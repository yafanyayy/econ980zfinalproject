On today's call, I'll provide a summary of 2020 and an overview of our growth priorities for 2021. Neel will then review our fourth quarter financial results, guide you through our new reporting structure and provide our outlook for 2021. After that, we will take your questions. 
We delivered solid execution in 2020. And as our employees quickly pivoted to a new operating environment and empowered our customers to meet their own rapidly changing environment. It was a challenging year for our customers and our employees. But 2020 also highlighted the power, flexibility and scalability of our fiber-based offerings and the agility of our employees. I'm exceptionally proud of the team's performance during difficult times.
I'd like to cover a few highlights from the year, and this is on Slide 4 in the presentation. For the last 3 years, you've heard me talk about the integration of Level 3 and the digital transformation of our company. Many of our efforts have culminated last fall with the introduction of the Lumen platform. I'll discuss the details in a moment. But for now, we'll say that we see the launch of the platform as a key milestone, and I'm excited about the growth it can enable.
The primary purpose of digital transformation is to improve the customer experience. But when done right, improving customer experience also enables cost savings. Our results reflect the dual benefit of our transformation efforts. In 2019, we announced $800 million to $1 billion in cost improvement associated with our transformation initiatives. Through a combination of digitalization, simplification and other transformation programs, we achieved $830 million in savings as of the fourth quarter of 2020, a year ahead of our original schedule.
The benefits of that work are seen in the fact that we grew both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. These efforts, to enable more efficient digital interactions, also drove improvement in our Net Promoter Scores, particularly in those areas where we have invested for growth in fiber-based services for enterprise and consumers.
You can also see the benefit of the better customer experience in our improving revenue trajectory, which is up 150 basis points compared to 2019. While I know we have more to do, I'm encouraged by that improvement. We are turning to growth in those parts of the business in which we are investing, and are managing our declining businesses with disciplined focused on preserving the free cash flow they generate.
Our foundation for future growth comes from our investments in the Lumen edge cloud infrastructure, expanding fiber for enterprises and deploying new in-building technology for greater security, service resilience and speed of delivery. And increasing the number of gigabit-enabled consumer customers. In 2020, we added 400,000 homes passed to our fiber to the home footprint. We now reach more than 2.4 million homes and are very excited about the digital customer experience we are providing through our Quantum Fiber brand.
We also continue to pay down debt and refinance maturities, reducing interest expense and strengthening our balance sheet. Lastly, we've expanded our commitment to ESG initiatives and recently issued our first sustainability-linked bond. Additionally, over the last year, we increased our focus on diversity and inclusion, adding a number of new programs, naming a Chief Diversity Officer to spearhead our efforts and expanding the leadership team's accountability and engagement in our diversity and inclusion goals. We remain committed to continually improving our approach to ESG, and I encourage you to review our annual ESG report.
Looking forward, we believe the launch of the Lumen platform sets a strong foundation for growth. Slide 5 gives you a sense of how we view the progression of the business. Over the last several years, we have been focused on integrating, transforming and operationalizing the capabilities we bring to market. With much of that work behind us, 2021 is about revenue growth and expanding adoption of our platform. More customers in more areas accessing more services in a seamless, automated and real-time basis is the vision for the Lumen platform. Of course, given the pandemic and macroeconomic implications, uncertainties remain in 2021. And we're keeping an eye on that, but we are excited about the coming year. We feel good about our sales funnel and customer engagement for both IGAM and enterprise, but we do see lengthening sales cycles as companies continue to evaluate their new infrastructure needs.
Turning to Slide 6. The onset of the fourth industrial revolution creates market demands for more capacity, more distributed computing resources, lower latency and higher resilience than ever before. Lumen and the Lumen platform are purpose-built to meet those needs. I'll start at the bottom of the slide with the physical infrastructure layer.
This physical infrastructure is obviously a foundational requirement for everything driving our economy today. I believe Lumen has the best local and long-haul fiber infrastructure in the world. Let me touch on a few points as to what that means for our customers.
First of all, we connect customers in more than 180,000 on-net buildings directly to our infrastructure with secure and reliable fiber. We have deep and robust interconnection and peering facilities to the world's eyeball networks and ISPs, acquiring and distributing traffic to and from millions of end points.
We have direct fiber connectivity to cloud service providers, Hyperscalers and more than 2,200 global data centers with tremendously scalable capacity. Over our global fiber network, we operate one of the world's largest Internet backbones and carry a significant portion of the Earth's Internet traffic each and every day.
The role we play in enabling the global Internet uniquely positions our Black Lotus Labs team to quickly gain visibility and insight into emerging cyber threats, which we then use to secure and protect our customers' networks and applications. As the team likes to say, ""We see more, so we can stop more."" In a nutshell, the Lumen platform has the scale, security, ubiquity and resilience necessary to meet the needs of the fourth industrial revolution.
Moving up one layer in the slide, Lumen dynamic connections is the result of recognizing that our customers needed software-based agility to consume and interact with our infrastructure. We meet this need by utilizing software-defined networking to allow customers to consume on the fly, everything from basic network connectivity to more advanced services like SD-WAN, HYPER WAN and HYPER DDoS. With this network as a service approach, our customers can add capacity and reconfigure destinations for that capacity as needed, enabling instantaneous consumption of additional network services.
This contrast with the old model of interacting with a salesperson, scheduling reserves delivery time line and rolling trials. Our platform approach not only improves the velocity with which customers can respond to their application need, but also the velocity we experienced in capturing and converting opportunity to revenue. Moving beyond the dynamic network, the next layer highlights the capabilities of the Lumen hybrid cloud. Access to multiple clouds over an agile, seamless and secure communications fabric is as critical to our customers as the physical layer network connectivity. They operate in dynamic environments that requires the ability to adapt to the daily minute-by-minute or even second-by-second shifting of their workloads from 1 compute resource to another.
The Lumen hybrid cloud, combined with our dynamic connections capability, allows customers to locate compute resources in their on-premises data centers, Lumen private and public cloud offerings or within one of the major cloud service providers, all with full control. The thousands of SaaS providers are a specific use case, the Lumen hybrid cloud capabilities allow them to leverage our peering networks and our own ISP to enhance their application performance by locating compute resources in our edge cloud facilities and bypassing much of the best efforts Internet.
You saw an example of this with our recent SAP announcement. SAP is working with Lumen to take advantage of these capabilities and other aspects of our platform to improve their customer experience, reduce their cost and enhance their service offerings.
I've discussed the Lumen edge initiatives on previous calls. As of today, we have fully enabled edge facilities covering roughly 60% of U.S. enterprise locations within 5 milliseconds of latency. Combining our unique fiber capabilities with our widespread edge infrastructure, by year-end, we expect to have more than 95% of U.S. enterprises within that same latency performance.
We believe the Lumen edge cloud offers a compelling solution for many of our customers' latency-sensitive applications, and are encouraged that it will contribute to our improving revenue trends as it is more fully deployed and adopted.
The final layer, the Lumen orchestrator, is the set of software tools that orchestrate all of these capabilities to give our customers greater control, a simpler operating model and a lower cost of ownership in an increasingly complex environment. We recently announced a partnership with VMware, which combines their orchestration capabilities and secure work-from-anywhere solutions with an increasingly dynamic, robust and automated Lumen platform. We're excited about this partnership and expect to work with VMware to bring new services to market through our joint innovation lab initiatives.
Both SAP and VMware are tremendous companies. We look forward to these relationships and believe they can be an important part of driving growth for Lumen. We expect to announce additional strategic relationships in the coming months.
I'll now take a moment to walk you through our 2021 priorities outlined on Slide 8. The first priority is to drive growth over the Lumen platform. Simply put, the Lumen platform combines the control flexibility, latency and performance of on-premises solutions with the efficiency, economics and simplicity of cloud-based solutions. We will continue to expand the digital marketplace we have developed and the products and services available to customers.
To that end, we anticipate new products like Lumen edge bare metal, Lumen edge private cloud, Lumen edge VM and an expansion of locations where customers can leverage the Lumen capabilities to enhance their applications with low latency. Together, these capabilities are unique to Lumen and would be difficult to replicate. Let me give you a couple of examples to tie this all together.
We're working with a major auto company on their autonomous vehicle program, helping them train their machine learning systems by building an accelerated data access network that decreases data transfer times between the metro areas they are testing with their headquarters. We're also working with a financial services company to update their computing architecture to meet exacting specifications for performance with financial counterparties around the world. We're managing the computing and storage infrastructure along with the network connectivity to their broad digital distribution footprint for market data. The benefit to the customer is the standardization of centralized computing for efficiency and flexibility, and simplifying their long-term digital distribution across the software defined network.
Our second priority is to improve the penetration of our robust product portfolio on our existing assets. Over the last few years, we have invested in adding new on-net buildings, deploying the latest in fiber technology in our long-haul network and expanding our fiber to the home footprint. We have begun to grow where those investments have been made, but we believe we can do better.
In short, as customers return a portion of their workforce to the office, we are well positioned to provide their work-from-anywhere solutions. As employees and students continue to work and learn remotely we are excited about our symmetrical broadband solutions for the home. Increasing our customer base and gaining wallet share with existing customers is a key priority for 2021.
Our third priority is our ongoing transformation to make it easier and easier for customers to consume our services and for our employees to support them. Expanding our digital marketplace and increasing the number of digital interactions are key goals. We believe this allows Lumen to continue to improve the velocity at which we move from opportunity to revenue and further enables our ability to improve customer experience and reduce operating costs.
Fourth is the continuation of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy to create shareholder value through investment in growth, returning value to shareholders through our dividend and reducing debt.
Neel will provide the details, but we believe the changes we are making in our reporting categories properly reflect the evolution of our products and services and our focus on growth. We hope these changes will provide better visibility into how we are performing where we are investing for growth as well as how we're doing in managing voice and other declining businesses for cash.
I'll wrap up by saying that I'm encouraged by the progress we've made and fully focused on the work that lies ahead. We leave 2020 with improving revenue trends, better EBITDA margins and a strengthened balance sheet. I believe we have demonstrated that we can take out costs to meet the pressure of legacy revenue loss.
Going forward, we will continue to implement customer-centric operational improvements but our future isn't about EBITDA stability through cost management. Rather, it is about EBITDA growth driven by revenue growth. I believe the Lumen platform is the right solution for our customers and will help us drive revenue, customer experience and ongoing operating efficiencies.
We are excited about the opportunities ahead. But an earnings call doesn't allow us enough time to discuss the numerous programs we have underway. We intend to host a virtual Analyst Day in late spring. During that event, we will share in greater depth, our go-to-market strategies, exciting alliances and new solutions we bring to the market. Stay tuned for the detailed information about this event. And I look forward to providing you additional insight on our road map future growth.
With that, I'll turn it over to Neel."

We have a lot to cover so I'll start with a few highlights.Turning to Slide 10. Despite the macro environment, we delivered solid results. For the full year, we improved the total revenue trajectory by 150",2135,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to cover so I'll start with a few highlights.
Turning to Slide 10. Despite the macro environment, we delivered solid results. For the full year, we improved the total revenue trajectory by 150 basis points, generated $8.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA, expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins and generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow.
We continued to invest in the business with capital expenditures of $3.7 billion. Over the course of 2020, we reduced net debt by approximately $1.6 billion and refinanced approximately $13 billion in long-term debt, further reducing interest expense, extending maturities, and strengthening our balance sheet.
Finally, as of the end of 2020, we achieved approximately $830 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA, cost transformation savings. Reaching our targeted savings range more than a year ahead of our expected time line.
Moving to revenue. For the full year 2020, total revenue declined 3.5% to $20.712 billion. As I mentioned in our highlights, this is a 150 basis point improvement from the 5% year-over-year decline in total revenue from 2018 to 2019.
Turning to Slide 11. Total revenue in the fourth quarter declined 3.4% to $5.125 billion. Moving now to our business segment. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts, or IGAM revenue decreased 1.6% or 0.7% on a constant currency basis. Moving to our enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue decreased 0.3%.
We continue to feel good about our growth prospects in IGAM and enterprise. But during the quarter, we did see some lengthening of sales cycles. SMB revenue decreased 7.1% year-over-year. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2020, we sold a significant portion of our legacy correctional facility communications business. The sale of this business impacted revenue by about $50 million in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. Excluding this business from prior results, year-over-year revenue would have declined 4.9%.
Wholesale revenue decreased 6.2% year-over-year. In summary, for the full year 2020, IGAM and enterprise, which, on a combined basis, represents 59% of business revenue, grew slightly on a constant currency basis. In a year of macro uncertainty facing most enterprise customers, this highlights the relevance of the products and services we offer. 
Our turnaround plans for SMB were impacted by the pandemic, but relatively low churn and improving macro conditions gives us confidence that SMB represents a growth opportunity for us over the long term. Wholesale will continue to decline. Overall, we remain focused on improving the revenue trajectory across all channels.
Turning to consumer on Slide 12. For the fourth quarter 2020, revenue declined 4.1% year-over-year. Broadband revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 grew 1.8% year-over-year. The revenue performance has been driven by our micro-targeting efforts, our ongoing focus to improve customer experience and driving up penetration of our competitive assets.
For the fourth quarter, in speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 54,000 subs. From a mix perspective, 14% of our total broadband subs now have greater than 100-meg speeds compared to 5% at the beginning of last year. Ending the year, we now have approximately 2.4 million homes passed with fiber compared to about 2 million at year-end 2019. 
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 13. For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $8.888 billion, which compares to $9.070 billion for 2019. For the fourth quarter of 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $2.281 billion compared to $2.278 billion from the year ago quarter.
Given the difficult macro conditions, we are pleased with the year-over-year EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, along with the sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA in both third and fourth quarter of 2020. We expanded our full year adjusted EBITDA margin to 42.9% compared to 42.3% for the full year 2019. For 2020, capital expenditures were $3.729 billion, and for the fourth quarter 2020, capital expenditures were $758 million. We continue to lean in and invest in the products and services that support the Lumen platform. We also continue to invest in expanding our fiber footprint and our digital customer and employee experience.
For the full year 2020, we generated free cash flow of $3.131 billion and $1.004 billion for the fourth quarter 2020. For the full year, we reduced net debt by approximately $1.6 billion and refinanced more than $13 billion. For the fourth quarter 2020 we reduced net debt by more than $650 million and refinanced $1 billion of debt at lower rates.
We exited 2020 having materially improved our maturity profile, further strengthening our balance sheet, lowering our cost of debt, enhancing our ability to invest in the business. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is now at 3.6x.
As of the end of the fourth quarter, we have achieved approximately $830 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings, putting us in our targeted range a year earlier than planned. We will continue to lean into transformation efforts in the future. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate cost transformation initiatives, with most of our initiatives now focused on improving revenue performance while delivering significant cost savings. As such, we will not report transformation savings in 2021. However, we do have line of sight and expect significant cost savings for the next several years.
Transitioning to 2021 reporting on Slide 15. The changes we're making better reflect our go-to-market strategy and where we are investing for growth. Our 2 segments going forward are business and mass markets. I'll focus on business segment first. We will continue to serve our business customers through 4 customer-facing sales channels: IGAM, large enterprise, mid-market and wholesale. IGAM is now our largest business sales channel. For the global accounts or GAM portion of this channel, we evaluated customer buying behavior and expanded the customer list with customers that we deem as high potential. As a result, some customers that have been in the enterprise channel have now moved into IGAM.
Our enterprise channel narrows its focus and becomes large enterprise, and we now have a sales channel focused specifically on midsized customers, which we are calling the mid-market channel. Based on buying patterns and support requirements, some smaller customers previously included in the enterprise channel have moved to our mid-market channel.
Within our wholesale channel, changes were limited to realignment of a few customer accounts. Slide 16 describes the segment changes in more detail. Over the long term, we are optimistic about the growth potential for IGAM, large enterprise and mid-markets.
Moving now to Slide 17 in our product categories by business segment. Compute and application services includes many of the solutions that Jeff referenced in his remarks. In addition, products like edge cloud services, CDM, data center and security are an integral part of our success with the Lumen edge. This category will also include revenue from our increased focus on ecosystem partnerships, leveraging the Lumen platform.
IP and data services include products that are core to providing enterprises with hybrid networking capabilities and include products like high-speed IP, VPN, SD-WAN and our dynamic connections capabilities.
Fiber infrastructure service is largely our dark fiber and optical services business. Our voice and other category represents the bulk of our legacy and primarily TDM services.
We continue to invest and expect growth from computer and application, IP and data and fiber infrastructure services. Together, these 3 categories represent over 70% of business revenue. As you think about the intersection of channels and products for our business segment, excluding wholesale, these 3 product categories in aggregate grew slightly year-over-year on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter. Mid-market, which currently is a headwind and represents a turnaround and eventually a growth opportunity.
Turning to Slide 18. The mass markets segment is a combination of the consumer customers, plus the addition of small business customers we had in the former SMB channel. We are now calling these customers the small business group, or SBG. As we looked at the buying patterns, support model and product needs for both our SBG and residential customers, we believe that combining the go-to-market approach provides efficiencies and potentially improvements in revenue trajectory.
Within the mass markets segment, we will report revenue in 4 categories: consumer broadband, SBG broadband, voice and other and CAF II revenue. Additionally, we are updating our product reporting and enhancing our disclosure around our Quantum Fiber business and brand.
In addition to fiber-enabled locations, we are now reporting fiber subs and ARPU. Quantum Fiber represents a growth opportunity for us along several fronts. Fiber-enabled homes are less than 15% of our footprint, and we continue to invest with our micro-targeting strategy. Given that a significant number of enabled units were added in the past couple of years, driving up penetration represents a near-term addressable market opportunity. Moreover, we have deemphasized low-speed offerings over fiber and our typical new sales ARPU now is generally higher than our base, representing another potential opportunity to improve the business.
Finally, we are breaking out SBG broadband, which until now hasn't been a large focus for us. And we expect to improve the trajectory like we have for consumer broadband.
I'd like to take a moment to summarize the transition from CAF II to the rural digital opportunity fund or RDOF. As most of you are aware, our subsidy revenue will step down from about $500 million a year to roughly $26 million in 2022. These changes do not impact 2021 results.
We took a very disciplined and ROI-based approach to RDOF. In fact, even after factoring in the subsidy, we see better returns from the fiber to the home investments we are making with our micro-targeting strategy. As we wrap up CAF II, we intend to further accelerate that strategy by shifting resources and organizational capabilities now focused on CAF II. 
Moving to Slide 19. As I mentioned earlier, we are no longer reporting transformation costs. However, we will continue to transform the business going forward and expect similar levels of expense, which are incorporated into our 2021 guidance. We will continue to report special items which include expenses such as severance, material legal settlements or other unforeseen material expenses that are onetime or unusual in nature. With this adjustment, full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA would have been $8.664 billion and free cash flow would have been $2.979 billion.
So turning to Slide 20, and an overview of our financial outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion for 2021 compared to $8.664 billion in 2020. As I just mentioned, our EBITDA now includes cost to continue to transform the business. Our guidance also incorporates significant success-based investments, focused on continuing to improve our revenue trajectory.
These incremental investments are primarily in the areas of product development, marketing, brand and go-to-market sales initiatives. For the full year 2021 we expect capital expenditures in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion. We expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion for the full year 2021 compared to $2.979 billion in 2020.
As you bridge from 2020 to 2021, keep in mind, we had about $175 million working capital benefit from the CARES Act that reverses in 2021 and 2022. For 2021, a we do not have any required contributions to the pension fund, and our free cash flow guidance does not include any discretionary contributions. Given strong market performance, our funding status at the end of the year was 86%. We will continue to monitor and may make contributions in 2021. Also, as a reminder, our first quarter has typically high working capital use, driven by timing of bonus payments and other prepaid expenses.
We expect net cash interest expense in the range of $1.525 billion to $1.575 billion for 2021. The midpoint of guidance represents almost $600 million in lower net cash interest compared to 2018. We are pleased with this outcome, enabled by our aggressive delevering plan that we embarked on in 2019.
We have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, improved our credit profile and our coverage ratios and remain committed to getting to our 2.75 to 3.25 net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target. Consistent with our execution in 2020, and we will continue with a balanced approach to paying down debt and investing in the business, focused on improving our revenue trajectory.
In summary, despite the uncertainty and challenges faced by our customers and our company, we delivered solid full year results. With our continued success-based investments in the business, our focus on profitable growth, focus on new and growing addressable markets and ongoing digital transformation initiatives, we are well positioned for 2021.
With that, we'll open it up for your questions. France, would you please explain the process?"

Can you help us maybe quantify how much you're planning to spend on the transformation side of it. And with the outlook for potentially improving revenue trends and continued cost-cutting efforts, why would we still see a decline in EBITDA?
And maybe finally, you did mention that your -- one of your focus will remain to lower leverage. I believe with this guidance, you will still be above your leverage target at year-end. Can you help us think about your capital allocation policy going forward?"

So on EBITDA, I think there's a page in our earnings presentation that lays out the pro forma view. So from the starting point of $8.664 billion, our guidance is $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. Like you all",333,"Batya, so I'll start with your question on EBITDA. So on EBITDA, I think there's a page in our earnings presentation that lays out the pro forma view. So from the starting point of $8.664 billion, our guidance is $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. Like you alluded to, I think, the guidance includes the cost to continue to transform the business. So we're not going to be slowing down. So we expect similar amount of cost in  2021 like we did in 2020. So you'll see there, excluding severance. In 2020, we had about $224 million in costs. So we expect about a similar amount of cost in 2021.
The other thing impacting EBITDA in 2021 really are the investments we're making in growth and really changing the revenue trajectory of the business. So if you think about all the things that Jeff mentioned, those investments are just not capital. They are both capital and operating expense. So some of the product initiatives we're working on product development cost. There is ecosystem initiatives with partners additional marketing, brand expenses, sales training, sales overlay, IT initiatives from -- to cash. So all of those things are incorporated into our EBITDA guidance.
So we're really focused on long-term EBITDA growth. And a big part of our focus in 2021 is really improving the revenue trajectory over the long-term with all the investments that we're making.
So your second question was around leverage, leverage target. So we're already at 3.6x. And so if you look at our guidance, we are still committed to paying down debt. And our target ratio is -- our target leverage ratio is still 2.75 to 3.25. We'll likely exit the year somewhere around 3.5 or slightly better. And within a [ 1/4 turn ] of our target range. So we're committed to it. Like you've seen us do in 2020, we will balance between paying down debt and investing in growth. And so that will be the balanced approach going forward."

And then I guess following up on Batya's question a little bit. Jeff, Slide 5 you've got this kind of aspirational trajectory towards growth. But then on Slide 11, we're looking at declines in almost every business unit. So what are the biggest moving parts, both headwinds and tailwinds, that are going to get us from turning to Slide 11 from a lot of negatives to looking more like Slide 5, which is this trajectory towards growth in the fourth industrial revolution?"

Over the last 3 years, we've averaged over $300 million of spending against CAF II. And this year, we're working on a series of initiatives to actually bring it down. So we don't know exactly where that's going to end up, but it will likely be less. In terms of headwinds and tailwinds, the way I would think about it is if you look at our new reporting for the business segment, the top 3 product categories, compute and applications, IP and data and fiber infrastructure, those are the ones that we're really investing for growth. And voice and other will really manage for cash.
Now when you look at the channel lens, there is some challenge with SMB, and we're working on that turnaround and eventually grow that at some point. So if you look at it from a product line, 70-plus percent of the business, we're focused on driving growth for the business segment. And if you look at even from a channel lens perspective, excluding wholesale, the business is about 75%. So that just kind of gives you a sense of the part of the business that we're focused on driving growth.
And in terms of mass markets, it really is about broadband, and our focus on investing in fiber and driving up penetration. And that's what we'll be focused on."

But at the same time, we've been building and investing in the Lumen platform and the capabilities that we want to deliver to the market. Neel talked about the 3 big product categories that are growing. But if you look inside some of those, the things like edge computing. We announced last year that we were going to invest heavily in edge. Today, we have about 60% of U.S. enterprises within 5 milliseconds. So as you look at the services that we've been developing, Lumen edge cloud, the Lumen edge VM, Lumen edge bare metal, all of those capabilities we see as growth capabilities. And we've been investing heavily in them this as well as things like HYBRID WAN and dynamic connections and UCaaS, unified Communications as a service. We continue to invest in the products and services and the capabilities that we need to deliver those.
We continue to invest in the infrastructure, making sure that we're expanding fiber to businesses, building out our edge cloud facilities and capabilities. And we've also been investing in our partnerships and making sure that we are partnering with world-class companies that we can take and put on the Lumen platform companies like Zoom, companies like SAP, companies like VMware, that we can partner with them and provide unique innovative solutions all over the Lumen platform. And so we'll continue to do that and continue to invest in the OpEx as well to drive those products and services. So Neel talked about that in his response to Batya's question about EBITDA.
So I'd say that what we've been doing for the last couple of years have been investing in those things, but really building the platform at this point. And now it's more about rolling that platform to our customers and expanding the products and services they buy from us."

So if you think about CAF II, like I mentioned, we were -- for the last 3 years, we averaged more than $300 million of capital. The other thing to keep in mind is that we -- through end of last year, we have enabled about 1.1 million units. And these are really in underserved areas. So we are selling into that. And that revenue and penetration is picking up every quarter. So there is also cash coming in from the footprint that we have enabled. So when you look at the puts and takes going into next year of the subsidy, the capital going away and cash coming from customers in that footprint, when you add it all up, it is not a material impact to our free cash flow. So it really doesn't change anything from a capital allocation perspective.
And in terms of RDOF, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we took a very, very disciplined approach. And so even when you net out the subsidy, our returns that we see on fiber to the home is significantly higher. Just to give you another data point, one of the largest winners of RDOF just announced that it's a $5 billion price tag to build out to about 1 million homes. If you compare that to the 400,000 homes that we just enabled last year, we certainly [ didn't ] spend a couple of billion. And so we have a different profile in terms of where we're investing fiber to the home. And we'll be success-based on that front. We're not setting any specific targets.
In our new disclosure, we're providing the enabled homes, and we're giving you penetration. So you can see that we have a fair amount of addressable opportunity to sell into. So we'll ramp up on a success basis, if it makes sense."

So over the last couple of years, you've seen the expense impact of the platform that we've been building as you think back and I referenced this in the prepared remarks, in 2019, we said we were going to save, $800 million to $1 billion in transfor",512,"Sure. So over the last couple of years, you've seen the expense impact of the platform that we've been building as you think back and I referenced this in the prepared remarks, in 2019, we said we were going to save, $800 million to $1 billion in transformation expenses. In the quarter, fourth quarter, we reached $830 million. And so you can see the benefit in our cost structure of the platform. 
But let me tell you a little bit more about what the platform is and why it's different than everybody else. First of all, it's built -- and I'm kind of referencing Slide 6 in the presentation. It's built on what I consider to be the world's best cyber infrastructure. The ubiquity of our fiber, the density of our fiber, the reach, the span, the quality and the ability to upgrade capacity, which we saw in 2020 with COVID is second to none. And we'll continue to invest in building that infrastructure.
But not only that, we've been able to locate our edge compute nodes with that fiber and with the tiering connectivity within 5 milliseconds of the majority of the U.S. enterprises. By the end of the year, we'll be at 95%, 98% of U.S. enterprises. And so there's that coupling that nobody else has. Nobody else has that ability. But then we also have the -- again, the peering networks, but the connectivity into cloud service providers, the 2,200 data centers on net and our dynamic connections capability is really a network as a service, where we integrate into our customers' applications. And they get to control that entire footprint, that entire connectivity all the way from their in location to wherever they want to do the computing on it, to wherever they want to distribute it via a software defined network. They don't have to call us, we don't have to engineer a solution. They can just have their software and the message to our software and the network configures the way that they want. When you combine that, with our Lumen hybrid cloud and the -- some of the orchestration services that we bring to customers, take connectivity to any major cloud service provider, the connectivity to any hyperscaler we've got more connectivity, more connectedness than virtually anybody. And so our customers get to take advantage of that.
And so ultimately, the advantage to the customer on the Lumen platform is that they get to acquire, analyze and act on their data better than any other platform and more uniquely because we're more connected, more capable, and we give them better orchestration services across it.
Now we've also got great partners. Partnering with VMware, partnering with SAP. We think those are great partners for us to continue to roll out these services. Partnering with Zoom on our collaboration services. So we've got great partners that we bring their capabilities. And we've created this digital marketplace that the platform becomes for our customers to access the different types of technology that they need for their specific application."

It's the combination of all of these things. And it's the intersection with our customers' needs. With the fourth industrial revolution, the need to process massive amounts of data with very low latency is really critical. And so we view our fiber infrastructure -- this is another application of how we can utilize the fiber infrastructure to deliver that capability to the customers.
The ubiquity of it and the density of it, allows us to give that 5-millisecond performance, gives very low latency, to our applications. The global nature of it allows us to carry that traffic to anywhere in the world. The connectivity of it allows us to carry it to any place in the world. So if you want to go to a particular cloud service provider, we can deliver it to that one. If you want to go to a different cloud service provider, we can deliver to the other one. And so the fiber network is the core foundational piece for the Lumen platform that sits on top of it and then all those other capabilities come in.
Now we continue to do things, Frank, that are intended to increase the value and the usefulness of the fiber network. If you look at our building ads, if you look at our fiber to the home expansions, those are about expanding the footprint. Last year, we talked about the use of the latest and newest technology and fiber capacity -- or excuse me, fiber technology that we were deploying, building the world's largest deployment of that type of technology. What we leverage there was our existing conduit infrastructure because we can build fiber at a very fast pace, and at a low-cost because of our conduit infrastructure. But we use that fiber for super high-scale capabilities, capabilities in delivering the world's Internet traffic but also connecting the hyperscalers and cloud service providers and great big software as a service companies, those types of things."

I don't really have any particular expectations. I expect something out of Lumen. I expect us to follow a disciplined, financially driven, logical approach to what we serve and what we don't serve. And as Neel pointed out, we think we have lots of opportunities to put our money to work inside of our existing footprint and outside to some extent. But inside our existing footprint at better returns than some of the RDOF dollars even with the subsidies. And so we'll follow a  very disciplined approach to whatever comes out of Washington.
And we'll work within the footprints that we have to deliver the best service for our customers with the best digital interactions so that they can overcome the digital divide and have the best capabilities. And that's one of the things that we think we stand out on as more people work from home and educate from home, we think the symmetrical nature of our fiber footprint is a huge advantage for a consumer customer or a small business customer.
And then the second question, sorry. On the sales -- the lengthening of the sales cycles, is there anything different here? Probably not. But what we found is people aren't resolving what is this post-pandemic world look like yet. Because we're not in a post-pandemic world. We're still in the middle of it. And so I think that it's not terribly that much different but we thought it would be getting better by this point. And so we see this lengthening of sales cycles as people are really trying to resolve what does it look like post COVID, and how do we think that the world is going to run.
Now I'll tell you my opinion, which is we won't go back to the way the world was. And the work from anywhere with reasonable capacities in security, and expanding the enterprise edge, not the cloud edge, not the Lumen edge, but expanding the edge of the enterprise to thousands and thousands of different locations is something that's going to create management challenges for customers and security challenges. Challenges for customers are actually good for Lumen because we can bring solutions to their capacity needs, their security needs, their orchestration needs and their control needs for how to manage these complex networks.
And so while we still -- we see this lengthening in cycles, long term, we think that the -- and I hate to say that the outcome of the pandemic is but I don't mean that. The outcome of the way we will work after the pandemic is fairly good for Lumen."

Is it where you already operate? Is it overbuild? The answer is yes. It's all of the above. And I'll give you some examples.
We build new homes all the time as a part of our -- as homes grow in a market, we focus on making sure that we're building into those subdivisions with fiber. It's a big part of our fiber expansion plan, making sure that when it's cheap to build and before homes get there, that we build the right infrastructure and to grow them. Is it in our footprint? Most of the fiber expansion is in our footprint, but not all of. It, if you look at MDUs outside of our footprint, we think we have great fiber penetration in markets that  we don't have consumer customers today. And so we go to those MDUs, though, and say we want to serve you in this market.
And then we've actually partnered with some communities like Springfield, Missouri, where we went and overbuilt the 2 providers that were there in conjunction with the city to expand our capabilities. So it's a little bit of all of the above.
All of the above has 1 characteristic, and that is -- maybe 2 characteristics. That we think we can drive revenue growth at a low-cost of capital and a low OpEx to do it. And so we view every opportunity through that lens. How do we make sure that we use our capital efficiency -- efficiently. And how do we make sure that we get the penetration that we want. And Neel touched on that as an opportunity for us. We still have an opportunity to improve our penetration in our fiber markets. But it is a little bit of all of the above: new construction, overbuilds in existing areas and then some expansion outside our traditional footprint."

Neel will then review our fourth quarter financial results, guide you through our new reporting structure and provide our outlook for 2021. After that, we will take your questions.
We delivered solid execution in 2020 as our employees quickly pivoted to a new operating environment and empowered our customers to meet their own rapidly changing environments. It was a challenging year for our customers and our employees, but 2020 also highlighted the power, flexibility and scalability of our fiber-based offerings and the agility of our employees. I'm exceptionally proud of the team's performance during difficult times.
I'd like to cover a few highlights from the year, and this is on Slide 4 in the presentation. For the last 3 years, you've heard me talk about the integration of Level 3 and the digital transformation of our company. Many of our efforts have culminated last fall with the introduction of the Lumen platform. I'll discuss the details in a moment. But for now, let's say that we see the launch of the platform as a key milestone, and I'm excited about the growth it can enable.
The primary purpose of digital transformation is to improve the customer experience. But when done right, improving customer experience also enables cost savings. Our results reflect the dual benefit of our transformation efforts. In 2019, we announced $800 million to $1 billion in cost improvement associated with our transformation initiatives. Through a combination of digitalization, simplification and other transformation programs, we achieved $830 million in savings as of the fourth quarter of 2020, a year ahead of our original schedule.
The benefits of that work are seen in the fact that we grew both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. These efforts, to enable more efficient digital interactions, also drove improvement in our Net Promoter Scores particularly in those areas where we've invested for growth in fiber-based services for enterprise and consumers. You can also see the benefit of the better customer experience in our improving revenue trajectory, which is up 150 basis points compared to 2019. While I know we have more to do, I'm encouraged by that improvement. We are turning to growth in those parts of the business in which we are investing and are managing our declining businesses with disciplined focused on preserving the free cash flow they generate.
Our foundation for future growth comes from our investments in the Lumen edge cloud infrastructure, expanding fiber for enterprises and deploying new in-building technology for greater security, service resilience and speed of delivery and increasing the number of gigabit-enabled consumer customers. In 2020, we added 400,000 homes passed to our fiber to the home footprint. We now reach more than 2.4 million homes and are very excited about the digital customer experience we are providing through our Quantum Fiber brand.
We also continue to pay down debt and refinance maturities, reducing interest expense and strengthening our balance sheet. Lastly, we've expanded our commitment to ESG initiatives and recently issued our first sustainability-linked bond. Additionally, over the last year, we increased our focus on diversity and inclusion, adding a number of new programs, naming a Chief Diversity Officer to spearhead our efforts and expanding the leadership team's accountability and engagement in our diversity and inclusion goals. We remain committed to continually improving our approach to ESG, and I encourage you to review our annual ESG report.
Looking forward, we believe the launch of the Lumen platform sets a strong foundation for growth. Slide 5 gives you a sense of how we view the progression of the business. Over the last several years, we've been focused on integrating, transforming and operationalizing the capabilities we bring to market. With much of that work behind us, 2021 is about revenue growth and expanding adoption of our platform.
More customers in more areas accessing more services in a seamless, automated and real-time basis is the vision for the Lumen platform. Of course, given the pandemic and macroeconomic implications, uncertainties remain in 2021. And we're keeping an eye on that, but we are excited about the coming year. We feel good about our sales funnel and customer engagement for both IGAM and enterprise, but we do see lengthening sales cycles as companies continue to evaluate their new infrastructure needs.
Turning to Slide 6. The onset of the fourth industrial revolution creates market demands for more capacity, more distributed computing resources, lower latency and higher resilience than ever before. Lumen and the Lumen platform are purpose-built to meet those needs. I'll start at the bottom of the slide with the physical infrastructure layer.
The physical infrastructure is obviously the foundational requirement for everything driving our economy today. I believe Lumen has the best local and long-haul fiber infrastructure in the world. Let me touch on a few points as to what that means for our customers.
First of all, we connect customers in more than 180,000 on-net buildings directly to our infrastructure with secure and reliable fiber. We have deep and robust interconnection and peering facilities to the world's eyeball networks and ISPs, acquiring and distributing traffic to and from millions of end points. We have direct fiber connectivity to cloud service providers, hyperscalers and more than 2,200 global data centers with tremendously scalable capacity.
Over our global fiber network, we operate one of the world's largest Internet backbones and carry a significant portion of the Earth's Internet traffic each and every day. The role we play in enabling the global Internet uniquely positions our Black Lotus Labs team to quickly gain visibility and insight into emerging cyber threats, which we then use to secure and protect our customers' networks and applications. As the team likes to say, ""We see more, so we can stop more."" In a nutshell, the Lumen platform has the scale, security, ubiquity and resilience necessary to meet the needs of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Moving up one layer in the slide, Lumen Dynamic Connections is the result of recognizing that our customers needed software-based agility to consume and interact with our infrastructure. We meet this need by utilizing software-defined networking to allow customers to consume on the fly everything from basic network connectivity to more advanced services like SD-WAN, Hyper WAN and Hyper DDoS. With this network as a service approach, our customers can add capacity and reconfigure destinations for that capacity as needed, enabling instantaneous consumption of additional network services. This contrast with the old model of interacting with a salesperson scheduling the service delivery time line and rolling trucks. Our platform approach not only improves the velocity with which customers can respond to their application need but also the velocity we experience in capturing and converting opportunity to revenue.
Moving beyond the dynamic network, the next layer highlights the capabilities of the Lumen hybrid cloud. Access to multiple clouds over an agile, seamless and secure communications fabric is as critical to our customers as the physical layer network connectivity. They operate in dynamic environments that requires the ability to adapt to the daily minute-by-minute or even second-by-second shifting of their workloads from one compute resource to another.
The Lumen hybrid cloud, combined with our Dynamic Connections capability, allows customers to locate compute resources in their on-premises data centers, Lumen private and public cloud offerings or within one of the major cloud service providers, all with full control. The thousands of SaaS providers are a specific use case. The Lumen hybrid cloud capabilities allow them to leverage our peering networks and our own ISP to enhance their application performance by locating compute resources in our edge cloud facilities and bypassing much of the [ best efforts ] Internet. You saw an example of this with our recent SAP announcement. SAP is working with Lumen to take advantage of these capabilities and other aspects of our platform to improve their customer experience, reduce their cost and enhance their service offerings.
I've discussed the Lumen edge initiatives on previous calls. As of today, we have fully enabled edge facilities covering roughly 60% of U.S. enterprise locations within 5 milliseconds of latency. Combining our unique fiber capabilities with our widespread edge infrastructure, by year-end, we expect to have more than 95% of U.S. enterprises within that same latency performance. We believe the Lumen edge cloud offers a compelling solution for many of our customers' latency-sensitive applications and are encouraged that it will contribute to our improving revenue trends as it is more fully deployed and adopted.
The final layer, the Lumen orchestrator, is a set of software tools that orchestrate all of these capabilities to give our customers greater control, a simpler operating model and a lower cost of ownership in an increasingly complex environment. We recently announced a partnership with VMware, which combines their orchestration capabilities and secure work-from-anywhere solutions with an increasingly dynamic, robust and automated Lumen platform. We're excited about this partnership and expect to work with VMware to bring new services to market through our joint innovation lab initiatives.
Both SAP and VMware are tremendous companies. We look forward to these relationships and believe they can be an important part of driving growth for Lumen. We expect to announce additional strategic relationships in the coming months.
I'll now take a moment to walk you through our 2021 priorities outlined on Slide 8. The first priority is to drive growth over the Lumen platform. Simply put, the Lumen platform combines the control flexibility, latency and performance of on-premises solutions with the efficiency, economics and simplicity of cloud-based solutions. We will continue to expand the digital marketplace we've developed and the products and services available to customers. To that end, we anticipate new products like Lumen edge bare metal, Lumen edge private cloud, Lumen edge VM and an expansion of locations where customers can leverage the Lumen capabilities to enhance their applications with low latency. Together, these capabilities are unique to Lumen and would be difficult to replicate.
Let me give you a couple of examples to tie this all together. We're working with a major auto company on their autonomous vehicle program, helping them train their machine learning systems by building an accelerated data access network that decreases data transfer times between the metro areas they are testing with their headquarters. We're also working with a financial services company to update their computing architecture to meet exacting specifications for performance with financial counterparties around the world. We're managing the computing and storage infrastructure along with the network connectivity to their broad digital distribution footprint for market data. The benefit to the customer is the standardization of centralized computing for efficiency and flexibility, and simplifying their long-term digital distribution across the software-defined network.
Our second priority is to improve the penetration of our robust product portfolio on our existing assets. Over the last few years, we have invested in adding new on-net buildings, deploying the latest in fiber technology in our long-haul network and expanding our fiber to the home footprint. We have begun to grow where those investments have been made, but we believe we can do better. In short, as customers return a portion of their workforce to the office, we are well positioned to provide their work-from-anywhere solutions. As employees and students continue to work and learn remotely, we are excited about our symmetrical broadband solutions for the home. Increasing our customer base and gaining wallet share with existing customers is a key priority for 2021.
Our third priority is our ongoing transformation to make it easier and easier for customers to consume our services and for our employees to support them. Expanding our digital marketplace and increasing the number of digital interactions are key goals. We believe this allows Lumen to continue to improve the velocity at which we move from opportunity to revenue and further enables our ability to improve customer experience and reduce operating costs.
Fourth is the continuation of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy to create shareholder value through investment in growth, returning value to shareholders through our dividend and reducing debt. Neel will provide the details, but we believe the changes we are making in our reporting categories properly reflect the evolution of our products and services and our focus on growth. We hope these changes will provide better visibility into how we are performing where we are investing for growth as well as how we're doing in managing voice and other declining businesses for cash.
I'll wrap up by saying that I'm encouraged by the progress we've made and fully focused on the work that lies ahead. We leave 2020 with improving revenue trends, better EBITDA margins and a strengthened balance sheet. I believe we have demonstrated that we can take out costs to meet the pressure of legacy revenue loss. Going forward, we will continue to implement customer-centric operational improvements, but our future isn't about EBITDA stability through cost management. Rather, it is about EBITDA growth driven by revenue growth. I believe the Lumen platform is the right solution for our customers and will help us drive revenue, customer experience and ongoing operating efficiencies.
We are excited about the opportunities ahead, but an earnings call doesn't allow us enough time to discuss the numerous programs we have underway. We intend to host a virtual Analyst Day in late spring. During that event, we will share in greater depth our go-to-market strategies, exciting alliances and new solutions we bring to the market. Stay tuned for the detailed information about this event, and I look forward to providing you additional insight on our road map to future growth.
With that, I'll turn it over to Neel."

For the full year, we improved the total revenue trajectory by 150",2131,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to cover, so I'll start with a few highlights.
Turning to Slide 10. Despite the macro environment, we delivered solid results. For the full year, we improved the total revenue trajectory by 150 basis points, generated $8.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA, expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins and generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow. We continued to invest in the business with capital expenditures of $3.7 billion. Over the course of 2020, we reduced net debt by approximately $1.6 billion and refinanced approximately $13 billion in long-term debt, further reducing interest expense, extending maturities and strengthening our balance sheet. Finally, as of the end of 2020, we achieved approximately $830 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA cost transformation savings, reaching our targeted savings range more than a year ahead of our expected time line.
Moving to revenue. For the full year 2020, total revenue declined 3.5% to $20.712 billion. As I mentioned in our highlights, this is a 150 basis point improvement from the 5% year-over-year decline in total revenue from 2018 to 2019.
Turning to Slide 11. Total revenue in the fourth quarter declined 3.4% to $5.125 billion. Moving now to our business segment. On a year-over-year basis, International and Global Accounts, or IGAM, revenue decreased 1.6% or 0.7% on a constant currency basis. Moving to our Enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue decreased 0.3%. We continue to feel good about our growth prospects in IGAM and Enterprise, but during the quarter, we did see some lengthening of sales cycles.
SMB revenue decreased 7.1% year-over-year. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2020, we sold a significant portion of our legacy correctional facility communications business. The sale of this business impacted revenue by about $15 million in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. Excluding this business from prior results, year-over-year revenue would have declined 4.9%. Wholesale revenue decreased 6.2% year-over-year.
In summary, for the full year 2020, IGAM and Enterprise, which on a combined basis represents 59% of business revenue, grew slightly on a constant currency basis. In a year of macro uncertainty facing most enterprise customers, this highlights the relevance of the products and services we offer. Our turnaround plans for SMB were impacted by the pandemic, but relatively low churn and improving macro conditions gives us confidence that SMB represents a growth opportunity for us over the long term. Wholesale will continue to decline. Overall, we remain focused on improving the revenue trajectory across all channels.
Turning to Consumer on Slide 12. For the fourth quarter 2020, revenue declined 4.1% year-over-year. Broadband revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 grew 1.8% year-over-year. The revenue performance has been driven by our micro-targeting efforts, our ongoing focus to improve customer experience and driving up penetration of our competitive assets. For the fourth quarter, in speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 54,000 subs. From a mix perspective, 14% of our total broadband subs now have greater than 100-meg speeds compared to 5% at the beginning of last year. Ending the year, we now have approximately 2.4 million homes passed with fiber compared to about 2 million at year-end 2019.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 13. For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $8.888 billion, which compares to $9.070 billion for 2019. For the fourth quarter 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $2.281 billion compared to $2.278 billion from the year ago quarter. Given the difficult macro conditions, we are pleased with the year-over-year EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, along with the sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA in both third and fourth quarter of 2020.
We expanded our full year adjusted EBITDA margin to 42.9% compared to 42.3% for the full year 2019. For 2020, capital expenditures were $3.729 billion. And for the fourth quarter 2020, capital expenditures were $758 million. We continue to lean in and invest in the products and services that support the Lumen platform. We also continue to invest in expanding our fiber footprint and our digital customer and employee experience.
For the full year 2020, we generated free cash flow of $3.131 billion and $1.004 billion for the fourth quarter 2020. For the full year, we reduced net debt by approximately $1.6 billion and refinanced more than $13 billion. For the fourth quarter 2020, we reduced net debt by more than $650 million and refinanced $1 billion of debt at lower rates. We exited 2020, having materially improved our maturity profile, further strengthening our balance sheet, lowering our cost of debt, enhancing our ability to invest in the business, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is now at 3.6x.
As of the end of the fourth quarter, we have achieved approximately $830 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings, putting us in our targeted range a year earlier than planned. We will continue to lean into transformation efforts in the future. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate cost transformation initiatives with most of our initiatives now focused on improving revenue performance while delivering significant cost savings. As such, we will not report transformation savings in 2021. However, we do have line of sight and expect significant cost savings for the next several years.
Transitioning to 2021 reporting on Slide 15. The changes we're making better reflect our go-to-market strategy and where we are investing for growth. Our 2 segments going forward are business and mass markets. I'll focus on business segment first. We will continue to serve our business customers through 4 customer-facing sales channels: IGAM, large enterprise, mid-market and wholesale. IGAM is now our largest business sales channel. For the global accounts, or GAM, portion of this channel, we evaluated customer buying behavior and expanded the customer list with customers that we deem as high potential. As a result, some customers that have been in the enterprise channel have now moved into IGAM.
Our enterprise channel narrows its focus and becomes large enterprise, and we now have a sales channel focused specifically on midsized customers, which we are calling the mid-market channel. Based on buying patterns and support requirements, some smaller customers previously included in the enterprise channel have moved to our mid-market channel. Within our wholesale channel, changes were limited to realignment of a few customer accounts.
Slide 16 describes the segment changes in more detail. Over the long term, we are optimistic about the growth potential for IGAM, large enterprise and mid-markets.
Moving now to Slide 17 in our product categories by business segment. Compute and application services includes many of the solutions that Jeff referenced in his remarks. In addition, products like edge cloud services, CDN, data center and security are an integral part of our success with the Lumen edge. This category will also include revenue from our increased focus on ecosystem partnerships, leveraging the Lumen platform.
IP and data services include products that are core to providing enterprises with hybrid networking capabilities and include products like high-speed IP, VPN, SD-WAN and our Dynamic Connections capabilities. Fiber infrastructure service is largely our dark fiber and optical services business. Our voice and other category represents the bulk of our legacy and primarily TDM services.
We continue to invest and expect growth from compute and application, IP and data and fiber infrastructure services. Together, these 3 categories represent over 70% of business revenue. As you think about the intersection of channels and products for our business segment, excluding wholesale, these 3 product categories in aggregate grew slightly year-over-year on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter. Mid-market, which currently is a headwind, represents a turnaround and eventually, a growth opportunity.
Turning to Slide 18. The mass markets segment is a combination of the consumer customers plus the addition of small business customers we had in the former SMB channel. We are now calling these customers the small business group, or SBG. As we looked at the buying patterns, support model and product needs for both our SBG and residential customers, we believe that combining the go-to-market approach provides efficiencies and potentially, improvements in revenue trajectory. Within the mass markets segment, we will report revenue in 4 categories: consumer broadband, SBG broadband, voice and other and CAF II revenue. Additionally, we are updating our product reporting and enhancing our disclosure around our Quantum Fiber business and brand.
In addition to fiber-enabled locations, we are now reporting fiber subs and ARPU. Quantum Fiber represents a growth opportunity for us along several fronts. Fiber-enabled homes are less than 15% of our footprint, and we continue to invest with our micro-targeting strategy. Given that a significant number of enabled units were added in the past couple of years, driving up penetration represents a near-term addressable market opportunity. Moreover, we have deemphasized low-speed offerings over fiber, and our typical new sales ARPU now is generally higher than our base, representing another potential opportunity to improve the business. Finally, we are breaking out SBG broadband, which until now hasn't been a large focus for us, and we expect to improve the trajectory like we have for consumer broadband.
I'd like to take a moment to summarize the transition from CAF II to the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, or RDOF. As most of you are aware, our subsidy revenue will step down from about $500 million a year to roughly $26 million in 2022. These changes do not impact 2021 results. We took a very disciplined and ROI-based approach to RDOF. In fact, even after factoring in the subsidy, we see better returns from the fiber to the home investments we are making with our micro-targeting strategy. As we wrap up CAF II, we intend to further accelerate that strategy by shifting resources and organizational capabilities now focused on CAF II.
Moving to Slide 19. As I mentioned earlier, we are no longer reporting transformation costs. However, we will continue to transform the business going forward and expect similar levels of expense, which are incorporated into our 2021 guidance. We will continue to report special items which include expenses such as severance, material legal settlements or other unforeseen material expenses that are onetime or unusual in nature. With this adjustment, full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA would have been $8.664 billion and free cash flow would have been $2.979 billion.
So turning to Slide 20 and an overview of our financial outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion for 2021 compared to $8.664 billion in 2020. As I just mentioned, our EBITDA now includes cost to continue to transform the business. Our guidance also incorporates significant success-based investments focused on continuing to improve our revenue trajectory. These incremental investments are primarily in the areas of product development, marketing, brand and go-to-market sales initiatives. For the full year 2021, we expect capital expenditures in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion. We expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion for the full year 2021 compared to $2.979 billion in 2020.
As you bridge from 2020 to 2021, keep in mind, we had about $175 million working capital benefit from the CARES Act that reverses in 2021 and 2022. For 2021, we do not have any required contributions to the pension fund, and our free cash flow guidance does not include any discretionary contributions. Given strong market performance, our funding status at the end of the year was 86%. We will continue to monitor and may make contributions in 2021. Also, as a reminder, our first quarter has typically high working capital use driven by timing of bonus payments and other prepaid expenses.
We expect net cash interest expense in the range of $1.525 billion to $1.575 billion for 2021. The midpoint of guidance represents almost $600 million in lower net cash interest compared to 2018. We are pleased with this outcome enabled by our aggressive delevering plan that we embarked on in 2019. We have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, improved our credit profile and our coverage ratios and remain committed to getting to our 2.75 to 3.25 net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target. Consistent with our execution in 2020, we will continue with a balanced approach to paying down debt and investing in the business focused on improving our revenue trajectory.
In summary, despite the uncertainty and challenges faced by our customers and our company, we delivered solid full year results. With our continued success-based investments in the business, our focus on profitable growth, focus on new and growing addressable markets and ongoing digital transformation initiatives, we are well positioned for 2021.
With that, we'll open it up for your questions. France, would you please explain the process?"

Can you help us maybe quantify how much you're planning to spend on the transformation side of it? And with the outlook for potentially improving revenue trends and continued cost-cutting efforts, why would we still see a decline in EBITDA?
And maybe finally, you did mention that your -- one of your focus will remain to lower leverage. I believe with this guidance, you will still be above your leverage target at year-end. Can you help us think about your capital allocation policy going forward?"
260149,700394437,2203704,"Lumen Technologies, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Batya, so I'll start with your question on EBITDA. So on EBITDA, I think there's a page in our earnings presentation that lays out the pro forma view. So from the starting point of $8.664 billion, our guidance is $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. Like you all",331,"Batya, so I'll start with your question on EBITDA. So on EBITDA, I think there's a page in our earnings presentation that lays out the pro forma view. So from the starting point of $8.664 billion, our guidance is $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. Like you alluded to, I think, the guidance includes the cost to continue to transform the business. So we're not going to be slowing down. So we expect similar amount of cost in 2021 like we did in 2020. So you'll see there, excluding severance, in 2020, we had about $224 million in costs. So we expect about a similar amount of cost in 2021.
The other thing impacting EBITDA in 2021 really are the investments we're making in growth and really changing the revenue trajectory of the business. So if you think about all the things that Jeff mentioned, those investments are just not capital. They are both capital and operating expense, so some of the product initiatives we're working on, product development cost. There is ecosystem initiatives with partners, additional marketing, brand expenses, sales training, sales overlay, IT initiatives from quote-to-cash. So all of those things are incorporated into our EBITDA guidance. So we're really focused on long-term EBITDA growth, and a big part of our focus in 2021 is really improving the revenue trajectory over the long term with all the investments that we're making.
So your second question was around leverage, leverage target. So we're already at 3.6x. And so if you look at our guidance, we are still committed to paying down debt. And our target ratio is -- our target leverage ratio is still 2.75 to 3.25. We'll likely exit the year somewhere around 3.5 or slightly better. And within a quarter, [ turnover ] our target range. So we're committed to it. Like you've seen us do in 2020, we will balance between paying down debt and investing in growth. And so that will be the balanced approach going forward."

And then I guess following up on Batya's question a little bit, Jeff, Slide 5, you've got this kind of aspirational trajectory towards growth. But then on Slide 11, we're looking at declines in almost every business unit. So what are the biggest moving parts, both headwinds and tailwinds, that are going to get us from turning Slide 11 from a lot of negatives to looking more like Slide 5, which is this trajectory towards growth in the Fourth Industrial Revolution?"

So we don't know exactly where that's going to end up, but it will likely be less. In terms of headwinds and tailwinds, the way I would think about it is if you look at our new reporting, for the business segment, the top 3 product categories, compute and applications, IP and data and fiber infrastructure, those are the ones that we're really investing for growth and voice and other will really manage for cash.
Now when you look at the channel lens, there is some challenge with SMB, and we're working on that turnaround and eventually grow that at some point. So if you look at it from a product lens, 70-plus percent of the business, we're focused on driving growth for the business segment. And if you look at even from a channel lens perspective, excluding wholesale, the business is about 75%. So that just kind of gives you a sense of the part of the business that we're focused on driving growth. And in terms of mass markets, it really is about broadband and our focus on investing in fiber and driving up penetration, and that's what we'll be focused on."

And where we're leaning in over the last couple of years, you've seen us invest heavily in improving our customer experience and our digital interactions with customers and the way that our employees support them. But at the same time, we've been building and investing in the Lumen platform and the capabilities that we want to deliver to the market. Neel talked about the 3 big product categories that are growing. But if you look inside some of those, things like edge computing, we announced last year that we were going to invest heavily in edge. Today, we have about 60% of U.S. enterprises within 5 milliseconds.
So as you look at the services that we've been developing, Lumen edge cloud, the Lumen edge VM, the Lumen edge bare metal, all of those capabilities we see as growth capabilities. And we've been investing heavily in them as well as things like hybrid WAN and Dynamic Connections and UCaaS, unified communications as a service. We continue to invest in the products and services and the capabilities that we need to deliver those. We continue to invest in the infrastructure, making sure that we're expanding fiber to businesses, building out our edge cloud facilities and capabilities.
And we've also been investing in our partnerships and making sure that we are partnering with world-class companies that we can take and put on the Lumen platform, companies like Zoom, companies like SAP, companies like VMware, that we can partner with them and provide unique innovative solutions all over the Lumen platform. And so we'll continue to do that and continue to invest in the OpEx as well to drive those products and services. So Neel talked about that in his response to Batya's question about EBITDA. So I'd say that what we've been doing for the last couple of years have been investing in those things, but really building the platform at this point. And now it's more about rolling that platform to our customers and expanding the products and services they buy from us."

So if you think about CAF II, like I mentioned, we were -- for the last 3 years, we averaged more than $300 million of capital. The other thing to keep in mind is that we -- through end of last year, we have enabled about 1.1 million units, and these are really in underserved areas. So we are selling into that, and that revenue and penetration is picking up every quarter. So there is also cash coming in from the footprint that we have enabled. So when you look at the puts and takes going into next year of the subsidy, the capital going away and cash coming from customers in that footprint, when you add it all up, it is not a material impact to our free cash flow. So it really doesn't change anything from a capital allocation perspective.
And in terms of RDOF, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we took a very, very disciplined approach. And so even when you net out the subsidy, our returns that we see on fiber to the home is significantly higher. Just to give you another data point, one of the largest winners of RDOF just announced that it's a $5 billion price tag to build out to about 1 million homes. If you compare that to the 400,000 homes that we just enabled last year, we certainly didn't spend a couple of billion. And so we have a different profile in terms of where we're investing fiber to the home, and we'll be success-based on that front. We're not setting any specific targets. In our new disclosure, we're providing the enabled homes and we're giving you penetration so you can see that we have a fair amount of addressable opportunity to sell into. So we'll ramp up on a success-based basis, if that makes sense."

So over the last couple of years, you've seen the expense impact of the platform that we've been building. As you think back, and I've referenced this in the prepared remarks, in 2019, we said we were going to save $800 million to $1 billion in tran",511,"Sure. So over the last couple of years, you've seen the expense impact of the platform that we've been building. As you think back, and I've referenced this in the prepared remarks, in 2019, we said we were going to save $800 million to $1 billion in transformation expenses. In the quarter -- fourth quarter, we reached $830 million, and so you can see the benefit in our cost structure of the platform. But let me tell you a little bit more about what the platform is and why it's different than everybody else.
First of all, it's built, and I'm kind of referencing Slide 6 in the presentation, it's built on what I consider to be the world's best cyber infrastructure. The ubiquity of our fiber, the density of our fiber, the reach, the span, the quality and the ability to upgrade capacity, which we saw in 2020 with COVID, is second to none. And we'll continue to invest in building that infrastructure. But not only that, we've been able to locate our edge compute nodes with that fiber and with the peering connectivity within 5 milliseconds of the majority of the U.S. enterprises. By the end of the year, we'll be at 95%, 98% of U.S. enterprises. And so there's that coupling that nobody else has. Nobody else has that ability.
But then we also have the, again, the peering networks, but the connectivity into cloud service providers, the 2,200 data centers on-net. And our Dynamic Connections capability is really a network as a service where we integrate into our customers' applications, and they get to control that entire footprint, that entire connectivity, all the way from their [ end ] location to wherever they want to do the computing on it, to wherever they want to distribute it via a software-defined network. They don't have to call us. We don't have to engineer a solution. They can just have their software, and the message to our software and the network configures the way that they want.
When you combine that with our Lumen hybrid cloud and the -- some of the orchestration services that we bring to customers, take connectivity to any major cloud service provider, the connectivity to any hyperscaler, we've got more connectivity, more connectedness than virtually anybody. And so our customers get to take advantage of that. And so ultimately, the advantage to the customer on the Lumen platform is that they get to acquire, analyze and act on their data better than any other platform and more uniquely because we're more connected, more capable and we give them better orchestration services across it.
Now we've also got great partners, partnering with VMware, partnering with SAP. We think those are great partners for us to continue to roll out these services, partnering with Zoom on our collaboration services. So we've got great partners that we bring their capabilities, and we've created this digital marketplace that the platform becomes for our customers to access the different types of technology that they need for their specific application."

It's the combination of all of these things, and it's the intersection with our customers' needs. With the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the need to process massive amounts of data with very low latency is really critical. And so we view our fiber infrastructure, this is another application of how we can utilize the fiber infrastructure to deliver that capability to the customers. The ubiquity of it and the density of it allows us to give that 5-millisecond performance, gives very low latency to our applications. The global nature of it allows us to carry that traffic to anywhere in the world. The connectivity of it allows us to carry it to any place in the world. So if you want to go to a particular cloud service provider, we can deliver it to that one. If you want to go to a different cloud service provider, we can deliver to the other one. And so the fiber network is the core foundational piece for the Lumen platform that sits on top of it and then all those other capabilities come in.
Now we continue to do things, Frank, that are intended to increase the value and the usefulness of the fiber network. If you look at our building ads, if you look at our fiber to the home expansions, those are about expanding the footprint. Last year, we talked about the use of the latest and newest technology and fiber capacity -- or excuse me, fiber technology that we were deploying, building the world's largest deployment of that type of technology. What we leverage there was our existing conduit infrastructure because we can build fiber at a very fast pace and at a low cost because of our conduit infrastructure. But we use that fiber for super high-scale capabilities, capabilities in delivering the world's Internet traffic but also connecting the hyperscalers and cloud service providers and great big software as a service companies, those types of things."

On the what do I expect out of Washington, are there any opportunities, I don't really have any particular expectations. I expect something out of Lumen. I expect us to follow a disciplined, financially driven, logical approach to what we serve and what we don't serve. And as Neel pointed out, we think we have lots of opportunities to put our money to work inside of our existing footprint and outside to some extent, but inside our existing footprint at better returns than some of the RDOF dollars even with the subsidies. And so we'll follow a very disciplined approach to whatever comes out of Washington. And we'll work within the footprints that we have to deliver the best service for our customers with the best digital interactions so that they can overcome the digital divide and have the best capabilities. And that's one of the things that we think we stand out on as more people work from home and educate from home, we think the symmetrical nature of our fiber footprint is a huge advantage for a consumer customer or a small business customer.
And then the second question, sorry, on the sales, the lengthening of the sales cycles. Is there anything different here? Probably not. But what we found is people aren't resolving what is this post-pandemic world look like yet because we're not in a post-pandemic world. We're still in the middle of it. And so I think that it's not terribly that much different, but we thought it would be getting better by this point. And so we see this lengthening of sales cycles as people are really trying to resolve what does it look like post COVID and how do we think that the world is going to run.
Now I'll tell you my opinion, which is we won't go back to the way the world was. And that work from anywhere with reasonable capacities in security and expanding the enterprise edge, not the cloud edge, not the Lumen edge, but expanding the edge of the enterprise to thousands and thousands of different locations is something that's going to create management challenges for customers and security challenges. Challenges for customers are actually good for Lumen because we can bring solutions to their capacity needs, their security needs, their orchestration needs and their control needs for how to manage these complex networks. And so while we feel -- we see this lengthening in cycles, long term, we think that the -- and I hate to say that the outcome of the pandemic is good. I don't mean that. The outcome of the way we will work after the pandemic is fairly good for Lumen."

We build new homes all the time as a part of our -- as homes grow in a market, we focus on making sure that we're building into those subdivisions with fiber. It's a big part of our fiber expansion plan, making sure that when it's cheap to build and before homes get there, that we build the right infrastructure and to grow them. Is it in our footprint? Most of the fiber expansion is in our footprint, but not all of it. If you look at MDUs outside of our footprint, we think we have great fiber penetration in markets that we don't have consumer customers today. And so we go to those MDUs, though, and say we want to serve you in this market. And then we've actually partnered with some communities like Springfield, Missouri, where we went and overbuilt the 2 providers that were there in conjunction with the city to expand our capabilities.
So it's a little bit of all of the above. All of the above has one characteristic and that is -- maybe 2 characteristics, that we think we can drive revenue growth at a low cost of capital and a low OpEx to do it. And so we view every opportunity through that lens: how do we make sure that we use our capital efficiency -- efficiently and how do we make sure that we get the penetration that we want. Neel touched on that as an opportunity for us. We still have an opportunity to improve our penetration in our fiber markets.

I'm going to take a few minutes at the outset to share my perspective on the quarter and some of the key value drivers I see, not only in our business, but also with respect to our capital allocation and inorganic strategies. After that, I'll ask Neel to walk you through the details of the quarter and key drivers for the remainder of 2021, then we'll open it up to your questions. 
Before diving into our results for the quarter, I want to discuss a few points coming out of our Investor Day in April. I hope those of you who were able to join us gained a better understanding of the markets, products and services, we believe, will drive our future growth as well as a sense of our conviction that we have the right assets, people, investment plans and execution strategies to grow both revenue and shareholder value over time. 
The path we reviewed during our Analyst Day is pretty straightforward. We are combining one of the world's best fiber infrastructures, our deep global interconnections to [indiscernible] networks and our increasingly robust Lumen platform to build the infrastructure necessary to support a full range of Fourth Industrial Revolution applications and use cases, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, augmented reality, IoT and unified communications. 
As of today, more than 85% of U.S. enterprises are within 5 milliseconds latency of our edge cloud facilities. We are well on our way to reach our end of the year goal of 95% of U.S. enterprise. Our fiber-enabled edge infrastructure, together with our embedded security capabilities and adaptive networking services, allows Lumen to deliver a differentiated solution set for expanding market opportunities. We're excited about the growing market for these services and our ability to meet those demand. 
For those who were unable to join our Investor Day, I invite you to go to our website to review the information we shared. 
I'm personally bullish on our approach. It leverages our greatest, most unique asset, one of the world's largest and most powerful fiber-based networks to drive growth in both core fiber-based network services as well as adjacent services such as security and edge computing that are greatly enhanced by our fiber network. The demand for these services is growing, and we're investing into and are well positioned to grow with that market. I believe it is a compelling thesis. 
At the same time, I understand our business needs to deliver top line revenue improvement today. While we delivered strong EBITDA and free cash flow in the first quarter, the revenue results don't yet meet our expectation. Neel will go into details, but I want you to hear directly from me that we are not satisfied and are focused on growth. 
As we've mentioned on previous calls, COVID-related lengthening in sales cycles across both public and business sectors continues to create near-term revenue uncertainty. For example, of sector sales at the end of 4Q '20 and the first couple of months of 1Q '21 were light. We are market share takers in the public sector and government slowdowns have created fewer opportunities to win new awards. This especially affects the onetime revenue we often see at the beginning of new contracts, which typically includes professional services equipment sales and installation charges. 
Similarly, the state, local and education customers have naturally focused all of their resources and COVID response. We believe the pause in these factors will prove to be simply one of timing. While we all began to learn about COVID in the first quarter of 2020, the nature of our business and sales cycles makes the effect of COVID more of a 2021 event for us. As we see the U.S. beginning to come out of the pandemic, we expect to see improvement in the second half of the year. 
I offer you these details to provide color on the quarter, not to rationalize results. We are very focused on revenue and expect to accelerate growth where we invest. But thus far, our growth is not at the pace required to overcome the declines in voice and legacy data services. We have the assets, the products, the people and processes in place to drive higher levels of revenue growth, and now it comes down to execution. 
Beyond revenue, we are continuing to do a lot of great work to improve the fundamentals of our business and to drive long-term growth. We have continued to expand the reach, the power and reliability of our world-class fiber infrastructure. Our fiber network is at the core of who we are and is the engine that will drive both our and our customers' success. It is among the best in the world, and we make it better every day. 
Our Lumen platform allows enterprise customers to seamlessly deploy the connectivity, the infrastructure and the applications they need to transform their businesses to the new realities of the fourth IR. We have enabled key products and partnerships that drive full-service solutions for our customers and integrate the network within their cloud applications. We have begun to deploy the automation and customer experience that will define our future. Across our business, these changes have driven both higher levels of customer satisfaction and enabled us to maintain strong EBITDA margins. 
These initiatives are ongoing, and I believe demonstrate we're doing the things required to drive long-term growth in revenue, EBITDA, free cash flow and shareholder value. I'm proud of this work and believe it will define our future success. As I said earlier though, we have a strong sense of urgency to accelerate top line growth. We are seeing positive results in our customer interactions and early success with our edge cloud efforts. As an example, our SAP alliance has led to the onboarding and major VAR customers on the Lumen platform. VARs like our customer, Pristine, rather than hear my views though, I thought I'd just share an exact quote from the customer. ""Through the entire process, we've been impressed with the Lumen offering. Their insight into our business demand and the quality of their team resulted in a packaged offering that targets the key challenges facing value-added resellers in our market space."" Obviously, I like to hear customer quotes like this. But I also want to point out that this is the exact intent of our entire Lumen platform. 
We understand the focus on near-term revenue but believe too singular a focus on that topic overshadows the many other positives in our business. I'm not going to belabor at this point. We shared with you our view of the sum of the parts of our business last year. That information is still on our website, and I would encourage you to give it another look. I think that the simple and straightforward analysis speaks for itself, and the market value for assets such as ours continues to support that basic view. 
The market cap less than 5x the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance and our current EBITDA multiple does not reflect our extensive fiber infrastructure or the growth potential we highlighted in our Analyst Day. Moreover, we have a strong balance sheet enabled by our deleveraging initiatives. Given our conviction around our growth initiatives and our equity evaluation, I'd like to share a few thoughts on capital allocation. 
Of course, our first capital allocation priority is to make the investments required to drive healthy growth and returns within our core business. These investments are not linear from 1 quarter to another, and we expect 2021 capital investments will accelerate from first quarter levels. I am confident we are investing in an appropriate level to support our growth, expand our fiber network and enable the systems and programs that will continue to drive higher levels of sales, customer satisfaction and operating efficiency. We are committed to investing in growth. 
Beyond investing in the business, we're also very focused on our dividend as a key element of our capital allocation strategy. We still get the occasional question or comment about the sustainability of, or our commitment to, our dividend. Frankly, this puzzles me. As I'm sure you can appreciate, it's difficult for any company to make completely unqualified statements about their capital allocation policy, including dividends, and we're no different. That said, I think we've been clear that we look at our current dividend level as both an appropriate capital allocation approach and an important proof point about our confidence in the future of our business. And with the current payout ratio in the 30s as a percentage of free cash flow, I think the question about sustainability answers itself. We believe the dividend is an important element in our delivery of value to shareholders, and that the current level of dividend is supported by sustainable payout ratios. 
[ Two ], we have been focused on strengthening our balance sheet and reducing our interest expense. And we've done a lot of good work in this space. Since announcing the deleveraging plan, we have reduced $4 billion in debt, refinanced more than $20 billion, improved our maturity profile and reduced cash interest expense by almost $600 million per year. This obviously enhances the financial position of the company and is very beneficial to our free cash flow profile. We did what we said we were going to do here, and there is no question in my mind that it was the right thing to do to sustain long-term value. 
In terms of interest cost savings, coverage ratios and credit profile, we've largely achieved the outcomes we targeted with our deleveraging plan. We are maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA target range and expect to get there over time with a combination of EBITDA growth and debt pay down. 
Our cash flow profile and balance sheet improvements give us the flexibility to reassess our capital allocation after investing in the business and supporting the dividend. Given our conviction around our sum of the parts analysis, fiber asset valuations and our business plans, we believe our shares trade at a significant discount to their true value. As we continue to progress toward our leverage targets, this naturally leads to discussions with the Board about share buybacks. We've made no decisions and are not making any specific announcements, but it is certainly part of our discussion. 
Finally, I'd like to talk about our approach to inorganic opportunities to grow or unlock value. You've heard me say before that we are constantly evaluating alternatives to enhance shareholder value and are open minded, including divestitures. I know you hear that phrase from virtually every CEO, and that it can just sound like CEO talk, and I understand that point of view. But I want to be clear that we are actively looking at selling noncore assets to unlock value in our business, further accelerate deleveraging and implement potential buyback programs. 
That said, we have been and will remain disciplined. We have confidence in our future and don't feel compelled to undertake any specific transaction. If we find transactions that are positive to shareholders, we won't hesitate to move forward. 
Let me summarize before I pass it over to Neel. We understand we must improve our revenue trajectory. We are focused and unflinching in our assessment of what we must do to drive that change. It does not happen overnight in a business such as ours, but we know we must improve. At the same time, I have a strong personal conviction that we are doing the things required to position Lumen for the future. We are expanding the reach and capacity of our already powerful fiber network. We are improving our product set, transforming our customer experience and reducing our cost of delivery. 
And again, I will highlight that we have a strong cash flow profile and an improved balance sheet that allows us to invest in the future of our business. While we reposition ourselves for long-term growth via the lumen platform for enterprises and Quantum Fiber for mass markets, we will also continue to maintain the discipline required for us to deliver value to our equity holders, not only through growth, but also through inorganic options, the return of capital through dividends, the ongoing reduction of leverage and should we decide as a better way to allocate capital, the possibility of share buybacks. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neel to review some of the details from the quarter. Neel?"

Let me begin with our financial summary on Slide 4. For the first quarter of 2021, we delivered solid adjusted EBITDA and an expanded adjusted EBITDA margin on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. We also",993,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin with our financial summary on Slide 4. For the first quarter of 2021, we delivered solid adjusted EBITDA and an expanded adjusted EBITDA margin on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. We also generated solid free cash flow. Based on our progress in the first quarter, we remain confident in our financial performance and are reiterating our outlook for the full year 2021. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 5. Total revenue in the first quarter declined 3.8% to $5.029 billion. Adjusting for the sale of a significant portion of our correctional facility business in the third quarter of 2020, our revenue would have declined 3.6%. Business revenue in the first quarter declined 3.8% to $3.595 billion or 3.5%, adjusting for the business sale that I just mentioned. 
Our overall business segment revenue performance was impacted by lengthening sales cycles in the current environment that we mentioned during the last few earnings calls in our recent Analyst Day. Within our business segment, IGAM revenue decreased 2.7% compared to roughly flat in the year ago quarter. In addition to lengthening sales cycles, our revenue performance this quarter was impacted by some CDN rerates in a large customer disconnect. Large enterprise declined 3% compared to a growth of 2.3% in the year ago quarter. As Jeff mentioned, revenue performance was impacted by lower sales and completion of several projects in public sector. Within compute and application services, we had a few COVID-related projects winding down. Sequential decline in fiber infrastructure services category was a result of nonrecurring revenue ramping down from completion of several network deployments without the corresponding benefit of similar revenues ramping up from new sales. 
Mid-market and enterprise declined 5.9% compared to 6.5% in the year ago quarter. The productional facility business sale I mentioned impacted mid-markets, but was largely offset by a strong quarter for nonrecurring revenues for equipment and professional services. 
Our wholesale channel declined 4.1% on a year-over-year basis compared to 6.6% in the year ago quarter. This quarter benefited from nonrecurring revenue from a few carrier settlements. 
Moving to Slide 6. Compute and application services for enterprise channels declined 2.3% year-over-year. As I mentioned, performance was impacted by CDN rerates and the large customer disconnect in our IGAM channel, along with completion of COVID related projects in the public sector. As highlighted in our Analyst Day, this category includes cloud edge in a number of our newer capabilities, and we expect it will take some time to get market traction. 
IP and data services for enterprise channels declined 2.2% year-over-year. Performance was impacted by lower sales for hybrid networks as enterprises deal with uncertainty related to future of work. While churn remains relatively stable for traditional VPN networks, we continue to see delayed decision-making for new SD-WAN and hybrid network sales. Fiber infrastructure services for enterprise channels grew 1.5% year-over-year. 
As I mentioned in my general remarks, sequential performance was impacted by completion of several large projects in our public sector vertical within large enterprise. We continue to manage voice and other services in the wholesale channel for cash. 
Turning to mass markets on Slide 7. First quarter 2021 revenue declined 3.8%. Within mass markets, consumer broadband revenue grew 1.2% and SBG broadband revenue was flat. We are very focused on the continued rollout of our Quantum Fiber product. For the quarter, we saw sequential growth in fiber customers by approximately 40,000. We exited the quarter with about 2.5 million homes enabled with fiber and 715,000 broadband customers on fiber. From a mix perspective, about 15% of our mass market broadband customers are now on fiber. As we have mentioned before, we expect that future performance will be largely driven by our continued success-based investments in our fiber to the home and small business and execution around driving up penetration of our competitive assets. 
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 8. For the first quarter 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $2.165 billion, compared to $2.209 billion from the year ago quarter. We continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter which grew to 43.1% compared to 42.3% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest in all the product, channel and customer experience initiatives we highlighted at our Analyst Day, but we're able to more than offset those investments with our continued focus on transformation savings. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2021 were $716 million. As we have mentioned, a significant portion of our CapEx is success-based. The lower sales from delayed customer decision-making also resulted in lower success-based capital spending during the quarter. We also continue to see benefits from our capital efficiency programs. In the first quarter 2021, the company generated free cash flow of $850 million. During the first quarter, we continue to make progress on our deleveraging initiative by reducing net debt by more than $460 million. In January of 2021, we also issued our first sustainability-linked bond, resulting in interest cost savings. Ian highlighted our strong ESG program. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced net debt by $2.1 billion. As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we have made towards strengthening our balance sheet and credit profile over the past couple of years. 
Turning to the business outlook on Slide 9. We feel good about the progress to date, and we are reiterating all of our 2021 financial outlook measures. Specifically, we remain confident about our adjusted EBITDA target of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion and expect free cash flow of $2.8 billion to $3 billion for the full year 2021. 
In summary, we continue to deliver solid EBITDA and free cash flow. With a strong balance sheet, we are investing in the business with the objective of improving revenue trajectory and delivering long-term EBITDA and free cash flow per share growth. 
With that, we'll open it up for your questions. France, would you please explain the process?"

Has that been getting worse as we are looking at over the last months? Any change recently that gives you the confidence that we could see some improvement in the second half? 
And maybe a question to Neel. There were a few onetime items that you highlighted. Could we get some numbers around that, maybe the nonrecurring benefits in the wholesale segment or the contribution of the large customer disconnect in IGAM? 
And maybe a final question on the noncore assets, could you -- the potential noncore asset sales, could you talk about what you would consider to be noncore?"

I don't know that they're lengthening any more than we've talked about over the last couple of quarters and during our Analyst Day back in April. We saw sales towards the end of the year lighter than we liked and sales at the beginning of the year lighter, but we had good sales in March. And so we're starting to -- we've got a good strong funnel. The market for our products and services are there. We're seeing better sales in March. I don't know if that's an overall change yet in the sales cycles, but things are starting to close again. 
And then with respect to noncore assets, I'll jump to the middle question and let Neel answer that. I don't want to get into specifics about different parts of our business and which ones that I'd fault for noncore. I think there's probably a pretty good sense of what those are. But if you look at where we invest, we're investing heavily in certain markets, in certain capabilities, in certain products, and those are the things that we think are core. So our fiber infrastructure, our edge computing, our platform that we're building, our customer experience, Quantum Fiber, all of those things, we think, are core to us and core to the products and services that we sell, and so we'll continue to focus our investments there.

Combination of those 2 things roughly was $15 million impact sequentially for IGAM. 
In terms of large enterprise, it was primarily public sector. There were some COVID-related projects winding down, like I mentioned.

You did have a strategic review in consumer -- your consumer footprint recently. Just wondering if maybe you could comment on that as maybe an area you would at least look at? And related to that,  is that business sufficiently separated from a network perspective from kind of your core enterprise business that you potentially could consummate such a deal in the relatively near term, if an opportunity did arise? 
And then my second question was on your client footprint, nice to see fiber penetration almost 30%. Maybe you could just talk about where you're winning share in that footprint? Is it coming from more new accounts? Or are there a lot of existing customers you're upgrading from legacy technologies? And then any reasonable target in your more mature fiber markets in terms of penetration?"

If you look in other markets, that's not as strong. So what we will look at with respect to the consumer copper network, that type of thing, would be looking at markets that we don't think are necessarily core to our Quantum Fiber strategy. I haven't -- I don't want to be very specific about what those could be or might be. But I do want to emphasize that we're open to looking at divestitures, and we actively pursue them. Now I'm not ready to announce any deal because we don't have one. But I do want to reinforce that this isn't just CEO talk. It isn't just me saying, ""Oh, yes, we're open to whatever."" We sold the majority of our corrections business, and we've looked at other parts of the business, and we'll continue to do that and make sure that -- that we're focused on the core of what's going to drive success for Lumen back to the fiber network, back to our platform capabilities, things like edge computing, Dynamic Connections. We've recognized with the change coming for our customers in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, those are the core assets that are going to drive our growth.

And so some of the things that we're doing from a customer experience perspective, you've heard a lot of our leaders talk about some of the automation initiatives. As we deploy those, we can take cost out of the organization. At the same time, it enables us to scale. So no, I think linear is probably a pretty good assumption.

So if you think about our business, every month, you have churn, and you're replacing that with newer services. And we focus on profitable revenues. And so as we've managed the business over the last couple of years, the revenues become more durable, more profitable. And if you think back to all the plans that we shared at the Analyst Day, fiber is foundational to all of that. And so being on that is a big part of our value proposition. And so we don't think we have to sacrifice profitability. In fact, we think our approach, it's a better customer experience when we have the customer on that. And all of the higher layer services really leverages our infrastructure. And it is a better experience for the customer when there is automation, there is self-service, which drives a very different margin profile. We're seeing that in the consumer space, and we're seeing that in the enterprise space. So yes, we don't need to -- we don't think we need to make that trade-off.

In terms of wholesale, you'll notice the business was roughly flat sequentially. And like I mentioned, there was a benefit from some carrier settlements, which are roughly about $15 million. 
And in mid markets, we had a couple of -- you have to keep in mind a couple of things going on. One is, as you look at mid-market year-over-year, we did have the sale of the correctional facility business or a significant portion of that in third quarter of last year. And if you look back to fourth quarter last year, that was roughly $15 million or so. And that was offset during the quarter when we did have some good wins in the mid-market segment and there are some onetime revenue related to that which included equipment and pro services. So if you look at the percentage change year-over-year, you don't really have to normalize for that if you're normalizing for nonrecurring revenues.

We don't -- I don't have any numbers to quantify the questions you have about what our top 10 markets, how many homes there are, how many fiber homes, any of that.

We've pass mid-market customers. We pass enterprise buildings. We pass wholesale locations and government locations. And so we know that as we build infrastructure in those top markets, there's a lot of synergy that comes from the network that we build and the people that we use to operate it in the way that we deploy it. And that's not going to be true, and I'm always hesitant to pick markets by name. I think Denver because that's where I'm sitting today. But if you look at some rural small town, we don't have those same opportunities. And so they're not going to be as attractive to invest in. In addition, we follow a -- when it comes to the consumer business, a very diligent micro-targeting strategy, where we look at the cost to build, we look at the densities, the average penetration rate, what we think we can accomplish in the market, the needs for the services, and we use those types of levers or triggers to identify where we want to build and where we don't want to build.

I guess I'll summarize with a couple of thoughts. First of all, we're focused on revenue, profitable revenue. We never talk about anything but profitable revenue and free cash flow. So we continue to stay focused as a company on the free cash flow that we generate, but driving that through profitable revenue growth. We're excited about the capabilities that we talked to you about a few weeks ago at the Analyst Day. We think we are bringing the products and services and the capabilities over the Lumen platform that the market needs and that the Fourth Industrial Revolution demands. And so we're really excited about our partnerships like the one that you asked about with T-Mobile because we think that helps us and augment our capabilities to deliver that, and we're starting to see success with some of those partnerships. We continue to invest in growth. We aren't skimping on capital. We are focused on growing our business, where we think the market will go. We're focused on continuing to augment what we believe is one of the world's most powerful fiber networks. And we'll continue to do that both on the mass market side and on the enterprise side. 
Now we also think that our shares are undervalued, and that brings up the questions for our Board about what's the best capital allocation approach. And so we wanted to mention that to you that we are having those discussions with the Board. 
And then lastly, we are we got a lot of questions on this, but we are serious about looking at the best way to maximize all of our assets for our shareholders. Some of those that are core, invest heavily in them. Those that are noncore, look if there are opportunities to divest them or take cash out of them. We will look at what we think is the best strategy for each of those types of assets for maximizing value.

I'm going to take a few minutes at the outset to share my perspective on the quarter and some of the key value drivers I see, not only in our business, but also with respect to our capital allocation and inorganic strategies. After that, I'll ask Neel to walk you through the details of the quarter and key drivers for the remainder of 2021. Then, we'll open it up to your questions.
Before diving into our results for the quarter, I want to discuss a few points coming out of our Investor Day in April. I hope those of you who were able to join us gained a better understanding of the markets, products and services, we believe, will drive our future growth as well as a sense of our conviction that we have the right assets, people, investment plans and execution strategies to grow both revenue and shareholder value over time.
The path we reviewed during our Analyst Day is pretty straightforward. We are combining one of the world's best fiber infrastructures, our deep global interconnections to IGAM networks and our increasingly robust Lumen platform to build the infrastructure necessary to support a full range of 4th Industrial Revolution applications and use cases, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, augmented reality, IoT and unified communications.
As of today, more than 85% of U.S. enterprises are within 5 milliseconds latency of our edge cloud facilities. We are well on our way to reach our end of the year goal of 95% of U.S. enterprises. Our fiber-enabled edge infrastructure, together with our embedded security capabilities and adaptive networking services, allows Lumen to deliver a differentiated solution set for expanding market opportunities. We're excited about the growing market for these services and our ability to meet those demand.
For those who were unable to join our Investor Day, I invite you to go to our website to review the information we shared.
I'm personally bullish on our approach. It leverages our greatest, most unique asset, one of the world's largest and most powerful fiber-based networks, to drive growth in both core fiber-based network services as well as adjacent services such as security and edge computing that are greatly enhanced by our fiber network. The demand for these services is growing, and we're investing into and are well positioned to grow with that market. I believe it is a compelling thesis.
At the same time, I understand our business needs to deliver top line revenue improvement today. While we delivered strong EBITDA and free cash flow in the first quarter, the revenue results don't yet meet our expectation. Neel will go into details, but I want you to hear directly from me that we are not satisfied and are focused on growth.
As we've mentioned on previous calls, COVID-related lengthening in sales cycles across both public and business sectors continues to create near-term revenue uncertainty. For example, public sector sales at the end of 4Q '20 and the first couple of months of 1Q '21 were light. We are market share takers in the public sector, and government slowdowns have created fewer opportunities to win new awards. This especially affects the onetime revenue we often see at the beginning of new contracts, which typically includes professional services, equipment sales and installation charges.
Similarly, the state, local and education customers have naturally focused all of their resources on COVID response. We believe the pause in these factors will prove to be simply one of timing. While we all began to learn about COVID in the first quarter of 2020, the nature of our business and sales cycles makes the effect of COVID more of a 2021 event for us. As we see the U.S. beginning to come out of the pandemic, we expect to see improvement in the second half of the year.
I offer you these details to provide color on the quarter, not to rationalize results. We are very focused on revenue and expect to accelerate growth where we invest. But thus far, our growth is not at the pace required to overcome the declines in voice and legacy data services. We have the assets, the products, the people and processes in place to drive higher levels of revenue growth, and now it comes down to execution.
Beyond revenue, we are continuing to do a lot of great work to improve the fundamentals of our business and to drive long-term growth. We have continued to expand the reach, the power and reliability of our world-class fiber infrastructure. Our fiber network is at the core of who we are and is the engine that will drive both our and our customers' success. It is among the best in the world, and we make it better every day.
Our Lumen platform allows enterprise customers to seamlessly deploy the connectivity, the infrastructure and the applications they need to transform their businesses to the new realities of the 4th IR. We have enabled key products and partnerships that drive full-service solutions for our customers and integrate the network within their cloud applications. We have begun to deploy the automation and customer experience that will define our future. Across our business, these changes have driven both higher levels of customer satisfaction and enabled us to maintain strong EBITDA margins.
These initiatives are ongoing, and I believe demonstrate we're doing the things required to drive long-term growth in revenue, EBITDA, free cash flow and shareholder value. I'm proud of this work and believe it will define our future success. As I said earlier though, we have a strong sense of urgency to accelerate top line growth. We are seeing positive results in our customer interactions and early success with our edge cloud efforts.
As an example, our SAP alliance has led to the onboarding and major VAR customers on the Lumen platform. VARs like our customer, Pristine. Rather than hear my views though, I thought I'd just share an exact quote from the customer. ""Through the entire process, we've been impressed with the Lumen offering. Their insight into our business demand and the quality of their team resulted in a packaged offering that targets the key challenges facing value-added resellers in our market space."" Obviously, I like to hear customer quotes like this. But I also want to point out that this is the exact intent of our entire Lumen platform.
We understand the focus on near-term revenue but believe too singular a focus on that topic overshadows the many other positives in our business. I'm not going to belabor this point. We shared with you our view of the sum of the parts of our business last year. That information is still on our website, and I would encourage you to give it another look. I think that the simple and straightforward analysis speaks for itself, and the market value for assets such as ours continues to support that basic view.
The market cap less than 5x the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance and our current EBITDA multiple does not reflect our extensive fiber infrastructure or the growth potential we highlighted in our Analyst Day. Moreover, we have a strong balance sheet enabled by our deleveraging initiatives. Given our conviction around our growth initiatives and our equity valuation, I'd like to share a few thoughts on capital allocation.
Of course, our first capital allocation priority is to make the investments required to drive healthy growth and returns within our core business. These investments are not linear from 1 quarter to another, and we expect 2021 capital investment will accelerate from first quarter levels. I am confident we are investing in an appropriate level to support our growth, expand our fiber network and enable the systems and programs that will continue to drive higher levels of sales, customer satisfaction and operating efficiency. We are committed to investing in growth.
Beyond investing in the business, we're also very focused on our dividend as a key element of our capital allocation strategy. We still get the occasional question or comment about the sustainability of, or our commitment to our dividend. Frankly, this puzzles me. As I'm sure you can appreciate, it's difficult for any company to make completely unqualified statements about their capital allocation policy, including dividends, and we're no different.
That said, I think we've been clear that we look at our current dividend level as both an appropriate capital allocation approach and an important proof point about our confidence in the future of our business. And with the current payout ratio in the 30s as a percentage of free cash flow, I think the question about sustainability answers itself. We believe the dividend is an important element in our delivery of value to shareholders, and that the current level of dividend is supported by sustainable payout ratios.
Two, we have been focused on strengthening our balance sheet and reducing our interest expense. And we've done a lot of good work in this space. Since announcing the deleveraging plan, we have reduced $4 billion in debt, refinanced more than $20 billion, improved our maturity profile and reduced cash interest expense by almost $600 million per year. This obviously enhances the financial position of the company and is very beneficial to our free cash flow profile.
We did what we said we were going to do here, and there is no question in my mind that it was the right thing to do to sustain long-term value. In terms of interest cost savings, coverage ratios and credit profile, we've largely achieved the outcomes we targeted with our deleveraging plan. We are maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA target range and expect to get there over time with a combination of EBITDA growth and debt pay down.
Our cash flow profile and balance sheet improvements give us the flexibility to reassess our capital allocation after investing in the business and supporting the dividend. Given our conviction around our sum of the parts analysis, fiber asset valuations and our business plans, we believe our shares trade at a significant discount to their true value. As we continue to progress toward our leverage targets, this naturally leads to discussions with the Board about share buybacks. We've made no decisions and are not making any specific announcement, but it is certainly part of our discussion.
Finally, I'd like to talk about our approach to inorganic opportunities to grow or unlock value. You've heard me say before that we are constantly evaluating alternatives to enhance shareholder value and are open minded, including divestitures. I know you hear that phrase from virtually every CEO, and that it can just sound like CEO talk, and I understand that point of view. But I want to be clear that we are actively looking at selling noncore assets to unlock value in our business, further accelerate deleveraging and implement potential buyback programs.
That said, we have been and will remain disciplined. We have confidence in our future and don't feel compelled to undertake any specific transaction. If we find transactions that are positive to shareholders, we won't hesitate to move forward.
Let me summarize before I pass it over to Neel. We understand we must improve our revenue trajectory. We are focused and unflinching in our assessment of what we must do to drive that change. It does not happen overnight in a business such as ours, but we know we must improve. At the same time, I have a strong personal conviction that we are doing the things required to position Lumen for the future. We are expanding the reach and capacity of our already powerful fiber network. We are improving our product set, transforming our customer experience and reducing our cost of delivery.
And again, I will highlight that we have a strong cash flow profile and an improved balance sheet that allows us to invest in the future of our business. While we reposition ourselves for long-term growth via the Lumen platform for enterprises and Quantum Fiber for mass markets, we will also continue to maintain the discipline required for us to deliver value to our equity holders, not only through growth, but also through inorganic options, the return of capital through dividends, the ongoing reduction of leverage and should we decide it is a better way to allocate capital, the possibility of share buybacks.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neel to review some of the details from the quarter. Neel?"

Let me begin with our financial summary on Slide 4.

For the first quarter of 2021, we delivered solid adjusted EBITDA and an expanded adjusted EBITDA margin on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. We also generated solid free cash flow. Based on our progress in the first quarter, we remain confident in our financial performance and are reiterating our outlook for the full year 2021.
Turning to revenue on Slide 5. Total revenue in the first quarter declined 3.8% to $5.029 billion. Adjusting for the sale of a significant portion of our correctional facility business in the third quarter of 2020, our revenue would have declined 3.6%. Business revenue in the first quarter declined 3.8% to $3.595 billion or 3.5% adjusting for the business sale that I just mentioned. Our overall business segment revenue performance was impacted by lengthening sales cycles in the current environment that we mentioned during the last few earnings calls and our recent Analyst Day. Within our business segment, IGAM revenue decreased 2.7% compared to roughly flat in the year ago quarter.
In addition to lengthening sales cycles, our revenue performance this quarter was impacted by some CDN rerates and a large customer disconnect. Large enterprise declined 3% compared to a growth of 2.3% in the year ago quarter. As Jeff mentioned, revenue performance was impacted by lower sales and completion of several projects in public sector.
Within compute and application services, we had a few COVID-related projects winding down. Sequential decline in fiber infrastructure services category was a result of nonrecurring revenue ramping down from completion of several network deployments without the corresponding benefit of similar revenues ramping up from new sales.
Mid-market and enterprise declined 5.9% compared to 6.5% in the year ago quarter. The correctional facility business sale I mentioned impacted mid-markets, but was largely offset by a strong quarter for nonrecurring revenues for equipment and professional services.
Our wholesale channel declined 4.1% on a year-over-year basis compared to 6.6% in the year ago quarter. This quarter benefited from nonrecurring revenue from a few carrier settlements.
Moving to Slide 6. Compute and application services for enterprise channels declined 2.3% year-over-year. As I mentioned, performance was impacted by CDN rerates and the large customer disconnect in our IGAM channel, along with completion of COVID-related projects in the public sector. As highlighted in our Analyst Day, this category includes cloud edge and a number of our newer capabilities, and we expect it will take some time to get market traction.
IP and data services for enterprise channels declined 2.2% year-over-year. Performance was impacted by lower sales for hybrid networks as enterprises deal with uncertainty related to future of work. While churn remains relatively stable for traditional VPN networks, we continue to see delayed decision-making for new SD-WAN and hybrid network sales. Fiber infrastructure services for enterprise channels grew 1.5% year-over-year.
As I mentioned in my general remarks, sequential performance was impacted by completion of several large projects in our public sector vertical within large enterprise. We continue to manage voice and other services in the wholesale channel for cash.
Turning to mass markets on Slide 7. First quarter 2021 revenue declined 3.8%. Within mass markets, consumer broadband revenue grew 1.2% and SBG broadband revenue was flat. We are very focused on the continued rollout of our Quantum Fiber product. For the quarter, we saw sequential growth in fiber customers by approximately 40,000. We exited the quarter with about 2.5 million homes enabled with fiber and 715,000 broadband customers on fiber. From a mix perspective, about 15% of our mass markets broadband customers are now on fiber.
As we have mentioned before, we expect that future performance will be largely driven by our continued success-based investments in our Fiber to the Home in small business and execution around driving up penetration of our competitive assets.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 8. For the first quarter 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $2.165 billion, compared to $2.209 billion from the year ago quarter. We continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, which grew to 43.1% compared to 42.3% in the year ago quarter. We continue to invest in all the product, channel and customer experience initiatives we highlighted at our Analyst Day, but we're able to more than offset those investments with our continued focus on transformation savings.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2021 were $716 million. As we have mentioned, a significant portion of our CapEx is success-based. The lower sales from delayed customer decision-making also resulted in lower success-based capital spending during the quarter.
We also continue to see benefits from our capital efficiency programs. In the first quarter 2021, the company generated free cash flow of $850 million. During the first quarter, we continued to make progress on our deleveraging initiative by reducing net debt by more than $460 million.
In January of 2021, we also issued our first sustainability-linked bond, resulting in interest cost savings and highlighted our strong ESG program. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced net debt by $2.1 billion.
As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we have made towards strengthening our balance sheet and credit profile over the past couple of years.
Turning to the business outlook on Slide 9. We feel good about the progress to date, and we are reiterating all of our 2021 financial outlook measures. Specifically, we remain confident about our adjusted EBITDA target of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion and expect free cash flow of $2.8 billion to $3 billion for the full year 2021.
In summary, we continue to deliver solid EBITDA and free cash flow. With a strong balance sheet, we are investing in the business with the objective of improving revenue trajectory and delivering long-term EBITDA and free cash flow per share growth.
With that, we'll open it up for your questions. France, would you please explain the process?"

I don't know if that's an overall change yet in the sales cycles, but things are starting to close again.
And then with respect to noncore assets, I'll jump through the middle question and let Neel answer that. I don't want to get into specifics about different parts of our business and which ones that I'd call core or noncore. I think there's probably a pretty good sense of what those are. But if you look at where we invest, we're investing heavily in certain markets, in certain capabilities, in certain products, and those are the things that we think are core. So our fiber infrastructure, our edge computing, our platform that we're building, our customer experience, Quantum Fiber, all of those things, we think, are core to us and core to the products and services that we sell, and so we'll continue to focus our investments there.

And those 2 things, in aggregate, was roughly a $40 million impact sequentially."

You did have a strategic review in consumer -- your consumer footprint recently. Just wondering if maybe you could comment on that as maybe an area you would have to look at? And related to that, is that business sufficiently separated from a network perspective from kind of your core enterprise business that you potentially could consummate such a deal in the relatively near term if an opportunity did arise?
And then my second question was on your client footprint, nice to see fiber penetration almost 30%. Maybe you could just talk about where you're winning share in that footprint? Is it coming from more new accounts? Or are there a lot of existing customers you're upgrading from legacy technologies? And then any reasonable target in your more mature fiber markets in terms of penetration?"

If you look in other markets, that's not as strong. So what we will look at with respect to the consumer copper network, that type of thing, would be looking at markets that we don't think are necessarily core to our Quantum Fiber strategy.
I haven't -- I don't want to be very specific about what those could be or might be. But I do want to emphasize that we're open to looking at divestitures, and we actively pursue them. Now I'm not ready to announce any deal because we don't have one. But I do want to reinforce that this isn't just CEO talk. It isn't just me saying, ""Oh, yes, we're open to whatever.""
We sold the majority of our corrections business, and we've looked at other parts of the business, and we'll continue to do that and make sure that we're focused on the core of what's going to drive success for Lumen, back to the fiber network, back to our platform capabilities, things like edge computing, Dynamic Connections. We've recognized with the change coming for our customers in the 4th Industrial Revolution, those are the core assets that are going to drive our growth. And if it's not core to us, then we're open and opportunistic about considering other alternatives. Neel, would you take the second half?"

And so as we've managed the business over the last couple of years, the revenues become more durable, more profitable.
And if you think back to all the plans that we shared at the Analyst Day, fiber is foundational to all of that. And so being on that is a big part of our value proposition. And so we don't think we have to sacrifice profitability. In fact, we think our approach, it's a better customer experience when we have the customer on that. And all of the higher-layer services really leverages our infrastructure.

In terms of wholesale, you'll notice the business was roughly flat sequentially. And like I mentioned, there was a benefit from some carrier settlements, which are roughly about $15 million.
And in mid markets, we had a couple of -- you have to keep in mind a couple of things going on. One is, as you look at mid-market year-over-year, we did have the sale of the correctional facility business or a significant portion of that in third quarter of last year. And if you look back to fourth quarter last year, that was roughly $15 million or so. And that was offset during the quarter when we did have some good wins in the mid-market segment and there are some onetime revenue related to that which included equipment and pro services. So if you look at the percentage change year-over-year, you don't really have to normalize for that if you're normalizing for nonrecurring revenues.
In terms of your question on top 10 markets, I can take a shot at that. Or Jeff, do you want to?"

We don't -- I don't have any numbers to quantify the questions you have about what our top 10 markets, how many homes there are, how many fiber homes, any of that. But let me tell you about the strategy in those top markets. And that is when we build fiber down the street to go to a residential home, we also pass small business customers. We've pass mid-market customers. We pass enterprise buildings. We pass wholesale locations and government locations. And so we know that as we build infrastructure in those top markets, there's a lot of synergy that comes from the network that we build and the people that we use to operate it and the way that we deploy it.
And that's not going to be true, and I'm always hesitant to pick markets by name. I picked Denver because that's where I'm sitting today. But if you look at some rural small town, we don't have those same opportunities. And so they're not going to be as attractive to invest in. In addition, we follow a -- when it comes to the consumer business, a very diligent micro-targeting strategy, where we look at the cost to build, we look at the densities, the average penetration rate, what we think we can accomplish in the market, the needs for the services, and we use those types of levers or triggers to identify where we want to build and where we don't want to build. Those typically are pretty good in our dense urban clusters like at Denver. Neel, I don't know if you want to add?"

I guess I'll summarize with a couple of thoughts. First of all, we're focused on revenue, profitable revenue. We never talk about anything but profitable revenue and free cash flow. So we continue to stay focused as a company on the free cash flow that we generate, but driving that through profitable revenue growth.
We're excited about the capabilities that we talked to you about a few weeks ago at the Analyst Day. We think we are bringing the products and services and the capabilities over the Lumen platform that the market needs and that the 4th Industrial Revolution demands. And so we're really excited about our partnerships like the one that you asked about with T-Mobile because we think that helps us and augment our capabilities to deliver that, and we're starting to see success with some of those partnerships.
We continue to invest in growth. We aren't skimping on capital. We are focused on growing our business, where we think the market will go. We're focused on continuing to augment what we believe is one of the world's most powerful fiber networks. And we'll continue to do that both on the mass market side and on the enterprise side.

It's an exciting day for Lumen and we have a lot to cover. I'll begin today's call with our recently announced transactions, including the just announced sale of a portion of our legacy local exchange business to Apollo. I'll then ask Neel to review a few second quarter highlights as well as provide a preliminary view of the expected effects of these transactions on Lumen's financial profile. And of course, we'll reserve time for your questions at the end of the call. So let's jump in.
Last week, we announced the sale of our Latin American assets to Stonepeak at a value of $2.7 billion, representing an approximately 9x multiple of the Latin American business' 2020 estimated adjusted EBITDA. There are more details about this transaction and the release materials. But the simplest way to think about Lat Am is that we will transfer ownership of substantially all our Lat Am based customers and assets to Stonepeak. And are entering into a services agreement with Stonepeak to continue to serve the needs of our enterprise customers based outside the region. Subject to customary regulatory approvals, we expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2022.
I'm also pleased to share that we have agreed to sell our legacy local exchange business in 20 states to Apollo for $7.5 billion, representing a multiple of approximately 5.5x our 2020 estimated adjusted EBITDA. In short, with this transaction, we are transferring to Apollo all our legacy local exchange assets in 20 states along with the consumer, small, medium business, state and local government, education and wholesale customers served by those assets. Lumen will retain ownership of our non-local exchange fiber assets in those 20 states, including our long-haul fiber and the enterprise CLEC assets. Lumen will also retain our legacy local exchange assets in another 16 states.
In the transferred markets, the service needs of Lumen's enterprise and government customers will be met under a network services agreement to be entered into with Apollo. Subject to customary regulatory approvals, we expect this transaction to close in the second half of 2022.
I'm very pleased with the valuations we were able to achieve for these 2 sets of assets. On the whole, our retained markets have significantly higher fiber penetration, population density, enterprise demand and overall growth opportunity than the transferred assets. We have spoken about the sum of the parts analysis of Lumen. And I believe multiples of 5.5x for these 20 states and 9x for Lat Am should sign a bright light on the relative value of our retained business. Don't get me wrong, the 20 states we're selling to Apollo are good markets with quality assets, talented employees and excellent customers. As we looked at these states, though, we knew that we were unlikely to prioritize investments in these markets ahead of our other opportunities in Enterprise and Quantum Fiber. After closing of this transaction, approximately 70% of our remaining mass market footprint is well suited for Quantum Fiber investment. This transaction will allow the transferred assets to get the higher level of investment we know they can sustain, and we are committed to partnering with Apollo to help them realize their vision for these markets.
As I mentioned on our Analyst Day back in April, we have worked very hard over the past 3 years to transform our company, both financially and operationally. We committed to driving growth over the Lumen platform and continue to transform the business. These transactions are fully aligned with that strategy, and we believe will drive future growth as we meet the needs of the fourth industrial revolution for enterprises and consumers alike.
Undertaking these transactions allows us to simplify our business, deliver differentiated products to a higher percentage of our customer base and target our capital investments to drive higher growth and more attractive long-term returns on both the Lumen platform and through our Quantum Fiber investment.
Of course, the transactions create pressure as well. While the sale of the consumer assets is expected to have a positive effect on our product mix day 1 after close and an improved growth profile going forward, the high levels of cash flow these markets generate will be free cash flow dilutive in the near term, even at these strong valuations. Even so, we are confident that these transactions are right for our business over the long term and will improve the growth profile of our company.
Neel will cover some of the operational financial impacts, but let me take a moment to speak to the implications of these transactions to our capital allocation strategy.
First, we absolutely expect to accelerate the pace of our growth investments in Quantum Fiber. By retaining the 16 states we have, fiber-based consumer and mass market services remain a huge opportunity for us and we have built a differentiated offering with Quantum Fiber, enabling an all-digital customer experience that uniquely positions us among mass-market broadband providers. As Neel will discuss, our Quantum Fiber results are bearing this out as we saw another quarter of net adds for our fiber and higher-speed offerings, continuing results from previous quarters. The jury isn't out on this one. When we invest in consumer fiber, we take share and we drive profitable growth.
As I mentioned, upon closing the Apollo transaction, approximately 70% of our remaining mass market footprint will be the sort of urban and suburban markets that are best addressable with Quantum Fiber solutions. We are developing an accelerated build plan, and we'll share those details as they're finalized. What we can tell you today is that while we remain strategic and disciplined in our approach, we expect to build faster and with more scale in the markets that we prioritized for Quantum Fiber investment.
We also believe we have a unique opportunity to grow our enterprise business by leveraging our expansive fiber network to provide essential transport services and further penetrating our on-net buildings, utilizing our edge computing network to move critical workloads closer to the source of data and the use of data and expanding the capabilities of the Lumen platform and enabling greater digital consumption of our services for all of our customers.
I'm the first to acknowledge that we're not yet seeing the pace of growth that we expect from these initiatives, but we remain confident in the opportunity and are streamlining our focus and further investing to drive that growth.
Second, I expect we will manage our balance sheet to remain more or less leverage neutral over the next few years as we accelerate investment into our growth initiatives. Longer term, I believe the previously articulated leverage range is the right one for our business. But I'm prepared to allow the time line to achieve that range to extend as we work through this investment cycle. Further, beyond fully investing in the growth of our business, we're mindful of being opportunistic in considering share repurchases. We are not choosing share repurchases over funding growth. Even as we scale the Quantum Fiber build and the Lumen platform investments, we expect to have excess capacity to consider opportunistic share repurchases. If we can do so at multiples that will be accretive to long-term share value. To that end, we've also announced today approval by our board of a $1 billion buyback program.
Lastly, the dividend. We have long stated that we believe return of cash in the form of a dividend is an appropriate capital allocation vehicle in a business like ours. However, with these transactions, the profile of our business is changing and will change rapidly going forward as we lean into investing for growth and continuing to rationalize the portfolio. I do realize that will put pressure on our dividend after we close these transactions and the further we get into our investment program. But as of now, we are not faced with that trade-off decision, and we'll continue to balance the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks while we accelerate our investment in Enterprise and Quantum Fiber growth.
Let me provide a small bit of color on my views on the second quarter results. While we worked hard to get these transactions announced, we remain very focused on driving performance in those areas that we believe provide the best opportunity for growing revenue and strong returns. That said, our second quarter revenue trends were sluggish. We've talked about the slow sales in the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first quarter as a result of COVID and delayed decision-making. Since then, we've seen good sales growth sequentially and believe our growth initiatives across the Lumen platform will help us improve our revenue trends as we move forward.
Before I turn the call over to Neel, let me offer a few points in summary. We're excited about the 2 transactions we've announced. We're pleased with the valuations that have also done these transactions to drive investment and operational focus within the remaining business, sticking to the strategy we discussed since launching Lumen and Quantum Fiber last fall. At 5.5x on the light business and 9x adjusted EBITDA on the Lat Am business, we believe the valuations highlight and support our view of the sum of the parts for the remaining business. While we already operate one of the world's most extensive and powerful fiber infrastructure, we will continue to invest in growth via the Lumen platform, cloud edge initiative and to accelerate deployment of Quantum Fiber.
We believe the recently announced transactions were executed at excellent valuations, and are aligned to our strategy of streamlining our business to those markets on which we are best able to profitably invest in growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neel to provide a few more details on the quarter and some of the expected effects from the announced transactions. Neel?"

I want to leave ample time for your questions on our announced transactions, so I will briefly review our second quarter results. Let me begin with our financial highlights in our earnings presentation.
For the second quarter of 2021, we delivered solid adjusted EBITDA and expanded margins year-over-year. Cash flow remains very robust, providing the opportunity to ramp investment in our key growth areas in the second half of the year. However, given our spending in the first half, we are reducing our CapEx guidance to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion. And accordingly, we are adjusting our free cash flow expectation to $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion for the full year 2021. As Jeff mentioned, our Board has approved a $1 billion share buyback program over 2 years, with which we will be opportunistically buying back shares.
Turning to second quarter revenue by sales channel. Total revenue in the second quarter declined 5.2% on a year-over-year basis to $4.924 billion. Normalizing for the sale of our correctional facility business in the third quarter of 2020, our revenue would have declined 4.9%. It is important to remember that year-over-year metrics were meaningfully affected by the surge on demand for voice collaboration and conferencing in the second quarter of last year, making comparisons less relevant. From a sequential perspective, total revenue declined by 2.1%, primarily driven by lower sales in the last couple of quarters.
Moving to business segment. In the second quarter, total business revenue declined 2% sequentially and 5.2% on a year-over-year basis to $3.522 billion. Normalizing for the sale of the correctional facility business, the decline was 4.9%.
Within our business segment, IGAM revenue declined 0.9% sequentially and 2.6% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by higher usage in the prior year period related to COVID. Within IGAM, compute and application, IP data and fiber infrastructure services were flat sequentially driven by improvement in sales and installs. Large enterprise declined 0.6% sequentially and 4.3% on a year-over-year basis. Computer and application services and fiber and infrastructure services both grew sequentially.
Mid-market enterprise declined 4.7% sequentially and 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. Sequential performance was impacted by strong nonrecurring revenues we highlighted last quarter. This sales channel was also impacted by the previously noted sale of the correctional facility business.
Wholesale declined 2.6% sequentially and 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, the first quarter of this year benefited from carrier settlements.
Our overall business segment revenue performance continued to be impacted by delayed decision-making by enterprise customers in the current environment. While year-over-year comparisons this quarter were affected by the pandemic-related surge in voice services last year, we are seeing stabilization in sequential trends.
Moving to business segment revenues by product categories. Compute and application services for the enterprise channels grew sequentially and was flat year-over-year. We expect compute and application services, which includes cloud edge and our newer Lumen platform offerings, to provide additional growth with increased market traction.
IP and data services for enterprise channels declined both sequentially and year-over-year as increased demand for IP and work-from-home solutions were offset by continued delayed decision-making for enterprise hybrid network deployments.
Fiber infrastructure services for enterprise channels grew year-over-year. Sequential performance was impacted by strength in nonrecurring revenues for equipment and professional services in our mid-market channel last quarter.
Voice and other services in the wholesale channel continue to be managed for cash, with legacy voice declines in line with our expectations, but year-over-year comparisons were impacted by higher COVID-related usage in the year ago quarter that I just mentioned. As with the first quarter, market conditions in the second quarter remained challenging.
As Jeff mentioned, we are not pleased with our revenue performance year-to-date, and have a solid plan to improve our revenue trajectory as the economy reopens and our new initiatives take hold.
Turning to mass markets, second quarter 2021 revenue declined 2.2% sequentially. During the quarter, we added 31,000 Quantum Fiber customers, reaching a total of 746,000. Our mass markets fiber broadband revenue grew 30% year-over-year this quarter. Fiber-based broadband revenue now represents 17% of mass markets broadband revenues compared to 13% in the year ago quarter.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA. For the second quarter of 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $2.109 billion compared to $2.135 billion in the year ago quarter. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, growing 170 basis points year-over-year to 42.8%. As we continue to direct incremental operating expense investments towards key growth areas of the company, we were able to more than offset those investments with our ongoing focus on operational transformation savings.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2021 were $646 million. As we have mentioned, a significant portion of our capital is success based, and with the lengthening sales cycles, we were able to calibrate our capital spending to the current environment.
As previously mentioned, we have adjusted our CapEx expectations lower for the full year, with an expectation that the second half spending will be higher than the first half as we start to ramp our mass market investments and business decision-making accelerates.
In the second quarter of 2021, the company generated free cash flow of $1.044 billion, and we have adjusted our full year 2021 guidance for free cash flow as a result of lower capital spending year-to-date. During the second quarter, we continue to make progress on our deleveraging initiatives by reducing net debt by more than $700 million. We issued $1 billion of lower coupon debt during the second quarter to refinance more than $1.2 billion of debt. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced net debt by $2.3 billion.
Moving to the financial outlook for 2021. Other than the previously mentioned capital expenditures, and resulting free cash flow changes, all other guidance metrics remain unchanged. We remain confident in our adjusted EBITDA target of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
Moving on to our announced transactions, both today with Apollo for part of our ILEC footprint and last week with Stonepeak for our Lat Am business, I would like to provide you with some high-level financial impacts that should help inform your modeling as you look past the expected closings in 2022. With respect to the Lat Am divestiture, we estimate our 2020 revenue related to the transaction at approximately $800 million; estimated adjusted EBITDA a little over $300 million; and capital expenditures of about $200 million. The estimated adjusted EBITDA includes costs to operate the business on a stand-alone basis and also elimination of noncash revenues and resulting EBITDA consistent with the proposed sale. These impacts predominantly affect our IGAM channel.
In terms of the ILEC transaction, we estimate our 2020 revenue related to the divested assets at approximately $2.5 billion; estimated adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion; and CapEx of about $400 million, excluding CAF. Similar to Lat Am, these estimates include revenue and costs to operate the business on a stand-alone basis.
As far as revenue associated with this transaction, about 70% of the revenue is mass market's, and the remainder roughly split between wholesale and enterprise channels. In terms of the product mix, about 50% of the revenue is for voice and other product category, and the remainder are largely mass market broadband revenues. As with any carve-out, we do expect some dissynergies, but we are also confident that we can address those with our focus on cost transformation initiatives.
Upon the closing of both transactions, Lumen's NOLs will be substantially utilized, and we will become a cash taxpayer. As Jeff mentioned, we will manage our debt profile to ensure that the transactions are leverage neutral. And our long-term target leverage of 2.75 to 3.25 net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged.
In summary, we have made significant progress this quarter in optimizing our business with a clear focus on positioning Lumen to capitalize on the growth opportunities. We expect business segment trends to improve, driven by our Lumen platform initiatives as enterprise decision-making accelerates. And we are very excited about the investment and growth opportunity in our mass market fiber business.
With that, we'll open it up for your questions."

And the transaction includes not only our mass markets revenue but also think about it as ILEC access revenue for wholesale and enterprise. So roughly $2.5 billion of revenue and $1.4 billion of EBITDA.
In terms of the growth profile you mentioned, 50% of that revenue is voice and other. So that revenue is declining similar to kind of the rest of the portfolio for mass markets in terms of voice and other. But in terms of mix, only, call it, less than 10% of our fiber revenues are in that area because that area is largely rural, if you will. Another data point that kind of highlights that is about 60% of our CAF subsidy, CAF II subsidy and about 60% of our CAF II units are in the footprint that we're selling. And so -- but broadband revenues in those states have been relatively stable because of the competitive landscape today. We think that's going to change going forward. But at a high level, that's the summary in terms of mix and the footprint."

One is the capitalization of the company is going to look very different by the time we get to closing the transaction and shortly thereafter. We are paying down debt. We are buying back -- or we intend to buy back shares, so that's one thing to keep in mind. Jeff also mentioned, we continue to rationalize the portfolio. So we'll be active on that front.
And then in terms of incremental growth capital, it's a timing and scaling question. We do want to ramp up, but we also want to ramp up in a responsible way where we don't have stranded capital that we're driving penetration where we're investing. And so there's a set of variables that we're working through.

We saw the slowdown in the first part of the first quarter. We've seen sequential improvement since then. That's a true statement. And we are -- we're seeing sequential improvement in sales, but the Delta variant is here. Our customers are beginning to change the way that they're coming back to work. We're doing that ourselves in response to some of the challenges that are out there. And so we have confidence that the sales cycles will improve and that we'll return to the sales expectations that we have. But there are still a number of factors we're seeing the evidence, but there's still a number of factors that could work against us in that.
With respect to the CapEx, that is actually tied to your first question more than it's tied to deal flow. When we see a slowdown in sales cycles and purchasing cycles, we don't spend as much capital. Our capital is highly correlated to our growth. And so we haven't spent as much capital in the first couple of quarters as we thought.
Now we expect all that to improve. So we expect higher capital utilization in the second half of the year as we continue to improve in sales and continue to drive revenue growth through the business. And then the last question with respect to buybacks, and is that tied to the deal closing? The answer is no. That is not tied to the deal closing.

But we also thought the math that you're doing is the math everybody is going to do. And there is going to be some trade-off between growth capital and how we allocate between growth capital and the dividend. And -- but it's not something we need to decide on today.
In terms of your question on the NOL, again, a lot of variables there. One is depending on deal timing, there's taxable income that we have in the core business. Then there's the tax regulation at the time when we closed the DL, so that's another variable. But not -- I would say that we know given our NOL balance, these assets have a low tax basis. And so we would be using up all of the NOL. And we'll have some cash taxes on top of that by the time we get to closing the deals, and we'll become a cash tax payer after that."

And then there was a lot of kind of corporately allocated overhead costs. Is the way that you're kind of getting to the EBITDA numbers for the divested properties. Is this a function of the NSA that you talked about striking with, I guess, both counterparties, Neel, and exactly to kind of fully reimburse you for what you would have been allocating to these entities, some of your kind of net neutral? And how's that NSA actually been nailed down.
And I guess the second question was, Jeff, you mentioned kind of cash flow dilution. Is that kind of just try to add up the numbers, the Latin American piece is a negative $100 million in EBITDA minus CapEx, and it's $1.1 billion for the ILEC, that's $1.2 billion. We're going to tax effect it because you can become a full taxpayer, that's like maybe negative $800 million. Then you're going to be a full cash taxpayer, that's maybe going to be another $700 million, that's about $1.5 billion. You're going to lose CAF II, that's about $100 million, that's $1.6 billion. You're going to save some money from the debt, right, so let's say $10 billion of cash, 5% interest, after taxes of $350 million. So maybe a negative $1.250 billion kind of on a pro forma basis. Are there other things are the moving parts, Neel, that we need to be thinking about like as we try to model out what a 2023 Lumen looks like under these constructs?"

And in terms of the math that you're doing. Yes, those are the numbers that we provided. Obviously, like I mentioned a couple of times before, you have to make some assumptions in terms of the capitalization of the company going forward. And keep in mind, there's also CapEx for CAF II that's going to fall off. So over the last 3 years or so, we've been averaging $300 million or so. So that will fall off as well.

We invest in fiber, and we'll intend to grow the penetration of broadband services for customers, high-speed broadband services. It's part of what our investment thesis is.

And if you look at our footprint of the remaining states, and we've already spent a couple of times, 70% are urban or suburban. That gives us a great opportunity.

Last week, we announced the sale of our Latin American assets to Stonepeak at a value of $2.7 billion, representing an approximately 9x multiple of the Latin American business' 2020 estimated adjusted EBITDA. There are more details about this transaction in the release materials, but the simplest way to think about LATAM is that we will transfer ownership of substantially all our LATAM-ased customers and assets to Stonepeak, and are entering into a services agreement with Stonepeak to continue to serve the needs of our enterprise customers based outside the region. Subject to customary regulatory approvals, we expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2022.
I'm also pleased to share that we have agreed to sell our legacy local exchange business in 20 states to Apollo for $7.5 billion, representing a multiple of approximately 5.5x our 2020 estimated adjusted EBITDA. In short, with this transaction, we are transferring to Apollo all our legacy local exchange assets in 20 states, along with the consumer, small/medium business, state and local government, education and wholesale customers served by those assets.
Lumen will retain ownership of our non-local exchange fiber assets in those 20 states, including our long-haul fiber and the enterprise CLEC assets. Lumen will also retain our legacy local exchange assets in another 16 states. In the transferred markets, the service needs of Lumen's enterprise and government customers will be met under a network services agreement to be entered into with Apollo. Subject to customary regulatory approvals, we expect this transaction to close in the second half of 2022.
I'm very pleased with the valuations we were able to achieve for these 2 sets of assets. On the whole, our retained markets have significantly higher fiber penetration, population density, enterprise demand and overall growth opportunity than the transferred assets. We have spoken about the sum of the parts analysis of Lumen. And I believe multiples of 5.5x for these 20 states and 9x for LATAM should shine a bright light on the relative value of our retained business.
Don't get me wrong, the 20 states we're selling to Apollo are good markets with quality assets, talented employees and excellent customers. As we looked at these states, though, we knew that we were unlikely to prioritize investments in these markets ahead of our other opportunities in Enterprise and Quantum Fiber. After closing of this transaction, approximately 70% of our remaining mass market footprint is well suited for Quantum Fiber investment. This transaction will allow the transferred assets to get the higher level of investment we know they can sustain, and we are committed to partnering with Apollo to help them realize their vision for these markets.
As I mentioned on our Analyst Day back in April, we have worked very hard over the past 3 years to transform our company, both financially and operationally. We committed to driving growth over the Lumen platform and continue to transform the business. These transactions are fully aligned with that strategy, and we believe will drive future growth as we meet the needs of the fourth industrial revolution, for enterprises and consumers alike.
Undertaking these transactions allows us to simplify our business, deliver differentiated products to a higher percentage of our customer base and target our capital investments to drive higher growth and more attractive long-term returns on both the Lumen platform and through our Quantum Fiber investment.
Of course, the transactions create pressure as well. While the sale of the consumer assets is expected to have a positive effect on our product mix day 1 after close and an improved growth profile going forward, the high levels of cash flow these markets generate will be free cash flow dilutive in the near term, even at these strong valuations. Even so, we are confident that these transactions are right for our business over the long term and will improve the growth profile of our company.
Neel will cover some of the operational financial impacts but let me take a moment to speak to the implications of these transactions to our capital allocation strategy.
First, we absolutely expect to accelerate the pace of our growth investments in Quantum Fiber. By retaining the 16 states we have, fiber-based consumer and mass market services remain a huge opportunity for us and we have built a differentiated offering with Quantum Fiber, enabling an all-digital customer experience that uniquely positions us among mass-market broadband providers. As Neil will discuss, our Quantum Fiber results are bearing this out as we saw another quarter of net adds for our fiber and higher-speed offerings continuing results from previous quarters.
The jury isn't out on this one. When we invest in consumer fiber, we take share and we drive profitable growth. As I mentioned, upon closing the Apollo transaction, approximately 70% of our remaining mass market footprint will be the sort of urban and suburban markets that are best addressable with Quantum Fiber solutions. We are developing an accelerated build plan, and we'll share those details as they're finalized. What we can tell you today is that while we remain strategic and disciplined in our approach, we expect to build faster and with more scale in the markets that we prioritize for Quantum Fiber investment.
We also believe we have a unique opportunity to grow our Enterprise business by leveraging our expansive fiber network to provide essential transport services and further penetrating our on-net buildings, utilizing our edge computing network to move critical workloads closer to the source of data and the use of data and expanding the capabilities of the Lumen platform and enabling greater digital consumption of our services for all of our customers.
I'm the first to acknowledge that we're not yet seeing the pace of growth that we expect from these initiatives, but we remain confident in the opportunity and are streamlining our focus and further investing to drive that growth.
Second, I expect we will manage our balance sheet to remain more or less leverage-neutral over the next few years as we accelerate investment into our growth initiatives. Longer term, I believe the previously articulated leverage range is the right one for our business. But I'm prepared to allow the time line to achieve that range to extend as we work through this investment cycle. Further, beyond fully investing in the growth of our business, we're mindful of being opportunistic in considering share repurchases. We are not choosing share repurchases over funding growth. Even as we scale the Quantum Fiber build and the Lumen platform investments, we expect to have excess capacity to consider opportunistic share repurchases if we can do so at multiples that will be accretive to long-term share value. To that end, we've also announced today approval by our Board of a $1 billion buyback program.
Lastly, the dividend. We have long stated that we believe return of cash in the form of a dividend is an appropriate capital allocation vehicle in a business like ours. However, with these transactions, the profile of our business is changing and will change rapidly going forward as we lean into investing for growth and continuing to rationalize the portfolio. I do realize that will put pressure on our dividend after we close these transactions and the further we get into our investment program. But as of now, we are not faced with that trade-off decision, and we'll continue to balance the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks while we accelerate our investment in Enterprise and Quantum Fiber growth.
Let me provide a small bit of color on my views on the second quarter results. While we worked hard to get these transactions announced, we remain very focused on driving performance in those areas that we believe provide the best opportunity for growing revenue and strong returns. That said, our second quarter revenue trends were sluggish. We've talked about the slow sales in the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first quarter as a result of COVID and delayed decision-making. Since then, we've seen good sales growth sequentially and believe our growth initiatives across the Lumen platform will help us improve our revenue trends as we move forward.
Before I turn the call over to Neel, let me offer a few points in summary. We're excited about the 2 transactions we've announced. We're pleased with the valuations that have also done these transactions to drive investment and operational focus within the remaining business, sticking to the strategy we discussed since launching Lumen and Quantum Fiber last fall. At 5.5x on the ILEC business and 9x adjusted EBITDA on the LATAM business, we believe the valuations highlight and support our view of the sum of the parts for the remaining business.
While we already operate one of the world's most extensive and powerful fiber infrastructure, we will continue to invest in growth via the Lumen platform, cloud edge initiatives and to accelerate deployment of Quantum Fiber. We believe the recently announced transactions were executed at excellent valuations, and are aligned to our strategy of streamlining our business to those markets on which we are best able to profitably invest in growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neel to provide a few more details on the quarter and some of the expected effects from the announced transactions. Neel?"
260149,1672703585,2361826,"Lumen Technologies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to leave ample time for your questions on our announced transactions so I will briefly review our second quarter results. Let me begin with our financial highlights in our earnings presentation.For t",1364,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to leave ample time for your questions on our announced transactions so I will briefly review our second quarter results. Let me begin with our financial highlights in our earnings presentation.
For the second quarter 2021, we delivered solid adjusted EBITDA and expanded margins year-over-year. Cash flow remains very robust, providing the opportunity to ramp investment in our key growth areas in the second half of the year. However, given our spending in the first half, we are reducing our CapEx guidance to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion. And accordingly, we are adjusting our free cash flow expectation to $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion for the full year 2021. As Jeff mentioned, our Board has approved a $1 billion share buyback program over 2 years, with which we will be opportunistically buying back shares.
Turning to second quarter revenue by sales channel. Total revenue in the second quarter declined 5.2% on a year-over-year basis to $4.924 billion. Normalizing for the sale of our correctional facility business in the third quarter of 2020, our revenue would have declined 4.9%. It is important to remember that year-over-year metrics were meaningfully affected by the surge in demand for voice collaboration and conferencing in the second quarter of last year, making comparisons less relevant. From a sequential perspective, total revenue declined by 2.1%, primarily driven by lower sales in the last couple of quarters.
Moving to business segment. In the second quarter, total business revenue declined 2% sequentially and 5.2% on a year-over-year basis to $3.522 billion. Normalizing for the sale of the correctional facility business, the decline was 4.9%.
Within our business segment, IGAM revenue declined 0.9% sequentially and 2.6% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by higher usage in the prior year period related to COVID. Within IGAM, compute and application, IP and data and fiber infrastructure services were flat sequentially driven by improvement in sales and installs. Large enterprise declined 0.6% sequentially and 4.3% on a year-over-year basis. Compute and application services and fiber and infrastructure services both grew sequentially. 
Mid-market enterprise declined 4.7% sequentially and 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. Sequential performance was impacted by strong nonrecurring revenues we highlighted last quarter. This sales channel was also impacted by the previously noted sale of the correctional facility business. Wholesale declined 2.6% sequentially and 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, the first quarter of this year benefited from carrier settlements.
Our overall business segment revenue performance continued to be impacted by delayed decision-making by enterprise customers in the current environment. While year-over-year comparisons this quarter were affected by the pandemic-related surge in voice services last year, we are seeing stabilization in sequential trends.
Moving to business segment revenues by product categories. Compute and application services for the enterprise channels grew sequentially and was flat year-over-year. We expect compute and application services, which includes cloud edge and our newer Lumen platform offerings, to provide additional growth with increased market traction.
IP and data services for enterprise channels declined both sequentially and year-over-year as increased demand for IP and work-from-home solutions were offset by continued delayed decision-making for enterprise hybrid network deployments.
Fiber infrastructure services for enterprise channels grew year-over-year. Sequential performance was impacted by strength in nonrecurring revenues for equipment and professional services in our mid-market channel last quarter.
Voice and other services in the wholesale channel continue to be managed for cash, with legacy voice declines in line with our expectations, but year-over-year comparisons were impacted by higher COVID-related usage in the year ago quarter that I just mentioned. As with the first quarter, market conditions in the second quarter remained challenging.
As Jeff mentioned, we are not pleased with our revenue performance year-to-date, and have a solid plan to improve our revenue trajectory as the economy reopens and our new initiatives take hold.
Turning to mass markets, second quarter 2021 revenue declined 2.2% sequentially. During the quarter, we added 31,000 Quantum Fiber customers, reaching a total of 746,000. Our mass markets fiber broadband revenue grew 30% year-over-year this quarter. Fiber-based broadband revenue now represents 17% of mass market's broadband revenues compared to 13% in the year ago quarter.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA. For the second quarter of 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $2.109 billion compared to $2.135 billion in the year ago quarter. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, growing 170 basis points year-over-year to 42.8%. As we continue to direct incremental operating expense investments towards key growth areas of the company, we were able to more than offset those investments with our ongoing focus on operational transformation savings.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2021 were $646 million. As we have mentioned, a significant portion of our capital is success based. And with the lengthening sales cycles, we were able to calibrate our capital spending to the current environment.
As previously mentioned, we have adjusted our CapEx expectations lower for the full year, with an expectation that the second half spending will be higher than the first half as we start to ramp our mass market investments, and business decision-making accelerates.
In the second quarter of 2021, the company generated free cash flow of $1.044 billion, and we have adjusted our full year 2021 guidance for free cash flow as a result of lower capital spending year-to-date.
During the second quarter, we continued to make progress on our deleveraging initiatives by reducing net debt by more than $700 million. We issued $1 billion of lower coupon debt during the second quarter to refinance more than $1.2 billion of debt. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced net debt by $2.3 billion.
Moving to the financial outlook for 2021. Other than the previously mentioned capital expenditures and resulting free cash flow changes, all other guidance metrics remain unchanged. We remain confident in our adjusted EBITDA target of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion.
Moving on to our announced transactions, both today with Apollo for part of our ILEC footprint and last week with Stonepeak for our LATAM business, I would like to provide you with some high-level financial impacts that should help inform your modeling as you look past the expected closings in 2022.
With respect to the LATAM divestiture, we estimate our 2020 revenue related to the transaction at approximately $800 million; estimated adjusted EBITDA, a little over $300 million and capital expenditures of about $200 million. The estimated adjusted EBITDA includes costs to operate the business on a stand-alone basis and also elimination of noncash revenues and resulting EBITDA consistent with the proposed sale. These impacts predominantly affect our IGAM channel.
In terms of the ILEC transaction, we estimate our 2020 revenue related to the divested assets at approximately $2.5 billion; estimated adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion; and CapEx of about $400 million, excluding CAF. Similar to LATAM, these estimates include revenue and costs to operate the business on a stand-alone basis.
As far as revenue associated with this transaction, about 70% of the revenue is mass markets, and the remainder roughly split between wholesale and enterprise channels.
In terms of the product mix, about 50% of the revenue is for voice and other product category, and the remainder are largely mass market broadband revenues. As with any carve-out, we do expect some dissynergies, but we are also confident that we can address those with our focus on cost transformation initiatives. 
Upon the closing of both transactions, Lumen's NOLs will be substantially utilized, and we will become a cash taxpayer. As Jeff mentioned, we will manage our debt profile to ensure that the transactions are leverage-neutral. And our long-term target leverage of 2.75 to 3.25 net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged.
In summary, we have made significant progress this quarter in optimizing our business with a clear focus on positioning Lumen to capitalize on the growth opportunities. We expect business segment trends to improve, driven by our Lumen platform initiatives as enterprise decision-making accelerates. And we are very excited about the investment and growth opportunity in our mass markets fiber business.
With that, we'll open it up for your questions."

Now they're not the entire states. We're selling just the ILEC operations in those states. So we will retain the CLEC networks and the IXC networks in those states. So it's about 20 states. And the transaction includes, not only our mass markets revenue but also think about it as ILEC access revenue for wholesale and enterprise. So roughly $2.5 billion of revenue and $1.4 billion of EBITDA.
In terms of the growth profile you mentioned, 50% of that revenue is voice and other. So that revenue is declining similar to kind of the rest of the portfolio for mass markets in terms of voice and other. But in terms of mix, only, call it, less than 10% of our fiber revenues are in that area because that area is largely rural, if you will.
Another data point that kind of highlights that is about 60% of our CAF subsidy, CAF II subsidy and about 60% of our CAF II units are in the footprint that we're selling. And so -- but broadband revenues in those states have been relatively stable because of the competitive landscape today. We think that's going to change going forward. But at a high level, that's the summary in terms of mix and the footprint."

We are buying back -- or we intend to buy back shares, so that's one thing to keep in mind. Jeff also mentioned, we continue to rationalize the portfolio. So we'll be active on that front.
And then in terms of incremental growth capital, it's a timing and scaling question. We do want to ramp up, but we also want to ramp up in a responsible way where we don't have stranded capital, that we're driving penetration where we're investing. And so there's a set of variables that we're working through.

We saw the slowdown in the first part of the first quarter. We've seen sequential improvement since then. That's a true statement. And we are -- we're seeing sequential improvement in sales.
But the Delta variant is here. Our customers are beginning to change the way that they're coming back to work. We're doing that ourselves in response to some of the challenges that are out there. And so we have confidence that the sales cycles will improve and that we'll return to the sales expectations that we have. But there are still a number of factors we're seeing the evidence, but there's still a number of factors that could work against us in that.
With respect to the CapEx, that is actually tied to your first question more than it's tied to deal flow. When we see a slowdown in sales cycles and purchasing cycles, we don't spend as much capital. Our capital is highly correlated to our growth. And so we haven't spent as much capital in the first couple of quarters as we thought. Now we expect all that to improve. So we expect higher capital utilization in the second half of the year as we continue to improve in sales and continue to drive revenue growth through the business.
And then the last question with respect to buybacks, and is that tied to the deal closing? The answer is no. That is not tied to the deal closing. That's tied to -- our Board has authorized $1 billion worth of repurchases, and that's tied to us evaluating the market and being opportunistic about the timing."

In essence, if you look at the deal timing, it's first half of the year next year for the LATAM sale, second half for the ILEC asset sale. We're hoping the ILEC asset sale is 12 months but it could be longer. So there is a fair amount of uncertainty -- not uncertainty, just the timing associated with all the approvals, et cetera.
And like I mentioned, there is a series of variables between now and then in terms of us -- our capitalization of the company going forward, the growth capital, et cetera, et cetera. So we think it's a little premature to kind of declare. It's something that Jeff and the Board are going to be very thoughtful about. But we also thought the math that you're doing is the math everybody is going to do, and there is going to be some trade-off between growth capital and how we allocate between growth capital and the dividend. And -- but it's not something we need to decide on today.
In terms of your question on the NOL, again, a lot of variables there. One is depending on deal timing, there's taxable income that we have in the core business. Then there's the tax regulation at the time when we close the deal, so that's another variable. But not -- I would say that we know, given our NOL balance, these assets have a low tax basis. And so we would be using up all of the NOL. And we'll have some cash taxes on top of that by the time we get to closing the deals and will become a cash tax payer after that."

I said to you a couple of years ago that we were open-minded, that we wanted to do smart decisions for our shareholders, good returns on any investments we made and the divestitures we did that we wanted to do the smart thing. That's what we've done.
We've been working with Apollo. We realized that they are the right partner to do this with, and now is the right time to do it with them. I think that they will invest heavily in these markets to help those markets grow and generate a great business for them. We will work with them closely. They're going to be a key provider to us as we continue to serve our Lumen customers in the 20 states that -- over the ILEC assets that they're going to be operating, so we'll continue to work with them. But we said we were going to be smart. We said we were going to be open-minded. And now we have these 2 transactions to show for that effort.
With respect to -- is that an ongoing position? Absolutely. We will always try and be smart and open-minded about the assets that we have and how do we use those assets to generate the maximum shareholder value. And so we will continue to be open-minded. We'll continue to look forward toward acquisitions, toward divestitures, whatever makes sense for us as we continue to evolve our business.
And that a little bit ties into your third question about amplifying growth on the business side. We have talked a lot about our Lumen platform. We think that is a growth amplifier on the Enterprise side. We've talked a lot about edge cloud and edge computing and the capabilities that we're delivering to our customers. We've talked about the partnerships that we've established with companies like Zoom, with VMware, with IBM, with a variety of other key industry leaders where we can partner with them to bring their capabilities to our customers and our capabilities to their customers via the Lumen platform.
So those are some of the things that we've been doing and will continue to do to amplify, to use your words, the growth from our enterprise customers as well as penetrating buildings more effectively, continuing to light new buildings, all of those things that we do just as a regular course of our business."

And then there was a lot of kind of corporately allocated overhead costs. Is the way that you're kind of getting to the EBITDA numbers for the divested properties, is this a function of the NSA that you talked about striking with, I guess, both counterparties, Neel, and do you expect them to kind of fully reimburse you for what you would have been allocating to these entities so you're kind of net neutral? And how has that NSA actually been nailed down?
And I guess the second question was, Jeff, you mentioned kind of cash flow dilution. If I kind of just try to add up the numbers, the Latin American piece is a negative $100 million in EBITDA minus CapEx, and it's $1.1 billion for the ILEC, that's $1.2 billion. We're going to tax effect it because you're going to become a full taxpayer, so that's like maybe negative $800 million. Then you're going to be a full cash taxpayer, that's maybe going to be another $700 million, that's about $1.5 billion. You're going to lose CAF II, that's about $100 million, that's $1.6 billion. You're going to save some money from the debt, right, so let's say $10 billion of cash, 5% interest, after taxes of $350 million. So maybe a negative $1.250 billion kind of on a pro forma basis. Are there other things, other moving parts, Neel, that we need to be thinking about, like, as we try to model out what a 2023 Lumen looks like under these kind of constructs?"

And in terms of the math that you're doing. Yes, those are the numbers that we provided. Obviously, like I mentioned a couple of times before, you have to make some assumptions in terms of the capitalization of the company going forward. And keep in mind, there's also CapEx for CAF II that's going to fall off. So over the last 3 years or so, we've been averaging $300 million or so. So that will fall off as well.

And so Lumen is doing the exact same thing.
We invest in fiber, and we'll intend to grow the penetration of broadband services for customers, high-speed broadband services. It's part of what our investment thesis is. It's part of what we think is good for the communities that we serve. And so we will continue to work with government to make sure that we participate in any programs that they have to ensure that this digital divide is conquered. But it's part of what we want to accomplish as we invest moving forward.
And if you look at our footprint of the remaining states, and we've already said it a couple of times, 70% are urban or suburban. That gives us a great opportunity. We have a high percentage of MDUs, multiple dwelling units. So that gives us a great opportunity to bring broadband to a very wide footprint of our customers.
So with that, thank you for the questions, and I'll wrap up briefly. And I appreciate everybody getting on the call with very short notice. We're excited about the 2 transactions we've announced. Our overall company profile is rapidly changing as we invest in the business and continue to rationalize the portfolio at 5.5x on the ILEC business and on the adjusted EBITDA in the LATAM business, we believe the valuations highlight and support our view of the sum of the parts for the remaining business.
We're pleased with the valuations, but we've also done these transactions to drive investment and operational focus within the remaining business. With a strong balance sheet, we continue to invest in growth and return cash to shareholders through dividend and share buybacks. And I'm very pleased -- I want to make this point. I'm very pleased with the transformation that we have achieved over the past few years and look forward to the growth opportunities that we see in front of us.

On today's call, I'll provide a few thoughts on our third quarter results, an update on our recently announced transactions, a review of our key capital allocation priorities and outline our investment plans as we continue to position the company for long-term sustainable revenue growth. I'll then ask Neel to discuss the third quarter in more detail. And of course, we'll reserve time at the end for your questions.
We're pleased with our third quarter sequential revenue progression. In fact, we showed sequential growth in both IGAM and large enterprise, showing the resilience of our business as COVID-related headwinds begin to diminish. We're also pleased with the continuation of the strong sales we saw in the second quarter and our growing funnel, which should provide a strong foundation as we drive toward growth. Overall, it's an exciting time for women as we continue evolving and transforming the company for long-term growth. Our Lumen platform continues to resonate with customers and is the cornerstone of our digital transformation for enterprises. In addition, I believe our Quantum Fiber platform is unique in the market, and not only drives an enhanced customer experience, but also drives revenue growth and even lowers the operating cost for our mass market segment, improving the profitability and sustainability of the business.
I'm excited to discuss the investments we're making to drive enterprise and Quantum Fiber growth, but let me start with an update on our previously announced transactions. Both the sale of our 20 ILEC states and our LATAM business are important steps to positioning our company for the long term. Those transactions materially change the mix of our business operations, which will amplify and accelerate the positive outcomes for our focused investments in our retained markets. Both transactions were executed with strong valuations, which we believe validates a much higher value for our retained portfolio of assets. Worth more than $10 billion collectively, we're making excellent progress toward closing both deals. We currently expect the LATAM transaction with Stonepeak to close during the first half of 2022, and believe the Apollo transaction will close in the second half of 2022.
After considering the transfer of our BART debt to Apollo, pension and OPEB liabilities, tax and other transaction adjustments, we estimate that we will receive approximately $7 billion in combined net proceeds from the deal. Looking beyond the transaction. If you turn to Slide 4 in our investor presentation, you can see our top 5 priorities for putting to work the significant free cash flow we generate and the proceeds from these transactions. As this slide illustrates, investing in growth is always our highest priority, and we're very excited about what we see as high return, high confidence opportunities to invest in both enterprise and Quantum Fiber growth.
Let me start with Quantum Fiber. First of all, the Quantum acceleration plan has already begun. On our last earnings call, I highlighted the attractiveness of our mass market assets in the 16 states we will retain after the sale to Apollo, and noted that approximately 70% of our footprint or about 15 million locations will be in urban and suburban areas. The majority of which are economically attractive for our Quantum expansion. Our Quantum Fiber initiatives continue to deliver, growing third quarter revenue 25% year-over-year. As we transition from micro targeting to a broader market approach for deployment, we have high confidence in our ability to drive significant revenue growth for years to come.
As I mentioned during the second quarter call, we plan to accelerate Quantum Fiber investments in our retained markets. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 2.5 million enabled locations within the retained 16 states. Historically, we've enabled around 400,000 locations per year, and we expect that pace will continue in the fourth quarter. As we accelerate our investment in Quantum Fiber, in 2022, we expect to ramp that enablement pace to over 1 million new locations on our way to hitting a run rate of 1.5 million to 2 million enablements per year as we exit 2022.
When deploying Quantum Fiber, we typically expect penetration rates of 40% or better with average build cost of less than $1,000 per location enabled. After a thorough review of our footprint and given these economics, we expect our total addressable opportunity to be more than 12 million locations. Our Quantum Fiber plan for 2022 is fully funded and we're very excited about these investments. But it's not just excitement born from hope. It's excitement born from experience and accomplishment. As we built Quantum Fiber, we've done more than simply construct new fiber. We built an excellent Quantum experience and product capability that is now ready to ramp aggressively, providing higher ARPU, low return and greater customer lifetime value.
Over the past couple of years, we have executed a successful fiber deployment program using a deliberate and micro-targeted approach. This approach has enhanced, improved in our capabilities, and we are positioned to execute on our much more aggressive plan. Our custom algorithms predict the cost to build and likely penetration levels for our fiber enablement opportunities, maximizing the efficiency of our capital spend. Our experienced and actively engaged workforce is already ramping for our accelerated Quantum Fiber build plan, and we are confident in our employees' ability to deliver on our plan.
We know supply chain is a major topic currently. So let me address that head on. We've been in close communication with our diverse and reliable supplier base and have commitments from them on their ability to deliver. However, we take nothing for granted, and this is an area where we will continue to closely monitor.
Moving to our Enterprise business. Rest assured, this much larger segment of Lumen is equally exciting for us and we will continue to invest aggressively in our edge compute and storage platforms, our managed service offerings and our security products as well as continuing to automate and improve our customers' digital experience across many of the core networking services. With our extensive long-haul and dense metro infrastructure, our network provides low latency, ultra-high capacity, resilience and cost advantages over many of our competitors. We have a robust and extensive fiber footprint for enterprises, and that allows us to continue to focus our capital investment on our platform experience, higher penetration in existing buildings, new product offerings and when driven by customer opportunities, success-based fiber expansion.
A few examples of recent wins in our business segment demonstrate the diversity of our customers and the need for our services across virtually all industries. These wins include a cloud TV enabler, an independent renewable energy, clean technology provider and a hyperscaler. All of this is in addition to our recently announced network modernization contract for the U.S. Postal Service. There is strong demand for the enterprise services we enable, and we continually evolve our product portfolio to leverage our robust fiber network and provide services our customers need to drive success in their businesses.
We believe our growth investments, coupled with our streamlined post divestiture portfolio will create tremendous value for our shareholders. The transactions will improve our revenue quality from day 1 and allow for focused investment, targeting our most strategic, highest ROI opportunities. We believe there are attractive opportunities to put new capital to work driving revenue growth and with returns well above our cost of capital. You've heard me say this before, we will invest for growth and grow where we invest.
Another key priority for Lumen is the importance we place on returning cash to shareholders. Therefore, we have no plans to modify our dividend, which we believe is sustainable at the $1 per share level. Although our payout ratio will likely rise in the near term, as we streamline our asset portfolio and invest in the Quantum and enterprise opportunities, we expect our focused operations to provide the underpinnings for top line growth in 2 to 3 years, which we expect will drive a more normalized dividend payout ratio over time.
Our Board believes the return of cash in the form of a dividend is an important part of our value proposition, and we are focused on supporting our dividend even as we make the investments necessary to reach our growth objectives. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, and as you can see in Priority 3, we will manage our balance sheet to remain more or less leverage neutral over the next few years. As we accelerate our Quantum Fiber deployment plan, we do expect the time line to reach our target net leverage ratio of 2.75x to 3.25x adjusted EBITDA will be extended.
With our 2 announced transactions, I'm not just using CEO speak when I say we are open to smart optimization of our assets. We are open-minded and we'll continue to evaluate asset optimization that makes sense for our shareholders, but we've also demonstrated our discipline in driving and working for the right deal, not just a deal to get something done. There's no urgency for us to divest assets and our thoughtful approach to the ILEC sale resulted in additional years of cash flow from operations and stronger multiple received and a strong partner in Apollo as we move our business forward. We'll continue the same open-minded disciplined approach to assess further optimization, both to improve our business mix and to fund growth in our retained businesses.
Lastly, let me talk for a minute about share buybacks. As you've seen, we completed the $1 billion share buyback that we announced last quarter, reducing our share count by about 81 million shares or approximately 7% of our total shares outstanding. I'll also note, we funded this buyback largely with our third quarter '21 free cash flow. We executed this buyback quickly because we believe our shares are deeply discounted and do not reflect the significant opportunity for Lumen going forward. Our Board continues to believe this and is prepared to authorize further buybacks on short notice if we believe this presents a prudent use of our shareholders' capital.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neel to discuss our third quarter results. Neel?"

As Jeff said, we're very excited about the transformation of our company and our plans to drive future growth. Let me begin with our financial summary.For the third quarter of 2021, IDM and large enterprise",1253,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff said, we're very excited about the transformation of our company and our plans to drive future growth. Let me begin with our financial summary.
For the third quarter of 2021, IDM and large enterprise sequential revenue performance returned to growth. We again delivered solid adjusted EBITDA and expanded margins year-over-year. Cash flow remains robust, providing the flexibility to support our capital allocation priorities. With respect to capital expenditures, enterprise customer demand has been centered around existing on-net buildings and less capital-intensive higher services. We are also seeing benefits from our continued focus on capital efficiency initiatives. As a result, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion.
Note that as we transition from micro targeting to a market-based approach for Quantum Fiber, and enterprise decision-making on new network deployment accelerates, we expect capital expenditures to ramp going forward.
We remain confident in our EBITDA guidance range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. And as a result of lower capital spending and lower net cash interest expense, our new outlook for free cash flow is $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.
Turning to revenue. In the third quarter, total revenue declined 5.4% on a year-over-year basis to $4.887 billion. It is important to remember that year-over-year metrics were meaningfully affected by -COVID-related demand last year, making comparisons less relevant. From a sequential perspective, total revenue declined by 0.8%, an improvement from the 2.1% sequential rate of decline in the second quarter. Business revenue in the third quarter declined 0.4% sequentially versus a decline of 2% last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined 5.1% to $3.508 billion. Normalizing for the sale of the correctional facility business in the third quarter of last year, the decline was 4.9%.
Within our business segment, IDM revenue grew 1.5% sequentially and 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year and sequential improvement was primarily driven by increased demand for wavelengths and Dark Fibre within fiber infrastructure services. IP and data services also grew sequentially within iGame. Large enterprise grew 7.1% sequentially and declined 5.9% on a year-over-year basis. Sequential improvement was driven by strength in our federal, state, local and education businesses, while year-over-year trends were impacted by the surge in COVID-related usage last year. Mid-market enterprise declined 2.3% sequentially and 9.6% on a year-over-year basis. While sequential performance improved in third quarter, trends continue to be pressured by the delayed decision-making environment.
Year-over-year trends were also impacted by the previously noted sale of the productional facility business. Revenue within our enterprise channels now represents about 75% of our total business revenue. Despite the mid-market headwind, enterprise channel revenue was flat on a sequential basis in the third quarter of 2021. Wholesale declined 1.5% sequentially and 7% on a year-over-year basis. Compute and application services for enterprise channels declined slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. Enterprise sequential performance was impacted by the mid-market channel and year-over-year primarily by the large IDM customer disconnect we referenced in first quarter.
Computer and Application Services grew both sequentially and year-over-year for large enterprise. IP and data services for enterprise channels declined both sequentially and year-over-year due to declines in new VPN hybrid network deployments. We have however, seeing increased demand for IP on a year-over-year basis as customers transition to SD-WAN and work from home technologies. Fiber infrastructure services grew sequentially, while declining on a year-over-year basis. The sequential growth was due to Dark Fibre and wave line demand, primarily for our large customers. Year-over-year declines were largely due to timing of equipment sales within our federal business. Voice and other services and the wholesale channel declined both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, in line with our expectations as we manage these areas for cash. Keep in mind that voice comparisons continue to be impacted by higher coverage-related usage in the year ago quarter. 
Turning to mass markets. Third quarter 2021 revenue declined 1.6% sequentially. Our mass markets fiber broadband revenue grew 25% year-over-year this quarter. During the quarter, we added 28,000 Quantum Fiber customers. 
Turning to adjusted EBITDA. For the third quarter of 2021, adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, was $2.078 billion compared to $2.132 billion in the year ago quarter. In addition to $9 million for transactions and separation costs, special items this quarter included a net benefit of $40 million. SG&A benefited by $70 million from a real estate asset sale, while cost of service was negatively impacted by about $30 million from our real estate rationalization efforts.
We continue to drive healthy adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, growing 120 basis points year-over-year to 42.5%. As a reminder, our third quarter is impacted by seasonally higher utility costs. Capital expenditures for the third quarter 2021 were $690 million. As discussed earlier, we are focused on capital efficiencies, penetrating existing on-net buildings while supporting our customers' digital transformation efforts with higher layer services. In the third quarter of 2021, the company generated free cash flow of $1.072 billion, and we have increased our full year 2021 guidance for free cash flow. As a result of our reduced outlook for both capital spending and net cash interest expense.
During October 2021, we completed our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. In total, we repurchased 81 million shares reducing our annualized dividend obligation by $81 million and reducing our shares outstanding by approximately 7%. We have also reduced our gross pension obligation by approximately $1.4 billion by transferring that obligation to an insurance sponsor without materially impacting our funded status in conjunction with transferring $2.5 billion of gross pension obligations as part of our ILEC transaction. On a pro forma basis, we have reduced our gross pension obligations by approximately $3.9 billion. At this point, we don't anticipate any required pension contributions over the next few years.
Moving on to the business outlook for 2021. In addition to the previously mentioned free cash flow and capital expenditure changes, we are updating our net cash interest expense to now be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.525 billion and our noncash compensation expense to be approximately $150 million. For depreciation and amortization, we now expect a range of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion as we have removed D&A expense related to the assets held for sale. As Jeff mentioned, we will manage our debt profile to ensure that the recently announced transactions are relatively leverage neutral and our long-term net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target of 2.75 to 3.25 remains unchanged.
As you think about any coverage ratios, it is important to remember that the announced transactions reduce our exposure to legacy revenues and significantly improve the quality and durability of earnings and cash flows going forward. Moreover, a significant portion of capital investments are expected to go towards long-life fiber infrastructure with predictable returns.
In closing, our company will look very different a year from now. We have made significant progress this quarter in taking steps to optimize our asset portfolio with a clear focus on positioning Lumen to capitalize on the growing and most profitable areas of our business. We are encouraged by our sequential revenue performance this quarter and expect business trends to improve as the economy continues to reopen. With a strong balance sheet, we remain very excited about scaling our Lumen enterprise platform as well as our significant and unique Quantum Fiber opportunity.
With that, France, we are ready to open it up for your questions."

And so we're pleased with our competitive position and our ability to take share moving forward that, again, moving forward, again, nothing is ever linear, but we have high confidence in our revenue growth. And it's part of the reason you did see us go through the buyback so quickly. We absolutely believe that our business is undervalued. And I've got data points that I can point to. We've done that. We've done the -- some of the parts analysis for you before. If you look at the sale of 20 kind of out of region, small ILEC states, we sold those places we were not investing. So you would expect to be at a lower multiple than the places where we were investing. We sold those for 5.5x adjusted EBITDA. And so we think that was a very good valuation for that business. If you look at LATAM, we sold it for 9x EBITDA. And we think that's a good valuation for that business. If you look at the remain co within Lumen in the context of that, you can -- hopefully, you can see why I think we're still undervalued. Then if you couple with that, our confidence in our ability to grow, our confidence in the investments that we're making in Quantum Fiber, our confidence in the investments that we've made in edge computing, edge storage, managed services, the platform to deliver all of our core networking services, our security capabilities.

We usually have a wedge product initially and then continue to grow the relationship.
On the mid-market side, we do have a focus on new levels. But that environment has been for obvious reasons, been a little challenging. In terms of your specific to sequential improvement, I'll just underline what Jeff said, it's not going to be linear. But as Jeff highlighted, we do see the leading indicators in addition to the mix change from the transaction and the growth we see in the areas that we're investing, we feel confident that in 2 to 3 years, we'll see the top line inflation.

I guess the second question is with the coming end of CAF II, I think you guys said even though you're cutting CapEx that you're expecting to spend more on the core initiatives next year maintaining high leverage. I just want to kind of maybe talk about the elephant in the room, which is that right now, you're a 5% declining revenue company with very high leverage, cutting your CapEx and after 3 months telling us that you're after reconsidering the dividend, now you're definitely going to keep paying it and maybe even spend some more stock buybacks.

Legacy consumer versus the business that we're selling versus the business that we're keeping. We don't really look at it and certainly don't give out information on it separately. But the legacy business is performing like we've seen it perform and our team has done a really good job of managing that business for cash. And we have invested as we thought was appropriate to continue to expand our homes past. If you look at the retained 16 states at the end of the year, we'll have something like 2.6 million fiber-enabled homes. You've seen us grow our consumer and mass market business at the rate of -- I don't know, 45,000 subscribers over 100 megabits per quarter, something like 28,000, 30,000 of those on pure fiber. And so we continue to have the parts of the business where we're investing grow. And we continue to have the parts that we're not investing. We manage those for cash.
Part of the rationale behind the sale to Apollo was that they will invest more in those markets. We think there's great opportunity in them. We just weren't going to invest in them at the pace that we thought that they deserve, and we think Visa will do that and gave us a good valuation for it. And so it makes a -- it's part of our funding philosophy is how do we fund what we want to do. Our debit is to sell assets, but part of it also is to shift some of that funding obligation to somebody else. They can grow that, and we don't spend the money there.
Now we have -- I've gone through it. I can go through it again, but we have lots of sources. We have significant free cash flow that we generate, and we have opportunities to continue to rationalize parts of the business that makes sense for us and parts that don't make sense for us. But we think that we're in a very good position to do the things that you sound a little dubious about, but we think we're in a good position to do those things, and we'll continue to focus on making sure that we maintain our dividend, that we invest in growth. First and foremost, that we invest in the growth that we think we can drive, and we can maintain our dividend and we can -- but stay relatively leverage neutral. And I've not made any commitment to doing a share buyback, additional share buybacks. But I do want you to know that our Board is very prepared to authorize one if we thought that was appropriate.

And so we see that as a significant opportunity. I think the economics are fairly well understood. And so you're going to see us ramping that business, and it's a long-life asset with predictable returns.
On your comment on the 5%, you should also look at our sequential performance. So yes, we're talking about COVID last year where we had a fair amount of COVID-related demand and voice performance. So a better number to look at is sequentially, yes, we did decline with we declined 0.8% in IDM and large enterprises grew on a sequential basis. So yes, like I mentioned before, it's not going to be linear, but we are encouraged by the revenue trends we see.
And the other thing to keep in mind is the capitalization of this business is rapidly changing, and it's going to change rapidly going forward. Since the Level 3 acquisition, we paid down about $7 billion of debt. We just announced $10 billion of transaction. In the quarter, we have 7% less outstanding shares.

The -- so look, in big pictures, it's what I said in my prepared remarks, there are a lot of puts and takes. But starting with the EMBARQ debt, we're transferring $1.4 billion worth of EMBARQ debt. That's a liability that we're eliminating on the Lumen side and transferring over. So that's actually one of the proceeds of the deal is that we're using that to transfer that liability. Then there are things like pension and OPEB liabilities in there a few hundred million dollars and we have taxes and deal costs. And so we can, at some point, kind of break some of those down, but those are the big picture items, and it goes from 10.2% to 7%."

We provided debt adjustments, so that's another $100 million between pension and OPEB liabilities, that's another $300 million. So that's bulk of it. So like Jeff said, just to underline that point, that's a liability transport. And the rest of it is basically transaction costs and taxes that we incur on the transaction. Now keep in mind, these assets have very low tax basis. And if you think about, we will be using NOLs, but at the same time, we are also using NOLs for our operating income. So it depends on the timing of the deal. And so it is an estimate. The $7 billion is an estimate. The key word there is that's discretionary cash flow that we can decide on how we support our capital priorities, whether to invest in the business, pay down debt and we'll do that as we go along. So from a cash flow perspective, that's something to keep in mind.
Also keep in mind, that we are generating strong free cash flow today. So if you just look at our fourth quarter guidance based on our updated guidance, we'll generate strong free cash flow there even after factoring in the dividend. So we feel pretty good about supporting all the capital priorities that you have laid out. Nothing specific to highlight in terms of 2022. I think we've already talked about CAF. You need to make sure you factored in the capital reduction there as well. And then we'll have more to say when we provide next year's guidance. In terms of the pension liability transport, I won't get into the specifics. But like we said on the 8-K, it doesn't materially change our funded status."

Or should it be relatively consistent over the course of the project? And to confirm, is the $12 million opportunity inclusive of the fiber locations you have today? Or is that incremental to them?"

In terms of ROIs, we continue to see very good ROIs on the investment that we make on the enterprise side. And I think most folks are similar with the dynamics there. So that's -- ROI is not an issue for us. It is really managing the legacy revenues for cash that really meets the returns from our perspective.

We, first of all, invested in making sure that our cost structure is appropriate, that we can deliver a level of service with a lower cost every year to deliver that and make sure that we're improving our service quality. We've done that. We continue to invest in edge computing and edge storage. We think those are great opportunities for us. We gave you -- at the beginning of the year, we said we'd have 95% of the U.S. within 5 milliseconds of our edge facilities by the end of the year. We finished that somewhere at the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter. We actually over-exceeded in the coverage. And in the time frame, we were much faster.

An",271,"So I just wanted to follow up on the consumer business. Over the -- if we think of 2019 as sort of a baseline year. It looks like the pace of net adds in the fiber business and even in the non-fiber business on the consumer side has slowed quite a lot. And on the fiber business, that's despite increasing your addressable footprint. I'm wondering if you could just talk to the -- what you're seeing in the market in broadband? What might be sort of creating headwinds for growth there? And the reason I ask is, we're on record of saying if you can put the $10 billion into deploying fiber, it creates an incredible amount of value for you. But obviously, it's a 6- to 7-year process. You're asking investors to look many years ahead before we will see cash flow falling through from this project in a material way. And so sort of gaining confidence in your ability to drive penetration into those markets, I think, is really key to getting an appropriate multiple for what you're building here.
And then second question, if I may, Jeff. The -- you sort of -- you have conviction that the stock is worth a lot more than where it's trading at the moment, and that was reflected in the share repurchase that you guys did in the third quarter. Why not funnel all the cash that you're paying in dividends into share repurchase if it's that under value? You're obviously not getting credit for the dividend based on the yield. So why not just put it all into share repurchases?"

I'll let Neel go through some of the detailed answers, and then I'll come back with the stock price conviction and what we're doing there. If you embedded in your question about consumer is kind of, well, do you believe that the $10 billion is a good use of investment. We agree with that. I agree with that. I'm just going to go a little bit into why not do stock repurchases because we believe there are investments that are good for shareholders. But then you also kind of introduced the notion of you got to prove it, that it's good. And that's exactly what we've been doing over the last couple of years. We know that the building fiber is not the hardest thing in the world. We can build cyber. We can build fiber to a bunch of locations. But then how do you deliver the service to customers. And so we've been working on our best in business capabilities. Our Quantum Fiber capabilities to turn up customers with low touch, with a digital experience in the way that they want to have the experience, to be able to layer other capabilities on top of that. And then we wanted to prove to ourselves as we moved away from investing in bonding and vectoring and things you have not heard us talk about for several years because we stopped doing them. As we put all of our focus on fiber, we wanted to prove that we could get to the penetration rates that we expect. And we can and we have. And we give you some insights into thinking that should be 40-plus percent penetration in places where we've been marketing for a period of time. And so we've done exactly what some of your question implied, which is prove that you can do this and prove that you have the capabilities and build those capabilities so that we can do it quickly, not just wait 6, 7 years to start seeing the return.
On the stock price conviction, we're absolutely convicted that the stock price is undervalued, and it's part of our capital allocation process. But that we have other aspects of the capital allocation that we want to do, too, investing in growth, investing in the Quantum Fiber business, investing in our fiber footprint for enterprises, investing in our platform and our services that we layer on top of those things and then maintaining the dividend, maintaining our leverage range. And those are, in some ways, competing uses of our capital. But to several questions that we've already answered. We think we're in a good position to deliver on all of those. We will be in a position if we -- if the Board decides that it's appropriate for us to do an additional buyback, we will act quickly and we'll do so. It may not be the same pace of buyback that we did in the last one, we were pretty aggressive about that. But we will authorize one if the Board thinks as the appropriate thing to do."

I think your question on the fundamental thesis in terms of the market and the opportunity and the symmetrical nature of fiber and how it's resonating with customers, all that we see, and we're leaning in. Our fiber net adds were a little softer this quarter than we would like. And that is primarily driven by the fact that we're going through a major pivot internally in terms of how we go to market. So like Jeff mentioned, we wanted to prove this out first. So we had a micro-targeting strategy. And we've proven it out, we've seen how it resonates with customers. We've invested in our processes and capabilities, and now we're doing the pivot to go to a more market-based approach. And that takes a little bit of time to get an organization our size to scale up to a new ecosystem. And so yes, we feel very confident that, that opportunity is something we see us creating a fair amount of value. And we're not constraining it.

On today's call, I'll provide a few thoughts on our third quarter results, an update on our recently announced transactions, a review of our key capital allocation priorities and outline our investment plans as we continue to position the company for long-term sustainable revenue growth. I'll then ask Neel to discuss the third quarter in more detail. And of course, we'll reserve time at the end for your questions.
We're pleased with our third quarter sequential revenue progression. In fact, we showed sequential growth in both IGAM and Large Enterprise, showing the resilience of our business as COVID-related headwinds begin to diminish. We're also pleased with the continuation of the strong sales we saw in the second quarter and our growing funnel, which should provide a strong foundation as we drive toward growth. 
Overall, it's an exciting time for Lumen as we continue evolving and transforming the company for long-term growth. Our Lumen platform continues to resonate with customers and is the cornerstone of our digital transformation for enterprises. In addition, I believe our Quantum Fiber platform is unique in the market and not only drives an enhanced customer experience but also drives revenue growth and even lowers the operating cost for our Mass Market segment, improving the profitability and sustainability of the business.
I'm excited to discuss the investments we're making to drive Enterprise and Quantum Fiber growth, but let me start with an update on our previously announced transactions. Both the sale of our 20 ILEC states and our LATAM business are important steps to positioning our company for the long term. Those transactions materially change the mix of our business operations, which will amplify and accelerate the positive outcomes for our focused investments in our retained markets. Both transactions were executed with strong valuations, which we believe validates a much higher value for our retained portfolio of assets. 
Worth more than $10 billion collectively, we're making excellent progress toward closing both deals. We currently expect the LATAM transaction with Stonepeak to close during the first half of 2022 and believe the Apollo transaction will close in the second half of 2022. After considering the transfer of our Embarq debt to Apollo, pension and OPEB liabilities, tax and other transaction adjustments, we estimate that we will receive approximately $7 billion in combined net proceeds from the deal.
Looking beyond the transaction. If you turn to Slide 4 in our investor presentation, you can see our top 5 priorities for putting to work the significant free cash flow we generate and the proceeds from these transactions. As this slide illustrates, investing in growth is always our highest priority, and we're very excited about what we see as high-return, high-confidence opportunities to invest in both Enterprise and Quantum Fiber growth.
Let me start with Quantum Fiber. First of all, the quantum acceleration plan has already begun. On our last earnings call, I highlighted the attractiveness of our Mass Market assets in the 16 states we will retain after the sale to Apollo and noted that approximately 70% of our footprint or about 15 million locations will be in urban and suburban areas, the majority of which are economically attractive for our quantum expansion. Our Quantum Fiber initiatives continue to deliver, growing third quarter revenue 25% year-over-year. As we transition from micro-targeting to a broader market approach for deployment, we have high confidence in our ability to drive significant revenue growth for years to come.
As I mentioned during the second quarter call, we plan to accelerate Quantum Fiber investments in our retained markets. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 2.5 million enabled locations within the retained 16 states. Historically, we've enabled around 400,000 locations per year, and we expect that pace will continue in the fourth quarter. As we accelerate our investment in Quantum Fiber, in 2022, we expect to ramp that enablement pace to over 1 million new locations, on our way to hitting a run rate of 1.5 million to 2 million enablements per year as we exit 2022. When deploying Quantum Fiber, we typically expect penetration rates of 40% or better with average build cost of less than $1,000 per location enabled. 
After a thorough review of our footprint and given these economics, we expect our total addressable opportunity to be more than 12 million locations. Our Quantum Fiber plan for 2022 is fully funded, and we're very excited about these investments. But it's not just excitement born from hope. It's excitement born from experience and accomplishment. As we built Quantum Fiber, we've done more than simply construct new fiber. We built an excellent quantum experience and product capability that is now ready to ramp aggressively, providing higher ARPU, lower churn and greater customer lifetime value.
Over the past couple of years, we have executed a successful fiber deployment program using a deliberate and micro-targeted approach. This approach has enhanced and proven our capabilities, and we are positioned to execute on our much more aggressive plan. Our custom algorithms predict the cost to build and likely penetration levels for our fiber enablement opportunities, maximizing the efficiency of our capital spend. Our experienced and actively engaged workforce is already ramping for our accelerated Quantum Fiber build plan, and we are confident in our employees' ability to deliver on our plan.
We know supply chain is a major topic currently. So let me address that head on. We've been in close communication with our diverse and reliable supplier base and have commitments from them on their ability to deliver. However, we take nothing for granted, and this is an area where we will continue to closely monitor.
Moving to our Enterprise business. Rest assured, this much larger segment of Lumen is equally exciting for us. And we will continue to invest aggressively in our edge compute and storage platforms, our managed service offerings and our security products as well as continuing to automate and improve our customers' digital experience across many of the core networking services. 
With our extensive long-haul and dense metro infrastructure, our network provides low latency, ultra-high capacity, resilience and cost advantages over many of our competitors. We have a robust and extensive fiber footprint for enterprises, and that allows us to continue to focus our capital investment on our platform experience, higher penetration in existing buildings, new product offerings and when driven by customer opportunities, success-based fiber expansion. 
A few examples of recent wins in our business segment demonstrate the diversity of our customers and the need for our services across virtually all industries. These wins include a cloud TV enabler, an independent renewable energy, clean technology provider and a hyperscaler. All of this is in addition to our recently announced network modernization contract for the U.S. Postal Service. There is strong demand for the enterprise services we enable, and we continually evolve our product portfolio to leverage our robust fiber network and provide services our customers need to drive success in their businesses.
We believe our growth investments, coupled with our streamlined post-divestiture portfolio, will create tremendous value for our shareholders. The transactions will improve our revenue quality from day 1 and allow for focused investment, targeting our most strategic, highest ROI opportunities. We believe there are attractive opportunities to put new capital to work, driving revenue growth and with returns well above our cost of capital. You've heard me say this before, we will invest for growth and grow where we invest.
Another key priority for Lumen is the importance we place on returning cash to shareholders. Therefore, we have no plans to modify our dividend, which we believe is sustainable at the $1 per share level. Although our payout ratio will likely rise in the near term, as we streamline our asset portfolio and invest in the quantum and enterprise opportunities, we expect our focused operations to provide the underpinnings for top line growth in 2 to 3 years, which we expect will drive a more normalized dividend payout ratio over time.
Our Board believes the return of cash in the form of a dividend is an important part of our value proposition, and we are focused on supporting our dividend even as we make the investments necessary to reach our growth objectives. As I mentioned in our last earnings call and as you can see in priority 3, we will manage our balance sheet to remain more or less leverage neutral over the next few years. As we accelerate our Quantum Fiber deployment plan, we do expect the time line to reach our target net leverage ratio of 2.75 to 3.25x adjusted EBITDA will be extended.
With our 2 announced transactions, I'm not just using CEO speak when I say we are open to smart optimization of our assets. We are open-minded, and we'll continue to evaluate asset optimization that makes sense for our shareholders. But we've also demonstrated our discipline in driving and working for the right deal, not just a deal to get something done. There's no urgency for us to divest assets, and our thoughtful approach to the ILEC sale resulted in additional years of cash flow from operations and stronger multiple received and a strong partner in Apollo as we move our business forward. We'll continue the same open-minded, disciplined approach to assess further optimization, both to improve our business mix and to fund growth in our retained businesses.
Lastly, let me talk for a minute about share buybacks. As you've seen, we completed the $1 billion share buyback that we announced last quarter, reducing our share count by about 81 million shares or approximately 7% of our total shares outstanding. I'll also note, we funded this buyback largely with our third quarter '21 free cash flow. We executed this buyback quickly because we believe our shares are deeply discounted and do not reflect the significant opportunity for Lumen going forward. Our Board continues to believe this and is prepared to authorize further buybacks on short notice if we believe this presents a prudent use of our shareholders' capital.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neel to discuss our third quarter results. Neel?"

For the third quarter of 2021, IGAM and Large Enterprise sequential revenue performance returned to growth. We again delivered solid adjusted EBITDA and expanded margins year-over-year. Cash flow remains robust, providing the flexibility to support our capital allocation priorities.
With respect to capital expenditures, enterprise customer demand has been centered around existing on-net buildings and less capital-intensive higher-layer services. We are also seeing benefits from our continued focus on capital efficiency initiatives. As a result, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Note that as we transition from micro-targeting to a market-based approach for Quantum Fiber and enterprise decision-making on new network deployment accelerates, we expect capital expenditures to ramp going forward.
We remain confident in our EBITDA guidance range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. And as a result of lower capital spending and lower net cash interest expense, our new outlook for free cash flow is $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.
Turning to revenue. In the third quarter, total revenue declined 5.4% on a year-over-year basis to $4.887 billion. It is important to remember that year-over-year metrics were meaningfully affected by COVID-related demand last year, making comparisons less relevant. From a sequential perspective, total revenue declined by 0.8%, an improvement from the 2.1% sequential rate of decline in the second quarter. Business revenue in the third quarter declined 0.4% sequentially versus a decline of 2% last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined 5.1% to $3.508 billion. Normalizing for the sale of the correctional facility business in the third quarter of last year, the decline was 4.9%.
Within our Business segment, IGAM revenue grew 1.5% sequentially and 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year and sequential improvement was primarily driven by increased demand for wavelengths and Dark Fibre within fiber infrastructure services. IP and data services also grew sequentially within IGAM. 
Large Enterprise grew 0.1% sequentially and declined 5.9% on a year-over-year basis. Sequential improvement was driven by strength in our federal, state, local and education businesses, while year-over-year trends were impacted by the surge in COVID-related usage last year. 
Mid-Market Enterprise declined 2.3% sequentially and 9.6% on a year-over-year basis. While sequential performance improved in third quarter, trends continue to be pressured by the delayed decision-making environment. Year-over-year trends were also impacted by the previously noted sale of the correctional facility business. 
Revenue within our enterprise channels now represents about 75% of our total Business revenue. Despite the mid-market headwind, enterprise channel revenue was flat on a sequential basis in the third quarter of 2021. Wholesale declined 1.5% sequentially and 7% on a year-over-year basis. 
Compute and application services for enterprise channels declined slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. Enterprise sequential performance was impacted by the mid-market channel and year-over-year primarily by the large IGAM customer disconnect we referenced in first quarter. Compute and application services grew both sequentially and year-over-year for Large Enterprise. 
IP and data services for enterprise channels declined both sequentially and year-over-year due to declines in new VPN hybrid network deployments. We have, however, seen increased demand for IP on a year-over-year basis as customers transition to SD-WAN and work-from-home technologies. 
Fiber infrastructure services grew sequentially while declining on a year-over-year basis. The sequential growth was due to Dark Fibre and wavelength demand, primarily for our large customers. Year-over-year declines were largely due to timing of equipment sales within our federal business. 
Voice and other services and the wholesale channel declined both sequentially and on year-over-year basis, in line with our expectations as we manage these areas for cash. Keep in mind that voice comparisons continue to be impacted by higher COVID-related usage in the year ago quarter.
Turning to Mass Markets. Third quarter 2021 revenue declined 1.6% sequentially. Our Mass Markets fiber broadband revenue grew 25% year-over-year this quarter. During the quarter, we added 28,000 Quantum Fiber customers.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA. For the third quarter of 2021, adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, was $2.078 billion compared to $2.132 billion in the year ago quarter. In addition to $9 million for transactions and separation costs, special items this quarter included a net benefit of $40 million. SG&A benefited by $70 million from a real estate asset sale, while cost of service was negatively impacted by about $30 million from our real estate rationalization efforts.
We continue to drive healthy adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, growing 120 basis points year-over-year to 42.5%. As a reminder, our third quarter is impacted by seasonally higher utility costs. 
Capital expenditures for the third quarter 2021 were $690 million. As discussed earlier, we are focused on capital efficiencies, penetrating existing on-net buildings while supporting our customers' digital transformation efforts with higher layer services. 
In the third quarter of 2021, the company generated free cash flow of $1.072 billion. And we have increased our full year 2021 guidance for free cash flow as a result of our reduced outlook for both capital spending and net cash interest expense.
During October 2021, we completed our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. In total, we repurchased 81 million shares, reducing our annualized dividend obligation by $81 million and reducing our shares outstanding by approximately 7%. 
We have also reduced our gross pension obligation by approximately $1.4 billion by transferring that obligation to an insurance sponsor without materially impacting our funded status in conjunction with transferring $2.5 billion of gross pension obligations as part of our ILEC transaction. On a pro forma basis, we have reduced our gross pension obligations by approximately $3.9 billion. At this point, we don't anticipate any required pension contributions over the next few years.
Moving on to the business outlook for 2021. In addition to the previously mentioned free cash flow and capital expenditure changes, we are updating our net cash interest expense to now be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.525 billion and our noncash compensation expense to be approximately $150 million. For depreciation and amortization, we now expect a range of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion as we have removed D&A expense related to the assets held for sale. As Jeff mentioned, we will manage our debt profile to ensure that the recently announced transactions are relatively leverage neutral, and our long-term net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target of 2.75 to 3.25 remains unchanged.
As you think about any coverage ratios, it is important to remember that the announced transactions reduce our exposure to legacy revenues and significantly improve the quality and durability of earnings and cash flows going forward. Moreover, a significant portion of capital investments are expected to go towards long-life fiber infrastructure with predictable returns.
In closing, our company will look very different a year from now. We have made significant progress this quarter in taking steps to optimize our asset portfolio with a clear focus on positioning Lumen to capitalize on the growing and most profitable areas of our business. We are encouraged by our sequential revenue performance this quarter and expect business trends to improve as the economy continues to reopen. With a strong balance sheet, we remain very excited about scaling our Lumen Enterprise platform as well as our significant and unique Quantum Fiber opportunity.
With that, France, we are ready to open it up for your questions."

And I think the assumption a lot of investors had is that inevitably would mean a very meaningful uplift in investment and as a result, might change the way you would approach the dividend. 
If I listen to the comments you laid out for us today, I think maybe the interpretation has evolved a little bit or been improved. And I think that what you're saying is you're comfortable keeping your balance sheet at its current level of leverage in order to fund your entire capital allocation program, be that dividend, potentially buybacks as well as the CapEx program, and if not, as if the balance sheet is specifically funding any one of those things but the collection of those things combined.

If you listen to our comments or prepared comments, we noted that our 2022 plan is fully funded. And while it's way too premature to talk about things beyond that, there are a number of levers that we have. We've been improving our capital efficiency. You saw that in this year's results, we'll continue to look at nonstrategic assets that we can divest, if that makes sense. 
And our capital spend is evolving. We're not necessarily spending on certain capabilities where the heavy lifting is already behind us. So a lot of our transformation capabilities and other things. And so there are a number of levers that we believe that the 5 key priorities that I outlined earlier and that are in the investor presentation are the key things for our business, and we think we have the funds to do them all."

Nothing is ever linear, and it's lumpy sometimes in our business. There's seasonality. There are other factors that go into it. But if you look at IGAM, our International and GAM business, and our Large Enterprise, they were particularly strong. And so we're pleased with the momentum that we've seen. 
The funnel has been building since about midway through the first quarter. So we've seen the funnel return to our prepandemic levels. We continue to augment our products and capabilities. We believe the fiber infrastructure we have is a unique value proposition, brings unique value proposition to our customers. And so we're pleased with our competitive position and our ability to take share moving forward that -- again, moving forward. Again, nothing is ever linear, but we have high confidence in our revenue growth. 
And it's part of the reason you did see us go through the buyback so quickly. We absolutely believe that our business is undervalued. And I've got data points that I can point to. We've done the -- we've done the -- some of the parts analysis for you before. If you look at the sale of 20 kind of out-of-region, small ILEC states, we sold those places we were not investing. So you would expect to be at a lower multiple than the places where we were investing. We sold those for 5.5x adjusted EBITDA. And so we think that was a very good valuation for that business. If you look at LATAM, we sold it for 9x EBITDA. And we think that's a good valuation for that business. If you look at the remainco within Lumen in the context of that, you can -- hopefully, you can see why I think we're still undervalued. 
Then if you couple with that our confidence in our ability to grow, our confidence in the investments that we're making in Quantum Fiber, our confidence in the investments that we've made in edge computing, edge storage, managed services, the platform to deliver all of our core networking services, our security capabilities, if you look at those things combined together, you can see why we've decided it was good to be aggressive in the pace of buyback."

We usually have a wedge product initially and then continue to grow the relationship. On the mid-market side, we do have a focus on new logos. But that environment has been, for obvious reasons, been a little challenging. 
In terms of your -- specific to sequential improvement, I'll just underline what Jeff said. It's not going to be linear.

I guess the second question is with the coming end of CAF II, I think you guys said even though you're cutting CapEx that you're expecting to spend more on the core initiatives next year, maintaining high leverage. I just want to kind of maybe talk about the elephant in the room, which is that right now, you're a 5% declining revenue company with very high leverage, cutting your CapEx and after 3 months telling us that you're -- after reconsidering the dividend, now you're definitely going to keep paying it and maybe even spend some more on stock buybacks.

But the legacy business is performing like we've seen it perform, and our team has done a really good job of managing that business for cash. And we have invested as we thought was appropriate to continue to expand our homes passed. 
If you look at the retained 16 states at the end of the year, we'll have something like 2.6 million fiber-enabled homes. You've seen us grow our Consumer and Mass Market business at the rate of, I don't know, 45,000 subscribers over 100 megabits per quarter, something like 28,000, 30,000 of those on pure fiber.

Part of the rationale behind the sale to Apollo was that they will invest more in those markets. We think there's great opportunity in them. We just weren't going to invest in them at the pace that we thought that they deserve, and we think that Apollo will do that and gave us a good valuation for it. And so it makes part -- it's part of our funding philosophy, is how do we fund what we want to do. Part of it is to sell assets, but part of it also is to shift some of that funding obligation to somebody else. They can grow that, and we don't spend the money there.
Now we have -- I've gone through it. I can go through it again. But we have lots of sources -- we have significant free cash flow that we generate, and we have opportunities to continue to rationalize parts of the business that makes sense for us and parts that don't make sense for us. But we think that we're in a very good position to do the things that you sound a little dubious about, but we think we're in a good position to do those things. 
And we'll continue to focus on making sure that we maintain our dividend, that we invest in growth -- first and foremost, that we invest in the growth that we think we can drive, and we can maintain our dividend, and we can -- but stay relatively leverage neutral. And I've not made any commitment to doing a share buyback, additional share buybacks, but I do want you to know that our Board is very prepared to authorize one if we thought that was appropriate. 
And Neel, I don't know if you want to add to that."

And so we see that as a significant opportunity. I think the economics are fairly well understood. And so you're going to see us ramping that business, and it's a long-life asset with predictable returns.
On your comment on the 5%, you should also look at our sequential performance. So yes, we're talking about COVID last year where we had a fair amount of COVID-related demand and voice performance. So a better number to look at is sequentially, yes, we did decline. We declined 0.8% in IGAM and Large Enterprise grew on a sequential basis. So yes, like I mentioned before, it's not going to be linear, but we are encouraged by the revenue trends we see.
And the other thing to keep in mind is the capitalization of this business is rapidly changing, and it's going to change rapidly going forward. Since the Level 3 acquisition, we paid down about $7 billion of debt. We just announced $10 billion of transaction. In the quarter, we have 7% less outstanding shares. So yes, we'll continue to transform the business and try to support the capital priorities that Jeff laid out."

But starting with the Embarq debt, we're transferring $1.4 billion worth of Embarq debt. That's a liability that we're eliminating on the Lumen side and transferring over. 
So that's actually one of the proceeds of the deal, is that we're using that to transfer that liability. Then there are things like pension and OPEB liabilities in there, a few hundred million dollars. And we have taxes and deal costs. And so we can, at some point, kind of break some of those down. But those are the big picture items, and it goes from $10.2 billion to $7 billion."

So really look through it. So there's $1.4 billion of Embarq debt. We provided debt adjustments. So that's another $100 million. Between pension and OPEB liabilities, that's another $300 million. So that's bulk of it. So like Jeff said, just to underline that point, that's a liability transfer. And the rest of it is basically transaction costs and taxes that we incur on the transaction.
Now keep in mind, these assets have very low tax basis. If you think about it, we will be using NOLs, but at the same time, we are also using NOLs for our operating income. So it depends on the timing of the deal. And so it is an estimate. The $7 billion is an estimate. 
The keyword there is that's discretionary cash flow that we can decide on how we support our capital priorities, whether to invest in the business, pay down debt. And we'll do that as we go along. So from a cash flow perspective, that's something to keep in mind.
Also keep in mind that we are generating strong free cash flow today. So if you just look at our fourth quarter guidance based on our updated guidance, we'll generate strong free cash flow there even after factoring in the dividend. So we feel pretty good about supporting all the capital priorities that you have laid out. 
Nothing specific to highlight in terms of 2022. I think we've already talked about CAF. You need to make sure you factored in the capital reduction there as well. And then we'll have more to say when we provide next year's guidance. 
In terms of the pension liability transport, I won't get into the specifics. But like we said on the 8-K, it doesn't materially change our funded status."

In terms of ROIs, we continue to see very good ROIs on the investment that we make on the Enterprise side. And I think the consumer, most folks are familiar with the dynamics there. So that's -- ROI is not an issue for us. It is really managing the legacy revenues for cash that really meets the returns, if you will, from our perspective.

Those are real numbers that we see benefit from. And if you look at what we've been investing in on the Enterprise side, it's been pretty significant. 
We, first of all, invested in making sure that our cost structure is appropriate, that we can deliver a level of service with a lower cost every year to deliver that and make sure that we're improving our service quality. We've done that. We continue to invest in edge computing and edge storage. We think those are great opportunities for us. 
We gave you -- at the beginning of the year, we said we'd have 95% of the U.S. within 5 milliseconds of our edge facilities by the end of the year. We finished that somewhere at the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter. We actually over-exceeded in the coverage and in the time frame, we were much faster, and then in the cost to deliver.

Over the -- if we think of 2019 as sort of a baseline year, it looks like the pace of net adds in the fiber business and even in the non-fiber business on the Consumer side has slowed quite a lot. An",270,"So I just wanted to follow up on the Consumer business. Over the -- if we think of 2019 as sort of a baseline year, it looks like the pace of net adds in the fiber business and even in the non-fiber business on the Consumer side has slowed quite a lot. And on the fiber business, that's despite increasing your addressable footprint. I'm wondering if you could just talk to the -- what you're seeing in the market in broadband. What might be sort of creating headwinds for growth there? 
And the reason I ask is we're on record of saying if you can put the $10 billion into deploying fiber, it creates an incredible amount of value for you. But obviously, it's a 6- to 7-year process. You're asking investors to look many years ahead before we will see cash flow falling through from this project in a material way. And so sort of gaining confidence in your ability to drive penetration into those markets, I think, is really key to getting an appropriate multiple for what you're building here.
And then second question, if I may, Jeff. The -- you sort of -- you have conviction that the stock is worth a lot more than where it's trading at the moment, and that was reflected in the share repurchase that you guys did in the third quarter. Why not funnel all the cash that you're paying in dividends into share repurchase if it's that undervalued? You're obviously not getting credit for the dividend based on the yield. So why not just put it all into share repurchases?"

I'll let Neel go through some of the detailed answers, and then I'll come back with the stock price conviction and what we're doing there. If you -- embedded in your question about Consumer is kind of, well, do you",523,"Yes. So let me take the first question. I'll let Neel go through some of the detailed answers, and then I'll come back with the stock price conviction and what we're doing there. If you -- embedded in your question about Consumer is kind of, well, do you believe that the $10 billion is a good use of investment? We agree with that. I agree with that. I'm just going to go a little bit into why not do stock repurchases because we believe there are investments that are good for shareholders. 
But then you also kind of introduced the notion of you got to prove it, that it's good. And that's exactly what we've been doing over the last couple of years. We know that the building fiber is not the hardest thing in the world. We can build fiber. We can build fiber to a bunch of locations. But then how do you deliver the service to customers? And so we've been working on our best in business capabilities, our Quantum Fiber capabilities, to turn up customers with low touch, with a digital experience in the way that they want to have the experience, to be able to layer other capabilities on top of that. 
And then we wanted to prove to ourselves as we moved away from investing in bonding and vectoring and things you have not heard us talk about for several years because we stopped doing them. As we put all of our focus on fiber, we wanted to prove that we could get to the penetration rates that we expect. And we can and we have. And we give you some insights into thinking that should be 40-plus percent penetration in places where we've been marketing for a period of time. And so we've done exactly what some of your question implied, which is prove that you can do this and prove that you have the capabilities and build those capabilities so that we can do it quickly, not just wait 6, 7 years to start seeing the return.
On the stock price conviction, we're absolutely convicted that the stock price is undervalued, and it's part of our capital allocation process but that we have other aspects of the capital allocation that we want to do, too, investing in growth, investing in the Quantum Fiber business, investing in our fiber footprint for enterprises, investing in our platform and our services that we layer on top of those things and then maintaining the dividend, maintaining our leverage range. And those are, in some ways, competing uses of our capital. But to several questions that we've already answered, we think we're in a good position to deliver on all of those. 
We will be in a position if we -- if the Board decides that it's appropriate for us to do an additional buyback. We will act quickly and we'll do so. It may not be the same pace of buyback that we did in the last one. We were pretty aggressive about that. But we will authorize one if the Board thinks that's the appropriate thing to do."

I think your question on the fundamental thesis in terms of the market and the opportunity and the symmetrical nature of fiber and how it's resonating with customers, all that we see, and we're leaning in. Our fiber net adds were a little softer this quarter than we would like. And that is primarily driven by the fact that we're going through a major pivot internally in terms of how we go to market. So like Jeff mentioned, we wanted to prove this out first. 
So we had a micro-targeting strategy. And we've proven it out. We've seen how it resonates with customers. We've invested in our processes and capabilities, and now we're doing the pivot to go to a more market-based approach. And that takes a little bit of time to get an organization our size to scale up to a new ecosystem. 
And so yes, we feel very confident that, that opportunity is something we see us creating a fair amount of value. And we're not constraining it. Like Jeff said, in terms of the priorities, there's a reason why #1 is invest to drive growth, and that's something we will prioritize."

On today's call, I'll provide a few thoughts on our third quarter results, an update on our recently announced transactions, a review of our key capital allocation priorities and outline our investment plans as we continue to position the company for long-term sustainable revenue growth. I'll then ask Neel to discuss the third quarter in more detail. And of course, we'll reserve time at the end for your questions.
We're pleased with our third quarter sequential revenue progression. In fact, we showed sequential growth in both IGAM and Large Enterprise, showing the resilience of our business as COVID-related headwinds begin to diminish. We're also pleased with the continuation of the strong sales we saw in the second quarter and our growing funnel, which should provide a strong foundation as we drive toward growth. 
Overall, it's an exciting time for Lumen as we continue evolving and transforming the company for long-term growth. Our Lumen platform continues to resonate with customers and is the cornerstone of our digital transformation for enterprises. In addition, I believe our Quantum Fiber platform is unique in the market and not only drives an enhanced customer experience but also drives revenue growth and even lowers the operating cost for our Mass Market segment, improving the profitability and sustainability of the business.
I'm excited to discuss the investments we're making to drive Enterprise and Quantum Fiber growth, but let me start with an update on our previously announced transactions. Both the sale of our 20 ILEC states and our LATAM business are important steps to positioning our company for the long term. Those transactions materially change the mix of our business operations, which will amplify and accelerate the positive outcomes for our focused investments in our retained markets. Both transactions were executed with strong valuations, which we believe validates a much higher value for our retained portfolio of assets. 
Worth more than $10 billion collectively, we're making excellent progress toward closing both deals. We currently expect the LATAM transaction with Stonepeak to close during the first half of 2022 and believe the Apollo transaction will close in the second half of 2022. After considering the transfer of our Embarq debt to Apollo, pension and OPEB liabilities, tax and other transaction adjustments, we estimate that we will receive approximately $7 billion in combined net proceeds from the deal.
Looking beyond the transaction. If you turn to Slide 4 in our investor presentation, you can see our top 5 priorities for putting to work the significant free cash flow we generate and the proceeds from these transactions. As this slide illustrates, investing in growth is always our highest priority, and we're very excited about what we see as high-return, high-confidence opportunities to invest in both Enterprise and Quantum Fiber growth.
Let me start with Quantum Fiber. First of all, the quantum acceleration plan has already begun. On our last earnings call, I highlighted the attractiveness of our Mass Market assets in the 16 states we will retain after the sale to Apollo and noted that approximately 70% of our footprint or about 15 million locations will be in urban and suburban areas, the majority of which are economically attractive for our quantum expansion. Our Quantum Fiber initiatives continue to deliver, growing third quarter revenue 25% year-over-year. As we transition from micro-targeting to a broader market approach for deployment, we have high confidence in our ability to drive significant revenue growth for years to come.
As I mentioned during the second quarter call, we plan to accelerate Quantum Fiber investments in our retained markets. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 2.5 million enabled locations within the retained 16 states. Historically, we've enabled around 400,000 locations per year, and we expect that pace will continue in the fourth quarter. As we accelerate our investment in Quantum Fiber, in 2022, we expect to ramp that enablement pace to over 1 million new locations, on our way to hitting a run rate of 1.5 million to 2 million enablements per year as we exit 2022. When deploying Quantum Fiber, we typically expect penetration rates of 40% or better with average build cost of less than $1,000 per location enabled. 
After a thorough review of our footprint and given these economics, we expect our total addressable opportunity to be more than 12 million locations. Our Quantum Fiber plan for 2022 is fully funded, and we're very excited about these investments. But it's not just excitement born from hope. It's excitement born from experience and accomplishment. As we built Quantum Fiber, we've done more than simply construct new fiber. We built an excellent quantum experience and product capability that is now ready to ramp aggressively, providing higher ARPU, lower churn and greater customer lifetime value.
Over the past couple of years, we have executed a successful fiber deployment program using a deliberate and micro-targeted approach. This approach has enhanced and proven our capabilities, and we are positioned to execute on our much more aggressive plan. Our custom algorithms predict the cost to build and likely penetration levels for our fiber enablement opportunities, maximizing the efficiency of our capital spend. Our experienced and actively engaged workforce is already ramping for our accelerated Quantum Fiber build plan, and we are confident in our employees' ability to deliver on our plan.
We know supply chain is a major topic currently. So let me address that head on. We've been in close communication with our diverse and reliable supplier base and have commitments from them on their ability to deliver. However, we take nothing for granted, and this is an area where we will continue to closely monitor.
Moving to our Enterprise business. Rest assured, this much larger segment of Lumen is equally exciting for us. And we will continue to invest aggressively in our edge compute and storage platforms, our managed service offerings and our security products as well as continuing to automate and improve our customers' digital experience across many of the core networking services. 
With our extensive long-haul and dense metro infrastructure, our network provides low latency, ultra-high capacity, resilience and cost advantages over many of our competitors. We have a robust and extensive fiber footprint for enterprises, and that allows us to continue to focus our capital investment on our platform experience, higher penetration in existing buildings, new product offerings and when driven by customer opportunities, success-based fiber expansion. 
A few examples of recent wins in our business segment demonstrate the diversity of our customers and the need for our services across virtually all industries. These wins include a cloud TV enabler, an independent renewable energy, clean technology provider and a hyperscaler. All of this is in addition to our recently announced network modernization contract for the U.S. Postal Service. There is strong demand for the enterprise services we enable, and we continually evolve our product portfolio to leverage our robust fiber network and provide services our customers need to drive success in their businesses.
We believe our growth investments, coupled with our streamlined post-divestiture portfolio, will create tremendous value for our shareholders. The transactions will improve our revenue quality from day 1 and allow for focused investment, targeting our most strategic, highest ROI opportunities. We believe there are attractive opportunities to put new capital to work, driving revenue growth and with returns well above our cost of capital. You've heard me say this before, we will invest for growth and grow where we invest.
Another key priority for Lumen is the importance we place on returning cash to shareholders. Therefore, we have no plans to modify our dividend, which we believe is sustainable at the $1 per share level. Although our payout ratio will likely rise in the near term, as we streamline our asset portfolio and invest in the quantum and enterprise opportunities, we expect our focused operations to provide the underpinnings for top line growth in 2 to 3 years, which we expect will drive a more normalized dividend payout ratio over time.
Our Board believes the return of cash in the form of a dividend is an important part of our value proposition, and we are focused on supporting our dividend even as we make the investments necessary to reach our growth objectives. As I mentioned in our last earnings call and as you can see in priority 3, we will manage our balance sheet to remain more or less leverage neutral over the next few years. As we accelerate our Quantum Fiber deployment plan, we do expect the time line to reach our target net leverage ratio of 2.75 to 3.25x adjusted EBITDA will be extended.
With our 2 announced transactions, I'm not just using CEO speak when I say we are open to smart optimization of our assets. We are open-minded, and we'll continue to evaluate asset optimization that makes sense for our shareholders. But we've also demonstrated our discipline in driving and working for the right deal, not just a deal to get something done. There's no urgency for us to divest assets, and our thoughtful approach to the ILEC sale resulted in additional years of cash flow from operations and stronger multiple received and a strong partner in Apollo as we move our business forward. We'll continue the same open-minded, disciplined approach to assess further optimization, both to improve our business mix and to fund growth in our retained businesses.
Lastly, let me talk for a minute about share buybacks. As you've seen, we completed the $1 billion share buyback that we announced last quarter, reducing our share count by about 81 million shares or approximately 7% of our total shares outstanding. I'll also note, we funded this buyback largely with our third quarter '21 free cash flow. We executed this buyback quickly because we believe our shares are deeply discounted and do not reflect the significant opportunity for Lumen going forward. Our Board continues to believe this and is prepared to authorize further buybacks on short notice if we believe this presents a prudent use of our shareholders' capital.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neel to discuss our third quarter results. Neel?"

As Jeff said, we're very excited about the transformation of our company and our plans to drive future growth. Let me begin with our financial summary.For the third quarter of 2021, IGAM and Large Enterpris",1248,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff said, we're very excited about the transformation of our company and our plans to drive future growth. Let me begin with our financial summary.
For the third quarter of 2021, IGAM and Large Enterprise sequential revenue performance returned to growth. We again delivered solid adjusted EBITDA and expanded margins year-over-year. Cash flow remains robust, providing the flexibility to support our capital allocation priorities.
With respect to capital expenditures, enterprise customer demand has been centered around existing on-net buildings and less capital-intensive higher-layer services. We are also seeing benefits from our continued focus on capital efficiency initiatives. As a result, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Note that as we transition from micro-targeting to a market-based approach for Quantum Fiber and enterprise decision-making on new network deployment accelerates, we expect capital expenditures to ramp going forward.
We remain confident in our EBITDA guidance range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. And as a result of lower capital spending and lower net cash interest expense, our new outlook for free cash flow is $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.
Turning to revenue. In the third quarter, total revenue declined 5.4% on a year-over-year basis to $4.887 billion. It is important to remember that year-over-year metrics were meaningfully affected by COVID-related demand last year, making comparisons less relevant. From a sequential perspective, total revenue declined by 0.8%, an improvement from the 2.1% sequential rate of decline in the second quarter. Business revenue in the third quarter declined 0.4% sequentially versus a decline of 2% last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined 5.1% to $3.508 billion. Normalizing for the sale of the correctional facility business in the third quarter of last year, the decline was 4.9%.
Within our Business segment, IGAM revenue grew 1.5% sequentially and 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year and sequential improvement was primarily driven by increased demand for wavelengths and Dark Fibre within fiber infrastructure services. IP and data services also grew sequentially within IGAM. 
Large Enterprise grew 0.1% sequentially and declined 5.9% on a year-over-year basis. Sequential improvement was driven by strength in our federal, state, local and education businesses, while year-over-year trends were impacted by the surge in COVID-related usage last year. 
Mid-Market Enterprise declined 2.3% sequentially and 9.6% on a year-over-year basis. While sequential performance improved in third quarter, trends continue to be pressured by the delayed decision-making environment. Year-over-year trends were also impacted by the previously noted sale of the correctional facility business. 
Revenue within our enterprise channels now represents about 75% of our total Business revenue. Despite the mid-market headwind, enterprise channel revenue was flat on a sequential basis in the third quarter of 2021. Wholesale declined 1.5% sequentially and 7% on a year-over-year basis. 
Compute and application services for enterprise channels declined slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. Enterprise sequential performance was impacted by the mid-market channel and year-over-year primarily by the large IGAM customer disconnect we referenced in first quarter. Compute and application services grew both sequentially and year-over-year for Large Enterprise. 
IP and data services for enterprise channels declined both sequentially and year-over-year due to declines in new VPN hybrid network deployments. We have, however, seen increased demand for IP on a year-over-year basis as customers transition to SD-WAN and work-from-home technologies. 
Fiber infrastructure services grew sequentially while declining on a year-over-year basis. The sequential growth was due to Dark Fibre and wavelength demand, primarily for our large customers. Year-over-year declines were largely due to timing of equipment sales within our federal business. 
Voice and other services and the wholesale channel declined both sequentially and on year-over-year basis, in line with our expectations as we manage these areas for cash. Keep in mind that voice comparisons continue to be impacted by higher COVID-related usage in the year ago quarter.
Turning to Mass Markets. Third quarter 2021 revenue declined 1.6% sequentially. Our Mass Markets fiber broadband revenue grew 25% year-over-year this quarter. During the quarter, we added 28,000 Quantum Fiber customers.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA. For the third quarter of 2021, adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, was $2.078 billion compared to $2.132 billion in the year ago quarter. In addition to $9 million for transactions and separation costs, special items this quarter included a net benefit of $40 million. SG&A benefited by $70 million from a real estate asset sale, while cost of service was negatively impacted by about $30 million from our real estate rationalization efforts.
We continue to drive healthy adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, growing 120 basis points year-over-year to 42.5%. As a reminder, our third quarter is impacted by seasonally higher utility costs. 
Capital expenditures for the third quarter 2021 were $690 million. As discussed earlier, we are focused on capital efficiencies, penetrating existing on-net buildings while supporting our customers' digital transformation efforts with higher layer services. 
In the third quarter of 2021, the company generated free cash flow of $1.072 billion. And we have increased our full year 2021 guidance for free cash flow as a result of our reduced outlook for both capital spending and net cash interest expense.
During October 2021, we completed our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. In total, we repurchased 81 million shares, reducing our annualized dividend obligation by $81 million and reducing our shares outstanding by approximately 7%. 
We have also reduced our gross pension obligation by approximately $1.4 billion by transferring that obligation to an insurance sponsor without materially impacting our funded status in conjunction with transferring $2.5 billion of gross pension obligations as part of our ILEC transaction. On a pro forma basis, we have reduced our gross pension obligations by approximately $3.9 billion. At this point, we don't anticipate any required pension contributions over the next few years.
Moving on to the business outlook for 2021. In addition to the previously mentioned free cash flow and capital expenditure changes, we are updating our net cash interest expense to now be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.525 billion and our noncash compensation expense to be approximately $150 million. For depreciation and amortization, we now expect a range of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion as we have removed D&A expense related to the assets held for sale. As Jeff mentioned, we will manage our debt profile to ensure that the recently announced transactions are relatively leverage neutral, and our long-term net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target of 2.75 to 3.25 remains unchanged.
As you think about any coverage ratios, it is important to remember that the announced transactions reduce our exposure to legacy revenues and significantly improve the quality and durability of earnings and cash flows going forward. Moreover, a significant portion of capital investments are expected to go towards long-life fiber infrastructure with predictable returns.
In closing, our company will look very different a year from now. We have made significant progress this quarter in taking steps to optimize our asset portfolio with a clear focus on positioning Lumen to capitalize on the growing and most profitable areas of our business. We are encouraged by our sequential revenue performance this quarter and expect business trends to improve as the economy continues to reopen. With a strong balance sheet, we remain very excited about scaling our Lumen Enterprise platform as well as our significant and unique Quantum Fiber opportunity.
With that, France, we are ready to open it up for your questions."

And I think the assumption a lot of investors had is that inevitably would mean a very meaningful uplift in investment and as a result, might change the way you would approach the dividend. 
If I listen to the comments you laid out for us today, I think maybe the interpretation has evolved a little bit or been improved. And I think that what you're saying is you're comfortable keeping your balance sheet at its current level of leverage in order to fund your entire capital allocation program, be that dividend, potentially buybacks as well as the CapEx program, and if not, as if the balance sheet is specifically funding any one of those things but the collection of those things combined.

You ran through the buyback really quickly, accelerating investment over time, but revenue this year didn't come through the way you expected earlier in the year. And it seems like you have a lot more confidence in the improvement in the business and is justified by the results this year or investors believing. So just help us think about what you're seeing in the business that's different than what's coming through in the results, maybe?"

There are other factors that go into it. But if",387,"Sure. Thanks, Phil. Let me start with the Enterprise sales. We're pleased with our sales momentum in the third quarter. Nothing is ever linear, and it's lumpy sometimes in our business. There's seasonality. There are other factors that go into it. But if you look at IGAM, our International and GAM business, and our Large Enterprise, they were particularly strong. And so we're pleased with the momentum that we've seen. 
The funnel has been building since about midway through the first quarter. So we've seen the funnel return to our prepandemic levels. We continue to augment our products and capabilities. We believe the fiber infrastructure we have is a unique value proposition, brings unique value proposition to our customers. And so we're pleased with our competitive position and our ability to take share moving forward that -- again, moving forward. Again, nothing is ever linear, but we have high confidence in our revenue growth. 
And it's part of the reason you did see us go through the buyback so quickly. We absolutely believe that our business is undervalued. And I've got data points that I can point to. We've done the -- we've done the -- some of the parts analysis for you before. If you look at the sale of 20 kind of out-of-region, small ILEC states, we sold those places we were not investing. So you would expect to be at a lower multiple than the places where we were investing. We sold those for 5.5x adjusted EBITDA. And so we think that was a very good valuation for that business. If you look at LATAM, we sold it for 9x EBITDA. And we think that's a good valuation for that business. If you look at the remainco within Lumen in the context of that, you can -- hopefully, you can see why I think we're still undervalued. 
Then if you couple with that our confidence in our ability to grow, our confidence in the investments that we're making in Quantum Fiber, our confidence in the investments that we've made in edge computing, edge storage, managed services, the platform to deliver all of our core networking services, our security capabilities, if you look at those things combined together, you can see why we've decided it was good to be aggressive in the pace of buyback."

We usually have a wedge product initially and then continue to grow the relationship. On the mid-market side, we do have a focus on new logos. But that environment has been, for obvious reasons, been a little challenging. 
In terms of your -- specific to sequential improvement, I'll just underline what Jeff said. It's not going to be linear. But as Jeff highlighted, we do see the leading indicators in addition to the mix change from the transaction and the growth we see in the areas that we're investing. We feel confident that in 2 to 3 years, we'll see the top line inflection.
And then you also had a question, Batya, on pricing. We're not really -- the pricing environment continues to be very healthy. We don't see any issues from that perspective, and you can see that in our margin expansion."

I guess the second question is with the coming end of CAF II, I think you guys said even though you're cutting CapEx that you're expecting to spend more on the core initiatives next year, maintaining high leverage. I just want to kind of maybe talk about the elephant in the room, which is that right now, you're a 5% declining revenue company with very high leverage, cutting your CapEx and after 3 months telling us that you're -- after reconsidering the dividend, now you're definitely going to keep paying it and maybe even spend some more on stock buybacks.

Legacy consumer versus -- the business that we're selling versus the business that we're keeping, we don't really look at it and certainly don't give out information on it separately. But the legacy business is performing like we've seen it perform, and our team has done a really good job of managing that business for cash. And we have invested as we thought was appropriate to continue to expand our homes passed. 
If you look at the retained 16 states at the end of the year, we'll have something like 2.6 million fiber-enabled homes. You've seen us grow our Consumer and Mass Market business at the rate of, I don't know, 45,000 subscribers over 100 megabits per quarter, something like 28,000, 30,000 of those on pure fiber. And so we continue to have the parts of the business where we're investing grow. And we continue to have the parts that we're not investing, we manage those for cash.
Part of the rationale behind the sale to Apollo was that they will invest more in those markets. We think there's great opportunity in them. We just weren't going to invest in them at the pace that we thought that they deserve, and we think that Apollo will do that and gave us a good valuation for it. And so it makes part -- it's part of our funding philosophy, is how do we fund what we want to do. Part of it is to sell assets, but part of it also is to shift some of that funding obligation to somebody else. They can grow that, and we don't spend the money there.
Now we have -- I've gone through it. I can go through it again. But we have lots of sources -- we have significant free cash flow that we generate, and we have opportunities to continue to rationalize parts of the business that makes sense for us and parts that don't make sense for us. But we think that we're in a very good position to do the things that you sound a little dubious about, but we think we're in a good position to do those things. 
And we'll continue to focus on making sure that we maintain our dividend, that we invest in growth -- first and foremost, that we invest in the growth that we think we can drive, and we can maintain our dividend, and we can -- but stay relatively leverage neutral. And I've not made any commitment to doing a share buyback, additional share buybacks, but I do want you to know that our Board is very prepared to authorize one if we thought that was appropriate.

On your comment on the 5%, you should also look at our sequential performance. So yes, we're talking about COVID last year where we had a fair amount of COVID-related demand and voice performance. So a better number to look at is sequentially, yes, we did decline. We declined 0.8% in IGAM and Large Enterprise grew on a sequential basis. So yes, like I mentioned before, it's not going to be linear, but we are encouraged by the revenue trends we see.
And the other thing to keep in mind is the capitalization of this business is rapidly changing, and it's going to change rapidly going forward. Since the Level 3 acquisition, we paid down about $7 billion of debt. We just announced $10 billion of transaction. In the quarter, we have 7% less outstanding shares.

But starting with the Embarq debt, we're transferring $1.4 billion worth of Embarq debt. That's a liability that we're eliminating on the Lumen side and transferring over. 
So that's actually one of the proceeds of the deal, is that we're using that to transfer that liability. Then there are things like pension and OPEB liabilities in there, a few hundred million dollars. And we have taxes and deal costs. And so we can, at some point, kind of break some of those down.

So that's bulk of it. So like Jeff said, just to underline that point, that's a liability transfer. And the rest of it is basically transaction costs and taxes that we incur on the transaction.
Now keep in mind, these assets have very low tax basis. If you think about it, we will be using NOLs, but at the same time, we are also using NOLs for our operating income. So it depends on the timing of the deal. And so it is an estimate. The $7 billion is an estimate. 
The keyword there is that's discretionary cash flow that we can decide on how we support our capital priorities, whether to invest in the business, pay down debt. And we'll do that as we go along. So from a cash flow perspective, that's something to keep in mind.
Also keep in mind that we are generating strong free cash flow today. So if you just look at our fourth quarter guidance based on our updated guidance, we'll generate strong free cash flow there even after factoring in the dividend. So we feel pretty good about supporting all the capital priorities that you have laid out. 
Nothing specific to highlight in terms of 2022. I think we've already talked about CAF. You need to make sure you factored in the capital reduction there as well. And then we'll have more to say when we provide next year's guidance. 
In terms of the pension liability transport, I won't get into the specifics. But like we said on the 8-K, it doesn't materially change our funded status."

Just to augment Neel's answer, looking at us from the outside, you probably discount that capital efficiency. Looking at us from the inside, we do not discount that. Those are real numbers that we see benefit from. And if you look at what we've been investing in on the Enterprise side, it's been pretty significant. 
We, first of all, invested in making sure that our cost structure is appropriate, that we can deliver a level of service with a lower cost every year to deliver that and make sure that we're improving our service quality. We've done that. We continue to invest in edge computing and edge storage. We think those are great opportunities for us. 
We gave you -- at the beginning of the year, we said we'd have 95% of the U.S. within 5 milliseconds of our edge facilities by the end of the year. We finished that somewhere at the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter. We actually over-exceeded in the coverage and in the time frame, we were much faster, and then in the cost to deliver. 
And so we are very careful with our investments. We've augmented our adaptive networking, our connected security. We're working on our unified communications and collaboration capabilities. We're continuing to augment our platform and our services, and we see success in the market with those. And all that's in addition to Quantum Fiber, which we intend to ramp, as I've already talked about a couple of times. Thanks for the question, James."

Over the -- if we think of 2019 as sort of a baseline year, it looks like the pace of net adds in the fiber business and even in the non-fiber business on the Consumer side has slowed quite a lot. An",270,"So I just wanted to follow up on the Consumer business. Over the -- if we think of 2019 as sort of a baseline year, it looks like the pace of net adds in the fiber business and even in the non-fiber business on the Consumer side has slowed quite a lot. And on the fiber business, that's despite increasing your addressable footprint. I'm wondering if you could just talk to the -- what you're seeing in the market in broadband. What might be sort of creating headwinds for growth there? 
And the reason I ask is we're on record of saying if you can put the $10 billion into deploying fiber, it creates an incredible amount of value for you. But obviously, it's a 6- to 7-year process. You're asking investors to look many years ahead before we will see cash flow falling through from this project in a material way. And so sort of gaining confidence in your ability to drive penetration into those markets, I think, is really key to getting an appropriate multiple for what you're building here.
And then second question, if I may, Jeff. The -- you sort of -- you have conviction that the stock is worth a lot more than where it's trading at the moment, and that was reflected in the share repurchase that you guys did in the third quarter. Why not funnel all the cash that you're paying in dividends into share repurchase if it's that undervalued? You're obviously not getting credit for the dividend based on the yield. So why not just put it all into share repurchases?"
260149,1684498653,2428867,"Lumen Technologies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So let me take the first question. I'll let Neel go through some of the detailed answers, and then I'll come back with the stock price conviction and what we're doing there. If you -- embedded in your question about Consumer is kind of, well, do you",523,"Yes. So let me take the first question. I'll let Neel go through some of the detailed answers, and then I'll come back with the stock price conviction and what we're doing there. If you -- embedded in your question about Consumer is kind of, well, do you believe that the $10 billion is a good use of investment? We agree with that. I agree with that. I'm just going to go a little bit into why not do stock repurchases because we believe there are investments that are good for shareholders. 
But then you also kind of introduced the notion of you got to prove it, that it's good. And that's exactly what we've been doing over the last couple of years. We know that the building fiber is not the hardest thing in the world. We can build fiber. We can build fiber to a bunch of locations. But then how do you deliver the service to customers? And so we've been working on our best in business capabilities, our Quantum Fiber capabilities, to turn up customers with low touch, with a digital experience in the way that they want to have the experience, to be able to layer other capabilities on top of that. 
And then we wanted to prove to ourselves as we moved away from investing in bonding and vectoring and things you have not heard us talk about for several years because we stopped doing them. As we put all of our focus on fiber, we wanted to prove that we could get to the penetration rates that we expect. And we can and we have. And we give you some insights into thinking that should be 40-plus percent penetration in places where we've been marketing for a period of time. And so we've done exactly what some of your question implied, which is prove that you can do this and prove that you have the capabilities and build those capabilities so that we can do it quickly, not just wait 6, 7 years to start seeing the return.
On the stock price conviction, we're absolutely convicted that the stock price is undervalued, and it's part of our capital allocation process but that we have other aspects of the capital allocation that we want to do, too, investing in growth, investing in the Quantum Fiber business, investing in our fiber footprint for enterprises, investing in our platform and our services that we layer on top of those things and then maintaining the dividend, maintaining our leverage range. And those are, in some ways, competing uses of our capital. But to several questions that we've already answered, we think we're in a good position to deliver on all of those. 
We will be in a position if we -- if the Board decides that it's appropriate for us to do an additional buyback. We will act quickly and we'll do so. It may not be the same pace of buyback that we did in the last one. We were pretty aggressive about that. But we will authorize one if the Board thinks that's the appropriate thing to do."

I think your question on the fundamental thesis in terms of the market and the opportunity and the symmetrical nature of fiber and how it's resonating with customers, all that we see, and we're leaning in. Our fiber net adds were a little softer this quarter than we would like. And that is primarily driven by the fact that we're going through a major pivot internally in terms of how we go to market. So like Jeff mentioned, we wanted to prove this out first. 
So we had a micro-targeting strategy. And we've proven it out. We've seen how it resonates with customers. We've invested in our processes and capabilities, and now we're doing the pivot to go to a more market-based approach. And that takes a little bit of time to get an organization our size to scale up to a new ecosystem. 
And so yes, we feel very confident that, that opportunity is something we see us creating a fair amount of value. And we're not constraining it. Like Jeff said, in terms of the priorities, there's a reason why #1 is invest to drive growth, and that's something we will prioritize."

On today's call, I'll provide a few thoughts on our third quarter results, an update on our recently announced transactions, a review of our key capital allocation priorities and outline our investment plans as we continue to position the company for long-term sustainable revenue growth. I'll then ask Neel to discuss the third quarter in more detail. And of course, we'll reserve time at the end for your questions.
We're pleased with our third quarter sequential revenue progression. In fact, we showed sequential growth in both IGAM and Large Enterprise, showing the resilience of our business as COVID-related headwinds begin to diminish. We're also pleased with the continuation of the strong sales we saw in the second quarter and our growing funnel, which should provide a strong foundation as we drive toward growth. 
Overall, it's an exciting time for Lumen as we continue evolving and transforming the company for long-term growth. Our Lumen platform continues to resonate with customers and is the cornerstone of our digital transformation for enterprises. In addition, I believe our Quantum Fiber platform is unique in the market and not only drives an enhanced customer experience but also drives revenue growth and even lowers the operating cost for our Mass Market segment, improving the profitability and sustainability of the business.
I'm excited to discuss the investments we're making to drive Enterprise and Quantum Fiber growth, but let me start with an update on our previously announced transactions. Both the sale of our 20 ILEC states and our LATAM business are important steps to positioning our company for the long term. Those transactions materially change the mix of our business operations, which will amplify and accelerate the positive outcomes for our focused investments in our retained markets. Both transactions were executed with strong valuations, which we believe validates a much higher value for our retained portfolio of assets. 
Worth more than $10 billion collectively, we're making excellent progress toward closing both deals. We currently expect the LATAM transaction with Stonepeak to close during the first half of 2022 and believe the Apollo transaction will close in the second half of 2022. After considering the transfer of our Embarq debt to Apollo, pension and OPEB liabilities, tax and other transaction adjustments, we estimate that we will receive approximately $7 billion in combined net proceeds from the deal.
Looking beyond the transaction. If you turn to Slide 4 in our investor presentation, you can see our top 5 priorities for putting to work the significant free cash flow we generate and the proceeds from these transactions. As this slide illustrates, investing in growth is always our highest priority, and we're very excited about what we see as high-return, high-confidence opportunities to invest in both Enterprise and Quantum Fiber growth.
Let me start with Quantum Fiber. First of all, the quantum acceleration plan has already begun. On our last earnings call, I highlighted the attractiveness of our Mass Market assets in the 16 states we will retain after the sale to Apollo and noted that approximately 70% of our footprint or about 15 million locations will be in urban and suburban areas, the majority of which are economically attractive for our quantum expansion. Our Quantum Fiber initiatives continue to deliver, growing third quarter revenue 25% year-over-year. As we transition from micro-targeting to a broader market approach for deployment, we have high confidence in our ability to drive significant revenue growth for years to come.
As I mentioned during the second quarter call, we plan to accelerate Quantum Fiber investments in our retained markets. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 2.5 million enabled locations within the retained 16 states. Historically, we've enabled around 400,000 locations per year, and we expect that pace will continue in the fourth quarter. As we accelerate our investment in Quantum Fiber, in 2022, we expect to ramp that enablement pace to over 1 million new locations, on our way to hitting a run rate of 1.5 million to 2 million enablements per year as we exit 2022. When deploying Quantum Fiber, we typically expect penetration rates of 40% or better with average build cost of less than $1,000 per location enabled. 
After a thorough review of our footprint and given these economics, we expect our total addressable opportunity to be more than 12 million locations. Our Quantum Fiber plan for 2022 is fully funded, and we're very excited about these investments. But it's not just excitement born from hope. It's excitement born from experience and accomplishment. As we built Quantum Fiber, we've done more than simply construct new fiber. We built an excellent quantum experience and product capability that is now ready to ramp aggressively, providing higher ARPU, lower churn and greater customer lifetime value.
Over the past couple of years, we have executed a successful fiber deployment program using a deliberate and micro-targeted approach. This approach has enhanced and proven our capabilities, and we are positioned to execute on our much more aggressive plan. Our custom algorithms predict the cost to build and likely penetration levels for our fiber enablement opportunities, maximizing the efficiency of our capital spend. Our experienced and actively engaged workforce is already ramping for our accelerated Quantum Fiber build plan, and we are confident in our employees' ability to deliver on our plan.
We know supply chain is a major topic currently. So let me address that head on. We've been in close communication with our diverse and reliable supplier base and have commitments from them on their ability to deliver. However, we take nothing for granted, and this is an area where we will continue to closely monitor.
Moving to our Enterprise business. Rest assured, this much larger segment of Lumen is equally exciting for us. And we will continue to invest aggressively in our edge compute and storage platforms, our managed service offerings and our security products as well as continuing to automate and improve our customers' digital experience across many of the core networking services. 
With our extensive long-haul and dense metro infrastructure, our network provides low latency, ultra-high capacity, resilience and cost advantages over many of our competitors. We have a robust and extensive fiber footprint for enterprises, and that allows us to continue to focus our capital investment on our platform experience, higher penetration in existing buildings, new product offerings and when driven by customer opportunities, success-based fiber expansion. 
A few examples of recent wins in our business segment demonstrate the diversity of our customers and the need for our services across virtually all industries. These wins include a cloud TV enabler, an independent renewable energy, clean technology provider and a hyperscaler. All of this is in addition to our recently announced network modernization contract for the U.S. Postal Service. There is strong demand for the enterprise services we enable, and we continually evolve our product portfolio to leverage our robust fiber network and provide services our customers need to drive success in their businesses.
We believe our growth investments, coupled with our streamlined post-divestiture portfolio, will create tremendous value for our shareholders. The transactions will improve our revenue quality from day 1 and allow for focused investment, targeting our most strategic, highest ROI opportunities. We believe there are attractive opportunities to put new capital to work, driving revenue growth and with returns well above our cost of capital. You've heard me say this before, we will invest for growth and grow where we invest.
Another key priority for Lumen is the importance we place on returning cash to shareholders. Therefore, we have no plans to modify our dividend, which we believe is sustainable at the $1 per share level. Although our payout ratio will likely rise in the near term, as we streamline our asset portfolio and invest in the quantum and enterprise opportunities, we expect our focused operations to provide the underpinnings for top line growth in 2 to 3 years, which we expect will drive a more normalized dividend payout ratio over time.
Our Board believes the return of cash in the form of a dividend is an important part of our value proposition, and we are focused on supporting our dividend even as we make the investments necessary to reach our growth objectives. As I mentioned in our last earnings call and as you can see in priority 3, we will manage our balance sheet to remain more or less leverage neutral over the next few years. As we accelerate our Quantum Fiber deployment plan, we do expect the time line to reach our target net leverage ratio of 2.75 to 3.25x adjusted EBITDA will be extended.
With our 2 announced transactions, I'm not just using CEO speak when I say we are open to smart optimization of our assets. We are open-minded, and we'll continue to evaluate asset optimization that makes sense for our shareholders. But we've also demonstrated our discipline in driving and working for the right deal, not just a deal to get something done. There's no urgency for us to divest assets, and our thoughtful approach to the ILEC sale resulted in additional years of cash flow from operations and stronger multiple received and a strong partner in Apollo as we move our business forward. We'll continue the same open-minded, disciplined approach to assess further optimization, both to improve our business mix and to fund growth in our retained businesses.
Lastly, let me talk for a minute about share buybacks. As you've seen, we completed the $1 billion share buyback that we announced last quarter, reducing our share count by about 81 million shares or approximately 7% of our total shares outstanding. I'll also note, we funded this buyback largely with our third quarter '21 free cash flow. We executed this buyback quickly because we believe our shares are deeply discounted and do not reflect the significant opportunity for Lumen going forward. Our Board continues to believe this and is prepared to authorize further buybacks on short notice if we believe this presents a prudent use of our shareholders' capital.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neel to discuss our third quarter results. Neel?"

As Jeff said, we're very excited about the transformation of our company and our plans to drive future growth. Let me begin with our financial summary.For the third quarter of 2021, IGAM and Large Enterpris",1248,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff said, we're very excited about the transformation of our company and our plans to drive future growth. Let me begin with our financial summary.
For the third quarter of 2021, IGAM and Large Enterprise sequential revenue performance returned to growth. We again delivered solid adjusted EBITDA and expanded margins year-over-year. Cash flow remains robust, providing the flexibility to support our capital allocation priorities.
With respect to capital expenditures, enterprise customer demand has been centered around existing on-net buildings and less capital-intensive higher-layer services. We are also seeing benefits from our continued focus on capital efficiency initiatives. As a result, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Note that as we transition from micro-targeting to a market-based approach for Quantum Fiber and enterprise decision-making on new network deployment accelerates, we expect capital expenditures to ramp going forward.
We remain confident in our EBITDA guidance range of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. And as a result of lower capital spending and lower net cash interest expense, our new outlook for free cash flow is $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.
Turning to revenue. In the third quarter, total revenue declined 5.4% on a year-over-year basis to $4.887 billion. It is important to remember that year-over-year metrics were meaningfully affected by COVID-related demand last year, making comparisons less relevant. From a sequential perspective, total revenue declined by 0.8%, an improvement from the 2.1% sequential rate of decline in the second quarter. Business revenue in the third quarter declined 0.4% sequentially versus a decline of 2% last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined 5.1% to $3.508 billion. Normalizing for the sale of the correctional facility business in the third quarter of last year, the decline was 4.9%.
Within our Business segment, IGAM revenue grew 1.5% sequentially and 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year and sequential improvement was primarily driven by increased demand for wavelengths and Dark Fibre within fiber infrastructure services. IP and data services also grew sequentially within IGAM. 
Large Enterprise grew 0.1% sequentially and declined 5.9% on a year-over-year basis. Sequential improvement was driven by strength in our federal, state, local and education businesses, while year-over-year trends were impacted by the surge in COVID-related usage last year. 
Mid-Market Enterprise declined 2.3% sequentially and 9.6% on a year-over-year basis. While sequential performance improved in third quarter, trends continue to be pressured by the delayed decision-making environment. Year-over-year trends were also impacted by the previously noted sale of the correctional facility business. 
Revenue within our enterprise channels now represents about 75% of our total Business revenue. Despite the mid-market headwind, enterprise channel revenue was flat on a sequential basis in the third quarter of 2021. Wholesale declined 1.5% sequentially and 7% on a year-over-year basis. 
Compute and application services for enterprise channels declined slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. Enterprise sequential performance was impacted by the mid-market channel and year-over-year primarily by the large IGAM customer disconnect we referenced in first quarter. Compute and application services grew both sequentially and year-over-year for Large Enterprise. 
IP and data services for enterprise channels declined both sequentially and year-over-year due to declines in new VPN hybrid network deployments. We have, however, seen increased demand for IP on a year-over-year basis as customers transition to SD-WAN and work-from-home technologies. 
Fiber infrastructure services grew sequentially while declining on a year-over-year basis. The sequential growth was due to Dark Fibre and wavelength demand, primarily for our large customers. Year-over-year declines were largely due to timing of equipment sales within our federal business. 
Voice and other services and the wholesale channel declined both sequentially and on year-over-year basis, in line with our expectations as we manage these areas for cash. Keep in mind that voice comparisons continue to be impacted by higher COVID-related usage in the year ago quarter.
Turning to Mass Markets. Third quarter 2021 revenue declined 1.6% sequentially. Our Mass Markets fiber broadband revenue grew 25% year-over-year this quarter. During the quarter, we added 28,000 Quantum Fiber customers.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA. For the third quarter of 2021, adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, was $2.078 billion compared to $2.132 billion in the year ago quarter. In addition to $9 million for transactions and separation costs, special items this quarter included a net benefit of $40 million. SG&A benefited by $70 million from a real estate asset sale, while cost of service was negatively impacted by about $30 million from our real estate rationalization efforts.
We continue to drive healthy adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, growing 120 basis points year-over-year to 42.5%. As a reminder, our third quarter is impacted by seasonally higher utility costs. 
Capital expenditures for the third quarter 2021 were $690 million. As discussed earlier, we are focused on capital efficiencies, penetrating existing on-net buildings while supporting our customers' digital transformation efforts with higher layer services. 
In the third quarter of 2021, the company generated free cash flow of $1.072 billion. And we have increased our full year 2021 guidance for free cash flow as a result of our reduced outlook for both capital spending and net cash interest expense.
During October 2021, we completed our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. In total, we repurchased 81 million shares, reducing our annualized dividend obligation by $81 million and reducing our shares outstanding by approximately 7%. 
We have also reduced our gross pension obligation by approximately $1.4 billion by transferring that obligation to an insurance sponsor without materially impacting our funded status in conjunction with transferring $2.5 billion of gross pension obligations as part of our ILEC transaction. On a pro forma basis, we have reduced our gross pension obligations by approximately $3.9 billion. At this point, we don't anticipate any required pension contributions over the next few years.
Moving on to the business outlook for 2021. In addition to the previously mentioned free cash flow and capital expenditure changes, we are updating our net cash interest expense to now be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.525 billion and our noncash compensation expense to be approximately $150 million. For depreciation and amortization, we now expect a range of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion as we have removed D&A expense related to the assets held for sale. As Jeff mentioned, we will manage our debt profile to ensure that the recently announced transactions are relatively leverage neutral, and our long-term net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target of 2.75 to 3.25 remains unchanged.
As you think about any coverage ratios, it is important to remember that the announced transactions reduce our exposure to legacy revenues and significantly improve the quality and durability of earnings and cash flows going forward. Moreover, a significant portion of capital investments are expected to go towards long-life fiber infrastructure with predictable returns.
In closing, our company will look very different a year from now. We have made significant progress this quarter in taking steps to optimize our asset portfolio with a clear focus on positioning Lumen to capitalize on the growing and most profitable areas of our business. We are encouraged by our sequential revenue performance this quarter and expect business trends to improve as the economy continues to reopen. With a strong balance sheet, we remain very excited about scaling our Lumen Enterprise platform as well as our significant and unique Quantum Fiber opportunity.
With that, France, we are ready to open it up for your questions."

And I think the assumption a lot of investors had is that inevitably would mean a very meaningful uplift in investment and as a result, might change the way you would approach the dividend. 
If I listen to the comments you laid out for us today, I think maybe the interpretation has evolved a little bit or been improved. And I think that what you're saying is you're comfortable keeping your balance sheet at its current level of leverage in order to fund your entire capital allocation program, be that dividend, potentially buybacks as well as the CapEx program, and if not, as if the balance sheet is specifically funding any one of those things but the collection of those things combined.

Nothing is ever linear, and it's lumpy sometimes in our business. There's seasonality. There are other factors that go into it. But if you look at IGAM, our International and GAM business, and our Large Enterprise, they were particularly strong. And so we're pleased with the momentum that we've seen. 
The funnel has been building since about midway through the first quarter. So we've seen the funnel return to our prepandemic levels. We continue to augment our products and capabilities. We believe the fiber infrastructure we have is a unique value proposition, brings unique value proposition to our customers. And so we're pleased with our competitive position and our ability to take share moving forward that -- again, moving forward. Again, nothing is ever linear, but we have high confidence in our revenue growth. 
And it's part of the reason you did see us go through the buyback so quickly. We absolutely believe that our business is undervalued. And I've got data points that I can point to. We've done the -- we've done the -- some of the parts analysis for you before. If you look at the sale of 20 kind of out-of-region, small ILEC states, we sold those places we were not investing. So you would expect to be at a lower multiple than the places where we were investing. We sold those for 5.5x adjusted EBITDA. And so we think that was a very good valuation for that business. If you look at LATAM, we sold it for 9x EBITDA. And we think that's a good valuation for that business. If you look at the remainco within Lumen in the context of that, you can -- hopefully, you can see why I think we're still undervalued. 
Then if you couple with that our confidence in our ability to grow, our confidence in the investments that we're making in Quantum Fiber, our confidence in the investments that we've made in edge computing, edge storage, managed services, the platform to deliver all of our core networking services, our security capabilities, if you look at those things combined together, you can see why we've decided it was good to be aggressive in the pace of buyback."

We usually have a wedge product initially and then continue to grow the relationship. On the mid-market side, we do have a focus on new logos. But that environment has been, for obvious reasons, been a little challenging. 
In terms of your -- specific to sequential improvement, I'll just underline what Jeff said. It's not going to be linear.

I guess the second question is with the coming end of CAF II, I think you guys said even though you're cutting CapEx that you're expecting to spend more on the core initiatives next year, maintaining high leverage. I just want to kind of maybe talk about the elephant in the room, which is that right now, you're a 5% declining revenue company with very high leverage, cutting your CapEx and after 3 months telling us that you're -- after reconsidering the dividend, now you're definitely going to keep paying it and maybe even spend some more on stock buybacks.

Legacy consumer versus -- the business that we're selling versus the business that we're keeping, we don't really look at it and certainly don't give out information on it separately. But the legacy business is performing like we've seen it perform, and our team has done a really good job of managing that business for cash. And we have invested as we thought was appropriate to continue to expand our homes passed. 
If you look at the retained 16 states at the end of the year, we'll have something like 2.6 million fiber-enabled homes. You've seen us grow our Consumer and Mass Market business at the rate of, I don't know, 45,000 subscribers over 100 megabits per quarter, something like 28,000, 30,000 of those on pure fiber. And so we continue to have the parts of the business where we're investing grow. And we continue to have the parts that we're not investing, we manage those for cash.
Part of the rationale behind the sale to Apollo was that they will invest more in those markets. We think there's great opportunity in them. We just weren't going to invest in them at the pace that we thought that they deserve, and we think that Apollo will do that and gave us a good valuation for it. And so it makes part -- it's part of our funding philosophy, is how do we fund what we want to do. Part of it is to sell assets, but part of it also is to shift some of that funding obligation to somebody else. They can grow that, and we don't spend the money there.
Now we have -- I've gone through it. I can go through it again. But we have lots of sources -- we have significant free cash flow that we generate, and we have opportunities to continue to rationalize parts of the business that makes sense for us and parts that don't make sense for us. But we think that we're in a very good position to do the things that you sound a little dubious about, but we think we're in a good position to do those things. 
And we'll continue to focus on making sure that we maintain our dividend, that we invest in growth -- first and foremost, that we invest in the growth that we think we can drive, and we can maintain our dividend, and we can -- but stay relatively leverage neutral. And I've not made any commitment to doing a share buyback, additional share buybacks, but I do want you to know that our Board is very prepared to authorize one if we thought that was appropriate.

And so we see that as a significant opportunity. I think the economics are fairly well understood. And so you're going to see us ramping that business, and it's a long-life asset with predictable returns.
On your comment on the 5%, you should also look at our sequential performance. So yes, we're talking about COVID last year where we had a fair amount of COVID-related demand and voice performance. So a better number to look at is sequentially, yes, we did decline. We declined 0.8% in IGAM and Large Enterprise grew on a sequential basis. So yes, like I mentioned before, it's not going to be linear, but we are encouraged by the revenue trends we see.
And the other thing to keep in mind is the capitalization of this business is rapidly changing, and it's going to change rapidly going forward. Since the Level 3 acquisition, we paid down about $7 billion of debt. We just announced $10 billion of transaction. In the quarter, we have 7% less outstanding shares.

But starting with the Embarq debt, we're transferring $1.4 billion worth of Embarq debt. That's a liability that we're eliminating on the Lumen side and transferring over. 
So that's actually one of the proceeds of the deal, is that we're using that to transfer that liability. Then there are things like pension and OPEB liabilities in there, a few hundred million dollars. And we have taxes and deal costs. And so we can, at some point, kind of break some of those down. But those are the big picture items, and it goes from $10.2 billion to $7 billion."

So I think if I can add, Jeff, I think the big ones are, like Jeff said, the purchase agreement has been filed. So really look through it. So there's $1.4 billion of Embarq debt.

So really look through it. So there's $1.4 billion of Embarq debt. We provided debt adjustments. So that's another $100 million. Between pension and OPEB liabilities, that's another $300 million. So that's bulk of it. So like Jeff said, just to underline that point, that's a liability transfer. And the rest of it is basically transaction costs and taxes that we incur on the transaction.
Now keep in mind, these assets have very low tax basis. If you think about it, we will be using NOLs, but at the same time, we are also using NOLs for our operating income. So it depends on the timing of the deal. And so it is an estimate. The $7 billion is an estimate. 
The keyword there is that's discretionary cash flow that we can decide on how we support our capital priorities, whether to invest in the business, pay down debt. And we'll do that as we go along. So from a cash flow perspective, that's something to keep in mind.
Also keep in mind that we are generating strong free cash flow today. So if you just look at our fourth quarter guidance based on our updated guidance, we'll generate strong free cash flow there even after factoring in the dividend. So we feel pretty good about supporting all the capital priorities that you have laid out.

In terms of ROIs, we continue to see very good ROIs on the investment that we make on the Enterprise side. And I think the consumer, most folks are familiar with the dynamics there. So that's -- ROI is not an issue for us. It is really managing the legacy revenues for cash that really meets the returns, if you will, from our perspective. 
In addition to that, we continue to focus on capital efficiency initiatives. So we continue to focus on how we get more efficiency in terms of our processes, how we deploy capital, unit cost of capacity. So those things continue to be areas of focus for us."

Those are real numbers that we see benefit from. And if you look at what we've been investing in on the Enterprise side, it's been pretty significant. 
We, first of all, invested in making sure that our cost structure is appropriate, that we can deliver a level of service with a lower cost every year to deliver that and make sure that we're improving our service quality. We've done that. We continue to invest in edge computing and edge storage. We think those are great opportunities for us. 
We gave you -- at the beginning of the year, we said we'd have 95% of the U.S. within 5 milliseconds of our edge facilities by the end of the year. We finished that somewhere at the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter. We actually over-exceeded in the coverage and in the time frame, we were much faster, and then in the cost to deliver. 
And so we are very careful with our investments. We've augmented our adaptive networking, our connected security. We're working on our unified communications and collaboration capabilities. We're continuing to augment our platform and our services, and we see success in the market with those.

Over the -- if we think of 2019 as sort of a baseline year, it looks like the pace of net adds in the fiber business and even in the non-fiber business on the Consumer side has slowed quite a lot. An",270,"So I just wanted to follow up on the Consumer business. Over the -- if we think of 2019 as sort of a baseline year, it looks like the pace of net adds in the fiber business and even in the non-fiber business on the Consumer side has slowed quite a lot. And on the fiber business, that's despite increasing your addressable footprint. I'm wondering if you could just talk to the -- what you're seeing in the market in broadband. What might be sort of creating headwinds for growth there? 
And the reason I ask is we're on record of saying if you can put the $10 billion into deploying fiber, it creates an incredible amount of value for you. But obviously, it's a 6- to 7-year process. You're asking investors to look many years ahead before we will see cash flow falling through from this project in a material way. And so sort of gaining confidence in your ability to drive penetration into those markets, I think, is really key to getting an appropriate multiple for what you're building here.
And then second question, if I may, Jeff. The -- you sort of -- you have conviction that the stock is worth a lot more than where it's trading at the moment, and that was reflected in the share repurchase that you guys did in the third quarter. Why not funnel all the cash that you're paying in dividends into share repurchase if it's that undervalued? You're obviously not getting credit for the dividend based on the yield. So why not just put it all into share repurchases?"

I'll let Neel go through some of the detailed answers, and then I'll come back with the stock price conviction and what we're doing there. If you -- embedded in your question about Consumer is kind of, well, do you",523,"Yes. So let me take the first question. I'll let Neel go through some of the detailed answers, and then I'll come back with the stock price conviction and what we're doing there. If you -- embedded in your question about Consumer is kind of, well, do you believe that the $10 billion is a good use of investment? We agree with that. I agree with that. I'm just going to go a little bit into why not do stock repurchases because we believe there are investments that are good for shareholders. 
But then you also kind of introduced the notion of you got to prove it, that it's good. And that's exactly what we've been doing over the last couple of years. We know that the building fiber is not the hardest thing in the world. We can build fiber. We can build fiber to a bunch of locations. But then how do you deliver the service to customers? And so we've been working on our best in business capabilities, our Quantum Fiber capabilities, to turn up customers with low touch, with a digital experience in the way that they want to have the experience, to be able to layer other capabilities on top of that. 
And then we wanted to prove to ourselves as we moved away from investing in bonding and vectoring and things you have not heard us talk about for several years because we stopped doing them. As we put all of our focus on fiber, we wanted to prove that we could get to the penetration rates that we expect. And we can and we have. And we give you some insights into thinking that should be 40-plus percent penetration in places where we've been marketing for a period of time. And so we've done exactly what some of your question implied, which is prove that you can do this and prove that you have the capabilities and build those capabilities so that we can do it quickly, not just wait 6, 7 years to start seeing the return.
On the stock price conviction, we're absolutely convicted that the stock price is undervalued, and it's part of our capital allocation process but that we have other aspects of the capital allocation that we want to do, too, investing in growth, investing in the Quantum Fiber business, investing in our fiber footprint for enterprises, investing in our platform and our services that we layer on top of those things and then maintaining the dividend, maintaining our leverage range. And those are, in some ways, competing uses of our capital. But to several questions that we've already answered, we think we're in a good position to deliver on all of those. 
We will be in a position if we -- if the Board decides that it's appropriate for us to do an additional buyback. We will act quickly and we'll do so. It may not be the same pace of buyback that we did in the last one. We were pretty aggressive about that. But we will authorize one if the Board thinks that's the appropriate thing to do."

I think your question on the fundamental thesis in terms of the market and the opportunity and the symmetrical nature of fiber and how it's resonating with customers, all that we see, and we're leaning in. Our fiber net adds were a little softer this quarter than we would like. And that is primarily driven by the fact that we're going through a major pivot internally in terms of how we go to market. So like Jeff mentioned, we wanted to prove this out first. 
So we had a micro-targeting strategy. And we've proven it out. We've seen how it resonates with customers. We've invested in our processes and capabilities, and now we're doing the pivot to go to a more market-based approach. And that takes a little bit of time to get an organization our size to scale up to a new ecosystem. 
And so yes, we feel very confident that, that opportunity is something we see us creating a fair amount of value. And we're not constraining it. Like Jeff said, in terms of the priorities, there's a reason why #1 is invest to drive growth, and that's something we will prioritize."
