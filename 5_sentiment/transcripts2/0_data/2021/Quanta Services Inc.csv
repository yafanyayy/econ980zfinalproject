On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. 
As noted in our earnings release this morning, we have renamed both of our segments to include solutions, which we believe is an accurate word to describe the value-creating and collaborative approach we take to working with our customers. 
Additionally, we renamed our Pipeline and Industrial segment to Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions, which we believe is more reflective of the strategic changes we have made over the past 5 years to reposition the segment towards a greater level of resilient business services to our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial customers. These services tend to be more visible and recurring in nature and are driven by safety, reliability and environmental regulations. 
We continue to expand our capabilities in both segments to provide comprehensive end-to-end solutions with craft skill labor at the core. We are proud of our successful focus on base business activity over the last 5 years, which now accounts for more than 90% of our revenues. We continue to view large projects as upside opportunities and are well positioned to safely execute them when they occur. 
Quanta performed well and delivered a solid year in 2020, which includes numerous accomplishments. This was due to the performance of our field leadership and the people of this organization who continue to be exceptional. 
Here are some of the accomplishments in 2020: Electric Power segment revenues achieved record levels, and we earned our best operating margin performance in 6 years, driven by strong execution across our operations. Included in these results were record storm response revenues from supporting our customers' efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by numerous severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize this level of resources to support our customers in times of need, even during a pandemic is unmatched in our industry. 
After an 18-month competitive process, LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ACO, was selected for a 15-year operation and maintenance agreement to operate, maintain and modernize PREPA's more than 18,000 mile electric transmission and distribution system in Puerto Rico. LUMA and PREPA are making good progress towards transitioning operations of the system this year, and we continue to believe this opportunity is strengthening 
We grew our communication services revenue we substantially completed the exit of our Latin American operations, despite the significant challenges and impacts to these wind down activities from the effects of COVID-19. 
We continue to lead the industry in safety, which we believe starts with training. We continue to incrementally invest in our training efforts through our Northwest Line College and Quanta Advanced Training Center. 
Additionally, last year, we began site preparation for a new line worker training campus in Puerto Rico that will be operated by Northwest Line college. The facility will provide world-class training to LUMA's employees and develop Puerto Rico's future and further differentiate and the marketplace as a strategic solutions provider. 
We invested approximately $400 million in strategic acquisition of 7 high-quality companies with great management teams that expand or enhance our ability to provide solutions to our customers are additive to our base business and advanced our strategic initiatives. These companies add to our self-perform capabilities, which typically accounts for approximately 85% of our work and are key to providing cost certainty to our customers. 
We believe our approach to acquisitions and our operating model helps derisk our work portfolio through improved execution and results in more consistent earnings. We strengthened our financial position with the closing of our $1 billion investment-grade senior notes offering, which we believe points to the resiliency and sustainability of our business model and positive multiyear outlook. 
We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and confidence in Quanta's financial strength and continued growth opportunities through the acquisition of approximately $250 million of common stock and a 25% increase in our dividend. 
And finally, the diversity of our services, proactive cost management and execution through significant uncertainty caused by the pandemic and challenged energy markets, allowed our underground utility and infrastructure solutions operations to perform well under the circumstances. We are optimistic that the most challenging market conditions are behind us, and we see opportunity for revenue and margin improvement in 2021 and continue to believe the segment can achieve upper single-digit operating income margin as operating conditions further normalize over time. 
We believe our strategic position in the marketplace remains strong, and we are well positioned for continued profitable growth over the near and longer term. Despite unprecedented operating conditions and uncertainties caused by the global pandemic proportions of our business, the strong performance of our Electric Power and Communications Operations resulted in record adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and backlog in 2020. 
While we are proud of the achievements last year, we remain focused on getting better to ensure that Quanta continues to evolve to effectively collaborate with our customers and business partners and helping them achieve their goals and to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us. 
The recent severe weather conditions that impacted living conditions in Texas and other parts of the country shows how a critical infrastructure that we design, build and maintain is to our everyday well being. The solutions Quanta provides supports our customers' efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency and connectivity, all of which have a favorable environmental and social impact on both the markets that we serve and society. 
Additionally, our solutions facilitate policies and goals aimed at the adoption of new technologies and transitioning towards a carbon-neutral economy. As a result, we believe our business is levered to favorable and sustainable long-term goals. 
Our utility customers, who account for more than 70% of our 2020 revenues, are leaders in the effort to reduce carbon emissions with aggressive efforts to modernize and harden their systems, expand their renewable generation portfolios and implement new technologies for current and future needs. A number of utilities have committed to providing 100% of their power by clean energy or achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Achieving these goals will require substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and distribution infrastructure to interconnect new renewable generation facilities to the power grid and to ensure grid reliability due to the significant increase of intermittent power added to the system. 
Further, developed economies are expected to be increasingly driven by electricity to meet carbon reduction goals over time. Vehicle electrification offers a large carbon reduction opportunity, in addition to residential and commercial space and water heating and industrial and agricultural electrification. 
According to a report from the Wires Group, increased electrification and electric vehicle adoption in the United States could require 70 to 200 gigawatts of new power generation by 2030. The majority of which is expected to be renewables and could require incremental transmission investment of $30 billion to $90 billion by 2030. We believe these investment requirements associated with electrification are in addition to the significant multiyear investment programs already in place for the coming years to modernize the existing power grid, to ensure reliable power delivery under current market conditions. 
The outlook for our communications operations, which is within the Electric Power segment, remains bright. We expect to generate approximately $700 million in revenue this year, which would represent approximately 30% growth over 2020. 
Our communications services support the technology we use every day for work, education, entertainment, connecting with friends and family, all of which are critically important. To that end, the effects of COVID-19 have caused communication providers to increase investment in the fiber networks to ensure adequate speed, capacity and reliability to meet these needs. 
Additionally, we believe Quanta is well positioned to leverage our Electric Power and communication solutions capabilities to assist many of our rural and municipal electric customers, who are expected to participate in the rural digital opportunity fund. This fund provides more than $20 billion to bridge the digital divide that exist for millions of people living in rural America without access to adequate broadband connectivity. Further, we expect 5G deployments to accelerate in 2021, which we remain well positioned to continue to participate in. 
Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment experienced meaningful challenges during the year to the effects of COVID-19, such as shutdowns in certain cities that had short-term impacts on our gas utility services and a significant reduction in demand for refined products that materially impacted our industrial service customers. 
As discussed previously, we believe the greatest impact from these dynamics are behind us. Going forward, we expect to continue our focus on our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial services businesses, consistent with our strategy over the last 5 years due to the favorable long-term trends, driven by safety, reliability and environmental regulations. 
Our gas utility services supported with regulated programs that will replace and modernize aging infrastructure, which can be leak prone and post potential safety concerns. They also support customer efforts to reduce methane emissions and position their gas distribution systems to potentially deliver hydrogen to users in the future. 
Our pipeline integrity services seek to ensure that existing pipelines operate safely and in an environmentally friendly manner. And many of our industrial services support customers compliance with regulations aimed at minimizing environmental impacts caused by methane gas release and increased operational efficiency and safety. 
We believe these favorable, safety, reliability and environmental initiatives and long-term industry trends, such as electrifications and technology implementations, will continue to drive growth opportunities for Quanta for the foreseeable future. 
Quanta is actively engaged in collaborative conversations with many of our customers about their multiyear, multibillion-dollar programs extending as far as 10 years, regarding how Quanta can provide solutions throughout our customers' value chain to meet their strategic infrastructure investment goals and support of these initiatives. 
In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2021 guidance. We believe -- which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute in our strong competitive position in the marketplace. Our expectations call for growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share and improved profit margins. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve new record levels of backlog in 2021. 
In summary, we generated solid results in 2020 that we believe will reflect the resiliency and sustainability of our business, the benefit of our strong financial position, the successful execution of our strategic initiatives and the excellence of our people. The challenges we faced and the way we continue to support and collaborate with our customers last year, particularly as it relates to the pandemic, brought out the best of this organization, and I believe, make Quanta stronger. 
Overall, our end markets and multiyear visibility are solid, and we have built a strong platform that positions us well to capitalize on favorable long-term trends, particularly the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy and the adoption of new technologies. 
Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions, strategic investments and dividends, we believe Quanta will continue to generate meaningful stockholder value going forward. 
Quanta is a portfolio of exceptional businesses with geographic and service line diversity. We are anchored by our commitment to craft skilled labor and our self-perform capabilities. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of the fourth quarter and full year results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?"
33509,703475678,2223273,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced fourth quarter 2020 revenues of $2.9 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $170.1 million or $1.17 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure,",2372,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced fourth quarter 2020 revenues of $2.9 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $170.1 million or $1.17 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.22. 
Overall, the fourth quarter closed out another exceptional year of operational performance for Quanta, a year in which we delivered record results across multiple metrics despite headwinds faced related to the pandemic. 
Our Electric Power revenues, excluding Latin America, were $2.11 billion, a 15.7% increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase was driven by mid single-digit growth in our base business, increased contributions from the timing of certain larger projects and $75 million in revenues from acquired businesses. 
Contributing to the base business growth was approximately 13% growth from our communications operations and record fourth quarter demand for our emergency restoration services of approximately $150 million, primarily associated with efforts to restore infrastructure in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States, although it came at the expense of certain other work in progress. Partially offsetting these increases was the expected reduction in fire hardening work in the Western United States during 4Q '20 as compared to 4Q '19. 
Electric segment margins in 4Q '20 were 11.6%. And excluding our Latin American operations, segment margins were 12.9% versus 9% in 4Q '19. The robust operating margins were driven by increased profit contributions from the elevated emergency restoration services, which typically present opportunities for higher margins due to higher equipment utilization and fixed cost absorption as well as improved margins in our Canadian operations, primarily associated with certain larger transmission projects. However, although difficult to calculate the direct incremental effects, excluding revenues and profit from strong response efforts, our margins were still comfortably in double digits, reflecting continued strong execution across all of our Electric Power operations. Of note, our communications margins continue to improve against the prior year with a margin of 9% during the quarter. 
Regarding our Latin American operations, included within the electric segment, we have substantially completed the wind down activities required to exit those markets. Our year-long effort to shut down our operations across the region was significantly impacted by COVID-19 dynamics as well as political and regulatory uncertainties and customer challenges, all of which contributed meaningfully higher losses than anticipated. 
In the fourth quarter, we took the additional step of reserving remaining property, equipment and inventory assets as the uncertain market conditions minimize likely recoveries upon disposition. As a reminder, we currently receive no tax benefit for losses in Latin America, so the $27 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.19. 
With minimal contractual obligations remaining, we feel comfortable that other than arbitration updates on the terminated Peruvian Communications Network Project, we will no longer provide commentary on Latin America. 
Revenues from our underground utility and infrastructure Solutions segment were $806 million, 36% lower than 4Q '19. Similar to prior quarters, expected reduced contributions from larger diameter pipeline projects contributed to the decline. The variability attributable to larger pipeline projects is why we've taken strategic steps to reposition our service offerings around more predictable utility-backed revenue streams. 
While we remain well positioned to opportunistically deploy resources for larger pipeline projects, we expect most future work will consist of smaller pipeline transmission and integrity-oriented projects. Additionally, the lingering negative impacts of COVID-19 have reduced some level of demand for broader services across the segment with the reduction in demand for refined products substantially contributing to reduced quarter-over-quarter revenues from our industrial operations. 
Operating margins for the segment were 5.1%. these margins were 190 basis points lower than 4Q '19, primarily due to reduced revenues as well as some degree of execution challenges during the quarter and costs associated with the exit of certain ancillary pipeline operations. These negative impacts were partially offset by net positive project closeouts, primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred suspension and milestone payments and the reduction of remaining contingency balances associated with the Atlantic Coast pipeline project, which was officially terminated on December 31, 2020. 
Our total backlog was $15.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, slightly higher than 4Q '19 and comparable to the third quarter of 2020, yet remains at record levels. 12-month backlog of $8.3 billion is an increase from both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2020. 
As a reminder, the LUMA joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment, and therefore, does not contribute to revenue and is not included in backlog. However, assuming an operating margin profile consistent with our Electric Power operations, LUMA's contribution over the 15-year operation and maintenance agreement would imply a backlog equivalent of more than $6 billion for Quanta. 
For the fourth quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure of $200 million. And although $381 million lower than 4Q '19, it was higher than we anticipated, driven by stronger profits in the quarter and a cash cycle consistent with our third quarter results. For the year, we generated record free cash flow of $892 million. 
Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 83 days for the quarter, which was comparable to the third quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2019. Cash flows in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 did partially benefit from the deferral of $37 million and $109 million of employer payroll tax payments permitted by the CARES Act with the payments due in equal installment at the end of 2021 and 2022. We had $185 million of cash at the end of the year with total liquidity of $2.2 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our credit agreement of approximately 1.2x. 
Turning to guidance. We continue to deal with some level of COVID-19 uncertainty as we assess the near-term prospects of our operations, primarily in our underground utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, and we remain prudent with our expectations for 2021. However, as we look ahead to 2021 and beyond, we see the base business propelling multiyear growth opportunities for both segments. 
Electric segment revenues grew to $7.8 billion at the end of 2020, and we continue to see our base business providing mid-single to double-digit growth opportunities, coupled with some degree of increased contributions from larger projects, primarily associated with previously announced projects in Canada. 
In the aggregate, we expect Electric Power revenues to range between $8.3 billion and $8.5 billion, which includes expected revenues from our communications operations of around $700 million. As it relates to Electric Power segment revenue seasonality, we expect revenue growth in each quarter of '21 compared to 2020, with quarter-over-quarter growth in the first and second quarters, potentially exceeding 10%. 
We expect first quarter revenues to be the lowest of the year due to normal seasonal weather dynamics impacting certain construction activities. We expect the high end of our revenue range to represent greater revenue growth opportunities in the third and fourth quarters relative to 2020. 
We expect 2021 operating margins for the Electric Power segment to range between 10.1% and 10.9%, which includes contributions of approximately $29 million or $0.20 per share from the LUMA joint venture and earnings from other integral unconsolidated affiliates. LUMA is expected to contribute around $9 million in the first half of the year and then increasing in the back half of the year as we exit the front-end transition services period. 
Although we are proud of our overall Electric Power performance in 2020, our 11.6% margins, excluding Latin America, are above historical averages and are the highest since 2013, due in part to record annual emergency restoration service revenues of $450 million. 
As outlined in our accompanying slides, our 2021 expectation for margins for this segment are consistent with historical averages and are also based on expectations for more normalized emergency restoration service revenues of approximately $200 million, also in line with historical averages. 
As is typically the case, we expect that first quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, possibly slightly below 10%. However, we expect margin to increase into the second and third quarters and then slightly decline in the fourth quarter. We believe communications operating income margins, which have been dilutive to segment margins in prior periods, could be at parity with electric operations on a full year basis. 
The underground utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and the challenging energy market conditions. However, we are anticipating upper single-digit to double-digit revenue growth off of 2020 with full year revenues expected to range between $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion. Over 90% of our revenue expectations for 2021 represent base business with larger projects representing their lowest level of contributions in the last 7 years. 
From a seasonality perspective, we see first quarter revenues being our lowest for the year, likely more than 20% lower than the first quarter of 2020. This decline is primarily due to significantly reduced industrial service revenues compared to the record results in 1Q '20, as industrial customers are still dealing with lower demand stemming from decreased global travel activity associated with the pandemic as well as reduced contributions from larger pipeline projects. 
Revenue should then increase sequentially into the third quarter than seasonally decline in the fourth quarter. Quarterly revenues for the second through the fourth quarters are expected to be higher on a quarter-over-quarter basis as compared to 2020 with double-digit growth expected for each quarter. 
Operating margin improvement for the segment continues to be a focus for us. We see segment margins ranging between 5.5% and 6%, led primarily by continued execution within our gas LDC operations. Our full year margin expectations include a breakeven contribution from our industrial services operations in 2021 due to the continued challenging environment. However, to put our current segment margin guidance in context, if our industrial operations contributed at historical pre-COVID margin levels, our segment margin guidance would increase by over 100 basis points. 
Consistent with years past and similar to Electric Power, our first quarter traditionally has lower activity in the segment due to weather seasonality, which impacts our revenues and pressures margins. With current increment weather across much of the U.S., further pressuring those operations, we expect first quarter margins between breakeven and a small loss. However, we expect solid improvement into the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. 
These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2021 annual revenues of $11.95 billion to $12.35 billion, and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between $1.09 billion and $1.19 billion. This represents 8% growth at the midpoint of the range when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. 
With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $3.16 and $3.66, and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.02 and $4.52. 
Turning to cash flow. We expect free cash flow for 2021 to range between $400 million and $600 million with the standard disclaimer that quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that occur in the normal course of operations. Included in our free cash flow expectation is the anticipated payment of $54 million in the fourth quarter related to payroll taxes that were deferred in 2020. 
As we have discussed during prior investor events, our cash flow generation moves counter to our revenue growth rate. For instance, a large driver of our significant free cash flow in 2020 was reduced revenues of approximately $900 million compared to 2019, decreasing working capital needs. However, higher revenue growth, like we're guiding for 2021, will like to require a meaningful investment in working capital to support the growth. 
While our 2021 free cash flow may be negatively impacted by increased working capital required to support our return to 2019 revenue levels, we believe the consistent, sustainable growth profile and solid margins of our base business provides for repeatable levels of free cash flow generation in line with our 2021 guidance in future periods. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found on the IR website at quantaservices.com. 
Looking back on our 2020 performance, although there were headwinds to the year, we ended the year with $11.2 billion in revenues, which represents an 8.1% revenue CAGR since 2015. More importantly, we ended the year with slightly over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a record for Quanta and equal to our goal established 5 years ago, which represents a nearly 15% CAGR since 2015. 
Lastly, our record adjusted EPS of $3.82 represents a 28% CAGR since 2015, with our adjusted EPS growing faster than profits, which are growing faster than revenues. Over the last 5 years, we have deployed approximately $1.4 billion in cash for M&A and strategic investments and $760 million for stock repurchases. While we acquired $250 million of common stock in 2020 and $7 million of common stock through February 24, 2021, we have approximately $530 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. 
Our first capital priority remains supporting the growth of our business through working capital and capital expenditures, however, we remain committed to the deployment of remaining available capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs, and we continue to expect opportunistic acquisitions. 
Our $1 billion bond offering in 2020 established a fixed level of debt that nicely complements our current EBITDA profile, which we believe is a repeatable, sustainable baseline of earnings. Simultaneously, we secured an expanded credit facility, further enhancing our ability to meet incremental capital needs. 
Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our operations, our prospects for profitable growth and the repeatable and sustained nature of our core markets. We've developed a platform for Quanta to capitalize on the trends driving the spend in our markets, and we firmly believe delivering base business solutions through world-class craft skill labor, opportunistic larger project deployments and continued balance sheet strength will be the key to delivering long-term shareholder value.

First, I think some of the grid hardening work that was particularly around fires that was kind of planned for 2020 has maybe been pushed off. Could you -- had been pushed off, can you comment on how you're thinking about that for 2021? 
And then just kind of any thoughts on some of The Biden Administration's goals around renewable energy and the potential for an Infrastructure Bill, sort of how are you thinking about: One, the potential for an Infrastructure Bill, and if you could see some grid-related initiatives there, given the administration's initiatives?"

When we looked at it last year, we knew in our mind, one of our larger utilities out there was coming out of bankruptcy as well as putting a management team in. They're still putting that management team in place. We said all along that we -- if we weren't working on that, we would be working somewhere in the West, that's still the case. It has not -- the demand for our services and what we're doing there from a solution provider to the wildfire assessment as well as the construction thereafter still remains. I think it's a long-term build in the west around hardening, modernization and all the things that are necessary when you want to move to more of a carbon-free environment. 
And when we look at that to the west, I think they're a little farther along in their anticipation of being there. So you're still backed up by quite a bit of gas in the region. So I continue to believe that we'll continue to see modernization of that infrastructure as well as hardening for wildfires to the west. 
And the way we looked at it this year is, we took a normal approach that we -- the same one we've taken in years past. And I -- if we're not busy on the wildfire piece of it, we'll be busy doing other things in the west. So I think all that's anticipated. If we start to move and expedite that, it would be in the later half of the year. And we comment on it as a move forward, move upward. So we took a prudent approach to that. 
As far as The Biden Administration, we've done well under both administrations. It doesn't -- whether it be Republican or Democrat are really agnostic to that. When we look at it, I think if they follow the energy plan of the 2030, 2050 type time frame as far as moving to a more carbon-free footprint, it certainly drives our business. I don't think that sentiment is going away. So we continue to see momentum around renewables and carbon-free types of environment, whether it be hydrogen, batteries, whatever it may be. We've got sentiments there. Administration certainly pushing that, and I think it's beneficial for Quanta on all fronts. So that's where we stand."

When we look at the industrial business, we have it as flat for the year. We do see signs of life there. If the economy comes back, we will get in a more normalized industrial sector and see more of the same type of work we've seen over our historical. 
So if you go back to '08 and '09 and you look, '08 and '09, after '08 and '09, we have very busy years in the industrial space. I expect that, that will happen. Nothing's changed there. I really like that business unit. I think we'll grow out of it. We have opportunities where others have left the space. So we continue to see greater opportunity than we've ever had there on a go-forward basis. We like it, and we'll continue to stay in it. 
So again, as Derrick commented, we do believe, if that gets back and you get in the upper single digits there like it's operated in the past, it will move the whole segment up. And that's what we see. So I -- we're committed to operating the segment in upper single digits. We're making strides to get there every day based on base business and repetitive and resilient type framework with growth to our LDC markets in our regulated markets, and that's backing that segment. 
I will say that the company itself is in a portfolio. And when you look at those individual segments or operating units that perform that work, it's not -- they can go perform electric work and do. They perform telecom work and do. So while it looks like, in a segment, you get -- you see it one way, it doesn't mean that we're not fully utilized as a company and we're not moving forward as a portfolio. So you see the overall margins of the company's lift, and we've always said that our goal for the company is to be double-digit adjusted EBITDA."

So what we're doing is making sure that our offices are fully utilized so what's driving the overall margins up of the company.

So those are 30-year builds. We like that business. We have put in the eastern seaboard, albeit it had some issues last year and just now starting to kind of come back to full-scale on the Eastern Seaboard.

And so it oftentimes contributes a little bit more into the first quarter than the normal aspect of our business. When you look at the modeling, I think what you'll find is for you to get to a 5.5% to 6% margin profile for underground based upon the breakeven to a small loss in the first quarter, you're going to have to see second, third and fourth quarters, operating effectively at around 7%. 
So it's really right now an exacerbated first quarter dynamic that's really creating the majority of the dilution, but otherwise, you're seeing margin execution of that remaining portion of the business, ex-industrial in the back half of the year, still at kind of that 7% type plus performance."

Thanks for the question. Yes. We had some weather here, for sure. And I want to say our employees, both at the corporate level and in the field, does a remarkable job of putting earnings out and being safe in the field and getting the lights back on. 
So that being said, when we look at that, I think you're going to have to have some redundancy, no matter what you do, the So whether it be if you're still back by gas, your pipe get froze out in West Texas. You're going to have to see some redundancy on the back-up the grid. And I -- whether you do it with batteries or new pipe, that's certainly there as well as transmission where you had load, you can't bring it out because you were constrained. 
So I think you're going to see transmission across North America. If we're going to go to more of a renewable sentiment state that's been stated, I've said it before and I'll say it again, the amount of transmission that's necessary to have a robust redundant system to back up intermittency is large in nature, much more than you can anticipate, if you go to a European-type environment where you see large corridors of transmission. 
So I think those spends stay there. Batteries will come into play at some point and be more of -- take some of that intermittency, but we're early in batteries as we move forward. So those kind of things to build that modern grid as you see electric vehicles come on, on the distribution system. Our infrastructure that we have today, we continue to need to invest to modernize. And you're going to -- our utility customers' CapEx and OpEx and as well as our regulators, we'll continue to put focus on those areas as we move forward."

It's early in my mind and hydrogen, we're still working on how that interacts in my mind with what's going on today. But we continue to see gas can utilize in new areas as well as replacements in our older areas to reduce methane emissions. So that's been something that has gone somewhat unnoticed is the methane emissions that it's caused today from leak prone pipe that's no longer there. So I think we're doing a good job of -- from the environmental aspect as well by replacing.

Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. 
As noted in our earnings release this morning, we have renamed both of our segments to include solutions, which we believe is an accurate word to describe the value-creating and collaborative approach we take to working with our customers. 
Additionally, we renamed our Pipeline and Industrial segment to Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions, which we believe is more reflective of the strategic changes we have made over the past 5 years to reposition the segment towards a greater level of resilient business services to our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial customers. These services tend to be more visible and recurring in nature and are driven by safety, reliability and environmental regulations. 
We continue to expand our capabilities in both segments to provide comprehensive end-to-end solutions with craft skill labor at the core. We are proud of our successful focus on base business activity over the last 5 years, which now accounts for more than 90% of our revenues. We continue to view large projects as upside opportunities and are well positioned to safely execute them when they occur. 
Quanta performed well and delivered a solid year in 2020, which includes numerous accomplishments. This was due to the performance of our field leadership and the people of this organization who continue to be exceptional. 
Here are some of the accomplishments in 2020: Electric Power segment revenues achieved record levels, and we earned our best operating margin performance in 6 years, driven by strong execution across our operations. Included in these results were record storm response revenues from supporting our customers' efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by numerous severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize this level of resources to support our customers in times of need, even during a pandemic is unmatched in our industry. 
After an 18-month competitive process, LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ATCO, was selected for a 15-year operation and maintenance agreement to operate, maintain and modernize PREPA's more than 18,000 mile electric transmission and distribution system in Puerto Rico. LUMA and PREPA are making good progress towards transitioning operations of the system this year, and we continue to believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta.
We grew our communication services revenue by more than 40%, meaningfully improved profit margins and ended the year with a total backlog of approximately $900 million. We substantially completed the exit of our Latin American operations, despite the significant challenges and impacts to these wind down activities from the effects of COVID-19. 
We continue to lead the industry in safety, which we believe starts with training. We continue to incrementally invest in our training efforts through our Northwest Line College and Quanta Advanced Training Center. 
Additionally, last year, we began site preparation for a new line worker training campus in Puerto Rico that will be operated by Northwest Line college. The facility will provide world-class training to LUMA's employees and develop Puerto Rico's future craft skill workforce. Our industry-leading training and recruiting initiatives are driving improved productivity in the field and ensures that we have the very best craft skill labor. This enhances our ability to collaborate with customers and labor affiliations on future workforce needs and further differentiate us in the marketplace as a strategic solutions provider. 
We invested approximately $400 million in strategic acquisition of 7 high-quality companies with great management teams that expand or enhance our ability to provide solutions to our customers, are additive to our base business and advance our strategic initiatives. These companies add to our self-perform capabilities, which typically accounts for approximately 85% of our work and are key to providing cost certainty to our customers. 
We believe our approach to acquisitions and our operating model helps derisk our work portfolio through improved execution and results in more consistent earnings. We strengthened our financial position with the closing of our $1 billion investment-grade senior notes offering, which we believe points to the resiliency and sustainability of our business model and positive multiyear outlook. 
We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and confidence in Quanta's financial strength and continued growth opportunities through the acquisition of approximately $250 million of common stock and a 25% increase in our dividend. 
And finally, the diversity of our services, proactive cost management and execution through significant uncertainty caused by the pandemic and challenged energy markets, allowed our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions operations to perform well under the circumstances. We are optimistic that the most challenging market conditions are behind us, and we see opportunity for revenue and margin improvement in 2021 and continue to believe the segment can achieve upper single-digit operating income margin as operating conditions further normalize over time. 
We believe our strategic position in the marketplace remains strong, and we are well positioned for continued profitable growth over the near and longer term. Despite unprecedented operating conditions and uncertainties caused by the global pandemic proportions of our business, the strong performance of our Electric Power and Communications Operations resulted in record adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and backlog in 2020. 
While we are proud of the achievements last year, we remain focused on getting better to ensure that Quanta continues to evolve to effectively collaborate with our customers and business partners and helping them achieve their goals and to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us. 
The recent severe weather conditions that impacted living conditions in Texas and other parts of the country shows how a critical infrastructure that we design, build and maintain is to our everyday well being. The solutions Quanta provides supports our customers' efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency and connectivity, all of which have a favorable environmental and social impact on both the markets that we serve and society. 
Additionally, our solutions facilitate policies and goals aimed at the adoption of new technologies and transitioning towards a carbon-neutral economy. As a result, we believe our business is levered to favorable and sustainable long-term goals. 
Our utility customers, who account for more than 70% of our 2020 revenues, are leaders in the effort to reduce carbon emissions with aggressive efforts to modernize and harden their systems, expand their renewable generation portfolios and implement new technologies for current and future needs. A number of utilities have committed to providing 100% of their power by clean energy or achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
Achieving these goals will require substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and distribution infrastructure to interconnect new renewable generation facilities to the power grid and to ensure grid reliability due to the significant increase of intermittent power added to the system. 
Further, developed economies are expected to be increasingly driven by electricity to meet carbon reduction goals over time. Vehicle electrification offers a large carbon reduction opportunity, in addition to residential and commercial space and water heating and industrial and agricultural electrification. 
According to a report from the WIRES Group, increased electrification and electric vehicle adoption in the United States could require 70 to 200 gigawatts of new power generation by 2030. The majority of which is expected to be renewables and could require incremental transmission investment of $30 billion to $90 billion by 2030. We believe these investment requirements associated with electrification are in addition to the significant multiyear investment programs already in place for the coming years to modernize the existing power grid, to ensure reliable power delivery under current market conditions. 
The outlook for our communications operations, which is within the Electric Power segment, remains bright. We expect to generate approximately $700 million in revenue this year, which would represent approximately 30% growth over 2020. 
Our communications services support the technology we use every day for work, education, entertainment, connecting with friends and family, all of which are critically important. To that end, the effects of COVID-19 have caused communication providers to increase investment in the fiber networks to ensure adequate speed, capacity and reliability to meet these needs. 
Additionally, we believe Quanta is well positioned to leverage our Electric Power and communication Solutions capabilities to assist many of our rural and municipal electric customers, who are expected to participate in the rural digital opportunity fund. This fund provides more than $20 billion to bridge the digital divide that exist for millions of people living in rural America without access to adequate broadband connectivity. Further, we expect 5G deployments to accelerate in 2021, which we remain well positioned to continue to participate in. 
Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment experienced meaningful challenges during the year to the effects of COVID-19, such as shutdowns in certain cities that had short-term impacts on our gas utility services and a significant reduction in demand for refined products that materially impacted our industrial service customers. 
As discussed previously, we believe the greatest impact from these dynamics are behind us. Going forward, we expect to continue our focus on our gas utility, pipeline integrity and industrial services businesses, consistent with our strategy over the last 5 years due to the favorable long-term trends, driven by safety, reliability and environmental regulations. 
Our gas utility services supported with regulated programs that will replace and modernize aging infrastructure, which can be leak prone and post potential safety concerns. They also support customer efforts to reduce methane emissions and position their gas distribution systems to potentially deliver hydrogen to users in the future. 
Our pipeline integrity services seek to ensure that existing pipelines operate safely and in an environmentally friendly manner. And many of our industrial services support customers compliance with regulations aimed at minimizing environmental impacts caused by methane gas release and increased operational efficiency and safety. 
We believe these favorable, safety, reliability and environmental initiatives and long-term industry trends, such as electrifications and technology implementations, will continue to drive growth opportunities for Quanta for the foreseeable future. 
Quanta is actively engaged in collaborative conversations with many of our customers about their multiyear, multibillion-dollar programs extending as far as 10 years, regarding how Quanta can provide solutions throughout our customers' value chain to meet their strategic infrastructure investment goals and support of these initiatives. 
In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2021 guidance. We believe -- which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute in our strong competitive position in the marketplace. Our expectations call for growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share and improved profit margins. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve new record levels of backlog in 2021. 
In summary, we generated solid results in 2020 that we believe will reflect the resiliency and sustainability of our business, the benefit of our strong financial position, the successful execution of our strategic initiatives and the excellence of our people. The challenges we faced and the way we continue to support and collaborate with our customers last year, particularly as it relates to the pandemic, brought out the best of this organization, and I believe, make Quanta stronger. 
Overall, our end markets and multiyear visibility are solid, and we have built a strong platform that positions us well to capitalize on favorable long-term trends, particularly the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy and the adoption of new technologies. 
Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions, strategic investments and dividends, we believe Quanta will continue to generate meaningful stockholder value going forward. 
Quanta is a portfolio of exceptional businesses with geographic and service line diversity. We are anchored by our commitment to craft skilled labor and our self-perform capabilities. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of the fourth quarter and full year results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?"
33509,703475678,2224404,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced fourth quarter 2020 revenues of $2.9 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $170.1 million or $1.17 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure,",2372,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced fourth quarter 2020 revenues of $2.9 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $170.1 million or $1.17 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.22. 
Overall, the fourth quarter closed out another exceptional year of operational performance for Quanta, a year in which we delivered record results across multiple metrics despite headwinds faced related to the pandemic. 
Our Electric Power revenues, excluding Latin America, were $2.11 billion, a 15.7% increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase was driven by mid single-digit growth in our base business, increased contributions from the timing of certain larger projects and $75 million in revenues from acquired businesses. 
Contributing to the base business growth was approximately 13% growth from our communications operations and record fourth quarter demand for our emergency restoration services of approximately $150 million, primarily associated with efforts to restore infrastructure in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States, although it came at the expense of certain other work in progress. Partially offsetting these increases was the expected reduction in fire hardening work in the Western United States during 4Q '20 as compared to 4Q '19. 
Electric segment margins in 4Q '20 were 11.6%. And excluding our Latin American operations, segment margins were 12.9% versus 9% in 4Q '19. The robust operating margins were driven by increased profit contributions from the elevated emergency restoration services, which typically present opportunities for higher margins due to higher equipment utilization and fixed cost absorption as well as improved margins in our Canadian operations, primarily associated with certain larger transmission projects. However, although difficult to calculate the direct incremental effects, excluding revenues and profit from storm response efforts, our margins were still comfortably in double digits, reflecting continued strong execution across all of our Electric Power operations. Of note, our communications margins continue to improve against the prior year with a margin of 9% during the quarter. 
Regarding our Latin American operations, included within the Electric segment, we have substantially completed the wind down activities required to exit those markets. Our year-long effort to shut down our operations across the region was significantly impacted by COVID-19 dynamics as well as political and regulatory uncertainties and customer challenges, all of which contributed meaningfully higher losses than anticipated. 
In the fourth quarter, we took the additional step of reserving remaining property, equipment and inventory assets as the uncertain market conditions minimize likely recoveries upon disposition. As a reminder, we currently receive no tax benefit for losses in Latin America, so the $27 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.19. 
With minimal contractual obligations remaining, we feel comfortable that other than arbitration updates on the terminated Peruvian Communications Network Project, we will no longer provide commentary on Latin America. 
Revenues from our underground utility and infrastructure Solutions segment were $806 million, 36% lower than 4Q '19. Similar to prior quarters, expected reduced contributions from larger diameter pipeline projects contributed to the decline. The variability attributable to larger pipeline projects is why we've taken strategic steps to reposition our service offerings around more predictable utility-backed revenue streams. 
While we remain well positioned to opportunistically deploy resources for larger pipeline projects, we expect most future work will consist of smaller pipeline transmission and integrity-oriented projects. Additionally, the lingering negative impacts of COVID-19 have reduced some level of demand for broader services across the segment with the reduction in demand for refined products substantially contributing to reduced quarter-over-quarter revenues from our industrial operations. 
Operating margins for the segment were 5.1%. these margins were 190 basis points lower than 4Q '19, primarily due to reduced revenues as well as some degree of execution challenges during the quarter and costs associated with the exit of certain ancillary pipeline operations. These negative impacts were partially offset by net positive project closeouts, primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred suspension and milestone payments and the reduction of remaining contingency balances associated with the Atlantic Coast pipeline project, which was officially terminated on December 31, 2020. 
Our total backlog was $15.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, slightly higher than 4Q '19 and comparable to the third quarter of 2020, yet remains at record levels. 12-month backlog of $8.3 billion is an increase from both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2020. 
As a reminder, the LUMA joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment, and therefore, does not contribute to revenue and is not included in backlog. However, assuming an operating margin profile consistent with our Electric Power operations, LUMA's contribution over the 15-year operation and maintenance agreement would imply a backlog equivalent of more than $6 billion for Quanta. 
For the fourth quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure of $200 million. And although $381 million lower than 4Q '19, it was higher than we anticipated, driven by stronger profits in the quarter and a cash cycle consistent with our third quarter results. For the year, we generated record free cash flow of $892 million. 
Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 83 days for the quarter, which was comparable to the third quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2019. Cash flows in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 did partially benefit from the deferral of $37 million and $109 million of employer payroll tax payments permitted by the CARES Act with the payments due in equal installment at the end of 2021 and 2022. We had $185 million of cash at the end of the year with total liquidity of $2.2 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our credit agreement, of approximately 1.2x. 
Turning to guidance. We continue to deal with some level of COVID-19 uncertainty as we assess the near-term prospects of our operations, primarily in our underground utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, and we remain prudent with our expectations for 2021. However, as we look ahead to 2021 and beyond, we see the base business propelling multiyear growth opportunities for both segments. 
Electric segment revenues grew to $7.8 billion at the end of 2020, and we continue to see our base business providing mid-single to double-digit growth opportunities, coupled with some degree of increased contributions from larger projects, primarily associated with previously announced projects in Canada. 
In the aggregate, we expect Electric Power revenues to range between $8.3 billion and $8.5 billion, which includes expected revenues from our communications operations of around $700 million. As it relates to Electric Power segment revenue seasonality, we expect revenue growth in each quarter of '21 compared to 2020, with quarter-over-quarter growth in the first and second quarters, potentially exceeding 10%. 
We expect first quarter revenues to be the lowest of the year due to normal seasonal weather dynamics impacting certain construction activities. We expect the high end of our revenue range to represent greater revenue growth opportunities in the third and fourth quarters relative to 2020. 
We expect 2021 operating margins for the Electric Power segment to range between 10.1% and 10.9%, which includes contributions of approximately $29 million or $0.20 per share from the LUMA joint venture and earnings from other integral unconsolidated affiliates. LUMA is expected to contribute around $9 million in the first half of the year and then increasing in the back half of the year as we exit the front-end transition services period. 
Although we are proud of our overall Electric Power performance in 2020, our 11.6% margins, excluding Latin America, are above historical averages and are the highest since 2013, due in part to record annual emergency restoration service revenues of $450 million. 
As outlined in our accompanying slides, our 2021 expectation for margins for this segment are consistent with historical averages and are also based on expectations for more normalized emergency restoration service revenues of approximately $200 million, also in line with historical averages. 
As is typically the case, we expect that first quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, possibly slightly below 10%. However, we expect margin to increase into the second and third quarters and then slightly decline in the fourth quarter. We believe communications operating income margins, which have been dilutive to segment margins in prior periods, could be at parity with electric operations on a full year basis. 
The underground utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and the challenging energy market conditions. However, we are anticipating upper single-digit to double-digit revenue growth off of 2020 with full year revenues expected to range between $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion. Over 90% of our revenue expectations for 2021 represent base business with larger projects representing their lowest level of contributions in the last 7 years. 
From a seasonality perspective, we see first quarter revenues being our lowest for the year, likely more than 20% lower than the first quarter of 2020. This decline is primarily due to significantly reduced industrial service revenues compared to the record results in 1Q '20, as industrial customers are still dealing with lower demand stemming from decreased global travel activity associated with the pandemic as well as reduced contributions from larger pipeline projects. 
Revenue should then increase sequentially into the third quarter than seasonally decline in the fourth quarter. Quarterly revenues for the second through the fourth quarters are expected to be higher on a quarter-over-quarter basis as compared to 2020 with double-digit growth expected for each quarter. 
Operating margin improvement for the segment continues to be a focus for us. We see segment margins ranging between 5.5% and 6%, led primarily by continued execution within our gas LDC operations. Our full year margin expectations include a breakeven contribution from our industrial services operations in 2021 due to the continued challenging environment. However, to put our current segment margin guidance in context, if our industrial operations contributed at historical pre-COVID margin levels, our segment margin guidance would increase by over 100 basis points. 
Consistent with years past and similar to Electric Power, our first quarter traditionally has lower activity in the segment due to weather seasonality, which impacts our revenues and pressures margins. With current inclement weather across much of the U.S., further pressuring those operations, we expect first quarter margins between breakeven and a small loss. However, we expect solid improvement into the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. 
These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2021 annual revenues of $11.95 billion to $12.35 billion, and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between $1.09 billion and $1.19 billion. This represents 8% growth at the midpoint of the range when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. 
With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $3.16 and $3.66, and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.02 and $4.52. 
Turning to cash flow. We expect free cash flow for 2021 to range between $400 million and $600 million with the standard disclaimer that quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that occur in the normal course of operations. Included in our free cash flow expectation is the anticipated payment of $54 million in the fourth quarter related to payroll taxes that were deferred in 2020. 
As we have discussed during prior investor events, our cash flow generation moves counter to our revenue growth rate. For instance, a large driver of our significant free cash flow in 2020 was reduced revenues of approximately $900 million compared to 2019, decreasing working capital needs. However, higher revenue growth, like we're guiding for 2021, will like to require a meaningful investment in working capital to support the growth. 
While our 2021 free cash flow may be negatively impacted by increased working capital required to support our return to 2019 revenue levels, we believe the consistent, sustainable growth profile and solid margins of our base business provides for repeatable levels of free cash flow generation in line with our 2021 guidance in future periods. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found on the IR website at quantaservices.com. 
Looking back on our 2020 performance, although there were headwinds to the year, we ended the year with $11.2 billion in revenues, which represents an 8.1% revenue CAGR since 2015. More importantly, we ended the year with slightly over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a record for Quanta and equal to our goal established 5 years ago, which represents a nearly 15% CAGR since 2015. 
Lastly, our record adjusted EPS of $3.82 represents a 28% CAGR since 2015, with our adjusted EPS growing faster than profits, which are growing faster than revenues. Over the last 5 years, we have deployed approximately $1.4 billion in cash for M&A and strategic investments and $760 million for stock repurchases. While we acquired $250 million of common stock in 2020 and $7 million of common stock through February 24, 2021, we have approximately $530 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. 
Our first capital priority remains supporting the growth of our business through working capital and capital expenditures, however, we remain committed to the deployment of remaining available capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs, and we continue to expect opportunistic acquisitions. 
Our $1 billion bond offering in 2020 established a fixed level of debt that nicely complements our current EBITDA profile, which we believe is a repeatable, sustainable baseline of earnings. Simultaneously, we secured an expanded credit facility, further enhancing our ability to meet incremental capital needs. 
Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our operations, our prospects for profitable growth and the repeatable and sustainable nature of our core markets. We've developed a platform for Quanta to capitalize on the trends driving the spend in our markets, and we firmly believe delivering base business solutions through world-class craft skill labor, opportunistic larger project deployments and continued balance sheet strength will be the key to delivering long-term shareholder value.

They're still putting that mana",401,"Yes. So I'll take the wild part of question to the West first. When we looked at it last year, we knew in our mind, one of our larger utilities out there was coming out of bankruptcy as well as putting a management team in. They're still putting that management team in place. We said all along that we -- if we weren't working on that, we would be working somewhere in the west, that's still the case. It has not -- the demand for our services and what we're doing there from a solution provider to the wildfire assessment as well as the construction thereafter still remains. I think it's a long-term build in the west around hardening, modernization and all the things that are necessary when you want to move to more of a carbon-free environment. 
And when we look at that to the west, I think they're a little farther along in their anticipation of being there. So you're still backed up by quite a bit of gas in the region. So I continue to believe that we'll continue to see modernization of that infrastructure as well as hardening for wildfires to the west. 
And the way we looked at it this year is, we took a normal approach that we -- the same one we've taken in years past. And I -- if we're not busy on the wildfire piece of it, we'll be busy doing other things in the west. So I think all that's anticipated. If we start to move and expedite that, it would be in the later half of the year. And we comment on it as it move forward, move upward. So we took a prudent approach to that. 
As far as The Biden Administration, we've done well under both administrations. It doesn't -- whether it be Republican or Democrat we're really agnostic to that. When we look at it, I think if they follow the energy plan of the 2030, 2050 type time frame as far as moving to a more carbon-free footprint, it certainly drives our business. I don't think that sentiment is going away. So we continue to see momentum around renewables and carbon-free types of environment, whether it be hydrogen, batteries, whatever it may be. We've got sentiments there. Administration certainly pushing that, and I think it's beneficial for Quanta on all fronts. So that's where we stand."

So I think when we look at the segment and look at what we're trying to accomplish there, we moved it away from large projects into more of a base business, and you see that happening, as we sit today. When we look at the industrial business, we have it as flat for the year. We do see signs of life there. If the economy comes back, we will get in a more normalized industrial sector and see more of the same type of work we've seen over our historical. 
So if you go back to '08 and '09 and you look, '08 and '09, after '08 and '09, we have very busy years in the industrial space. I expect that, that will happen. Nothing's changed there. I really like that business unit. I think we'll grow out of it. We have opportunities where others have left the space. So we continue to see greater opportunity we've ever had there on a go-forward basis. We like it, and we'll continue to stay in it. 
So again, as Derrick commented, we do believe, if that gets back and you get in the upper single digits there like it's operated in the past, it will move the whole segment up. And that's what we see. So I -- we're committed to operating the segment in upper single digits. We're making strides to get there every day based on base business and repetitive and resilient type framework with growth to our LDC markets in our regulated markets, and that's backing that segment. 
I will say that the company itself is in a portfolio. And when you look at those individual segments or operating units that perform that work, it's not -- they can go perform electric work and do. They perform telecom work and do. So while it looks like, in a segment, you get -- you see it one way, it doesn't mean that we're not fully utilized as a company and we're not moving forward as a portfolio. So you see the overall margins of the company's lift, and we've always said that our goal for the company is to be double-digit adjusted EBITDA."

As Alex just asked, there is a little bit of M&A driving the revenue side so that would factor the revenue growth up just a little bit.

But in general, the market is there for us to continue to grow that business above the growth rate of the Electric segment for sure. 
So I think we see that going forward and our ability -- what's happening with the work is that's also going in our municipal electric customers. So it's allowing us even more opportunity to grow the business with even in our Electric side of the business.

I know before -- or historically, Duke, you talked about scale and perhaps not enough geographic diversification sort of weighing down on the margins in this business.

That being said, our crews aren't sitting. I mean, many times, they'll go and perform electric work. They'll do other things on the Electric segment. So you're seeing the overall margins of the company move up. No matter what class of work they do a bore rig, for example, can bore electric one day, gas the next and telecom the next. 
So what we're doing is making sure that our offices are fully utilized so what's driving the overall margins up of the company. And we do anticipate that as we continue to grow out a utility side of that LDC business with integrity and pipe replacements that, that will continue to be the largest piece of the segment as well as move up our margin profile and resiliency of the business as we go forward. 
So those are 30-year builds. We like that business. We have put in the eastern seaboard, albeit it had some issues last year and just now starting to kind of come back to full-scale on the Eastern Seaboard. So I think when we see all that come together, you're going to start to see it move up fairly rapidly. 
I do think the industrial business, we -- when we acquired Stronghold, it was around $500 million. We had anticipated that growing to $1 billion at some point, but that is back to more normalized what we would. So when we look at that piece going forward, we like the pieces that are there. They're critical path infrastructure. We've not scaled back to operate at the $500 million mark. We still believe, when this moves out, that there's greater opportunity for us. So we are holding on to some people to make sure that we can fulfill the customers' needs as we move forward. 
So there is a little drag on margin there in the industrial business by design. We've done it before in other areas. I think it's the right thing to do for the long-term vision that we have for that group."

Relative to the differential revenue, Duke commented it effectively, think about it like a couple of hundred million dollars. But I think another point that's worth noting is 2021 expectations are exacerbated by kind of a first quarter effect. Industrial is counter-seasonal. And so it oftentimes contributes a little bit more into the first quarter than the normal aspect of our business. When you look at the modeling, I think what you'll find is for you to get to a 5.5% to 6% margin profile for underground based upon the breakeven to a small loss in the first quarter, you're going to have to see second, third and fourth quarters, operating effectively at around 7%. 
So it's really right now an exacerbated first quarter dynamic that's really creating the majority of the dilution, but otherwise, you're seeing margin execution of that remaining portion of the business, ex-industrial in the back half of the year, still at kind of that 7% type plus performance."

And I want to say our employees, both at the corporate level and in the field, did a remarkable job of putting earnings out and being safe in the field and getting the lights back on. 
So that being said, when we look at that, I think you're going to have to have some redundancy, no matter what you do, due to the intermittency. So whether it be if you're still backed by gas, your pipe get froze out in West Texas. You're going to have to see some redundancy on to back-up the grid. And I -- whether you do it with batteries or new pipe, that's certainly there as well as transmission where you had load, you can't bring it out because you were constrained. 
So I think you're going to see transmission across North America. If we're going to go to more of a renewable sentiment state that's been stated, I've said it before and I'll say it again, the amount of transmission that's necessary to have a robust redundant system to back up intermittency is large in nature, much more than you can anticipate if you go to a European-type environment where you see large corridors of transmission. 
So I think those spends stay there. Batteries will come into play at some point and be more of -- take some of that intermittency out, but we're early in batteries as we move forward. So those kind of things to build that modern grid as you see electric vehicles come on, on the distribution system. Our infrastructure that we have today, we continue to need to invest to modernize. And you're going to -- our utility customers' CapEx and OpEx and as well as our regulators, we'll continue to put focus on those areas as we move forward."

So that's been something that has gone somewhat unnoticed is the methane emissions that it's caused today from leak prone pipe that's no longer there. So I think we're doing a good job of -- from the environmental aspect as well by replacing.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chie",1305,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our first quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. 
This morning, we reported solid first quarter results with revenues of $2.7 billion in GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.62 and $0.83, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was a record $15.8 billion, which we believe reflects the continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. 
We continue to see opportunities for multiyear growth across our service lines, driven by our solutions-based approach and the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers. The recognition that the country's infrastructure needs to be modernized to support economic growth, improved safety and reliability and for a cleaner environment, is evidenced by the Biden administration's recently proposed $2 trillion infrastructure plan. The proposal will evolve and take time to move through the political process. But as proposed, the plan includes funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets, including high-voltage electric transmission and power grid modernization and resiliency, renewable energy, electric vehicle charging station infrastructure and other electrification initiatives and broadband infrastructure expansion. 
While this infrastructure proposal could accelerate activity in these areas and provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over several years, I want to stress that our positive multiyear outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on this infrastructure proposal. We have been collaborating with our customers for many years to support their significant multiyear investment programs already in place to modernize the existing power grid, ensure reliable power, delivery and to integrate higher levels of renewable generation. 
Our Electric Power Solutions operations performed well during the quarter, reflecting broad-based business strength, driven by ongoing grid modernization, system hardening, renewable energy interconnections and solid and safe execution. 
During the quarter, we signed a significant multiyear master services agreement with a utility in the Western United States, which made a substantial incremental contribution to our record first quarter backlog. We believe our record backlog and these initiatives will continue to drive multiyear growth opportunities for Quanta. 
Though COVID-19 has created some near-term challenges in Canada, we see opportunities to pursue additional large projects there for the coming years. Additionally, our discussions with high-voltage electric transmission project sponsors in the United States have increased as the need for large-scale electric transmission infrastructure to support growing renewable generation and achieve carbon-neutrality goals become evident. 
LUMA Energy and its employees, as supported by Quanta and its joint venture partner, ATCO, are all working diligently towards transitioning the operations and maintenance of the Puerto Rico electric power grid to LUMA in early June. LUMA's efforts under the agreement are intended to deliver long-term social and economic benefits to the people of Puerto Rico. 
As stated previously, we believe this opportunity is transformative for all the parties involved, including the people of Puerto Rico and the work to be performed by LUMA under the 15-year contract aligns with Quanta's strategy of providing sophisticated and valuable solutions to the utility industry that benefits consumers. 
The majority of our communications operations are off to a solid start this year, driven by strong demand for fiber densification to reach homes and businesses and the early stages of 5G network deployments. However, during the quarter, we experienced short-term challenges really associated with efficient subcontractor work in a specific geographic area, which required rework. We have addressed our quality assessment protocol shortcomings on this issue and are pursuing compensation from the subcontractor. This was an isolated issue, and we believe we are on track to generate high single or double-digit operating income margins for the remainder of this year. 
Additionally, we continue to believe we can achieve at least $1 billion in annual revenue with double-digit operating income margins in the medium term. As service providers continue to push fiber closer to the customer, fiber backhaul densification continues, 5G wireless infrastructure development increases and meaningful federal funding is provided for broadband network expansion initiatives in underserved markets. 
On prior calls, we have shared our belief that Quanta is uniquely positioned between the communications and utility industries to provide solutions for broadband and 5G technology deployments, leveraging existing infrastructure. We have made significant progress working with our customers and a broadband technology partner. And during the first quarter, made a minority financial investment in this partner. We also entered into a strategic alliance with them, where Quanta will serve as a program manager for large-scale deployments of their fixed wireless broadband technology, which we utilized our customers' facilities where appropriate. 
We believe this relationship advances our solutions with customers to accelerate and improve access to affordable and reliable broadband in rural and underserved markets. We believe our proactive strategy and the unique solutions Quanta provides the marketplace enhances our opportunity to expand our telecom infrastructure solutions with other utility and communication customers. 
Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well in the quarter with better-than-expected profitability despite seasonality and continued challenges caused by COVID-19. We are confident in our full year expectations for the segment, driven by solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity service. Additionally, there are encouraging signs supporting our expectations of improved demand for our industrial services beginning in the second half of this year. 
We believe deferred maintenance and capital spending due to the effects of COVID on the downstream market is creating pent-up demand for our services, which should prove beneficial as market conditions normalize for our customers. However, we would like to see how the summer travel season develops, which could influence activity levels of our downstream customers before making adjustments to our full year expectations for this segment. 
The solutions Quanta provides support our customers' efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency and connectivity, all of which have favorable environmental and social impact. Our end markets and multiyear visibility are solid. And we have built a strong platform that positions us well to capitalize on favorable long-term trends, particularly grid modernization and hardening, the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy and the adoption of new technologies such as 5G, battery storage and hydrogen. 
Previously, we have discussed our strategic focus on enhancing our front-end capabilities such as engineering and permitting. To complement our world-class construction expertise, our strategy is designed to provide differentiated, comprehensive and industry-leading solutions to our customers, which we have achieved through organic investment and select acquisitions. This strategy is contributing to our backlog growth, increasing our total addressable market and providing meaningful growth opportunities for the future. 
In our earnings release this morning, we raised our 2021 guidance due to solid first quarter results and confidence in the business. We believe this demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute and our strong competitive position in the marketplace. 
We continue to believe we are in a multiyear up cycle with continued opportunity for further record backlog and results in 2021. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. 
We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our first quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?"
33509,711413800,2272453,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced first quarter 2021 revenues of $2.7 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $90 million or $0.62 per diluted share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was",1225,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced first quarter 2021 revenues of $2.7 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $90 million or $0.62 per diluted share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.83. 
The first quarter was another strong quarter for Quanta, led by continued strength from electric power and better-than-expected profitability from our Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment. 
Our electric power revenues were $2.1 billion, a record for the first quarter and a 17% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued growth in base business activities as well as contributions from larger transmission projects underway in Canada and revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $70 million. 
Also, revenues associated with emergency restoration services attributable to winter storm response efforts were approximately $80 million, a first quarter record. 
Electric segment margins in 1Q '21 were 9.7% versus 7.3% in 1Q '20. The improved operating margins were driven by double-digit performance from our electric operations within the segment, including the benefit associated with increased profit contributions from emergency restoration efforts which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization. 
Operating margins also benefited from approximately $5 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. Negatively impacting first quarter margins were recorded reserves for the identified issues Duke discussed, which, when combined with normal seasonality, exacerbated by severe weather challenges from winter Storm Uri created an operating loss within our U.S. telecom operations for the quarter. Again, we believe we have addressed the issues and expect margins at or near double digits going forward. 
Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $643 million for the quarter, 35% lower than 1Q '20, due primarily due to reduced revenues from our industrial operations and a reduction in contributions from larger pipeline projects. Operations within this segment in last year's first quarter results had yet to be impacted by COVID-19 headwinds. And in fact, our industrial operations had record results in the period. 
In 1Q '21, the segment continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19, with first quarter revenues from our Canadian operations and our industrial operations both meaningfully below pre-pandemic levels. Despite the COVID-related headwinds, the segment delivered margins of 1.4%. And although 170 basis points lower than 1Q '20, primarily due to the reduced revenues, the results exceeded our original expectations for 1Q, led by execution across much of our base business activity, including our gas distribution and industrial services. 
Our total backlog was a record $15.8 billion at the end of the first quarter with 12-month backlog of $8.9 billion, representing solid increases when compared to year-end as well as the first quarter of 2020. This marks the third consecutive quarter where we posted record backlog, a trend driven primarily by continued growth in multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe continues to validate the repeatable, sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. 
For the first quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $49 million, $115 million lower than 1Q '20, however, 1Q '20 included the collection of $82 million of insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of 2 pipeline project claims. 
Day sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 89 days for the first quarter, an increase of 4 days compared to the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of 6 days compared to December 31, 2020. These increases are primarily due to the expected ramp in work on 2 larger electric transmission projects in Canada in the first quarter and the timing of billing. The Canadian response to COVID has significantly hampered production, for which we will seek recovery and delayed this in meeting certain billing milestones. 
We had approximately $200 million of cash at the end of the quarter, with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our credit agreement of approximately 1.3x. 
Integration activities associated with acquisitions closed in the back half of 2020 are ongoing, and we closed another small acquisition during the first quarter of 2021. We continue to take an opportunistic view towards acquisitions and maintain the balance sheet strength to support strategic capital outlays in this area. Additionally, through the date of this earnings release, we acquired approximately $29 million worth of stock as part of our repurchase program. We remain committed to delivering shareholder value through prudent capital deployment. 
Turning to guidance. Based on the Electric segment's strong first quarter and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased the low end of our full year expectations for segment revenues, resulting in a range between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion for 2021. Similarly, we are increasing the low end of our full year margin range for the segment with 2021 operating margins now expected to range between 10.2% and 10.9%. 
Regarding the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, while we had a nice start to the year, we are not yet in a position to change our full year expectations. Accordingly, we are reiterating our original full year guidance for the segment, with revenues expected to range between $3.65 billion and $3.85 billion and segment margins ranging between 5.5% and 6%. These segment operating ranges support our increased expectations for 2021 annual revenues of between $12.05 billion to $12.35 billion, and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. The midpoint of the range represents 10% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. 
In addition to these improved operating expectations, our full year expectations for net income and adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, are expected to benefit from a reduced annual tax rate, driven by higher benefits realized in the first quarter associated with the fair value of vested stock compensation awards. We now expect our full year tax rate to range between 25.25% and 25.75%. As a result, our increased expectation for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.25 and $3.69, and our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, is now between $4.12 and $4.57. 
We are maintaining our free cash flow guidance for the year, expecting it to range between $400 million and $600 million. And we'll reiterate that quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. 
Overall, we are pleased with the start to the year and remain confident in the strength of our operations and prospects for profitable growth. As our backlog continues to grow and our visibility into the duration of this infrastructure cycle continues to improve, we have increasing conviction in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities across our end markets. 
We firmly believe the repeatable nature of our base business solutions, coupled with opportunistic larger project deployments, disciplined capital allocation and continued balance sheet strength will be the key to delivering long-term shareholder value.  This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?"

Oftentimes, it comes down to the way that the weather patterns impact the year, more specifically in the fourth quarter. 
The fourth quarter is where substantial types of increment weather can come in and really impact the type of dynamic. Let alone the fact that through the year, we work in a range of circumstances, creating volatility. So we think it's always prudent to recognize those circumstances. But what I would also say is we think we have a tendency to execute throughout. I think also, as we've seen us do the last few years. 
So as we stand here today, we think our business model is intact. We think we continue to do the margin improvements that we think are available to us. But it's just the right thing to do to recognize the volatility of what we're working."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll turn -- then turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our first quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. 
This morning, we reported solid first quarter results with revenues of $2.7 billion in GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.62 and $0.83, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was a record $15.8 billion, which we believe reflects the continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. 
We continue to see opportunities for multiyear growth across our service lines, driven by our solutions-based approach and the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers. The recognition that the country's infrastructure needs to be modernized to support economic growth, improved safety and reliability and for a cleaner environment, is evidenced by the Biden administration's recently proposed $2 trillion infrastructure plan. The proposal will evolve and take time to move through the political process. But as proposed, the plan includes funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets, including high-voltage electric transmission and power grid modernization and resiliency, renewable energy, electric vehicle charging station infrastructure and other electrification initiatives and broadband infrastructure expansion. 
While this infrastructure proposal could accelerate activity in these areas and provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over several years, I want to stress that our positive multiyear outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on this infrastructure proposal. We have been collaborating with our customers for many years to support their significant multiyear investment programs already in place to modernize the existing power grid, ensure reliable power, delivery and to integrate higher levels of renewable generation. 
Our Electric Power Solutions operations performed well during the quarter, reflecting broad-based business strength, driven by ongoing grid modernization, system hardening, renewable energy interconnections and solid and safe execution. 
During the quarter, we signed a significant multiyear master services agreement with a utility in the Western United States, which made a substantial incremental contribution to our record first quarter backlog. We believe our record backlog and these initiatives will continue to drive multiyear growth opportunities for Quanta. 
Though COVID-19 has created some near-term challenges in Canada, we see opportunities to pursue additional large projects there for the coming years. Additionally, our discussions with high-voltage electric transmission project sponsors in the United States have increased as the need for large-scale electric transmission infrastructure to support growing renewable generation and achieve carbon-neutrality goals become evident. 
LUMA Energy and its employees, as supported by Quanta and its joint venture partner, ATCO, are all working diligently towards transitioning the operations and maintenance of the Puerto Rico electric power grid to LUMA in early June. LUMA's efforts under the agreement are intended to deliver long-term social and economic benefits to the people of Puerto Rico. 
As stated previously, we believe this opportunity is transformative for all the parties involved, including the people of Puerto Rico and the work to be performed by LUMA under the 15-year contract aligns with Quanta's strategy of providing sophisticated and valuable solutions to the utility industry that benefits consumers. 
The majority of our communications operations are off to a solid start this year, driven by strong demand for fiber densification to reach homes and businesses and the early stages of 5G network deployments. However, during the quarter, we experienced short-term challenges really associated with efficient subcontractor work in a specific geographic area, which required rework. We have addressed our quality assessment protocol shortcomings on this issue and are pursuing compensation from the subcontractor. This was an isolated issue, and we believe we are on track to generate high single or double-digit operating income margins for the remainder of this year. 
Additionally, we continue to believe we can achieve at least $1 billion in annual revenue with double-digit operating income margins in the medium term. As service providers continue to push fiber closer to the customer, fiber backhaul densification continues, 5G wireless infrastructure development increases and meaningful federal funding is provided for broadband network expansion initiatives in underserved markets. 
On prior calls, we have shared our belief that Quanta is uniquely positioned between the communications and utility industries to provide solutions for broadband and 5G technology deployments, leveraging existing infrastructure. We have made significant progress working with our customers and a broadband technology partner. And during the first quarter, made a minority financial investment in this partner. We also entered into a strategic alliance with them, where Quanta will serve as a program manager for large-scale deployments of their fixed wireless broadband technology, which we utilized our customers' facilities where appropriate. 
We believe this relationship advances our solutions with customers to accelerate and improve access to affordable and reliable broadband in rural and underserved markets. We believe our proactive strategy and the unique solutions Quanta provides the marketplace enhances our opportunity to expand our telecom infrastructure solutions with other utility and communication customers. 
Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment performed well in the quarter with better-than-expected profitability despite seasonality and continued challenges caused by COVID-19. We are confident in our full year expectations for the segment, driven by solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity service. Additionally, there are encouraging signs supporting our expectations of improved demand for our industrial services beginning in the second half of this year. 
We believe deferred maintenance and capital spending due to the effects of COVID on the downstream market is creating pent-up demand for our services, which should prove beneficial as market conditions normalize for our customers. However, we would like to see how the summer travel season develops, which could influence activity levels of our downstream customers before making adjustments to our full year expectations for this segment. 
The solutions Quanta provides support our customers' efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency and connectivity, all of which have favorable environmental and social impact. Our end markets and multiyear visibility are solid. And we have built a strong platform that positions us well to capitalize on favorable long-term trends, particularly grid modernization and hardening, the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy and the adoption of new technologies such as 5G, battery storage and hydrogen. 
Previously, we have discussed our strategic focus on enhancing our front-end capabilities such as engineering and permitting. To complement our world-class construction expertise, our strategy is designed to provide differentiated, comprehensive and industry-leading solutions to our customers, which we have achieved through organic investment and select acquisitions. This strategy is contributing to our backlog growth, increasing our total addressable market and providing the meaningful growth opportunities for the future. 
In our earnings release this morning, we raised our 2021 guidance due to solid first quarter results and confidence in the business. We believe this demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute and our strong competitive position in the marketplace. 
We continue to believe we are in a multiyear upcycle with continued opportunity for further record backlog and results in 2021. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. 
We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our first quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?"

Today, we announced first quarter 2021 revenues of $2.7 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $90 million or $0.62 per diluted share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.83. 
The first quarter was another strong quarter for Quanta, led by continued strength from electric power and better-than-expected profitability from our Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment. 
Our electric power revenues were $2.1 billion, a record for the first quarter and a 17% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued growth in base business activities as well as contributions from larger transmission projects underway in Canada and revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $70 million. 
Also, revenues associated with emergency restoration services attributable to winter storm response efforts were approximately $80 million, a first quarter record. 
Electric segment margins in 1Q '21 were 9.7% versus 7.3% in 1Q '20. The improved operating margins were driven by double-digit performance from our electric operations within the segment, including the benefit associated with increased profit contributions from emergency restoration efforts which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization. 
Operating margins also benefited from approximately $5 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. Negatively impacting first quarter margins were recorded reserves for the identified issues Duke discussed, which, when combined with normal seasonality, exacerbated by severe weather challenges from Winter Storm Uri created an operating loss within our U.S. telecom operations for the quarter. Again, we believe we have addressed the issues and expect margins at or near double digits going forward. 
Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $643 million for the quarter, 35% lower than 1Q '20, due primarily to reduced revenues from our industrial operations and a reduction in contributions from larger pipeline projects. Operations within this segment in last year's first quarter results had yet to be impacted by COVID-19 headwinds. And in fact, our industrial operations had record results in the period. 
In 1Q '21, the segment continues to be negatively impacted by COVID-19, with first quarter revenues from our Canadian operations and our industrial operations both meaningfully below pre-pandemic levels. Despite the COVID-related headwinds, the segment delivered margins of 1.4%. And although 170 basis points lower than 1Q '20, primarily due to the reduced revenues, the results exceeded our original expectations for 1Q, led by execution across much of our base business activity, including our gas distribution and industrial services. 
Our total backlog was a record $15.8 billion at the end of the first quarter with 12-month backlog of $8.9 billion, representing solid increases when compared to year-end as well as the first quarter of 2020. This marks the third consecutive quarter where we posted record backlog, a trend driven primarily by continued growth in multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe continues to validate the repeatable, sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. 
For the first quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $49 million, $115 million lower than 1Q '20, however, 1Q '20 included the collection of $82 million of insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of 2 pipeline project claims. 
Day sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 89 days for the first quarter, an increase of 4 days compared to the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of 6 days compared to December 31, 2020. These increases are primarily due to the expected ramp in work on 2 larger electric transmission projects in Canada in the first quarter and the timing of billing. The Canadian response to COVID has significantly hampered production, for which we will seek recovery and delayed this in meeting certain billing milestones. 
We had approximately $200 million of cash at the end of the quarter, with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our credit agreement of approximately 1.3x. 
Integration activities associated with acquisitions closed in the back half of 2020 are ongoing, and we closed another small acquisition during the first quarter of 2021. We continue to take an opportunistic view towards acquisitions and maintain the balance sheet strength to support strategic capital outlays in this area. Additionally, through the date of this earnings release, we acquired approximately $29 million worth of stock as part of our repurchase program. We remain committed to delivering shareholder value through prudent capital deployment. 
Turning to guidance. Based on the Electric segment's strong first quarter and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased the low end of our full year expectations for segment revenues, resulting in a range between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion for 2021. Similarly, we are increasing the low end of our full year margin range for the segment with 2021 operating margins now expected to range between 10.2% and 10.9%. 
Regarding the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, while we had a nice start to the year, we are not yet in a position to change our full year expectations. Accordingly, we are reiterating our original full year guidance for the segment, with revenues expected to range between $3.65 billion and $3.85 billion and segment margins ranging between 5.5% and 6%. These segment operating ranges support our increased expectations for 2021 annual revenues of between $12.05 billion to $12.35 billion, and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. The midpoint of the range represents 10% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. 
In addition to these improved operating expectations, our full year expectations for net income and adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, are expected to benefit from a reduced annual tax rate, driven by higher benefits realized in the first quarter associated with the fair value of vested stock compensation awards. We now expect our full year tax rate to range between 25.25% and 25.75%. As a result, our increased expectation for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.25 and $3.69, and our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, is now between $4.12 and $4.57. 
We are maintaining our free cash flow guidance for the year, expecting it to range between $400 million and $600 million. And we'll reiterate that quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. 
Overall, we are pleased with the start to the year and remain confident in the strength of our operations and prospects for profitable growth. As our backlog continues to grow and our visibility into the duration of this infrastructure cycle continues to improve, we have increasing conviction in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities across our end markets. 
We firmly believe the repeatable nature of our base business solutions, coupled with opportunistic larger project deployments, disciplined capital allocation and continued balance sheet strength will be the key to delivering long-term shareholder value.  This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?"

So I know as you can see, we raised the low end of the guidance here for the first quarter to some way to comment to that we continue to think that there's strength in the business model itself. But we very regularly put through a range of guidance on an annual basis. That considers a low end because of the fact that we work in volatile workspace. Oftentimes, it comes down to the way that the weather patterns impact the year, more specifically in the fourth quarter. 
The fourth quarter is where substantial types of increment weather can come in and really impact the type of dynamic. Let alone the fact that through the year, we work in a range of circumstances, creating volatility. So we think it's always prudent to recognize those circumstances. But what I would also say is we think we have a tendency to execute throughout. I think also, as we've seen us do the last few years. 
So as we stand here today, we think our business model is intact. We think we continue to do the margin improvements that we think are available to us. But it's just the right thing to do to recognize the volatility of what we're working."

Steve, I think when you look at the business, our performance from a margin standpoint in the segment we did beat our expectations. I think we've raised the guidance on the year. We continue to do it. We look at it as a portfolio. We're getting operating leverage out of all of our offices, whether they're doing telecom, gas or electric. We're reporting in segments. We may run the offices a little different than that. 
Overall, the performance of the company is exceptional in the field. The model around telecom, it was an organic growth strategy around it. It does have probably 50% of subcontract. It's -- due to the fact that it ramps up and down, and we're not going to invest in something that just ramps like that because it continues to weigh on it, we want some balance in it. And the balance allows us to have some variable cost in our equipment and things of that nature. My returns are better that way in my mind. So that's the way we run the telecom business. And that's how we'll go forward with it. 
That being said, we did have a QA/QC issue in the quarter. We'll do a better job of catching that next time or now. For that matter and try to call back all we can. But all in all, I mean, we're performing really well across the board in my mind."

On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. 
As noted in our earnings release this morning, we have renamed both of our segments to include solutions, which we believe is an accurate word to describe the value-creating and collaborative approach we take to working with our customers. 
Additionally, we renamed our Pipeline and Industrial segment to Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions, which we believe is more reflective of the strategic changes we have made over the past 5 years to reposition the segment towards a greater level of resilient business services to our gas utility pipeline Integrity and industrial customers. These services tend to be more visible and recurring in nature and are driven by safety, reliability and environmental regulations. 
We continue to expand our capabilities in both segments to provide comprehensive end-to-end solutions with craft skill labor at the core. We are proud of our successful focus on base business activity over the last 5 years, which now accounts for more than 90% of our revenues. We continue to view large projects as upside opportunities and are well positioned to safely execute them when they occur. 
Quanta performed well and delivered a solid year in 2020, which includes numerous accomplishments. This was due to the performance of our field leadership and the people of this organization who continue to be exceptional. 
Here are some of the accomplishments in 2020: Electric Power segment revenues achieved record levels, and we earned our best operating margin performance in 6 years, driven by strong execution across our operations. Included in these results were record storm response revenues from supporting our customers' efforts to restore power to millions of people adversely impacted by numerous severe weather events during the year. Our ability to quickly mobilize this level of resources to support our customers in times of need, even during a pandemic is unmatched in our industry. 
After an 18-month competitive process, LUMA Energy, our joint venture with ATCO, was selected for a 15-year operation and maintenance agreement to operate, maintain and modernize PREPA's more than 18,000 mile electric transmission and distribution system in Puerto Rico. LUMA and PREPA are making good progress towards transitioning operations of the system this year, and we continue to believe this opportunity is transformative for Quanta.
We grew our communication services revenue by more than 40%, meaningfully improved profit margins and ended the year with a total backlog of approximately $900 million. We substantially completed the exit of our Latin American operations, despite the significant challenges and impacts to these wind down activities from the effects of COVID-19. 
We continue to lead the industry in safety, which we believe starts with training. We continue to incrementally invest in our training efforts through our Northwest Line College and Quanta Advanced Training Center. 
Additionally, last year, we began site preparation for a new line worker training campus in Puerto Rico that will be operated by Northwest Line College. The facility will provide world-class training to LUMA's employees and develop Puerto Rico's future craft skill workforce. Our industry-leading training and recruiting initiatives are driving improved productivity in the field and ensures that we have the very best craft skill labor. This enhances our ability to collaborate with customers and labor affiliations on future workforce needs and further differentiate us in the marketplace as a strategic solutions provider. 
We invested approximately $400 million in strategic acquisition of 7 high-quality companies with great management teams that expand or enhance our ability to provide solutions to our customers, are additive to our base business and advance our strategic initiatives. These companies add to our self-perform capabilities, which typically accounts for approximately 85% of our work and are key to providing cost certainty to our customers. 
We believe our approach to acquisitions and our operating model helps derisk our work portfolio through improved execution and results in more consistent earnings. We strengthened our financial position with the closing of our $1 billion investment-grade senior notes offering, which we believe points to the resiliency and sustainability of our business model and positive multiyear outlook. 
We demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and confidence in Quanta's financial strength and continued growth opportunities through the acquisition of approximately $250 million of common stock and a 25% increase in our dividend. 
And finally, the diversity of our services, proactive cost management and execution through significant uncertainty caused by the pandemic and challenged energy markets, allowed our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions operations to perform well under the circumstances. We are optimistic that the most challenging market conditions are behind us, and we see opportunity for revenue and margin improvement in 2021 and continue to believe the segment can achieve upper single-digit operating income margin as operating conditions further normalize over time. 
We believe our strategic position in the marketplace remains strong, and we are well positioned for continued profitable growth over the near and longer term. Despite unprecedented operating conditions and uncertainties caused by the global pandemic proportions of our business, the strong performance of our Electric Power and Communications Operations resulted in record adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and backlog in 2020. 
While we are proud of the achievements last year, we remain focused on getting better to ensure that Quanta continues to evolve to effectively collaborate with our customers and business partners and helping them achieve their goals and to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us. 
The recent severe weather conditions that impacted living conditions in Texas and other parts of the country shows how a critical infrastructure that we design, build and maintain is to our everyday well being. The solutions Quanta provides supports our customers' efforts to increase reliability, safety, efficiency and connectivity, all of which have a favorable environmental and social impact on both the markets that we serve and society. 
Additionally, our solutions facilitate policies and goals aimed at the adoption of new technologies and transitioning towards a carbon-neutral economy. As a result, we believe our business is levered to favorable and sustainable long-term goals. 
Our utility customers, who account for more than 70% of our 2020 revenues, are leaders in the effort to reduce carbon emissions with aggressive efforts to modernize and harden their systems, expand their renewable generation portfolios and implement new technologies for current and future needs. A number of utilities have committed to providing 100% of their power by clean energy or achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
Achieving these goals will require substantial incremental investment in transmission, substation and distribution infrastructure to interconnect new renewable generation facilities to the power grid and to ensure grid reliability due to the significant increase of intermittent power added to the system. 
Further, developed economies are expected to be increasingly driven by electricity to meet carbon reduction goals over time. Vehicle electrification offers a large carbon reduction opportunity, in addition to residential and commercial space and water heating and industrial and agricultural electrification. 
According to a report from the WIRES Group, increased electrification and electric vehicle adoption in the United States could require 70 to 200 gigawatts of new power generation by 2030. The majority of which is expected to be renewables and could require incremental transmission investment of $30 billion to $90 billion by 2030. We believe these investment requirements associated with electrification are in addition to the significant multiyear investment programs already in place for the coming years to modernize the existing power grid, to ensure reliable power delivery under current market conditions. 
The outlook for our communications operations, which is within the Electric Power segment, remains bright. We expect to generate approximately $700 million in revenue this year, which would represent approximately 30% growth over 2020. 
Our communications services support the technology we use every day for work, education, entertainment, connecting with friends and family, all of which are critically important. To that end, the effects of COVID-19 have caused communication providers to increase investment in the fiber networks to ensure adequate speed, capacity and reliability to meet these needs. 
Additionally, we believe Quanta is well positioned to leverage our Electric Power and communication solutions capabilities to assist many of our rural and municipal electric customers, who are expected to participate in the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. This fund provides more than $20 billion to bridge the digital divide that exist for millions of people living in rural America without access to adequate broadband connectivity. Further, we expect 5G deployments to accelerate in 2021, which we remain well positioned to continue to participate in. 
Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment experienced meaningful challenges during the year to the effects of COVID-19, such as shutdowns in certain cities that had short-term impacts on our gas utility services and a significant reduction in demand for refined products that materially impacted our industrial service customers. 
As discussed previously, we believe the greatest impact from these dynamics are behind us. Going forward, we expect to continue our focus on our gas utility pipeline Integrity and industrial services businesses, consistent with our strategy over the last 5 years due to the favorable long-term trends, driven by safety, reliability and environmental regulations. 
Our gas utility services supported with regulated programs that will replace and modernize aging infrastructure, which can be leak prone and pose potential safety concerns. They also support customer efforts to reduce methane emissions and position their gas distribution systems to potentially deliver hydrogen to users in the future. 
Our pipeline Integrity services seek to ensure that existing pipelines operate safely and in an environmentally friendly manner. And many of our industrial services support customers compliance with regulations aimed at minimizing environmental impacts caused by methane gas release and increased operational efficiency and safety. 
We believe these favorable, safety, reliability and environmental initiatives and long-term industry trends, such as electrifications and technology implementations, will continue to drive growth opportunities for Quanta for the foreseeable future. 
Quanta is actively engaged in collaborative conversations with many of our customers about their multiyear, multibillion-dollar programs extending as far as 10 years, regarding how Quanta can provide solutions throughout our customers' value chain to meet their strategic infrastructure investment goals and support of these initiatives. 
In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2021 guidance. We believe -- which we believe demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, favorable end market trends, our ability to safely execute in our strong competitive position in the marketplace. Our expectations call for growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share and improved profit margins. Additionally, we see opportunity to achieve new record levels of backlog in 2021. 
In summary, we generated solid results in 2020 that we believe reflect the resiliency and sustainability of our business, the benefit of our strong financial position, the successful execution of our strategic initiatives and the excellence of our people. The challenges we faced and the way we continue to support and collaborate with our customers last year, particularly as it relates to the pandemic, brought out the best of this organization, and I believe, make Quanta stronger. 
Overall, our end markets and multiyear visibility are solid, and we have built a strong platform that positions us well to capitalize on favorable long-term trends, particularly the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy and the adoption of new technologies. 
Considering our organic growth opportunities and the levers available to us to allocate future cash flow generation into creating opportunities such as stock repurchases, acquisitions, strategic investments and dividends, we believe Quanta will continue to generate meaningful stockholder value going forward. 
Quanta is a portfolio of exceptional businesses with geographic and service line diversity. We are anchored by our commitment to craft skilled labor and our self-perform capabilities. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of the fourth quarter and full year results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?"

Net income attributable to common stock was $170.1 million or $1.17 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure,",2372,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced fourth quarter 2020 revenues of $2.9 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $170.1 million or $1.17 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.22. 
Overall, the fourth quarter closed out another exceptional year of operational performance for Quanta, a year in which we delivered record results across multiple metrics despite headwinds faced related to the pandemic. 
Our Electric Power revenues, excluding Latin America, were $2.11 billion, a 15.7% increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase was driven by mid single-digit growth in our base business, increased contributions from the timing of certain larger projects and $75 million in revenues from acquired businesses. 
Contributing to the base business growth was approximately 13% growth from our communications operations and record fourth quarter demand for our emergency restoration services of approximately $150 million, primarily associated with efforts to restore infrastructure in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States, although it came at the expense of certain other work in progress. Partially offsetting these increases was the expected reduction in fire hardening work in the Western United States during 4Q '20 as compared to 4Q '19. 
Electric segment margins in 4Q '20 were 11.6%. And excluding our Latin American operations, segment margins were 12.9% versus 9% in 4Q '19. The robust operating margins were driven by increased profit contributions from the elevated emergency restoration services, which typically present opportunities for higher margins due to higher equipment utilization and fixed cost absorption as well as improved margins in our Canadian operations, primarily associated with certain larger transmission projects. However, although difficult to calculate the direct incremental effects, excluding revenues and profit from storm response efforts, our margins were still comfortably in double digits, reflecting continued strong execution across all of our Electric Power operations. Of note, our communications margins continue to improve against the prior year with a margin of 9% during the quarter. 
Regarding our Latin American operations, included within the Electric segment, we have substantially completed the wind down activities required to exit those markets. Our year-long effort to shut down our operations across the region was significantly impacted by COVID-19 dynamics as well as political and regulatory uncertainties and customer challenges, all of which contributed meaningfully higher losses than anticipated. 
In the fourth quarter, we took the additional step of reserving remaining property, equipment and inventory assets as the uncertain market conditions minimize likely recoveries upon disposition. As a reminder, we currently receive no tax benefit for losses in Latin America, so the $27 million in losses impacted the quarter by approximately $0.19. 
With minimal contractual obligations remaining, we feel comfortable that other than arbitration updates on the terminated Peruvian Communications Network Project, we will no longer provide commentary on Latin America. 
Revenues from our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment were $806 million, 36% lower than 4Q '19. Similar to prior quarters, expected reduced contributions from larger diameter pipeline projects contributed to the decline. The variability attributable to larger pipeline projects is why we've taken strategic steps to reposition our service offerings around more predictable utility-backed revenue streams. 
While we remain well positioned to opportunistically deploy resources for larger pipeline projects, we expect most future work will consist of smaller pipeline transmission and Integrity-oriented projects. Additionally, the lingering negative impacts of COVID-19 have reduced some level of demand for broader services across the segment with the reduction in demand for refined products substantially contributing to reduced quarter-over-quarter revenues from our industrial operations. 
Operating margins for the segment were 5.1%. These margins were 190 basis points lower than 4Q '19, primarily due to reduced revenues as well as some degree of execution challenges during the quarter and costs associated with the exit of certain ancillary pipeline operations. These negative impacts were partially offset by net positive project closeouts, primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred suspension and milestone payments and the reduction of remaining contingency balances associated with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project, which was officially terminated on December 31, 2020. 
Our total backlog was $15.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, slightly higher than 4Q '19 and comparable to the third quarter of 2020, yet remains at record levels. 12-month backlog of $8.3 billion is an increase from both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2020. 
As a reminder, the LUMA joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment, and therefore, does not contribute to revenue and is not included in backlog. However, assuming an operating margin profile consistent with our Electric Power operations, LUMA's contribution over the 15-year operation and maintenance agreement would imply a backlog equivalent of more than $6 billion for Quanta. 
For the fourth quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $200 million. And although $381 million lower than 4Q '19, it was higher than we anticipated, driven by stronger profits in the quarter and a cash cycle consistent with our third quarter results. For the year, we generated record free cash flow of $892 million. 
Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 83 days for the quarter, which was comparable to the third quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2019. Cash flows in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 did partially benefit from the deferral of $37 million and $109 million of employer payroll tax payments permitted by the CARES Act with the payments due in equal installment at the end of 2021 and 2022. We had $185 million of cash at the end of the year with total liquidity of $2.2 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our credit agreement, of approximately 1.2x. 
Turning to guidance. We continue to deal with some level of COVID-19 uncertainty as we assess the near-term prospects of our operations, primarily in our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, and we remain prudent with our expectations for 2021. However, as we look ahead to 2021 and beyond, we see the base business propelling multiyear growth opportunities for both segments. 
Electric segment revenues grew to $7.8 billion at the end of 2020, and we continue to see our base business providing mid-single to double-digit growth opportunities, coupled with some degree of increased contributions from larger projects, primarily associated with previously announced projects in Canada. 
In the aggregate, we expect Electric Power revenues to range between $8.3 billion and $8.5 billion, which includes expected revenues from our communications operations of around $700 million. As it relates to Electric Power segment revenue seasonality, we expect revenue growth in each quarter of '21 compared to 2020, with quarter-over-quarter growth in the first and second quarters, potentially exceeding 10%. 
We expect first quarter revenues to be the lowest of the year due to normal seasonal weather dynamics impacting certain construction activities. We expect the high end of our revenue range to represent greater revenue growth opportunities in the third and fourth quarters relative to 2020. 
We expect 2021 operating margins for the Electric Power segment to range between 10.1% and 10.9%, which includes contributions of approximately $29 million or $0.20 per share from the LUMA joint venture and earnings from other integral unconsolidated affiliates. LUMA is expected to contribute around $9 million in the first half of the year and then increasing in the back half of the year as we exit the front-end transition services period. 
Although we are proud of our overall Electric Power performance in 2020, our 11.6% margins, excluding Latin America, are above historical averages and are the highest since 2013, due in part to record annual emergency restoration service revenues of $450 million. 
As outlined in our accompanying slides, our 2021 expectation for margins for this segment are consistent with historical averages and are also based on expectations for more normalized emergency restoration service revenues of approximately $200 million, also in line with historical averages. 
As is typically the case, we expect that first quarter operating margins will be the lowest for the year, possibly slightly below 10%. However, we expect margin to increase into the second and third quarters and then slightly decline in the fourth quarter. We believe communications operating income margins, which have been dilutive to segment margins in prior periods, could be at parity with electric operations on a full year basis. 
The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and the challenging energy market conditions. However, we are anticipating upper single-digit to double-digit revenue growth off of 2020 with full year revenues expected to range between $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion. Over 90% of our revenue expectations for 2021 represent base business with larger projects representing their lowest level of contributions in the last 7 years. 
From a seasonality perspective, we see first quarter revenues being our lowest for the year, likely more than 20% lower than the first quarter of 2020. This decline is primarily due to significantly reduced industrial service revenues compared to the record results in 1Q '20, as industrial customers are still dealing with lower demand stemming from decreased global travel activity associated with the pandemic as well as reduced contributions from larger pipeline projects. 
Revenue should then increase sequentially into the third quarter then seasonally decline in the fourth quarter. Quarterly revenues for the second through the fourth quarters are expected to be higher on a quarter-over-quarter basis as compared to 2020 with double-digit growth expected for each quarter. 
Operating margin improvement for the segment continues to be a focus for us. We see segment margins ranging between 5.5% and 6%, led primarily by continued execution within our gas LDC operations. Our full year margin expectations include a breakeven contribution from our industrial services operations in 2021 due to the continued challenging environment. However, to put our current segment margin guidance in context, if our industrial operations contributed at historical pre-COVID margin levels, our segment margin guidance would increase by over 100 basis points. 
Consistent with years past and similar to Electric Power, our first quarter traditionally has lower activity in the segment due to weather seasonality, which impacts our revenues and pressures margins. With current inclement weather across much of the U.S., further pressuring those operations, we expect first quarter margins between breakeven and a small loss. However, we expect solid improvement into the second and third quarters with a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. 
These segment operating ranges support our expectation for 2021 annual revenues of $11.95 billion to $12.35 billion, and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between $1.09 billion and $1.19 billion. This represents 8% growth at the midpoint of the range when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. 
With these operating results, we estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $3.16 and $3.66, and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.02 and $4.52. 
Turning to cash flow. We expect free cash flow for 2021 to range between $400 million and $600 million with the standard disclaimer that quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that occur in the normal course of operations. Included in our free cash flow expectation is the anticipated payment of $54 million in the fourth quarter related to payroll taxes that were deferred in 2020. 
As we have discussed during prior investor events, our cash flow generation moves counter to our revenue growth rate. For instance, a large driver of our significant free cash flow in 2020 was reduced revenues of approximately $900 million compared to 2019, decreasing working capital needs. However, higher revenue growth, like we're guiding for 2021, will likely to require a meaningful investment in working capital to support the growth. 
While our 2021 free cash flow may be negatively impacted by increased working capital required to support our return to 2019 revenue levels, we believe the consistent, sustainable growth profile and solid margins of our base business provides for repeatable levels of free cash flow generation in line with our 2021 guidance in future periods. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found on the IR website at quantaservices.com. 
Looking back on our 2020 performance, although there were headwinds to the year, we ended the year with $11.2 billion in revenues, which represents an 8.1% revenue CAGR since 2015. More importantly, we ended the year with slightly over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a record for Quanta and equal to our goal established 5 years ago, which represents a nearly 15% CAGR since 2015. 
Lastly, our record adjusted EPS of $3.82 represents a 28% CAGR since 2015, with our adjusted EPS growing faster than profits, which are growing faster than revenues. Over the last 5 years, we have deployed approximately $1.4 billion in cash for M&A and strategic investments and $760 million for stock repurchases. While we acquired $250 million of common stock in 2020 and $7 million of common stock through February 24, 2021, we have approximately $530 million of availability remaining on our current stock repurchase program. 
Our first capital priority remains supporting the growth of our business through working capital and capital expenditures, however, we remain committed to the deployment of remaining available capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase and dividend programs, and we continue to expect opportunistic acquisitions. 
Our $1 billion bond offering in 2020 established a fixed level of debt that nicely complements our current EBITDA profile, which we believe is a repeatable, sustainable baseline of earnings. Simultaneously, we secured an expanded credit facility, further enhancing our ability to meet incremental capital needs. 
Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our operations, our prospects for profitable growth and the repeatable and sustainable nature of our core markets. We've developed a platform for Quanta to capitalize on the trends driving the spend in our markets, and we firmly believe delivering base business solutions through world-class craft skill labor, opportunistic larger project deployments and continued balance sheet strength will be the key to delivering long-term shareholder value.

When we looked at it last year, we knew in our mind, one of our larger utilities out there was coming out of bankruptcy as well as putting a management team in. They're still putting that management team in place. We said all along that we -- if we weren't working on that, we would be working somewhere in the west, that's still the case. It has not -- the demand for our services and what we're doing there from a solution provider to the wildfire assessment as well as the construction thereafter still remains. I think it's a long-term build in the west around hardening, modernization and all the things that are necessary when you want to move to more of a carbon-free environment. 
And when we look at that to the west, I think they're a little farther along in their anticipation of being there. So you're still backed up by quite a bit of gas in the region. So I continue to believe that we'll continue to see modernization of that infrastructure as well as hardening for wildfires to the west. 
And the way we looked at it this year is, we took a normal approach that we -- the same one we've taken in years past. And I -- if we're not busy on the wildfire piece of it, we'll be busy doing other things in the west. So I think all that's anticipated. If we start to move and expedite that, it would be in the later half of the year. And we comment on it as it move forward, move upward. So we took a prudent approach to that. 
As far as The Biden Administration, we've done well under both administrations. It doesn't -- whether it be Republican or Democrat we're really agnostic to that. When we look at it, I think if they follow the energy plan of the 2030, 2050 type time frame as far as moving to a more carbon-free footprint, it certainly drives our business. I don't think that sentiment is going away. So we continue to see momentum around renewables and carbon-free types of environment, whether it be hydrogen, batteries, whatever it may be. We've got sentiments there. Administration certainly pushing that, and I think it's beneficial for Quanta on all fronts. So that's where we stand."

If the economy comes back, we will get in a more normalized industrial sector and see more of the same type of work we've seen over our historical. 
So if you go back to '08 and '09 and you look, '08 and '09, after '08 and '09, we have very busy years in the industrial space. I expect that, that will happen. Nothing's changed there. I really like that business unit. I think we'll grow out of it. We have opportunities where others have left the space. So we continue to see greater opportunity we've ever had there on a go-forward basis. We like it, and we'll continue to stay in it. 
So again, as Derrick commented, we do believe, if that gets back and you get in the upper single digits there like it's operated in the past, it will move the whole segment up. And that's what we see. So I -- we're committed to operating the segment in upper single digits. We're making strides to get there every day based on base business and repetitive and resilient type framework with growth to our LDC markets in our regulated markets, and that's backing that segment. 
I will say that the company itself is in a portfolio. And when you look at those individual segments or operating units that perform that work, it's not -- they can go perform electric work and do. They perform telecom work and do. So while it looks like, in a segment, you get -- you see it one way, it doesn't mean that we're not fully utilized as a company and we're not moving forward as a portfolio. So you see the overall margins of the company lift, and we've always said that our goal for the company is to be double-digit adjusted EBITDA."

So I think we see that going forward and our ability -- what's happening with the ERCOT work is that's also going in our municipal electric customers. So it's allowing us even more opportunity to grow the business with even in our Electric side of the business.

So you're seeing the overall margins of the company move up. No matter what class of work they do. A bore rig, for example, can bore electric one day, gas the next and telecom the next. 
So what we're doing is making sure that our offices are fully utilized so what's driving the overall margins up of the company. And we do anticipate that as we continue to grow out a utility side of that LDC business with Integrity and pipe replacements that, that will continue to be the largest piece of the segment as well as move up our margin profile and resiliency of the business as we go forward. 
So those are 30-year builds. We like that business. We have put in the Eastern Seaboard, albeit it had some issues last year and just now starting to kind of come back to full-scale on the Eastern Seaboard. So I think when we see all that come together, you're going to start to see it move up fairly rapidly. 
I do think the industrial business, we -- when we acquired Stronghold, it was around $500 million. We had anticipated that growing to $1 billion at some point, but that is back to more normalized. What -- so when we look at that piece going forward, we like the pieces that are there. They're critical path infrastructure. We've not scaled back to operate at the $500 million mark. We still believe, when this moves out, that there's greater opportunity for us. So we are holding on to some people to make sure that we can fulfill the customers' needs as we move forward.

Relative to the differential revenue, Duke commented it effectively, think about it like a couple of hundred million dollars. But I think another point that's worth noting is 2021 expectations are exacerbated by kind of a first quarter effect. Industrial is counter-seasonal. And so it oftentimes contributes a little bit more into the first quarter than the normal aspect of our business. When you look at the modeling, I think what you'll find is for you to get to a 5.5% to 6% margin profile for underground based upon the breakeven to a small loss in the first quarter, you're going to have to see second, third and fourth quarters, operating effectively at around 7%. 
So it's really right now an exacerbated first quarter dynamic that's really creating the majority of the dilution, but otherwise, you're seeing margin execution of that remaining portion of the business, ex-industrial in the back half of the year, still at kind of that 7% type plus performance."

And I want to say our employees, both at the corporate level and in the field, did a remarkable job of putting earnings out and being safe in the field and getting the lights back on. 
So that being said, when we look at that, I think you're going to have to have some redundancy, no matter what you do, due to the intermittency. So whether it be if you're still backed by gas, your pipe get froze out in West Texas. You're going to have to see some redundancy on to back-up the grid. And I -- whether you do it with batteries or new pipe, that's certainly there as well as transmission where you had load, you can't bring it out because you were constrained. 
So I think you're going to see transmission across North America. If we're going to go to more of a renewable sentiment state that's been stated, I've said it before and I'll say it again, the amount of transmission that's necessary to have a robust redundant system to back up intermittency is large in nature, much more than you can anticipate if you go to a European-type environment where you see large corridors of transmission. 
So I think those spends stay there. Batteries will come into play at some point and be more of -- take some of that intermittency out, but we're early in batteries as we move forward. So those kind of things to build that modern grid as you see electric vehicles come on, on the distribution system. Our infrastructure that we have today, we continue to need to invest to modernize. And you're going to -- our utility customers' CapEx and OpEx and as well as our regulators, we'll continue to put focus on those areas as we move forward."

It's early in my mind in hydrogen. We're still working on how that interacts in my mind with what's going on today. But we continue to see gas being utilize in new areas as well as replacements in our older areas to reduce methane emissions. So that's been something that has gone somewhat unnoticed is the methane emissions that it's caused today from leak prone pipe that's no longer there. So I think we're doing a good job of -- from the environmental aspect as well by replacing.

On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary. And will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our second quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. 
This morning, we reported solid results with record second quarter revenues and earnings per share. Backlog of $17 billion at the end of the quarter was also a record, which we believe reflects the benefits of our collaborative approach with customers and the continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. 
We continue to see opportunities for multiyear growth across our service lines, driven by our solution-based approach and the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers. Our Electric Power Solutions operations had another strong quarter with record revenues and better-than-expected margins, reflecting solid and safe execution, favorable end market conditions and continued momentum as a result of ongoing grade modernization, system hardening and renewable energy interconnections. Our Electric Power backlog continues to increase, driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities which adds to the substantial MSA backlog growth from the first quarter. 
We are proud of our execution and confident in our strong market position to capitalize on the opportunities created by favorable long-term trends driving utility investment and demand for our comprehensive solutions. As an example, one of our largest electric customers in the Western United States recently announced a major new multiyear program to underground approximately 10,000 miles of electric distribution power lines and high fire-threat districts in the utility service territory. This initiative is in the planning stages and is expected to incorporate input from numerous stakeholders and be implemented over a number of years. 
While it may seem like a bold endeavor and unprecedented in its scale, the imperative to mitigate the risk of wildfires and the economic and human costs caused by them, as evidenced over the last several years in the Western United States, soon will outweigh the capital investment necessary to complete this kind of program. 
Electric utilities in other areas of the country are also pursuing initiatives to underground critical infrastructure. Examples include electric transmission projects in the Northeast, distribution circuits along the coast lines, electric transmission line projects for offshore wind generation and undergrounding transmission and distribution initiatives by other utilities in California. Many of these initiatives are part of a large-scale multiyear system hardening programs, which provide meaningful opportunities for Quanta. 
We continue to see accelerated renewable generation development and associated demand for our services, including transmission interconnects, substations and energy storage. Our customers continue to advance their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality in large part through increasing renewable generation investments. For example, we have begun work on what will become the largest solar power battery storage center in the world for a long-standing utility customer. We believe public policy and the positive general sentiment supporting a greener environment will drive North America's power generation mix increasingly towards renewables over the near and longer term. And as these dynamics continue to advance, demand for our services could accelerate. 
Related to these opportunities, we are actively pursuing larger high-voltage electric transmission projects associated with interconnecting renewable generation, which are scheduled to be awarded by the end of this year with work expected to begin in 2022. We believe Quanta is the industry leader in performing larger-scale high-voltage electric transmission projects in North America, with an industry-leading track record of safely executing for our customers on time and on budget, and we are well positioned for these opportunities. 
Additionally, we are experiencing accelerating activity and opportunities for our electric vehicle infrastructure installation and program management capabilities. We are in active discussions with several industry participants about managing the deployment of thousands of charging stations, both regionally and nationally. These are exciting and meaningful prospects but just part of the equation in our view. More importantly, we feel the market is underestimating the significant investment needed to modernize and expand the capacity of the electric distribution system to accommodate the mass deployment of retail and commercial fleet electric vehicle charging infrastructure. 
And finally, in June, LUMA Energy and its employees, as supported by Quanta and its joint venture partner, ATCO, commenced the operations and maintenance of Puerto Rico's electric power transmission and distribution system under a supplemental terms agreement, following nearly a year of preparation. 
In LUMA, we have created a purpose-built and effective operator for the Puerto Rico T&D system and the people of Puerto Rico. We remain steadfast in our commitment to continue to invest our time, expertise and resources to help drive efficient operations at LUMA as it works to deliver a modern, secure, resilient and affordable electric grid and to develop a highly trained, cross-skilled workforce for the future of Puerto Rico. 
Our communications operations performed well in the second quarter, and we continue to profitably scale and grow the business. As we discussed in our last earnings call, the subcontractor challenges we experienced in the first quarter were an isolated issue and did not continue into the second quarter. We are on track to generate high single- or double-digit operating income margins for the remainder of this year and remain confident in our ability to profitably grow our operations. 
Service providers continue to push fiber closer to the customer. However, backhaul justification is ongoing and 5G wireless infrastructure development is increasing. Further, in response to the meaningful federal funding being provided for broadband network expansion in underserved markets, we are seeing accelerated spending by our cooperatives and municipal electric customers who also provide communication services, allowing us to leverage our relationships to provide turnkey telecom solutions to them. 
On our first quarter earnings call, we announced a strategic alliance with and a minority investment in a broadband technology partner. Under our alliance agreement with them, Quanta is serving as the program manager for a large-scale deployment of their fixed broadband technology. To that end, we recently began the large-scale installation of their technology in several cities with opportunities to expand our technology into additional cities in 2022. We believe that Quanta is uniquely positioned between the communications and the utility industries to provide solutions for broadband and 5G technology deployments by leveraging existing infrastructure and our relationship and the demand technology provider is evidence of that. 
Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment generally performed well in the quarter. With the exception of a provision for the credit loss taken related to a customer that recently declared bankruptcy, which Derrick will discuss in his remarks. I will note, however, that this was not because of our performance or execution on the project and that even with the allowance, we were profitable on the work we perform. 
We continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, produce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. Our industrial services and -- are strengthening and should continue to do so through the balance of this year. Further, we expect continued recovery of our industrial services operations in 2022 due to the return of customer maintenance and capital spending that was previously deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market. Additionally, we were recently awarded more than $350 million of larger pipeline projects, primarily in Canada. We expect a portion of this revenue to be recognized this year with the majority of the revenue to be realized in 2022. 
Somewhat restraining the segment's recovery are heightened restrictions and concerns in Australia and Canada due to the surge of the Delta COVID-19 variant, and its effect on our operations in those countries. 
I hope that our comments this morning and from our prior call convey our confidence in the strategic initiatives we are executing on, the competitive position we have in the marketplace and our positive multiyear outlook. On our last earnings call, I commented that our positive outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on the infrastructure proposal being pursued in Washington, D.C. But if the bill were enacted, it could provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over the near and longer term. 
As many of you know, significant progress has recently been made on a bipartisan infrastructure package that includes funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets. By additional political steps are still required, we are encouraged by what we see in the most recently proposed legislation. We believe our business is strong, and we continue to have a favorable outlook for the rest of this year. As a result, in our earnings release this morning, we raised our 2021 guidance. We believe this demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, our ability to safely execute and our strong competitive position in the marketplace. 
We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2022 are gaining momentum, driven by our solutions-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with the existing and new customers, opportunities for larger electric transmission projects and the opportunity for recovery of certain portions of our business that have been affected by the global pandemic. 
On prior calls, we have discussed our strategy of enhancing our front-end capabilities such as engineering and permitting to complement our world-class construction expertise, which is designed to provide differentiated, comprehensive and industry-leading solutions to our customers. I am pleased to report that our strategy has been well received by our customers across our service lines and is allowing us to better support them and capture more of their programmatic spend. 
Our markets continue to evolve and strengthen, driven by longer-term favorable trends, including modernization, system hardening, electrification, carbon neutrality initiatives and the adoption of new technologies. Additionally, our customers and regulators increasingly understand that the rapid growth in renewable generation, electric vehicles and data-intensive technologies bring significant intermittency, which strains existing systems and creates challenges for planning the grids and networks of the future. For these advancements to be successful, infrastructure requires redundancy to ensure reliability. We believe the infrastructure investment necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment, which provides us with years of visibility and growth opportunities. 
And finally, an important part of our value proposition to all of our stakeholders is Quanta's commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. To that end, earlier this week, we published our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which discusses the company's accomplishments last year as well as our commitments to people, planet and principles. 
Quanta has a great ESG story to tell, and we are pleased with the progress we are making to provide increased transparency into our corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives. We are focused on operating the business for the longer term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe with Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?"

Today, we announced a record second quarter 2021 revenues of $3 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $117 million or $0.81 per diluted share.

Net income attributable to common stock was $117 million or $0.81 per diluted share. And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.06. 
Our Electric Power revenues were $2.1 billion, a record for the second quarter and a 20% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued growth in base business activities as well as contributions from larger transmission projects and revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $70 million. 
Electric segment operating income margins in 2Q '21 were 11% versus 10.3% in 2Q '20, led by continued execution strength, coupled with increased revenues, which contributed to improved equipment utilization and fixed cost absorption. Operating margins also benefited from approximately $7 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. 
Our communications operations, included within the electric segment, delivered mid-single-digit margins during the quarter. Due to some of the subcontractor and quality issues we identified in the first quarter, we transitioned field leadership on several projects, which led to more normalized margins during the quarter. Those transition activities have been completed, and we expect our communications operations will return the margins at or near double digits for the remainder of the year, similar to the second half of 2020. 
Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $852 million for the quarter, 19% higher than 2Q '20 due primarily to increased revenues from gas distribution and industrial services, partially offset by reduced revenues from larger pipeline projects. Our industrial operations and non-U.S. markets within this segment remain pressured by COVID-19 dynamics impacting core quarter revenues and margins. However, last year's second quarter results were more adversely impacted by pandemic-related disruptions. 
Second quarter operating income margins for the segment were 2.8%, 20 basis points lower than 2Q '20. Negatively impacting second quarter margins was the recognition of a $23.6 million provision for credit loss related to receivables from Limetree Refining, which declared bankruptcy in July 2021, and approximately 280 basis point impact on segment margins. 
Regarding the provision, our industrial operations had been providing regular turnaround and maintenance services when Limetree Refining's operations added St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands refinery for several years. Following operational difficulties experienced at the St. Croix refinery, refinery shut down operations during the second quarter. And shortly thereafter, Limetree Refining filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy process is in its early stages. However, given the uncertainty around the proceedings and the future operations of the same core refinery, we reserved a substantial portion of our outstanding receivables. We will continue to monitor the bankruptcy process and assess the likelihood of recovery as the facts and circumstances develop. This project began in 2018, and even after the charge remains nicely profitable. Excluding the impact of this provision, segment results were otherwise in line with our Q2 expectations. 
Our total backlog was a record $17 billion at the end of the second quarter with 12 months backlog at $9 billion, both of which represent solid increases when compared to year-end and the second quarter of 2020. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter where we posted record backlog, a trend that continues to be driven primarily by multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe continues to validate the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. 
For the second quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $126 million, $331 lower than 2Q '20. Net cash provided by operating activities during the second quarter of 2021, although largely in line with our expectations, was negatively impacted by increased working capital requirements related to the continued ramp up of 2 larger electric transmission projects in Canada and the timing that's associated with billings. 
The various work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation have created substantial inefficiencies and production delays. These have led to increased project costs, some of which have already been approved with the remaining amounts being pursued in normal course. Partially offsetting this was a favorable impact of increased earnings as compared to 2Q '20. 
The free cash flow generated in the second quarter of 2020 resulted from substantially reduced revenues and the corresponding reduction in working capital. Also during 2Q '20, we deferred the payment of both $58 million of federal and state income taxes and $30.7 million of payroll taxes. The federal and state income taxes were subsequently paid in July 2020, while 50% of the deferred payroll taxes are due by December 31, '21, with the remainder due by December 31, '22. 
Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 83 days for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 1 day compared to the second quarter of 2020 and comparable to December 31, 2020. We had approximately $212 million of cash through the end of the quarter with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our credit agreement, of approximately 1.2x. 
As we've discussed in the past, our first priority for capital allocation remains supporting the working capital and equipment needs of our operations. However, we remain committed to delivering shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions. Through the date of this earnings release, we've acquired approximately $58 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year as part of our repurchase program, and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. 
Turning to guidance. Based on the electric segment's strong performance through the first 6 months of the year and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased our full year expectations for segment revenues, resulting in a range between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion for 2021. Similarly, we are increasing our full year margin range for this segment with 2021 operating margins now expected to range between 10.5% and 11%. 
Our full year expectations for the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, however, have slightly moderated due primarily to a lack of visibility into new project awards that could contribute to the back half of 2021 from our Canadian and Australian operations. Accordingly, we are reducing our full year expectations for this segment, with revenue that's now expected to range between $3.5 billion and $3.65 billion, and segment margins ranging between 4.6% and 5.1%, which includes the $23.6 million or nearly 70 basis point negative impact on a full year basis, associated with the provision for credit loss recognized in the second quarter. These segment operating ranges support our increased expectations for 2021 annual revenues of between $12.2 billion and $12.45 billion, and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between $1.13 billion and $1.21 billion. The midpoint of the range represents 11% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. 
We now expect our full year tax rate to range between 24.25% and 24.75%, a slight reduction from our prior expectations due to favorable tax dynamics in the second quarter associated with certain deferred compensation items. As a result, our increased expectations for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.40 and $3.76, and our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, is now between $4.32 and $4.68. 
We expect cash generation associated with our increased expectations for our revenue and earnings will be slightly offset by higher working capital requirements in the second half of the year. And accordingly, we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance for the year, expecting it to range between $400 million and $600 million. 
As we stated in prior quarters, our quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. 
Overall, our core utility-based operations continue to execute at a high level, and we are well positioned to deliver solutions to meet the expanding capital and maintenance programs of our North American utility partners. We firmly believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle and our ability to train and deploy world-class craft-skilled labor differentiates us in the markets we serve. This craft skill foundation, coupled with our balance sheet strength gives us the ability to deliver industry-leading solutions to our customers while maintaining the ability to opportunistically deploy capital to deliver long-term shareholder items.

But right now, we can grow the company organically as well. We've done that with Puerto Rico. I think it's still unnoticed. It's still undervalued. The opportunity there that we got in service this quarter, it's just amazing what the company has done and the people of this company. So I just -- that opportunity is large, and we're proud of it.

So no issues there, and it would certainly be additive to anything we've talked about. 
But that being said, the sentiment around renewables and the interconnections and what's needed, I spoke to my script about redundancy. And it goes and recognize the way technology and the way EV and the way any kind of intermittency affects any kind of infrastructure that you need constant throughput. So data, electric, it doesn't matter. You need the redundancy if you're going to depend on it. And that's the issue is we haven't started really to get ready for EV and the monetization of the distribution system to handle electric vehicles is something that's just starting and has a long runway. So I think that, along with the great interconnects and the stacking effects that you see within the infrastructure bill will only support growth going forward in anything that we've said on a go-forward basis."

It was encouraging to hear you talk about the benefits of utilization because I would think that would only improve as the volume ramps up. 
Or is there a trade-off that's going to come in about investments that you need to make to support the growth that might be somewhat mitigating of that? Just curious how we think about sort of the structural margin direction from here."

So you're seeing that we're utilizing those offices also to work on gas, telecom from a margin standpoint and grab as much operating leverage as we can on a portfolio basis, so that's there. 
I think structurally, the thing that's different as you have the impacts of Puerto Rico, which Derrick can comment on, that is also driving that margin profile up. We are getting good utilization out of the resources, the funding capabilities are certainly helping us become more efficient. The training that we've put into -- that we've invested in with our line schools and how we're getting people to the field quicker is helping and deferring some of the later costs that we would normally see because we're getting it done upfront.

We'll work with the client, like we always have. And I do think it benefits us both near and long term. 
And no, it doesn't -- the effects of undergrounding something doesn't prevent someone from having maintenance. It does help with fire. It does help on certain things, but there will still be plenty of maintenance that does cut out trimming of trees, which we don't do. So -- but the maintenance on underground and transformers and wire and everything else that goes along with it is certainly there. We do it on a daily basis today. There's a lot of underground within the system today that we maintain, rehab, do many, many things within that realm of possibility. So I think the odds -- in the past, I would have said it didn't make sense to underground, but given the fact that what you're seeing with loss of life and the amount, the dollars that are spent on fire, I think it makes a lot of sense. It's a bold kind of big project. But when you think about what's going on, you're always under the gun of bankruptcy or something within fire, and it makes perfect sense.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Finan",1914,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our second quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
This morning, we reported solid results with record second quarter revenues and earnings per share. Backlog of $17 billion at the end of the quarter was also a record, which we believe reflects the benefits of our collaborative approach with customers and the continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. We continue to see opportunities for multiyear growth across our service lines driven by our solution-based approach and the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers.
Our electric power solutions operations had another strong quarter, with record revenues and better-than-expected margins, reflecting solid and safe execution, favorable end market conditions and continued momentum as a result of ongoing grade modernization, system hardening and renewable energy interconnections. Our Electric Power backlog continues to increase, driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities, which adds to the substantial MSA backlog growth from the first quarter. We are proud of our execution and confident in our strong market position to capitalize on the opportunities created by favorable long-term trends, driving utility investment and demand for our comprehensive solutions.
As an example, one of our largest electric customers in the Western United States recently announced a major new multiyear program to underground approximately 10,000 miles of electric distribution power lines and high fire-threat districts in the utility service territory. This initiative is in the planning stages and is expected to incorporate input from numerous stakeholders and be implemented over a number of years. While it may seem like a bold endeavor and unprecedented in its scale, the imperative to mitigate the risk of wildfires and the economic and human costs caused by them, as evidenced over the last several years in the Western United States, soon will outweigh the capital investment necessary to complete this kind of program.
Electric utilities in other areas of the country are also pursuing initiatives to underground critical infrastructure. Examples include electric transmission projects in the Northeast, distribution circuits along the coast lines, electric transmission line projects for offshore wind generation and undergrounding transmission and distribution initiatives by other utilities in California. Many of these initiatives are part of a large-scale, multiyear system hardening programs, which provide meaningful opportunities for Quanta.
We continue to see accelerated renewable generation development and associated demand for our services, including transmission interconnects, substations and energy storage. Our customers continue to advance their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality, in large part through increasing renewable generation investments. For example, we have begun work on what will become the largest solar power battery storage center in the world for a long-standing utility customer. We believe public policy and the positive general sentiment supporting a greener environment will drive North America's power generation mix increasingly towards renewables over the near and longer term. And as these dynamics continue to advance, demand for our services could accelerate.
Related to these opportunities, we are actively pursuing larger high-voltage electric transmission projects associated with interconnecting renewable generation, which are scheduled to be awarded by the end of this year, with work expected to begin in 2022. We believe Quanta is the industry leader in performing larger-scale high-voltage electric transmission projects in North America, with an industry-leading track record of safely executing for our customers on time and on budget, and we are well positioned for these opportunities.
Additionally, we are experiencing accelerating activity and opportunities for our electric vehicle infrastructure installation and program management capabilities. We are in active discussions with several industry participants about managing the deployment of thousands of charging stations, both regionally and nationally. These are exciting and meaningful prospects but just part of the equation in our view. More importantly, we feel the market is underestimating the significant investment needed to modernize and expand the capacity of the electric distribution system to accommodate the mass deployment of retail and commercial fleet electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
And finally, in June, LUMA Energy and its employees, as supported by Quanta and its joint venture partner, ATCO, commenced the operations and maintenance of Puerto Rico's electric power transmission and distribution system under a supplemental terms agreement, following nearly a year of preparation. In LUMA, we have created a purpose-built and effective operator for the Puerto Rico T&D system and the people of Puerto Rico. We remain steadfast in our commitment to continue to invest our time, expertise and resources to help drive efficient operations at LUMA as it works to deliver a modern, secure, resilient and affordable electric grid and to develop a highly trained, craft-skilled workforce for the future of Puerto Rico.
Our communications operations performed well in the second quarter, and we continue to profitably scale and grow the business. As we discussed in our last earnings call, the subcontractor challenges we experienced in the first quarter were an isolated issue and did not continue into the second quarter. We are on track to generate high single- or double-digit operating income margins for the remainder of this year and remain confident in our ability to profitably grow our operations.
Service providers continue to push fiber closer to the customer. Fiber backhaul justification is ongoing, and 5G wireless infrastructure development is increasing. Further, in response to the meaningful federal funding being provided for broadband network expansion in underserved markets, we are seeing accelerated spending by our cooperative and municipal electric customers who also provide communication services, allowing us to leverage our relationships to provide turnkey telecom solutions to them.
On our first quarter earnings call, we announced a strategic alliance with and minority investment in a broadband technology partner. Under our alliance agreement with them, Quanta is serving as the program manager for a large-scale deployment of their fixed broadband technology. To that end, we recently began the large-scale installation of their technology in several cities, with opportunities to expand our technology into additional cities in 2022. We believe that Quanta is uniquely positioned between the communications and the utility industries to provide solutions for broadband and 5G technology deployments by leveraging existing infrastructure, and our relationship with this broadband technology provider is evidence of that.
Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment generally performed well in the quarter, with the exception of a provision for the credit loss taken related to a customer that recently declared bankruptcy, which Derrick will discuss in his remarks. I will note, however, that this was not because of our performance or execution on the project and that even with the allowance, we were profitable on the work we performed.
We continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. Our industrial services and -- are strengthening and should continue to do so through the balance of this year. Further, we expect continued recovery of our industrial services operations in 2022 due to the return of customer maintenance and capital spending that was previously deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market.
Additionally, we were recently awarded more than $350 million of larger pipeline projects, primarily in Canada. We expect a portion of this revenue to be recognized this year, with the majority of the revenue to be realized in 2022. Somewhat restraining the segment's recovery are heightened restrictions and concerns in Australia and Canada due to the surge of the Delta COVID-19 variant and its effect on our operations in those countries.
I hope that our comments this morning and from our prior calls convey our confidence in the strategic initiatives we are executing on, the competitive position we have in the marketplace and our positive multiyear outlook. On our last earnings call, I commented that our positive outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on the infrastructure proposal being pursued in Washington, D.C. but that if the bill were enacted, it could provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over the near and longer term.
As many of you know, significant progress has recently been made on a bipartisan infrastructure package that includes funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets. While additional political steps are still required, we are encouraged by what we see in the most recently proposed legislation.
We believe our business is strong, and we continue to have a favorable outlook for the rest of this year. As a result, in our earnings release this morning, we raised our 2021 guidance. We believe this demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our business and long-term strategy, our ability to safely execute and our strong competitive position in the marketplace. We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2022 are gaining momentum, driven by our solutions-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with the existing and new customers, opportunities for larger electric transmission projects and the opportunity for recovery of certain portions of our business that have been affected by the global pandemic.
On prior calls, we have discussed our strategy of enhancing our front-end capabilities such as engineering and permitting to complement our world-class construction expertise, which is designed to provide differentiated, comprehensive and industry-leading solutions to our customers. I am pleased to report that our strategy has been well received by our customers across our service lines and is allowing us to better support them and capture more of their programmatic spend.
Our markets continue to evolve and strengthen, driven by longer-term favorable trends, including modernization, system hardening, electrification, carbon neutrality initiatives and the adoption of new technologies. Additionally, our customers and regulators increasingly understand that the rapid growth in renewable generation, electric vehicles and data-intensive technologies bring significant intermittency, which strains existing systems and creates challenges for planning the grids and networks of the future. For these advancements to be successful, infrastructure requires redundancy to ensure reliability. We believe the infrastructure investment necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment, which provides us with years of visibility and growth opportunities.
And finally, an important part of our value proposition to all of our stakeholders is Quanta's commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. To that end, earlier this week, we published our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which discusses the company's accomplishments last year as well as our commitments to people, planet and principles. Quanta has a great ESG story to tell, and we are pleased with the progress we are making to provide increased transparency into our corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives.
We are focused on operating the business for the longer term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.
I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?"

Today, we announced record second quarter 2021 revenues of $3 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $117 million or $0.81 per diluted share.

Net income attributable to common stock was $117 million or $0.81 per diluted share. And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.06.
Our electric power revenues were $2.1 billion, a record for the second quarter and a 20% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued growth in base business activities as well as contributions from larger transmission projects and revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $70 million.
Electric segment operating income margins in 2Q '21 were 11% versus 10.3% in 2Q '20, led by continued execution strength, coupled with increased revenues, which contributed to improved equipment utilization and fixed cost absorption. Operating margins also benefited from approximately $7 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture.
Our communications operations, included within the electric segment, delivered mid-single-digit margins during the quarter. Due to some of the subcontractor and quality issues we identified in the first quarter, we transitioned field leadership on several projects, which led to more normalized margins during the quarter. Those transition activities have been completed, and we expect our communications operations will return to margins at or near double digits for the remainder of the year, similar to the second half of 2020.
Underground utility and infrastructure segment revenues were $852 million for the quarter, 19% higher than 2Q '20, due primarily to increased revenues from gas distribution and industrial services, partially offset by reduced revenues from larger pipeline projects. Our industrial operations and non-U.S. markets within this segment remain pressured by COVID-19 dynamics, impacting core quarter revenues and margins. However, last year's second quarter results were more adversely impacted by pandemic-related disruptions.
Second quarter operating income margins for the segment were 2.8%, 20 basis points lower than 2Q '20. Negatively impacting second quarter margins was the recognition of a $23.6 million provision for credit loss related to receivables from Limetree Refining, which declared bankruptcy in July 2021, an approximately 280 basis point impact on segment margins.
Regarding the provision, our industrial operations had been providing regular turnaround and maintenance services to Limetree Refining's operations at its St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands refinery for several years. Following operational difficulties experienced at the St. Croix refinery, the refinery shut down operations during the second quarter. And shortly thereafter, Limetree Refining filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
The bankruptcy process is in its early stages. However, given the uncertainty around the proceedings and the future operations at the St. Croix refinery, we've reserved a substantial portion of our outstanding receivables. We will continue to monitor the bankruptcy process and assess the likelihood of recovery as the facts and circumstances develop. This project began in 2018 and, even after the charge, remains nicely profitable. Excluding the impact of this provision, segment results were otherwise in line with our Q2 expectations.
Our total backlog was a record $17 billion at the end of the second quarter, with 12-month backlog at $9 billion, both of which represent solid increases when compared to year-end and the second quarter of 2020. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter where we posted record backlog, a trend that continues to be driven primarily by multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe continues to validate the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings.
For the second quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $126 million, $331 million lower than 2Q '20. Net cash provided by operating activities during the second quarter of 2021, although largely in line with our expectations, was negatively impacted by increased working capital requirements related to the continued ramp-up of 2 larger electric transmission projects in Canada and the timing that's associated with billings.
The various work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation have created substantial inefficiencies and production delays. These have led to increased project costs, some of which have already been approved, with the remaining amounts being pursued in normal course. Partially offsetting this was the favorable impact of increased earnings as compared to 2Q '20.
The free cash flow generated in the second quarter of 2020 resulted from substantially reduced revenues and the corresponding reduction in working capital. Also during 2Q '20, we deferred the payment of both $58 million of federal and state income taxes and $30.7 million of payroll taxes. The federal and state income taxes were subsequently paid in July 2020, while 50% of the deferred payroll taxes are due by December 31, '21, with the remainder due by December 31, '22.
Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 83 days for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 1 day compared to the second quarter of 2020 and comparable to December 31, 2020. We had approximately $212 million of cash at the end of the quarter, with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our credit agreement, of approximately 1.2x.
As we've discussed in the past, our first priority for capital allocation remains supporting the working capital and equipment needs of our operations. However, we remain committed to delivering shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions. Through the date of this earnings release, we've acquired approximately $58 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year as part of our repurchase program, and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives.
Turning to guidance. Based on the electric segment's strong performance through the first 6 months of the year and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased our full year expectations for segment revenues, resulting in a range between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion for 2021. Similarly, we are increasing our full year margin range for this segment, with 2021 operating margins now expected to range between 10.5% and 11%.
Our full year expectations for the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, however, have slightly moderated due primarily to a lack of visibility into new project awards that could contribute to the back half of 2021 from our Canadian and Australian operations. Accordingly, we are reducing our full year expectations for this segment, with revenues now expected to range between $3.5 billion and $3.65 billion and segment margins ranging between 4.6% and 5.1%, which includes the $23.6 million or nearly 70 basis point negative impact on a full year basis associated with the provision for credit loss recognized in the second quarter. These segment operating ranges support our increased expectations for 2021 annual revenues of between $12.2 billion and $12.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between $1.13 billion and $1.21 billion. The midpoint of the range represents 11% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA.
We now expect our full year tax rate to range between 24.25% and 24.75%, a slight reduction from our prior expectations due to favorable tax dynamics in the second quarter associated with certain deferred compensation items. As a result, our increased expectation for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.40 and $3.76, and our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, is now between $4.32 and $4.68.
We expect cash generation associated with our increased expectations for our revenue and earnings will be slightly offset by higher working capital requirements in the second half of the year. And accordingly, we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance for the year, expecting it to range between $400 million and $600 million.
As we stated in prior quarters, our quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com.
Overall, our core utility-based operations continue to execute at a high level, and we are well positioned to deliver solutions to meet the expanding capital and maintenance programs of our North American utility partners. We firmly believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle and our ability to train and deploy world-class craft-skilled labor differentiates us in the markets we serve. This craft skill foundation, coupled with our balance sheet strength, gives us the ability to deliver industry-leading solutions to our customers while maintaining the ability to opportunistically deploy capital to deliver long-term shareholder value.

So both of those things are something that we do quite often and very transferable from our standpoint on a go-forward basis, so something that we believe is right down the fairway for us.

I'm just trying to understand what that was relative to your electric power business because the margin performance there continues to be strong. So I'm just trying to understand the underlying performance there.
And then, Duke, I guess, more a strategic question. The balance sheet is in great shape. You have great -- obviously, a lot of organic growth opportunity ahead of you. But when you think about some of these adjacent markets that you're trying to grow in, I'm just wondering if there's opportunities on the M&A side that the market is underappreciating and/or opportunities within underground utility that could potentially help accelerate the margin improvement in that segment."

As far as the balance sheet, when we look at it, obviously, we value everything against our stock. There's no shortage of opportunity in the market for sure. But we've transformed the company a little while back, and I think we're really proud of what we've done, and we're going to be prudent about how we go forward. There is places that we see that provide opportunity, both regionally and structurally, within the service line segments that we'll be looking at. But we look at a lot of different things and think about a lot of it strategically over the next decade, and we'll position the company properly going forward.
But right now, we can grow the company organically as well. We've done that with Puerto Rico. I think it's still unnoticed. It's still undervalued. The opportunity there that we got in service this quarter, it's just amazing what the company has done and the people of this company. So I just -- that opportunity is large, and we're proud of it.
As far as underground, we have a significant amount of underground out in the West, probably some of the largest in the West. So we're able to perform within the segments on the underground that we see. But if we can enhance the margins and certainly, we'll look at those acquisitions as we move forward."

That would be great for the industry, great for the renewable sentiment and things of that nature. So no issues there, and it would certainly be additive to anything we've talked about.
But that being said, the sentiment around renewables and the interconnections and what's needed, I spoke to my script about redundancy. And it goes unrecognized, the way technology and the way EV and the way any kind of intermittency affects any kind of infrastructure, that you need constant throughput. So data, electric, it doesn't matter. You need the redundancy if you're going to depend on it. And that's the issue, is we haven't started really to get ready for EV, and the modernization of the distribution system to handle electric vehicles is something that's just starting and has a long runway. So I think that, along with the great interconnects and the stacking effects that you see within the infrastructure bill, will only support growth going forward in anything that we've said on a go-forward basis."

We really like where we sit. We're having good discussions all throughout the island with not only local -- the economy and the people and everything around it. So the opportunity there is large, and we look forward to the future there. And I commend our people and everything they did to throw their sleeves up and take a lot of heat but also deliver on the back side of it."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financ",1601,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer. We will provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. 
This morning, we reported solid third quarter results, which included a number of record financial metrics, including revenues, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share. Additionally, total backlog of $17 billion at the end of the quarter was also a record, which we believe reflects the benefits of our collaborative approach with the customers, favorable end market dynamics and continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies. 
As many of you are aware, several weeks ago, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Blattner, which is a premier utility scale renewable energy infrastructure solutions provider in North America. With decades of experience and a strong safety culture, we believe the energy transition in North America is on the cusp of a significant acceleration and at moving to a carbon-neutral economy will require sizable and decades-long investment in renewable generation and related infrastructure. We believe this transaction puts Quanta in a unique position to enable the energy infrastructure for North America's energy transition. Since announcing our intention to acquire Blattner in early September, customer reactions and conversations across our customer base have been overwhelmingly positive and supportive. 
Further, we previously commented about how remarkably similar Quanta and Blattner operationally and culturally, which has become increasingly apparent to working with the Blattner management team on integration. We were all excited about our combined growth opportunities when we first announced the transaction. And I can tell you that today, we are even more excited and increasingly confident in the value proposition, innovative solutions and growth synergy opportunities at Quanta and Blattner are positioned to provide existing and new customers. 
Now turning the call to our operating results. Our Electric Power Solutions operations continued to perform well with record revenues and strong margins driven by robust demand for our services, solid and safe execution, high utilization of our resources and operational excellence. We are proud of our execution and confident that our strong market position will allow us to capitalize on future opportunities created by a favorable long-term trends driving utility investment and demand for our comprehensive solutions. 
Demand for grid modernization, system hardening and renewable energy interconnection services remain active, and discussions around opportunities for our electric vehicle infrastructure installation and program management capabilities continue to advance. Our electric power backlog remains strong driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities, which adds to the substantial MSA backlog growth we generated in the first half of this year. 
During the quarter, Hurricane Ida made landfall over Louisiana, which ultimately left 1.2 million customers across 8 states without power, including 1 million outages in Louisiana alone. Quanta deployed significant resources to support utility customers through electric power infrastructure who was damaged or destroyed by the hurricane, including more than 2,500 line workers and front-end support services and engineering staff. Our comprehensive response resulted in record emergency restoration revenue and highlights our ability to quickly mobilize substantial resources to support our customers in times of need. 
Our customers continue to advance their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality over the coming decades, which is planned to be achieved in large part through increasing renewable generation investment. We believe public policy and a positive general sentiment supporting a greener environment will drive North America's power generation mix increasingly towards renewables over the near and longer term. 
Blattner's utility scale renewable generation solutions, coupled with Quanta's complementary and holistic grid solutions, creates a unique value proposition and opportunity to collaborate with our customers to shape their energy transition initiatives. For example, Blattner is currently constructing more than 30 utility-scale renewable energy projects across the country, and another Quanta company is currently working on the largest solar-powered battery storage projects in North America. Additionally, we are seeing accelerated demand for our services that enable renewal generation, including transmission interconnections and substations. 
We continue to scale our communication operations and progress to our strategy. For example, we have developed our wireless capabilities and are expanding our wireless services into certain markets. Communications revenues grew significantly in the third quarter as compared to last year. And though we incurred higher costs on certain jobs due to descoping of certain contracts and project closeouts, which impacted profitability for these operations, these issues were not meaningful to the overall electric power segment or Quanta as a whole. Nevertheless, Demand for our communication services remains high, and the majority of our communication operations are performing at or near our double-digit margin targets. 
Our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment generally performed well in the quarter despite being impacted by work disruptions along the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Ida and work inefficiencies associated with the recent surge of the COVID-19 Delta variant in certain areas. We continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity services. which are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. We expect our industrial services to strengthen through next year, along with the continued recovery of the global economy and demand for refined products as well as the return of our customer maintenance and capital spending that was previously deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market. 
Looking to the coming years, we believe the opportunity Quanta has with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities may be underestimated. Here are several examples of such initiatives and project opportunities. 
Gas utilities are implementing system modernization initiatives that position them to blend hydrogen into their natural gas flow. To that end, Quanta is working with several gas utility customers on hydrogen pilot programs. Certain refiners are building renewable and biofuel processing facilities, which could create opportunities for our industrial services. Natural gas power plants are also exploring blending hydrogen with natural gas as a fuel source to power their turbines, which could create opportunities for our pipeline infrastructure services. Lastly, we are actively pursuing carbon sequestration projects in the United States, which could utilize our engineering and pipeline construction services. In Canada, Pembina Pipeline and TC Energy have proposed a plan to jointly develop a carbon transportation and sequestration system called the Alberta Carbon Grid, which is envisioned to serve as the backbone of Alberta's carbon capture utilization and storage industry and could include participation by other pipeline companies. The initiative would leverage existing pipelines, requires a new pipeline and facility investment, which when fully constructed would be capable of transporting more than 20 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. 
The North American energy transition is just that, a transition process. We roll our electric power infrastructure solutions play, and the energy transition is clear. However, we believe Quanta's underground utility and infrastructure solutions operations could play in an evolving and increasing role in this transition in support of our customers' carbon reduction initiatives. 
Progress continues in Washington, D.C. towards enacting the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better plan. As commented on prior calls, our positive multiyear outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on either of these packages. But if either or both enacted, they could provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over both the near and longer term. These packages include funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets. In particular, the Build Back Better plan currently contains policy and incentives representing the largest clean energy legislative package in American history. While additional political steps are still required, we are encouraged by what we've seen recently. 
We have profitably grown the company and executed well this year and expect to continue to do so. We are confident in the strategic initiatives we are executing on, the competitive position we have in the marketplace and our positive multiyear outlook. We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2022 are gaining momentum driven by our solution-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers, opportunities for larger electric transmission projects, the addition of Blattner's renewable generation solutions and the opportunity for recovery of certain portions of our business that have been affected by the global pandemic. 
Looking to the medium and longer term, as energy transition and carbon reduction initiatives are increasingly implemented, in addition to the primary drivers of our business currently, we believe our visibility could increase and our growth opportunities could expand and accelerate. We believe the infrastructure investment and renewable generation necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment and that this is arguably the most exciting time in Quanta's history. 
We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our third quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?"
33509,1686093369,2424970,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record third quarter 2021 revenues to $3.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $174 million or $1.21 per diluted share. And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP meas",2190,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record third quarter 2021 revenues to $3.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $174 million or $1.21 per diluted share. And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.48. 
Our electric power revenues were $2.3 billion, a quarterly record and a 10% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued favorable dynamics across our core utility and communications markets and associated demand for our services. Also contributing to the increase were revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $55 million. 
Electric segment operating income margins in 3Q '21 were 12.4%, slightly lower than 12.7% in 3Q '20 but better than our initial expectations. Operating margins benefited from record emergency restoration revenues of approximately $230 million, which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization as well as overall solid execution across our electric operations. Additionally, segment margins benefited from approximately $10 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. Otherwise, the slight reduction in operating margin versus prior year was attributable to normal job variability and mix of work and our communications operations, which delivered mid-single-digit margins during the quarter. As a reminder, last year's third quarter electric power results also included what was at the time a record level of emergency restoration revenues. 
Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.02 billion for the quarter, 12% higher than 3Q '20 due primarily to increased revenue from gas distribution and industrial services. Though our operations experienced increased activity year-over-year, current quarter revenues and margins in our industrial operations were negatively impacted by disruptions along the Gulf Coast attributable to Hurricane Ida in both our industrial and non-U.S. markets within this segment remain pressured by COVID-19 dynamics. Third quarter operating income margins for the segment were 6.7%, 170 basis points lower than 3Q '20, but generally in line with our expectations. Margins for the year -- margins for the third quarter of 2020 benefited from favorable adjustments on certain larger pipeline projects with both scope changes and favorable closeouts in the quarter. 
Our total backlog was $17 billion at the end of the third quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter we've posted record total backlog. Additionally, 12-month backlog of $9.8 billion also represents a quarterly record. Our backlog growth continues to be driven primarily by multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe reinforces the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. The Blattner acquisition occurred after September 30, and accordingly, their backlog is not included in our current reported levels. However, the total backlog from Blattner and the other 4Q acquisitions is approximately $1.8 billion. 
For the third quarter of 2021, we generated negative free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $40 million compared to $70 million of positive free cash flow in 3Q '20. Net cash provided by operating activities during the third quarter of 2021, although largely in line with our expectations, was down due to higher revenues and corresponding increases in working capital demands compared to prior year, which benefited from lower revenues and a corresponding lower use of working capital. Also, 3Q '20 benefited from the deferral of $41 million of payroll taxes in accordance with the CARES Act, 50% of which are due by December 31, 2021, with the remainder due by December 31, 2022. Partially offsetting these dynamics was a favorable impact of increased earnings as compared to 3Q '20. 
Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 89 days for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 7 days compared to the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 6 days compared to December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to elevated working capital requirements associated with 2 large Canadian transmission projects driving an increase in contract assets. Specific to the Canadian projects, both continue to encounter work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation as well as delays attributable to, among other things, wildfires impacting access to work sites. These dynamics created substantial inefficiencies and production delays resulting in increased project costs. We are in active discussions with both customers regarding change orders associated with these increased costs, some of which have already been approved, with the remaining amounts being pursued in the normal course. In addition, normal variability in work production and associated payment cycles across our operations contributed to slightly higher DSO in the quarter. 
As Duke discussed and as we previously announced, we closed on the acquisition of Blattner on October 13. Prior to the closing, in September 2021, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.12%, receiving net proceeds of $1.48 billion. Accordingly, as at quarter end, we had approximately $1.7 billion of cash.little
Subsequent to the quarter, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, provide a term loan facility of $750 million, which was fully drawn and combined with the net proceeds from the senior notes offering to fund a substantial majority of the cash consideration payable to the Blattner shareholders at closing. I'll highlight that our financial strategy and consistent performance have allowed us to maintain investment-grade ratings subsequent to these financing transactions. 
From a capital allocation perspective, Blattner represents the largest acquisition in Quanta's history and a strategic opportunity to expand the solutions we deliver to support North America's transition to carbon neutral energy infrastructure. Capital deployment for strategic acquisitions has always been a key part of our strategy. But as we've discussed in the past, our first priority for capital allocation remains supporting the working capital and equipment needs of our existing operations. While the debt issued to support the Blattner acquisition moved our leverage profile above our target range, it remains well below the financial covenant requirements in our credit facility, and we believe we can efficiently delever while continuing to create shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions. Through the date of this earnings release, we've acquired approximately $64 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year as part of our repurchase program, and we'll continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. To that end, during the third quarter and through the date of the earnings release, in addition to Blattner, we acquired 3 additional businesses and made a minority investment in another for total combined consideration of approximately $110 million. These incremental transactions further enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive infrastructure solutions to our North American utility and communications customers. 
Turning to our guidance. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the strength of our core utility-backed operation, which continued to deliver solid results with robust year-over-year growth. However, the results of companies acquired during and subsequent to the third quarter, including Blattner's operations, will be included in our consolidated financial statements, which makes comparability to our previous expectations' challenge. It should be noted that we are in very early stages of establishing Blattner-specific opening balance sheet, which includes assessing the positions of ongoing projects as of the closing and valuing the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The result of those ongoing efforts will have a meaningful impact on Blattner's fourth quarter contribution, which we've attempted to address in the range of our fourth quarter expectations for the acquired businesses. That said, excluding the expected contributions from the recently acquired companies, we now expect full year revenues from our legacy operations to range between $12.15 billion and $12.35 billion. Due to the strength of our consolidated performance for the first 9 months of the year, we are increasing our expectations for the contribution of our legacy operations to adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.17 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint of the range representing an increase over our previous guidance and 13% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA. 
As it relates to our current reportable segments, while we continue to evaluate how these changes may change with the addition of Blattner, I wanted to provide some color on our current expectations compared to our previous commentary, again, excluding contributions from the recently acquired businesses. We continue to expect full year revenues to range between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion for our legacy electric segment operations. However, based on the strong performance through the first 9 months of the year and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased our full year margin range for the segment with 2021 operating margins expected to come in slightly above 11%. Our full year expectations for the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, however, have slightly moderated due primarily to lower third quarter revenue levels than previously expected. Accordingly, we are reducing our full year expectations for the segment with revenue is now expected to range between $3.45 billion and $3.55 billion, while segment margins are now expected to range between 4.5% and 5%, which includes a $23.6 million provision for credit loss recognized in the second quarter, a nearly 70-basis-point negative impact on a full year basis. 
With regard to the recently acquired companies operations I spoke of earlier, including Blattner, we expect post-closing revenue contributions for the year to range between $400 million and $500 million and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, ranging between $40 million and $60 million. Accordingly, including the expected contributions from the recently acquired companies, we now expect our consolidated full year revenues to range between $12.55 billion and $12.85 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between and $1.21 billion and $1.26 billion. 
Corporate and unallocated costs will increase significantly primarily due to the acquired companies. We currently estimate amortization expense for the full year will be between $149 million and $159 million, with $60 million to $70 million attributable to the recently acquired companies. Stock compensation expense for the full year is now expected to be approximately $89 million, with approximately $2 million attributable to restricted stock units issued to employees of the acquired company. Acquisition and integration costs are expected to be approximately $26 million for the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately $36 million for the year. This includes approximately $10.5 million of expenses associated with change of control payments awarded to certain employees of Blattner by the selling shareholders, which require expense accounting as they have a 1-year service period requirement. We expect a comparable dollar amount will be accrued each quarter post closing until the 1-year anniversary of the transaction, at which time the payments will be made to the employee. We intend to include this amount as an adjustment to arrive at our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP measures. 
Below the line, we expect interest expense for the year to be around $67 million, which includes approximately $16 million of incremental interest expense associated with debt financing used to fund the cash portion of the Blattner acquisition. Additionally, we now expect our full year tax rate to be around 24%, reflecting a slight reduction from our prior expectations due primarily to a favorable shift in the mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our expectation for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.20 and $3.40. And our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, is now between $4.62 and $4.87. 
On a consolidated basis, we now expect free cash flow for the year to range between $350 million and $500 million. This slight decrease is primarily due to potential timing of payments associated with emergency restoration efforts as well as the likelihood that the dynamics impacting the larger Canadian projects continue to pressure DSO in the fourth quarter. Additionally, while we expect Blattner will be meaningfully accretive to our cash flow profile on an annual basis, we expect certain favorable billing positions at the time of acquisition could unwind as Blattner incurs costs in the fourth quarter to finish projects for which they've already received payments. This dynamic could minimize Blattner's cash contribution during the quarter, which we factored into our range of expectations. As we stated in prior quarters, our quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. 
Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle, and the acquisition of Blattner further differentiates us in the markets we serve and expand our ability to deliver solutions to support North America's transition to carbon neutral energy infrastructure. We remain confident in our ability to execute against the opportunities in front of us while maintaining the financial flexibility to opportunistically deploy capital to deliver long-term shareholder value.

And then on the Industrial Services side, I think you talked about some storm issues impacting results. Is that business still profitable? Or was that business profitable in the third quarter?

We're kind of -- we're operating income mid-single digits instead of upper single to double digits when we looked at it. So it's not performing terrible. It's not where we want it to be. The macro market is very good and robust. The closeouts on a few projects are very difficult, but the large majority or the vast majority of the business is performing in those double-digit margins and offsetting anything there. It's minimal, as we said on the call, from a charge standpoint or really just cost standpoint when we close things out. So we'll go from there. 
But I do think we added backlog. We continue to build backlog in the segment. We see a long runway there, and we did start up some wireless capabilities. It has some cost in it. So in general, incidental to the company, incidental to the segment, we like the market long term. We will get into double digits there over time. 
Canada, when we look at Canada, I think in general, the projects are performing well. We still see some COVID effects there to the Delta variant on some of those projects. So there is some delays in getting billing cycles, billing points there as we run through a project, I think. So that, it's more of a billing issue of when can we get things build versus any problems with the project or charges. We did not take charges on Canadian projects. We performed very well. 
And the storm, yes, it did have a positive effect to the electric segment. It does when we get storms like that. It was a little bit bigger than last year from the standpoint. So a fairly large store for us. I think it shows our collaborative effect with the client, how we've got in and worked our front-end services, we're still working the storm for our client. So it just shows the longevity of the company and what we've done on the front side of the business to collaborate with the client, to get things up faster, to do a nice job there for them. And I think we performed very well there, offset by it did have some impact on some of our underground segments as it always does when it comes in. So you get some offset, and you also come off some larger work to go pick up storm. So those things offset some in the quarter."

So there's only a part of October. So that's a component of it. Two exactly, it's unfair to annualize a given quarter, much like it is on Quanta. I mean we have a degree of seasonality. You can't take any given quarter and annualize that. There are movements of projects and seasonality. That is still the case as well for Blattner in any of the companies that we acquire. So we still feel very comfortable with the 2.5 to 2.7 original guidance for Blattner irrespective of this quarter contribution. 
And then lastly, yes, there is a bit of just timing starts and stops of projects affecting the number. And then probably the last point that you raised is that we have been trying to be a bit prudent with the contribution because of the fact that we have just out closed the transaction, we've got opening balance sheet work to do, looking at how some of that opening balance sheet will lay out to the rest of those contracts. So 4 or 5 different factors there. But net-net, we feel very comfortable still with the 2.5, 2.7annual '22 contribution."

When we look at it, I mean we're really just -- we're thinking about it as part of the segment, much like you would think about LNG when you're moving LNG or you're doing things. Really, what you're seeing is the transition of infrastructure. Where our role is in this infrastructure transition as we move into the future, I mean, I think we just sit right in the middle of it on anything you can think about is that transition. So whether they need -- they're going to need pipe to move it and they're also going to need pipe to move hydrogen and into blend into natural gas. And I think when you start blending that, you have different infrastructure. So all these different things that we're bringing into the market's, batteries, EV renewables, technology with 5G, all those things are certainly where we sit. 
And as we said in the nucleus of that and we think about it, as we think about Blattner and where they sit in all this, that transition is something that Quanta is really focused on from a labor standpoint, a technology standpoint and how we help and collaborate with the client, not only from where they're at today, but how they transition. So at the very front end of that is where we're playing, and it's early in hydrogen. I do think there's going to be a significant amount of opportunity going forward, but we're already seeing where turbines and power plants on gas are starting to blend and even spec hydrogen to some degree. So it's going to be a piece of the nucleus of how you regulate and keep the grid balanced. The bigger issue with the grid is to balance it. Sun, wind and then the balance thereof. So hydrogen will play a part of it."

But having said that, from an overall seasonality, I think I'd probably say it's reasonably similar to our overall electric power operations, probably really a little bit lower than the first, rising in the second, stronger in the third and then the fourth being either comparable to or having a slight decline depending upon the timing of any of these supply-type dynamics.

We can operate that business quite profitably. We're just not -- in my mind, we decided not to invest in it and not to continue to invest. So it's a little bit different. We can still do $1 billion in the business. We can do $2 billion in the business from what we have today. So we don't have to invest more in capital. We have the people, we have the things that we can do. As you look at carbon sequestration and all the lines there and all the things that they're coming up on hydrogen, and it certainly plays into the business, and we'll look at it. We have the capabilities internally. We'll continue to take the opportunities that they'll stack on to anything we're doing, whether it be Canada or the U.S. But there are some nice projects out there, and certainly, we're around the edges on every 1 of them. But we're not going to take the risk that it's not something that we have to have. And when we guide, it will be $300 million to $500 million. I can almost tell you right now, and that's what it will look like. If we do a $2 billion, great, we'll let you know."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financ",1602,"Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary and will then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer. We will provide a review of our third quarter results and full year 2021 financial expectations. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.
This morning, we reported solid third quarter results, which included a number of record financial metrics, including revenues, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share. Additionally, total backlog of $17 billion at the end of the quarter was also a record, which we believe reflects the benefits of our collaborative approach with the customers, favorable end market dynamics and continued advancement of our long-term growth strategies.
As many of you are aware, several weeks ago, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Blattner, which is a premier utility scale renewable energy infrastructure solutions provider in North America with decades of experience and a strong safety culture. We believe the energy transition in North America is on the cusp of a significant acceleration, and at moving to a carbon-neutral economy will require sizable and decades-long investment in renewable generation and related infrastructure. We believe this transaction puts Quanta in a unique position to enable the energy infrastructure for North America's energy transition.
Since announcing our intention to acquire Blattner in early September, customer reactions and conversations across our customer base have been overwhelmingly positive and supportive. Further, we previously commented about how remarkably similar Quanta and Blattner are operationally and culturally, which has become increasingly apparent to working with the Blattner management team on integration. We were all excited about our combined growth opportunities when we first announced the transaction. And I can tell you that today, we are even more excited and increasingly confident in the value proposition, innovative solutions and growth synergy opportunities at Quanta and Blattner are positioned to provide existing and new customers.
Now turning the call to our operating results. Our Electric Power Solutions operations continued to perform well with record revenues and strong margins driven by robust demand for our services, solid and safe execution, high utilization of our resources and operational excellence. We are proud of our execution and confident that our strong market position will allow us to capitalize on future opportunities created by a favorable long-term trends driving utility investment and demand for our comprehensive solutions.
Demand for grid modernization, system hardening and renewable energy interconnection services remain active, and discussions around opportunities for our electric vehicle infrastructure installation and program management capabilities continue to advance. Our electric power backlog remains strong, driven primarily by significant multiyear master service agreements with utilities, which adds to the substantial MSA backlog growth we generated in the first half of this year.
During the quarter, Hurricane Ida made landfall over Louisiana, which ultimately left 1.2 million customers across 8 states without power, including 1 million outages in Louisiana alone. Quanta deployed significant resources to support utility customers through electric power infrastructure who was damaged or destroyed by the hurricane, including more than 2,500 line workers and front-end support services and engineering staff. Our comprehensive response resulted in record emergency restoration revenue and highlights our ability to quickly mobilize substantial resources to support our customers in times of need.
Our customers continue to advance their efforts to achieve carbon neutrality over the coming decades, which is planned to be achieved in large part through increasing renewable generation investment. We believe public policy and a positive general sentiment supporting a greener environment will drive North America's power generation mix increasingly towards renewables over the near and longer term.
Blattner's utility scale renewable generation solutions, coupled with Quanta's complementary and holistic grid solutions, creates a unique value proposition and opportunity to collaborate with our customers to shape their energy transition initiatives. For example, Blattner is currently constructing more than 30 utility-scale renewable energy projects across the country, and another Quanta company is currently working on the largest solar-powered battery storage projects in North America. Additionally, we are seeing accelerated demand for our services that enable renewal generation, including transmission interconnections and substations.
We continue to scale our communication operations and progress to our strategy. For example, we have developed our wireless capabilities and are expanding our wireless services into certain markets. Communications revenues grew significantly in the third quarter as compared to last year. And though we incurred higher costs on certain jobs due to descoping of certain contracts and project closeouts, which impacted profitability for these operations, these issues were not meaningful to the overall electric power segment or Quanta as a whole. Nevertheless, demand for our communication services remains high and the majority of our communication operations are performing at or near our double-digit margin targets.
Our underground utility in Infrastructure Solutions segment generally performed well in the quarter despite being impacted by work disruptions along the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Ida and work inefficiencies associated with the recent surge of the COVID-19 Delta variant in certain areas. 
We continue to experience solid demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity services, which are driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. We expect our industrial services to strengthen through next year, along with the continued recovery of the global economy and demand for refined products as well as the return of our customer maintenance and capital spending that was previously deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market.
Looking to the coming years, we believe the opportunity Quanta has with customers in this segment as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities may be underestimated. Here are several examples of such initiatives and project opportunities.
Gas utilities are implementing system modernization initiatives that position them to blend hydrogen into their natural gas flow. To that end, Quanta is working with several gas utility customers on hydrogen pilot programs.
Certain refiners are building renewable and biofuel processing facilities, which could create opportunities for our industrial services. Natural gas power plants are also exploring blending hydrogen with natural gas as a fuel source to power their turbines, which could create opportunities for our pipeline infrastructure services. 
Lastly, we are actively pursuing carbon sequestration projects in the United States, which could utilize our engineering and pipeline construction services. In Canada, Pembina Pipeline and TC Energy have proposed a plan to jointly develop a carbon transportation and sequestration system called the Alberta Carbon Grid, which is envisioned to serve as the backbone of Alberta's carbon capture utilization and storage industry and could include participation by other pipeline companies. The initiative would leverage existing pipelines, requires a new pipeline and facility investment, which when fully constructed would be capable of transporting more than 20 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.
The North American energy transition is just that a transition process. We roll our electric power infrastructure solutions play, and the energy transition is clear. However, we believe Quanta's underground utility and infrastructure solutions operations could play in an evolving and increasing role in this transition in support of our customers' carbon reduction initiatives.
Progress continues in Washington, D.C. towards enacting the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better plan. As commented on prior calls, our positive multiyear outlook and strategic plan are not reliant on either of these packages. But if either or both enacted, they could provide incremental opportunity for Quanta over both the near and longer term. These packages include funding and policies to encourage new infrastructure development and modernization in several of our core markets. In particular, the Build Back Better plan currently contains policy and incentives representing the largest clean energy legislative package in American history. While additional political steps are still required, we are encouraged by what we've seen recently.
We have profitably grown the company and executed well this year and expect to continue to do so. We are confident in the strategic initiatives we are executing on, the competitive position we have in the marketplace and our positive multiyear outlook. We also believe that our business and opportunities for profitable growth in 2022 are gaining momentum, driven by our solution-based approach, the growth of programmatic spending with existing and new customers, opportunities for larger electric transmission projects, the addition of Blattner's renewable generation solutions and the opportunity for recovery of certain portions of our business that have been affected by the global pandemic.
Looking to the medium and longer term, as energy transition and carbon reduction initiatives are increasingly implemented in addition to the primary drivers of our business currently, we believe our visibility could increase and our growth opportunities could expand and accelerate. We believe the infrastructure investment and renewable generation necessary to support these initiatives are still in the early stages of deployment, and that this is arguably the most exciting time in Quanta's history.
We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders.
I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our third quarter results and 2021 expectations. Derrick?"
33509,1686093369,2425238,"Quanta Services, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Quanta Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record third quarter 2021 revenues to $3.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $174 million or $1.21 per diluted share. And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP meas",2189,"Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record third quarter 2021 revenues to $3.4 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $174 million or $1.21 per diluted share. And adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.48.
Our electric power revenues were $2.3 billion, a quarterly record and a 10% increase when compared to the third quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by continued favorable dynamics across our core utility and communications market and associated demand for our services. Also contributing to the increase were revenues from acquired businesses of approximately $55 million. Electric segment operating income margins in 3Q '21 were 12.4%, slightly lower than 12.7% in 3Q '20 but better than our initial expectations. 
Operating margins benefited from record emergency restoration revenues of approximately $230 million, which typically present opportunities for higher margins than our normal base business activities due to higher utilization as well as overall solid execution across our electric operations. Additionally, segment margins benefited from approximately $10 million of income associated with our LUMA joint venture. Otherwise, the slight reduction in operating margin versus prior year was attributable to normal job variability and mix of work and our communications operations, which delivered mid-single-digit margins during the quarter. As a reminder, last year's third quarter electric power results also included what was at the time a record level of emergency restoration revenues.
Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.02 billion for the quarter, 12% higher than 3Q '20 due primarily to increased revenue from gas distribution and industrial services. Though our operations experienced increased activity year-over-year, current quarter revenues and margins in our industrial operations were negatively impacted by disruptions along the Gulf Coast attributable to Hurricane Ida in both our industrial and non-U.S. markets within this segment remain pressured by COVID-19 dynamics. Third quarter operating income margins for the segment were 6.7%, 170 basis points lower than 3Q '20, but generally in line with our expectations. Margins for the year -- margins for the third quarter of 2020 benefited from favorable adjustments on certain larger pipeline projects with both scope changes and favorable closeout in the quarter.
Our total backlog was $17 billion at the end of the third quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter we've posted record total backlog. Additionally, 12-month backlog of $9.8 billion also represents a quarterly record. Our backlog growth continues to be driven primarily by multiyear MSA programs with North American utilities, which we believe reinforces the repeatable and sustainable nature of the largest portion of our revenues and earnings. The Blattner acquisition occurred after September 30. And accordingly, their backlog is not included in our current reported levels. However, the total backlog from Blattner and the other 4Q acquisitions is approximately $1.8 billion.
For the third quarter of 2021, we generated negative free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $40 million compared to $70 million of positive free cash flow in 3Q '20. Net cash provided by operating activities during the third quarter of 2021, although largely in line with our expectations, was down due to higher revenues and corresponding increases in working capital demands compared to prior year, which benefited from lower revenues and a corresponding lower use of working capital. Also, 3Q '20 benefited from the deferral of $41 million of payroll taxes in accordance with the CARES Act, 50% of which are due by December 31, 2021, with the remainder due by December 31, 2022. Partially offsetting these dynamics was a favorable impact of increased earnings as compared to 3Q '20.
Days sales outstanding, or DSO, measured 89 days for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 7 days compared to the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of 6 days compared to December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to elevated working capital requirements associated with 2 large Canadian transmission projects driving an increase in contract assets. 
Specific to the Canadian projects, both continue to encounter work stoppage protocols in Canada associated with COVID mitigation as well as delays attributable to, among other things, wildfires impacting access to work sites. These dynamics created substantial inefficiencies and production delays resulting in increased project costs. We are in active discussions with both customers regarding change orders associated with these increased costs, some of which have already been approved with the remaining amounts being pursued in the normal course. In addition, normal variability in work production and associated payment cycles across our operations contributed to slightly higher DSO in the quarter.
As Duke discussed and as we previously announced, we closed on the acquisition of Blattner on October 13. Prior to the closing, in September 2021, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.12%, receiving net proceeds of $1.48 billion. Accordingly, as at quarter end, we had approximately $1.7 billion of cash.
Subsequent to the quarter, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, provide a term loan facility of $750 million, which was fully drawn and combined with the net proceeds from the senior notes offering to fund a substantial majority of the cash consideration payable to the Blattner shareholders at closing. I'll highlight that our financial strategy and consistent performance have allowed us to maintain investment-grade ratings subsequent to these financing transactions.
From a capital allocation perspective, Blattner represents the largest acquisition in Quanta's history and a strategic opportunity to expand the solutions we deliver to support North America's transition to carbon neutral energy infrastructure. Capital deployment for strategic acquisitions has always been a key part of our strategy. But as we've discussed in the past, our first priority for capital allocation remains supporting the working capital and equipment needs of our existing operations. While the debt issued to support the Blattner acquisition moved our leverage profile above our target range, it remains well below the financial covenant requirements in our credit facility, and we believe we can efficiently delever while continuing to create shareholder value through our dividend and repurchase programs as well as strategic acquisitions. 
Through the date of this earnings release, we've acquired approximately $64 million worth of stock since the beginning of the year as part of our repurchase program, and we'll continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that fit our strategic objectives. To that end, during the third quarter and through the date of the earnings release, in addition to Blattner, we acquired 3 additional businesses and made a minority investment in another for total combined consideration of approximately $110 million. These incremental transactions further enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive infrastructure solutions to our North American utility and communications customers.
Turning to our guidance. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the strength of our core utility-backed operation, which continued to deliver solid results with robust year-over-year growth. However, the results of companies acquired during and subsequent to the third quarter, including Blattner's operations, will be included in our consolidated financial statements, which makes comparability to our previous expectations' challenge. It should be noted that we are in very early stages of establishing Blattner-specific opening balance sheet, which includes assessing the positions of ongoing projects as of the closing and valuing the tangible and intangible assets acquired. The result of those ongoing efforts will have a meaningful impact on Blattner's fourth quarter contribution, which we've attempted to address in the range of our fourth quarter expectations for the acquired businesses. 
That said, excluding the expected contributions from the recently acquired companies, we now expect full year revenues from our legacy operations to range between $12.15 billion and $12.35 billion. Due to the strength of our consolidated performance for the first 9 months of the year, we are increasing our expectations for the contribution of our legacy operations to adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.17 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint of the range representing an increase over our previous guidance and 13% growth when compared to 2020's record adjusted EBITDA.
As it relates to our current reportable segments, while we continue to evaluate how these changes may change with the addition of Blattner, I wanted to provide some color on our current expectations compared to our previous commentary, again, excluding contributions from the recently acquired businesses. We continue to expect full year revenues to range between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion for our legacy electric segment operations. However, based on the strong performance through the first 9 months of the year and continued confidence in our ability to execute on the opportunities across the segment, we've increased our full year margin range for the segment with 2021 operating margins expected to come in slightly above 11%. 
Our full year expectations for the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, however, have slightly moderated due primarily to lower third quarter revenue levels than previously expected. Accordingly, we are reducing our full year expectations for the segment with revenues now expected to range between $3.45 billion and $3.55 billion while segment margins are now expected to range between 4.5% and 5%, which includes a $23.6 million provision for credit loss recognized in the second quarter, a nearly 70-basis-point negative impact on a full year basis.
With regard to the recently acquired companies operations I spoke of earlier, including Blattner, we expect post-closing revenue contributions for the year to range between $400 million and $500 million and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, ranging between $40 million and $60 million. Accordingly, including the expected contributions from the recently acquired companies, we now expect our consolidated full year revenues to range between $12.55 billion and $12.85 billion and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of between and $1.21 billion and $1.26 billion.
Corporate and unallocated costs will increase significantly, primarily due to the acquired companies. We currently estimate amortization expense for the full year will be between $149 million and $159 million, with $60 million to $70 million attributable to the recently acquired companies. 
Stock compensation expense for the full year is now expected to be approximately $89 million, with approximately $2 million attributable to restricted stock units issued to employees of the acquired company. 
Acquisition and integration costs are expected to be approximately $26 million for the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately $36 million for the year. This includes approximately $10.5 million of expenses associated with change of control payments awarded to certain employees of Blattner by the selling shareholders, which require expense accounting as they have a 1-year service period requirement. We expect a comparable dollar amount will be accrued each quarter post closing until the 1-year anniversary of the transaction, at which time the payments will be made to the employee. We intend to include this amount as an adjustment to arrive at our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP measures.
Below the line, we expect interest expense for the year to be around $67 million, which includes approximately $16 million of incremental interest expense associated with debt financing used to fund the cash portion of the Blattner acquisition. Additionally, we now expect our full year tax rate to be around 24%, reflecting a slight reduction from our prior expectations due primarily to a favorable shift in the mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions. As a result, our expectation for full year diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is now between $3.20 and $3.40. And our increased expectation for adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, is now between $4.62 and $4.87.
On a consolidated basis, we now expect free cash flow for the year to range between $350 million and $500 million. This slight decrease is primarily due to potential timing of payments associated with emergency restoration efforts as well as the likelihood that the dynamics impacting the larger Canadian projects continue to pressure DSO in the fourth quarter. 
Additionally, while we expect Blattner will be meaningfully accretive to our cash flow profile on an annual basis, we expect certain favorable billing positions at the time of acquisition could unwind as Blattner incurs costs in the fourth quarter to finish projects for which they've already received payments. This dynamic could minimize Blattner's cash contribution during the quarter, which we factored into our range of expectations. As we stated in prior quarters, our quarterly free cash flow is subject to sizable movements due to various customer and project dynamics that can occur in the normal course of operations. 
For additional information, please refer to our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Info section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a significant infrastructure investment cycle, and the acquisition of Blattner further differentiates us in the markets we serve and expand our ability to deliver solutions to support North America's transition to carbon neutral energy infrastructure. We remain confident in our ability to execute against the opportunities in front of us while maintaining the financial flexibility to opportunistically deploy capital to deliver long-term shareholder value.
This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?"

And then do you see that coming back on track as we go into the fourth quarter in '22?
And then on the Industrial Services side, I think you talked about some storm issues impacting results. Is that business still profitable? Or was that business profitable in the third quarter?
And just lastly, on the Canadian projects that you called out, just want to confirm whether there were charges taken or was this just a working capital swing. And when do those DSOs normalize?"

We're kind of -- we're operating income mid-single digits instead of upper single to double digits when we looked at it. So it's not performing terrible. It's not where we want it to be. The macro market is very good and robust. The closeouts on a few projects are very difficult, but the large majority or the vast majority of the business is performing in those double-digit margins and offsetting anything there. It's minimal, as we said on the call, from a charge standpoint or really just cost standpoint when we close things out. So we'll go from there.
But I do think we added backlog. We continue to build backlog in the segment. We see a long runway there, and we did start up some wireless capabilities. It has some cost in it. So in general, incidental to the company, incidental to the segment, we like the market long term. We will get into double digits there over time.
Canada, when we look at Canada, I think, in general, the projects are performing well. We still see some COVID effects there to the Delta variant on some of those projects. So there is some delays in getting billing cycles, billing points there as we run through a project, I think. So that, it's more of a billing issue of when can we get things build versus any problems with the project or charges. We did not take charges on Canadian projects. We performed very well.
And the storm, yes, it did have a positive effect to the electric segment. It does when we get storms like that. It was a little bit bigger than last year from the standpoint. So a fairly large storm for us. I think it shows our collaborative effect with the client, how we've got in and worked our front-end services, we're still working the storm for our client. So it just shows the longevity of the company and what we've done on the front side of the business to collaborate with the client, to get things up faster, to do a nice job there for them. And I think we performed very well there, offset by it did have some impact on some of our underground segments as it always does when it comes in. So you get some offset, and you also come off some larger work to go pick up storm. So those things offset some in the quarter."

So we still feel very comfortable with the 2.5 to 2.7 original guidance for Blattner irrespective of this quarter contribution.
And then lastly, yes, there is a bit of just timing starts and stops of projects affecting the number. And then probably the last point that you raised is that we have been trying to be a bit prudent with the contribution because of the fact that we have just out closed the transaction, we've got opening balance sheet work to do, looking at how some of that opening balance sheet will lay out to the rest of those contracts.

When we look at it, I mean we're really just -- we're thinking about it as part of the segment, much like you would think about LNG when you're moving LNG or you're doing things. Really, what you're seeing is the transition of infrastructure. Where our role is in this infrastructure transition as we move into the future, I mean, I think we just sit right in the middle of it on anything you can think about is that transition. So whether they need -- they're going to need pipe to move it and they're also going to need pipe to move hydrogen and into blend into natural gas. And I think when you start blending that, you have different infrastructure. 
So all these different things that we're bringing into the market's, batteries, EV renewables, technology with 5G, all those things are certainly where we sit. And as we said in the nucleus of that and we think about it, as we think about Blattner and where they sit in all this, that transition is something that Quanta is really focused on from a labor standpoint, a technology standpoint and how we help and collaborate with the client, not only from where they're at today, but how they transition. 
So at the very front end of that is where we're playing, and it's early in hydrogen. I do think there's going to be a significant amount of opportunity going forward, but we're already seeing where turbines and power plants on gas are starting to blend and even spec hydrogen to some degree. So it's going to be a piece of the nucleus of how you regulate and keep the grid balanced. The bigger issue with the grid is to balance it, sun, wind and then the balance thereof. So hydrogen will play a part of it."

But having said that, from an overall seasonality, I think I'd probably say it's reasonably similar to our overall electric power operations, probably really a little bit lower than the first, rising in the second, stronger in the third and then the fourth being either comparable to or having a slight decline depending upon the timing of any of these supply-type dynamics.

I'm talking more from the T&D side on hardening resilience relative to new investment replacement. Is that shifting? Are they focusing more on the former? And I'm assuming there's not a major difference in margin or utilization depending on what you guys do for them, but just wondered if you could share your thoughts on that."

So I think when we look at it, it depends on where you're at geographically, but certainly all of the above. We've seen storm hardening escalate. We've seen undergrounding certainly come about in a significant way. Those 2 things are there. I think what's underappreciated is the amount of infrastructure and the modernization necessary on the distribution system to handle the load, the EV. When you start putting these cars, batteries on at night. And on the distribution load of what it does to the system, I think it's underestimated on the cost and the amount of work that's out there of capital that's necessary to get these systems ready for electric vehicles. I just -- in my mind, it's just underappreciated."

But on Blattner, just the award activity in 3Q and since, given that you talked about a lot of solar mix shift for next year relative to the wind projects, I guess maybe just an update on kind of how things are trending there and if that mix shift is coming through. And then also, it seems like there's been a lot of approvals for offshore wind projects. And I think that's kind of outside of the wheelhouse that you're looking at. But are there opportunities for you to participate on any of those?"

So the commitment there, we're really looking at megawatts and not projects. The projects are certainly there. If we decide to start, say, the reward we got, I just think it's not valuable to the shareholder nor is it productive. So what we're saying is $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion next year and $3.6 billion in '25 of top line button. So that's how we see it. That's how robust it is. So it should give you a good idea of what we're seeing as a company and how we sit in the pendulum of the future and the renewable business. So in my mind, that shows where we're at. And I think, again, the words are there. We're certainly with the client, talking to them on a multiyear basis, not just one job. So that's fair.
Offshore, it's expensive. I think we have clients that are certainly -- have their plans around offshore. And we're certainly in there as far as interconnections. Things that we're good at, we'll do. But primarily as it comes onshore, just -- I've said this before, but we have had bad luck with boats, and I'm just not a boat fan."

What are the different elements of the learning curve you have to get up? And when can we expect that to normalize such that we can have sort of a more consistent margin expectation here on the telecom side within that, the electric segment? 
And then just maybe a quick follow-up on -- just to clarify on the Blattner deal, you've been extremely clear about the confidence that you have in the guidance numbers. But you've talked about the revenue numbers, not the EBITDA contribution. I just want to make sure there's no difference in your confidence in between the revenues and EBITDA."

As far as the telecom, we've talked about it in length. I think in general, what I would say is the closeouts on the end as far as engineering closeouts and things like that and then some descoping of certain clients on their builds created some effects in projects, and we're still working with the client. We'll do our best to call stuff back. But if you think about it, if we get $200 million and we did 6% instead of 10%, it's $6 million, something like that. 
It's just -- it's not big numbers for us long term, and I think we're not seeing big effects to that as far as margins. And we will get them in the double-digit ranges. We're operating for primarily in those ranges. We had some projects early on that are complicated. It's an industry issue. It's not just us. So it's something that we're all faced with and some closeouts. And I think we're in the late stages of those closeouts, and you'll start to see it get back in the double digits."
