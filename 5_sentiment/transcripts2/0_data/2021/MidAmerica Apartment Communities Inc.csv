We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. As detailed in our fourth quarter earnings report, MAA ended 2020 on a positive note, results were ahead of expectations, and we carry good momentum into calendar year 2021. During the fourth",636,"Thanks, Tim. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. As detailed in our fourth quarter earnings report, MAA ended 2020 on a positive note, results were ahead of expectations, and we carry good momentum into calendar year 2021. 
During the fourth quarter, leasing traffic was strong, and we captured 6% higher move-ins as compared to prior year. And despite the normal seasonal slowdown during the holidays, we were able to capture positive blended lease-over-lease rent growth that equaled the prior third quarter with particularly strong renewal lease pricing averaging 5.2% in Q4. Average physical occupancy also remained strong at 95.7% in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement from the performance in Q3. 
We believe these trends supported by improving employment conditions and the positive migration trends across our footprint positions MAA for continued outperformance into the coming spring and summer leasing season. Overall, conditions are setting up for a solid recovery cycle for apartment leasing fundamentals across the Sun Belt over the next 3 years or so as demand recovers and supply levels moderate a bit into 2022. 
I believe for several reasons that MAA is in particularly strong position as we head into the recovery part of the cycle. First, we expect that our Sun Belt markets will continue to capture job growth, migration trends and demand for apartment housing that will be well ahead of national trends. While there were clearly favorable Sunbelt migration trends by both employers and households prior to COVID, this past year the trends accelerated. The primary reasons behind these favorable migration trends, including enhanced affordability, favorable business climates and lower taxes will still be with us well past the point we get the pressures associated with COVID behind us. 
Secondly, the efforts we have underway this past year implementing change to a number of our processes involving new technology and web-based tools will continue to drive more opportunity for margin expansion. Specifically, steps taken to automate aspects of both our leasing and maintenance service operations will drive more efficiency with personnel cost. We expect to begin harvesting some of those early benefits later this year. 
Our redevelopment operation aimed at upgrading and repositioning many of our existing properties continues to capture very attractive rent growth and returns on capital. These higher levels of -- the higher levels of new apartment supply introduced into a number of markets over the past year will actually expand this redevelopment opportunity for us over the next couple of years. As outlined in the supplemental schedules to the earnings release, we also expanded our new development pipeline in the fourth quarter, with just over 2,600 units now underway. 
Our external growth pipeline executed through in-house development, prepurchase of joint venture development projects and the acquisition of existing properties will continue to expand over the next year. In addition to the projects outlined in our current pipeline schedule included in our earnings release, we have predevelopment activity currently underway with sites we own or have tied up in Denver, Tampa, Raleigh and Salt Lake City. 
Finally, and importantly, our balance sheet remains in a very strong position with ample capacity to support both our redevelopment and our new growth initiatives. 
Calendar year 2020 was certainly not the year we expected, but MAA's full cycle strategy with a uniquely diversified portfolio across the Sun Belt supported by a strong operating platform and balance sheet position the company to hold up well. Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to also say thank you to our MAA associates for a tremendous year of service and support to our residents, our shareholders and each other. 
Our strategy is working and our platform capabilities are strong. However, it's your intensity and passion for serving those who depend on our company that enables us to truly excel. Tom?"

The recovery we saw beginning in May and June continued across the portfolio through the fourth quarter. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 6%. This allowed us to improve average daily occupancy from 95.6% in the third quarter to 95.7% in the fourth quarter. In addition to the improvement in occupancy, we were able to hold blended rents in the fourth quarter, in line with the third quarter and an 80 basis point increase. All in-place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved 1.3% for the fourth quarter. As noted in the release, collections during the quarter were strong. We collected 99.2% of build rent in the fourth quarter. 
This is the same result we had in the third quarter of 2020. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The numbers of those seeking assistance has dropped over time. In April, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants has decreased to just 491 for the January rental assistance plan. This represents less than 0.5% of our 100,000 units. We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. 
During the fourth quarter, we made progress on our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. For the full year 2020, we installed 23,950 Smart Home packages and completed just over 4,200 interior unit upgrades. January's collections are in line with the good results we saw in the fourth quarter. As of January 31, we've collected 98.7% of rent build which is comparable to the month end number for the third and fourth quarters of 2020. 
Leasing volume in January was strong, up 4.9% from last year. Blended lease-over-lease rent growth effective during January exceeded last year's results for the first time since March. Effective blended lease-over-lease pricing for January was positive 2.2%, 40 basis improvement from the prior year. 
Effective new lease pricing for January was negative 1.8%. This is a 70 basis point improvement from January of last year. January renewals effective during the month were up 6.3%. 
Our customer service scores improved 110 basis points over the prior year. This aids to our retention trends, which are positive for January, February and March, as well as lease-over-lease renewal rates for those months, which are in the 5.5 to 6.5 range. Average daily occupancy for the month of January is 95.4%, which is even with January of last year. 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.8%. We're well positioned as we move into 2021. 
Led by job growth, which is expected to increase 3.4% in 2021 versus the 6.1% drop we saw for our markets in 2020, we expect to see the broad recovery in our region and the country continue. We expect Phoenix, Tampa, Raleigh and Jacksonville to be our strongest markets and expect Houston and Orlando and D.C. to recover at a slower rate. 
I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They served and care for our residents and our associates, and they have adapted to new business conditions and they drive our recovery. Well done, and thank you, all. I'll now turn the call over to Brad."

While most buyers have returned to the market, the lack of available for-sale properties continues to restrict transaction volume. 
Investor demand for multifamily product within our region of the country is very strong. And this supply/demand imbalance is driving aggressive pricing. Due to the robust demand, supported by continued low interest rates, cap rates have compressed further and are frequently in the high 3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations within our markets. 
We expect to remain active in the transaction market this year. So based on pricing levels we're currently seeing, we're not optimistic that we will succeed in finding existing communities that will clear our underwriting hurdles in 2021. 
While acquiring will be a challenge, as noted in the earnings guidance, we do plan to come to market with $200 million to $250 million of planned property dispositions this year. We will redeploy those proceeds into our growing development pipeline, which currently stands at $595 million with 8 projects and just over 2,600 units. In the fourth quarter, we started construction on the MAA Windmill Hill in Austin, Texas as well as Novel Val Vista, a prepurchase in Phoenix, Arizona. 
Both of these are lower density suburban projects that we expect to deliver stabilized NOI yields around 6%, well in excess of our current acquisition cap rates. Despite increased construction costs as well as some supply chain issues related specifically to cabinets and appliances, our development and prepurchase projects remain on budget with no significant delay concerns at this point. 
We have several other development sites owned or under contract that we hope to start construction on in 2021 and into 2022. We are encouraged that despite facing some supply pressure, our Phase 2 lease-up property located in Fort Worth continues to lease up at our original expectations as does our soon to be completed Phase 2 in Dallas, where over 90% of the units have been delivered. 
Turning to the outlook for new supply deliveries in 2021. Based on our assessment and the projection data we have, new supply deliveries across our major markets are projected to remain flat with 2020 levels, at 2.8% of existing inventory. 
Consistent with previous years, we expect delayed starts, extended construction schedules, canceled projects and overall construction capacity constraints to continue to impact actual supply deliveries to some degree. While clearly, new supply does have an impact on our business, it's just 1 side of the equation with demand playing a significant role as well. And for reasons Eric mentioned in his comments, we believe the demand for multifamily housing within our region of the country will remain strong and improve this year as the economy continues to recover. 
When looking at the ratios for expected job growth to new supply deliveries in 2021, we expect leasing conditions in our footprint to improve from last year. Encouragingly, the data on permitting activity and construction starts for our region of the country continue to show activity below prepandemic levels. This group -- this drop in activity will likely lead to a moderating level of new supply deliveries into 2022, setting up for what we believe will be an improved leasing environment beyond this year. 
That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Al."

Thank you, Brad, and good morning. Core FFO of $1.65 per share for the fourth quarter produced full year core FFO of $6.43 per share, which represented a 2.7% growth over the prior year and is well above our internal expectations following the break",727,"Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning. Core FFO of $1.65 per share for the fourth quarter produced full year core FFO of $6.43 per share, which represented a 2.7% growth over the prior year and is well above our internal expectations following the breakout of the pandemic. Stable occupancy, strong collections and positive pricing performance were the primary drivers of continued same-store revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is 1.8% and for the full year, which is 2.5%. As expected, same-store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were impacted by growth in real estate taxes, insurance costs and the continued rollout of the bulk Internet program, which is included in utilities expenses. 
And though some of this pressure will carry into 2021, we expect overall same-store operating expenses to begin moderating this year, which I'll discuss just a bit more in a moment. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We had no significant refinancing activity during the fourth quarter, but we continue to fund the development pipeline and internal redevelopment programs. 
As Brad mentioned, our development pipeline has increased to 8 deals with total projected costs of $595 million. During the quarter, we funded $104 million of development costs, leaving less than half or another $259 million remaining to be funded towards the completion of the current pipeline. 
Though still growing, our pipeline is still is only about 3% of our enterprise value, which is a modest risk given the overall strength of our balance sheet and a diversified portfolio strategy. As Tom mentioned, we also made good progress toward the -- during the quarter on our internal programs, funding a total of $40 million toward the interior unit redevelopments, Smart Home installations and external amenity upgrades, bringing our full year funding for these programs to $76 million, which is expected to begin contributing to our growth more strongly late in 2021 and 2022. We ended the year with low leverage debt-to-EBITDA of only 4.8x and with $850 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our line of credit. 
Finally, we provided initial earnings guidance for 2021 with our release, which is detailed in our supplemental information package. Core FFO for the full year is projected to be $6.30 to $6.60 per share, which is $6.45 at the midpoint. The primary driver of earnings performance is same-store revenue growth, which is projected to be around 2% for the year. This growth is based on the expectation of continued improving economic trends and job growth in our markets, as Tom outlined, and we believe these trends will support both stable occupancy levels, averaging around 95.5% for the year. And modestly improving pricing trends through the year, driving effective rent growth for the year of around 1.7%. And an additional contribution of 30 to 40 basis points of projected revenue growth for the year is related to the final portion of our double-play bulk Internet program. 
We do expect the first quarter to be our lowest revenue growth for the year as it will bear the full impact of 2020's pricing performance growing from there [indiscernible] as improving leasing trends take full effect. Same-store operating expense growth is projected to moderate some as compared to 2020, will continue to be impacted by the rollout of double-play and higher insurance costs with these costs combining for an estimated 1.4% of the same-store expense growth in 2021. 
But excluding double-play and insurance, all other same-store expenses are expected to increase in a more minus 2.5% to 3% range for the full year. And this includes real estate tax growth of 3.75% at the midpoint, which is moderating, but still somewhat elevated. Overhead costs for 2021 are projected to be more normalized, with total overhead expenses expected to be about $107 million for the year, which is a 2.8% increase over the midpoint of our original guidance for 2020. Our forecast also assumes development funding, $250 million to $350 million for the year, primarily provided by projected asset sales of $200 million to $250 million. And given our current forecast, we have no current plans to raise additional equity, and we expect to end the year with our debt-to-EBITDA just below 5x. And so that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we'll now turn the call back over to you for any questions."

But I'd say, having said that, when we look at the spread between the rents of new supply that's coming online versus our properties. That spread is still really good. And as Eric said, that's leading to more redevelopment opportunities for us. So we think that, that continues. 
It's hard to say where -- just looking at permitting trends, while they're clearly down versus pre-COVID levels, I would say construction starts are down even more. It's hard to say just from the permitting data, where that supply is located. But my sense is it's going to be more suburban in nature.

They are becoming very restrictive about what they are allowing in the way of apartment permitting believing that these additional households will put some level of stress on the infrastructure and we're seeing that the permitting activity is starting to get a lot more restrictive than it ever has been in a lot of these southeastern markets. 
So I think there is another, if you will, a hurdle starting to develop across some of these southeast markets that will make it increasingly a little bit more challenging to supply some of these suburban locations."

Just to add on to some of that detail that Tom laid out there. I do think that there are a lot of reasons to believe that a lot of this migration trend that we saw the U.S. population to the southeast over the past year, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, a lot of these trends were evident prior to COVID. COVID accelerated those trends somewhat. And I would tell you that I believe a lot of the moves that took place during 2020 are pretty sticky in nature. And I think that the trends are likely to continue post COVID. 
I think you have to recognize a lot of these southeastern markets, they continue to offer all the same attractive qualities that I think started the trend some years back. And what is happening as more employers are bringing more knowledge-based jobs and tech jobs into this region of country, employment base is really starting to further diversify. 
And of course, work from home and these knowledge-based jobs allows a lot more remote working, which I think is also working in our favor. So I think that a combination of just how these economic trends have been building, frankly, in these job and migration trends have been building for the last 10 years or so, recognizing accelerated a little bit last year, but those trends were in place well before COVID, and I think we'll continue past COVID, the affordability of the region, particularly as it relates to housing, continues to, I think, be very, very attractive and will become even more so over the next 10 years.

And what Nashville and what Austin and what Raleigh have to offer people today versus where they were 20 years ago is night-and-day difference. And so I'm very optimistic that we are at the beginning of some continued very favorable trends for housing needs throughout this region of the country."

At the end of the day, I think REIT shareholder capital over time, over a long period of time, is largely rewarded through steady earnings growth, obviously, and particularly dividend growth. And having said that, I've always believed then that the best way to accomplish that performance objective and that profile is deploy capital where demand is likely to be the best and the strongest and growing in a consistent fashion over a long period of time. I get it that the southeast markets for years, the argument and criticism was that there are lower barriers to supply and new supply can come in and oversupply a market. What I would tell you is what supply causes is it causes moderation what demand causes is steady earnings growth over time. And a falloff in demand can have catastrophic consequences. And an oversupplied market is unlikely to be catastrophic in nature. It can be weak for a year or but it's unlikely to trigger a massive sort of upset to your earnings stream can put a company in trouble, create dividend stress and things of that nature. So I've always believed that these Sunbelt markets offer the performance profile that we're after. And that's what we should be doing and where we should focus our capital. So it's a very long answer to your question, but no, we have no interest in now using this opportunity to go into these gateway markets. I don't think our -- what we're trying to do for capital -- for shareholder capital would not be sufficiently rewarded for pursuing that. At this point, we don't see a reason to do that and we like what we're doing."

I think you're extraordinarily fortunate to be so heavy in these markets, having built the platform that you've done through a lot of hard work and acquisitions and M&A and development. But there's a lot of capital chasing these markets too, right, which is going to drive down returns overall. 
And I'm not -- ignoring the fact that the demand is extraordinarily strong, but is there a financial side of it, too, that as money is coming out of these gateways that you could create a better total return by deploying capital or reallocating capital in the portfolio? Or is that just not -- in your view, the demand is not there, so I'm not going to -- it doesn't matter if I can get 100 basis points or 200 basis points higher initial return out of it?"

And I mean, obviously, I think it depends somewhat on your investment horizon. As you think about risk return, risk/reward/return, I think, clearly, there's going to be opportunities that are going to emerge in some of these gateway markets. Where you can go in and deploy capital and make an investment and create an exceptional return on your investment. I think it somewhat depends on your horizon and how long you want to think about the capital being deployed in that market. Again, from our perspective, we're very long-term investors, very long term holders, and we're trying to create an earnings profile from that investment action to match up well in terms of how we're trying to perform for capital over a long period of time. And so we just don't believe that with that horizon that we're working with and that objective that we're shooting for that the gateway markets really align for us in the way we want to try to perform for capital. I'm not suggesting that focusing on those markets is wrong. And I think there are certainly ways to make a lot of money in those markets. But I think you have to think about your horizon, perhaps a little bit differently. 
And I will say that while we continue to see capital coming into these markets, I think that there are times where these gateway markets over the last -- and you know this, over the last 10 or 15 years, I mean, just attracting an enormous amount of capital and a lot of international capital sometimes that I think was really motivated by some looking for a great return on their capital, in some cases, is looking for a place to preserve capital, if you will. And so you get a lot of different influences on some of these bigger gateway markets, and particularly with international capital. That can, I think, create some distortions from time to time in terms of assets are being priced relative to the long-term earnings potential of the investment. So we just see volatility and other aspects of those markets, those gateway markets that just don't really match up well to how we're trying to perform for capital, and we're going to continue to focus on it the way we do."

I think just overall, I mean, just given the uncertainty that's in the marketplace, I think that the first quarter being the first quarter of the year and where you have the most uncertainty, I think the range was just to reflect that. And I think the driver for the forecast for the whole year is based on revenue performance. 
And so I think that's the key to be the top or the bottom of the range and really for the year or for the quarter. And I think the first quarter, as I talked about a little bit in the comments, is expected to be the lowest revenue quarter for the year, but that's really reflecting effective rent per unit, which is a combination, which is backward or trailing indicator, which is a combination of the pricing you did last year plus what you're doing this year. 
And so we're expecting improving pricing trends, but the first quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter because it will reflect really, the bulk of last year's pricing, which was 1.3% on average, and we certainly expect that to be higher in 2021 based on the forecast we're putting together. So that's really the key factor. I hope that answers your question."

I think it depends on a few things. One, the markets that folks are looking in. Certainly, some markets are easier to get financing in or less hard to get financing in than others. 
Then I think it also depends on the sponsor. I mean I think what we're seeing is generally for the larger developers, the strong sponsors that historically have had pretty good pipelines. They're still able to get financing. But I think the smaller developers that do just a handful of deals a year they're not as strong. They don't have as strong a relationship with the banks, are having a little bit tougher time getting their debt financing lined up. 
So that certainly has been an impact in financing, and that also certainly leads to some of our prepurchase opportunities. In terms of loan terms, we're seeing, call it, 10-year rates in that 4%, 4.5% range for construction financing, which I think is still decent at the moment. Really, the only change that we've seen -- or the biggest change we've seen in construction or in financing, not constructive financing, but is really has to do with the low cap rates that we're currently seeing for  these stabilized assets. The low cap rates are starting to drive some LTV movement in order for debt service coverage ratios to continue to be held. 
So we are seeing loan to values come down a bit. We're not seeing any impact yet on pricing, but we'll really just see how that unfolds later this year as more opportunities come to market. But that's basically what we're seeing at the moment."

But I just -- I feel like that what we're going to find is that over the next -- I think there's real fundamental shift that has -- that was in place, if you will, to some degree before COVID as employers and job seekers, if you will, were continually drawn to this region of the country as a consequence of all the things that you know about. 
And I just believe that those factors have not moderated. They have not lessened. COVID accelerated them a little bit, but those trends are going to continue well past COVID. And I think that what we're finding that is, particularly as some of this millennial generation continues to age, they've moved in up in their career. They've moved into jobs increasingly that I think offer the ability to be more remote than they have been in the past. 
That -- the drive that they had to be in New York and work 60, 70 hours a week that was then. They're in a different place now. And I just -- I feel like that a combination of, frankly, the aging millennial generation and how their lifestyle needs evolve and desires change as well as retiring baby boomers who are looking for change and looking for more affordable living. That those 2 big slugs of the demographics of the U.S., the millennials and the retiring baby boomers, those are huge numbers. And as those 2 age demographics evolve, I think the Sunbelt stands to benefit more so than some of the higher cost coastal markets. 
And so I heard somebody suggest that, yes, the coastal markets are going to -- the gateway markets are going to come back. But they're probably going to come back a little bit cheaper and a little bit younger than they were before. And I think there's probably some truth to that."

And I think it kind of really goes to some of the questions that I've heard asked, and maybe, Eric, your tone, just on the recovery in your market seems pretty upbeat. 
But yet, when you kind of take where fourth quarter same-store revenue growth was, and you look at the midpoint of the guidance, you layer in the accelerating redevelopment. I guess 1 of the questions we have, and I think others are driving at is why isn't that driving a little more reacceleration other than just the earn-in of last year's effective rents. Is there anything else you've assumed in guidance or higher turnover, lower occupancy that's contributing to maybe a more muted reacceleration in 2021?"

We went into the 2020 with some of the highest earned-in leasing performance that we've ever had, and that allowed effective rent per unit to remain fairly strong, if you will, throughout 2020, which was hugely helpful. I remember late in 2019, people are asking me what I'm worried about. And I said, I'm worried about a slowdown. I worried about something happening with the economy. And in preparation for that worry, the best thing we could do is grow rents as hard as we could, even at the expense of giving up a little bit of occupancy and allow that compounding benefit to be there is a protective performance on revenues, should we see the economy weaken and that certainly helped us this past year. 
So what I would tell you is, I mean, there are 2 things at play here that I think are going to cause the recovery process, the recovery slope to be steady as opposed to being a real steep-up curve, if you will, one is we are still battling supply issues, and we will have those supply issues throughout 2021, pretty consistent with what we saw in 2020. We think it actually peaks in the first part of the year. It probably starts to moderate a little bit towards the back half of the year, but that's well after we get past the peak leasing season for 2021. 
So -- and as we pointed out, the supply picture, I think, improves as we get into 2022 and beyond, at least for a couple of years. I think probably by the time we get to '24, '25, it starts to accelerate again as a consequence of what we see happening with permitting today. 
But the other factor that is at play here is that we are still now carrying -- the first quarter of this year, is going to reflect the full negative impact of the pricing performance that we had to do during the spring and summer leasing season of 2020 when it was at its weakest. And so that -- all that's going to continue to roll through the portfolio and it will peak, we believe, in the first quarter. 
But as we get into the spring and summer leasing season of 2021, where we do believe that the leasing environment will be much more positive and better then we will again start to compound that improvement in terms of our revenue performance, and it will build, and it will build by the time we get into late 2021, and particularly as we get into 2022. So that -- those 2 things sort of supply pressure, but particularly sort of the compounding effect of lease-over-lease pricing and what it does to revenues, it takes time for that to work through the system."

During the fourth",636,"Thanks, Tim. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. As detailed in our fourth quarter earnings report, MAA ended 2020 on a positive note, results were ahead of expectations, and we carry good momentum into calendar year 2021.  
During the fourth quarter, leasing traffic was strong, and we captured 6% higher move-ins as compared to prior year. And despite the normal seasonal slowdown during the holidays, we were able to capture positive blended lease-over-lease rent growth that equaled the prior third quarter with particularly strong renewal lease pricing averaging 5.2% in Q4. 
Average physical occupancy also remained strong at 95.7% in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement from the performance in Q3. We believe these trends supported by improving employment conditions and the positive migration trends across our footprint positions MAA for continued outperformance into the coming spring and summer leasing season. 
Overall, conditions are setting up for a solid recovery cycle for apartment leasing fundamental across the Sun Belt over the next 3 years or so as demand recovers and supply levels moderate a bit into 2022.  I believe for several reasons that MAA is in particularly strong position as we head into the recovery part of the cycle. 
First, we expect that our Sun Belt markets will continue to capture job growth, migration trends and demand for apartment housing that will be well ahead of national trends. While there were clearly favorable Sun Belt migration trends by both employers and households prior to COVID, this past year the trends accelerated. The primary reasons behind these favorable migration trends, including enhanced affordability, favorable business climates and lower taxes will still be with us well past the point we get the pressures associated with COVID behind us.  
Secondly, the efforts we have underway this past year implementing change to a number of our processes involving new technology and web-based tools will continue to drive more opportunity for margin expansion. Specifically, steps taken to automate aspects of both our leasing and maintenance service operations will drive more efficiency with personnel cost. We expect to begin harvesting some of those early benefits later this year.  
Our redevelopment operation aimed at upgrading and repositioning many of our existing properties continues to capture very attractive rent growth and returns on capital. These higher levels of -- the higher levels of new apartment supply introduced into a number of markets over the past year will actually expand this redevelopment opportunity for us over the next couple of years. As outlined in the supplemental schedules to earnings release, we also expanded our new development pipeline in the fourth quarter, with just over 2,600 units now underway.  
Our external growth pipeline executed through in-house development, prepurchase of joint venture development projects and the acquisition of existing properties will continue to expand over the next year. 
In addition to the projects outlined in our current pipeline schedule included in our earnings release, we have predevelopment activity currently underway with sites we own or have tied up in Denver, Tampa, Raleigh and Salt Lake City.  
Finally, and importantly, our balance sheet remains in a very strong position with ample capacity to support both our redevelopment and our new growth initiatives. Calendar year 2020 was certainly not the year we expected, but MAA's full cycle strategy with a uniquely diversified portfolio across the Sun Belt supported by a strong operating platform and balance sheet position the company to hold up well. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to also say thank you to our MAA associates for a tremendous year of service and support to our residents, our shareholders and each other. Our strategy is working and our platform capabilities are strong. However, it's your intensity and passion for serving those who depend on our company that enables us to truly excel. Tom?"

The recovery we saw beginning in May and June continued across the portfolio through the fourth quarter. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 6%. This allowed us to improve average daily occupancy from 95.6% in the third quarter to 95.7% in the fourth quarter. In addition to the improvement in occupancy, we were able to hold blended rents in the fourth quarter, in line with the third quarter and an 80 basis point increase. 
All in-place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved 1.3% for the fourth quarter. As noted in the release, collections during the quarter were strong. We collected 99.2% of build rent in the fourth quarter. This is the same result we had in the third quarter of 2020. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The numbers of those seeking assistance has dropped over time. In April, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants has decreased to just 491 for the January rental assistance plan. This represents less than 0.5% of our 100,000 units. 
We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we made progress on our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. For the full year 2020, we installed 23,950 Smart Home packages and completed just over 4,200 interior unit upgrades. January's collections are in line with the good results we saw in the fourth quarter. As of January 31, we've collected 98.7% of rent build which is comparable to the month end number for the third and fourth quarters of 2020.  
Leasing volume in January was strong, up 4.9% from last year. Blended lease-over-lease rent growth effective during January exceeded last year's results for the first time since March. Effective blended lease-over-lease pricing for January was positive 2.2%, 40 basis improvement from the prior year.  
Effective new lease pricing for January was negative 1.8%. This is a 70 basis point improvement from January of last year. January renewals effective during the month were up 6.3%.  
Our customer service scores improved 110 basis points over the prior year. This aids to our retention trends, which are positive for January, February and March, as well as lease-over-lease renewal rates for those months, which are in the 5.5 to 6.5 range. 
Average daily occupancy for the month of January is 95.4%, which is even with January of last year. 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.8%. We're well positioned as we move into 2021.  
Led by job growth, which is expected to increase 3.4% in 2021 versus the 6.1% drop we saw for our markets in 2020, we expect to see the broad recovery in our region and the country continue. We expect Phoenix, Tampa, Raleigh and Jacksonville to be our strongest markets and expect Houston, Orlando and D.C. to recover at a slower rate.  
I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They served and care for our residents and our associates, and they have adapted to new business conditions that drive -- and they drive our recovery. Well done, and thank you, all. I'll now turn the call over to Brad."

While most buyers have returned to the market, the lack of available for sale properties continues to restrict transaction volume. Investor demand for multifamily product within our region of the country is very strong. And this supply/demand imbalance is driving aggressive pricing. 
Due to the robust demand, supported by continued low interest rates, cap rates have compressed further and are frequently in the high 3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations within our markets. We expect to remain active in the transaction market this year. So based on pricing levels we're currently seeing, we're not optimistic that we will succeed in finding existing communities that will clear our underwriting hurdles in 2021.  
While acquiring will be a challenge, as noted in the earnings guidance, we do plan to come to market with $200 million to $250 million of planned property dispositions this year. We will redeploy those proceeds into our growing development pipeline, which currently stands at $595 million with 8 projects in just over 2,600 units. 
In the fourth quarter, we started construction on the MAA Windmill Hill in Austin, Texas as well as Novel Val Vista, a prepurchase in Phoenix, Arizona. Both of these are lower density suburban projects that we expect to deliver stabilized NOI yields around 6%, well in excess of our current acquisition cap rates. Despite increased construction costs as well as some supply chain issues related specifically to cabinets and appliances, our development and prepurchase projects remain on budget with no significant delay concerns at this point.  
We have several other development sites owned or under contract that we hope to start construction on in 2021 and into 2022. We are encouraged that despite facing some supply pressure, our Phase 2 lease-up property located in Fort Worth continues to lease up at our original expectations as does our soon to be completed Phase 2 in Dallas, where over 90% of the units have been delivered.  
Turning to the outlook for new supply deliveries in 2021. Based on our assessment and the projection data we have, new supply deliveries across our major markets are projected to remain flat with 2020 levels, at 2.8% of existing inventory. Consistent with previous year's, we expect delayed starts, extended construction schedules, canceled projects and overall construction capacity constraints to continue to impact actual supply deliveries to some degree. While clearly, new supply does have an impact on our business, it's just one side of the equation with demand playing a significant role as well. And for reasons Eric mentioned in his comments, we believe the demand for multifamily housing within our region of the country will remain strong and improve this year as the economy continues to recover.  
When looking at the ratios for expected job growth to new supply deliveries in 2021, we expect leasing conditions in our footprint to improve from last year. Encouragingly, the data on permitting activity and construction starts for our region of the country continue to show activity below prepandemic levels. This group -- this drop in activity will likely lead to a moderating level of new supply deliveries into 2022, setting up for what we believe will be an improved leasing environment beyond this year.  
That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Al."

Stable occupancy, strong collections and positive pricing performance were the primary drivers of continued same-store revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is 1.8% and for the full year, which is 2.5%. 
As expected, same-store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were impacted by growth in real estate taxes, insurance costs and the continued rollout of the bulk internet program, which is included in utilities expenses. And though some of this pressure will carry into 2021, we expect overall same-store operating expenses to begin moderating this year, which I'll discuss just a bit more in a moment. 
Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We had no significant refinancing activity during the fourth quarter, but we continue to fund the development pipeline and internal redevelopment programs. As Brad mentioned, our development pipeline has increased to 8 deals with total projected costs of $595 million. During the quarter, we funded $104 million of development costs, leaving less than half or another $259 million remaining to be funded toward the completion of the current pipeline. Though still growing, our pipeline is still is only about 3% of our enterprise value, which is a modest risk, given the overall strength of our balance sheet and a diversified portfolio strategy. 
As Tom mentioned, we also made good progress toward the -- during the quarter on our internal programs, funding a total of $40 million toward the interior unit redevelopments, Smart Home installations and external amenity upgrades, bringing our full year funding for lease programs to $76 million, which is expected to begin contributing to our growth more strongly late in 2021 and 2022. We ended the year with low leverage, debt-to-EBITDA of only 4.8x and with $850 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our line of credit.  
Finally, we provided initial earnings guidance for 2021 with our release, which is detailed in our supplemental information package. Core FFO for the full year is projected to be $6.30 to $6.60 per share, which is $6.45 at the midpoint. The primary driver of earnings performance is same-store revenue growth, which is projected to be around 2% for the year. This growth is based on the expectation of continued improving economic trends and job growth in our markets, as Tom outlined, and we believe these trends will support both stable occupancy levels, averaging around 95.5% for the year. And modestly improving pricing trends through the year, driving effective rent growth for the year of around 1.7%. An additional contribution of 30 to 40 basis points of projected revenue growth for the year is related to the final portion of our Double Play bulk internet program.  
We do expect the first quarter to be our lowest revenue growth for the year as it will bear the full impact of 2020's pricing performance growing from there as the -- head from there as improving leasing trends take full effect. 
Same-store operating expense growth is projected to moderate some as compared to 2020, will continue to be impacted by the rollout of Double Play and higher insurance costs with these costs combining for an estimated 1.4% of the same-store expense growth in 2021. But excluding Double Play and insurance, all other same-store expenses are expected to increase in a more modest 2.5% to 3% range for the full year. And this includes real estate tax growth of 3.75% at the midpoint, which is moderating, but still somewhat elevated. 
Overhead costs for 2021 are projected to be more normalized, with total overhead expenses expected to be about $107 million for the year, which is a 2.8% increase over the midpoint of our original guidance for 2020. Our forecast also assumes development funding of $250 million to $350 million for the year, primarily provided by projected asset sales of $200 million to $250 million. And given our current forecast, we have no current plans to raise additional equity, and we expect to end the year with our debt-to-EBITDA just below 5x. 
So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we'll now turn the call back over to you for any questions."

But I'd say, having said that, when we look at the spread between the rents of new supply that's coming online versus our properties. That spread is still really good. And as Eric said, that's leading to more redevelopment opportunities for us. So we think that continues. It's hard to say where -- just looking at permitting trends, while they're clearly down versus pre-COVID levels, I would say construction starts are down even more. It's hard to say just from the permitting data, where that supply is located. But my sense is, it's going to be more suburban in nature. But given the economics of where costs are, the rent levels of those are still going to be pretty substantial compared to our current product."

As more of this multi-housing product heads to the suburbs, we're seeing a lot of -- particularly in the satellite cities, the suburban cities, if you will, that have their own school systems and their own municipal governments. They are becoming very restrictive about what they are allowing in the way of apartment permitting, believing that these additional households will put some level of stress on the infrastructure and we're seeing that the permitting activity is starting to get a lot more restrictive than it ever has been in a lot of these southeastern markets.  
So I think there is another, if you will, a hurdle starting to develop across some of these southeast markets that will make it increasingly a little bit more challenging to supply some of these suburban locations."

Just to add on to some of that detail that Tom laid out there. I do think that there are a lot of reasons to believe that a lot of this migration trend that we saw the U.S. population to the southeast over the past year, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, a lot of these trends were evident prior to COVID. COVID accelerated those trends somewhat. And I would tell you that, I believe a lot of this -- a lot of the moves that took place during 2020 are pretty sticky in nature. And I think that the trends are likely to continue post COVID. 
I think you have to recognize a lot of these southeastern markets, they continue to offer all the same attractive qualities that I think started the trend some years back. And what is so -- happening as more employers are bringing more knowledge-based jobs and tech jobs into this region of country, the employment base is really starting to further diversify. And of course, work from home and these knowledge-based jobs allows a lot more remote working, which I think is also working in our favor. 
And so I think that a combination of just how these economic trends have been building, frankly, in these job and migration trends have been building for the last 10 years or so, recognizing -- accelerated a little bit last year, but those trends were in place well before COVID, and I think we'll continue past COVID. The affordability of the region, particularly as it relates to housing, continues to, I think, be very, very attractive and will become even more so over the next 10 years. 
And I think we also have to recognize that these Sun Belt markets are continuing to become very desirable places to live. And what Nashville and what Austin and what Raleigh have to offer people today versus where they were 20 years ago is night-and-day difference. And so I'm very optimistic that we are at the beginning of some continued very favorable trends for housing needs throughout this region of the country."

At the end of the day, I think REIT shareholder capital over time, over a long period of time is largely rewarded through steady earnings growth, obviously, and particularly dividend growth. And having said that, I've always believed then that the best way to accomplish that performance objective and that profile is, deploy capital where demand is likely to be the best and the strongest and growing in a consistent fashion over a long period of time. 
I get it that the southeast markets for years, the argument and criticism was that there are lower barriers to supply and new supply can come in and oversupply a market. What I would tell you is, what supply causes, it causes moderation. What demand causes is steady earnings growth over time. And a falloff in demand can have catastrophic consequences. And an oversupplied market is unlikely to be catastrophic in nature. It can be weak for a year or two but it's unlikely to trigger a massive -- sort of upset your earnings stream, which can put a company in trouble, create dividend stress and things of that nature. 
So I've always believed that these Sunbelt markets offer the performance profile that we're after. And that's what we should be doing and where we should focus our capital. So it's a very long answer to your question. But no, we have no interest in now using this opportunity to go into these gateway markets. I don't think our -- what we're trying to do for capital -- for shareholder capital would not be sufficiently rewarded for pursuing that. At this point, we don't see a reason to do that and we like what we're doing."

And I'm not ignoring the fact that the demand is extraordinarily strong, but is there a financial side of it, too, that, as money is coming out of these gateways that you could create a better total return by deploying capital or reallocating capital in the portfolio?

As you think about risk return, risk/reward/return, I think, clearly, there's going to be opportunities that are going to emerge in some of these gateway markets, where you can go in and deploy capital and make an investment and create an exceptional return on your investment. 
I think it somewhat depends on your horizon and how long you want to think about the capital being deployed in that market. Again, from our perspective, we're very long-term investors, very long term holders, and we're trying to create an earnings profile from that investment action to match up well in terms of how we're trying to perform for capital over a long period of time. And so we just don't believe that, with that horizon that we're working with and that objective that we're shooting for, that the gateway markets really align for us in the way we want to try to perform for capital. I'm not suggesting that focusing on those markets is wrong. And I think there are -- there's certainly ways to make a lot of money in those markets. But I think you have to think about your horizon, perhaps a little bit differently. 
And I will say that, while we continue to see capital coming into these markets, I think that there were times where these gateway markets over the last -- and you know this, over the last 10 or 15 years, I mean, just attracting enormous amount of capital and a lot of international capital sometimes that I think was really motivated by, now someone who're looking for a great return on their capital, in some cases, is looking for a place to preserve capital, if you will. 
And so you get a lot of different influences on some of these bigger gateway markets, and particularly with international capital that can, I think, create some distortions from time to time in terms of assets are being priced relative to the long-term earnings potential of the investment. So we just see volatility and other aspects of those markets. Now those gateway markets just don't really match up well to how we're trying to perform for capital, and we're going to continue to focus on it the way we do."

Obviously, we're a month into the quarter, and there are fewer leases that are signed and recognized, still the uncertainty, but just wondering if you can walk through how you could end up at the high end or the low end? And then specific to your same-store revenue comment, where you expect same-store revenue to be in the first quarter? I know you said it should be the lowest point of the year?"

I think just overall, I mean, just given the uncertainty that's in the marketplace, I think that the first quarter being the first quarter of the year and where you have the most uncertainty. I think the range was just to reflect that. And I think the driver for the forecast for the whole year is based on revenue performance. 
And so I think that's the key to be the top or the bottom of the range and really for the year or for the quarter. And I think the first quarter, as talked about a little bit in the comments, is expected to be the lowest revenue quarter for the year, but that's really reflecting effective rent per unit, which is a combination, which is backward or trailing indicator, which is a combination of the pricing you did last year, plus what you're doing this year. 
And so we're expecting improving pricing trends, but the first quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter because it will reflect really, the bulk of last year's pricing, which was 1.3% on average, and we certainly expect that to be higher in 2021 based on the forecast we're putting together. So that's really the key factor. I hope that answers your question."

And the -- really, the variation is with a new renter, they have a level of leverage because they're shopping, and they can move anywhere and their switching. Costs are really the same. If we have done our job and provided good resident service in taking care of the residents and, frankly, a pretty challenging time, we've earned the opportunity because we've created for value to charge a little bit more. And so that is where we have the most pricing power because we've worked with them, we've earned them and their switching costs are a little bit higher. So that delta that you talk about has always been there. It is widest in this time of year, and it will be tightest in the summer months, but we expect that, and we plan for that.

I think it depends on a few things. One, the markets that folks are looking in. Certainly, some markets are easier to get financing in or less hard to get financing in than others. 
Then I think it also depends on the sponsor. I mean I think what we're seeing is generally for the larger developers, the strong sponsors that historically have had pretty good pipelines. They're still able to get financing. But I think the smaller developers that do just a handful of deals a year, they're not as strong. They don't have as strong a relationship with the banks, or having a little bit tougher time getting their debt financing lined up. 
So that certainly has been an impact in financing, and that also certainly leads to some of our prepurchase opportunities. In terms of loan terms, we're seeing, call it, 10-year rates in that 4%, 4.5% range for construction financing, which I think is still decent at the moment. Really, the only change that we've -- or the biggest change we've seen in construction or in financing, not construction financing, but is really has to do with the low cap rates that we're currently seeing for these stabilized assets. The low cap rates are starting to drop some LTV movement in order for debt service coverage ratios to continue to be held. 
So we are seeing loan to values come down a bit. We're not seeing any impact yet on pricing, but we'll really just see how that unfolds later this year as more opportunities come to market. But that's basically what we're seeing at the moment."

But as new supply begins to -- over the next few years, if it is more oriented towards the suburban locations, that's actually going to expand our field of opportunity for more extensive redevelopment out in the suburb components of the portfolio because obviously, this new product is coming in at a price point that is well above our existing product and with comparable locations and comparable appeal in that regard, we can go in and make these investments with kitchen and bath upgrades and create a very competitive product. And so offer the market, the renter market a slight discount to the newer product and get great returns on capital and get great lease-up success with it.

We are fortunate in our markets that the rents have continued to hold up within our markets. So we're not having to make some aggressive assumptions with rent trending or some large recovery in rent in our underwriting. 
So the 2 that we just started, as I said in my comments, we're still looking at north of a 6% yield. And certainly, that compares very favorably when you look at Class A brand-new products in our markets, what they're trading at today. So we continue to believe in that.

And you can argue that there are some real bargains in a lot of other areas that you're not in, that could entice people perhaps even more this time around than then. Again, it's never been positive in migration. Really, I don't think that's ever happened with the Sunbelt into a market like New York, but it probably will normalize.

So I don't disagree that the 12% -- go back 2 years ago, before COVID, the move-ins from outside of our footprint were a little over 9%. So even compared to where we are today with COVID, it's only moved up from 9% of our move-ins from outside the footprint to 12% of the -- so I -- your point is valid in that sense. It hasn't changed radically. 
But I just -- I feel like that what we're going to find is that over the next -- I think there's real fundamental shift that has -- that was in place, if you will, to some degree before COVID as employers and job seekers, if you will, were continually drawn to this region of the country as a consequence of all the things that you know about. 
And I just believe that those factors have not moderated. They have not lessened. COVID accelerated them a little bit, but those trends are going to continue well past COVID. And I think that what we're finding that is, particularly as some of this millennial generation continues to age. They've moved in up in their career. They've moved into jobs increasingly that I think offer the ability to be more remote than they have been in the past. 
That drive that they had to be in New York and work 60, 70 hours a week that was then. They're in a different place now. And I just -- I feel like that a combination of, frankly, the aging millennial generation and how their lifestyle needs evolve and desires change as well as retiring baby boomers, who are looking for change and looking for more affordable living. Those 2 big slugs of the demographics of the U.S., the millennials and the retiring baby boomers, those are huge numbers. And as those 2 age demographics evolve, I think the Sunbelt stands to benefit more so than some of the higher cost coastal markets. 
And so I heard somebody suggest that, yes, the coastal markets are going to -- the gateway markets are going to come back. But they're probably going to come back a little bit cheaper and a little bit younger than they were before. And I think there's probably some truth to that."

But yet, when you kind of take where fourth quarter same-store revenue growth was, and you look at the midpoint of the guidance, you layer in the accelerating redevelopment. I guess one of the questions we have, and I think others are driving at is, why isn't that driving a little more reacceleration other than just the earn-in of last year's effective rents. Is there anything else you've assumed in guidance, higher turnover, lower occupancy that's contributing to maybe a more muted reacceleration in 2021?"

We went into the 2020 with some of the highest earned-in leasing performance that we've ever had, and that allowed effective rent per unit to remain fairly strong, if you will, throughout 2020, which was hugely helpful. I remember late in 2019, if people asking me, what I'm worried about. And I've said, I'm worried about the slowdown. I'm worried about something happening with the economy. And in preparation for that worry, the best thing we could do is, grow rents as hard as we could, even at the expense of giving up a little bit of occupancy and allow that compounding benefit to be there as a protective performance on revenues, should we see the economy weaken and that certainly helped us this past year. 
So what I would tell you is, I mean, there are 2 things that play here that I think are going to cause the recovery process, recovery slope to be steady as opposed to being a real steep up-up curve, if you will. One is, we are still battling supply issues, and we will have those supply issues throughout 2021, pretty consistent with what we saw in 2020. And we think it actually peaks in the first part of the year and probably starts to moderate a little bit towards the back half of the year, but that's well after we get past the peak leasing season for 2021. 
So -- and then as we pointed out, the supply picture, I think, improves as we get into 2022 and beyond, at least for a couple of years. I think probably by the time we get to '24, '25, it starts to accelerate again as a consequence of what we see happening with permitting today. 
But the other factor that is at play here is that, we are still now carrying and the first quarter of this year is going to reflect the full negative impact of the pricing performance that we had to do during the spring and summer leasing season of 2020 when it was at its weakest. And so that -- all that's going to continue to roll through the portfolio and it will peak, we believe, in the first quarter. 
But as we get into the spring and summer leasing season of 2021, where we do believe that the leasing environment, it will be much more positive and better than we will again start to compound that improvement in terms of our revenue performance, and it will build, and it will build by the time we get into late 2021, and particularly as we get into 2022. So that -- those 2 things sort of supply pressure, but particularly sort of the compounding effect of lease-over-lease pricing and what it does to revenues, it takes time for that to work through the system."

I would say from a growth aspect, it's hard to pinpoint what the other folks are certainly underwriting. I would say one of the things that's driving the difference in valuation, it really is leverage. Certainly, our leverage level is a lot different than high-levered buyers that are looking for 65% to, call it, 80% leverage on some of these deals and given where interest rates are.

I appreciate it. I'm going to ask one question then. Single family rentals. Thinking about, you've seen a lot of homebuilders validate the concept getting into purpose-built communities of single-family rentals that can operate like horizontal apartments with an amenity, maybe in more kind of outlined locations, but definitely Sunbelt. 
Does a concept like a purpose-built single-family rental community potentially offer you anything attractive in terms of diversifying the product mix? Or how do you think about that concept going forward?"

We are -- we've seen a few examples from time to time. And should -- right now, of course, that kind of opportunity is attracting a ton of capital. So pricing is pretty competitive.

We are encouraged with the solid start to the year as core FFO results were well ahead of our expectations. A recovery in rent growth is clearly getting started. Our overall blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis are running slightly ahead of last year, and our forecast is for continued improvement. A combination of the recovery within the Sunbelt economies that is just starting to build, coupled with the continued migration of employers and jobs to this region, are driving higher level of demand across our portfolio. We like the trends that we're seeing as we head into the important summer leasing season. 
Our teams are off to a strong start this year with our unit interior redevelopment program, the rollout of our Smart Home technology platform as well as several new projects aimed at full repositioning of communities to higher price points. We're excited about the upside in MAA growth to capture from all 3 of these programs. It was about this time last year when we hit the pause button on these projects in order to protect residents and staff during the initial months of COVID, and we expect to make solid progress this year. 
Our new development platform continues to expand, and we're excited to have closed this month on our first opportunity in the Salt Lake City market. We see continued strong job growth and positive migration trends to this market and look forward to expanding our presence there. Supported by our strong balance sheet and growing demand for apartment housing across our Sunbelt markets, we believe we are poised to capture increasing earnings contribution from our development pipeline over the next few years. 
As the Sunbelt market economies begin to reopen, it seems clear that based on the trends that we're seeing, that the worst of the pressures associated with COVID are behind us. MAA's unique approach to diversifying across the Sunbelt has clearly worked to soften some of the pressures surrounding the recession and the slowdown in leasing over the past few quarters. However, we're frankly more excited about the prospects for outperformance over the coming recovery cycle, the growing appeal of the Sunbelt markets, the upside that we have to capture in redevelopment within our existing portfolio, higher efficiencies, we expect to harvest from several new technology initiatives, and finally, a growing impact from our external growth pipeline, all combined to put MAA in a solid position for the coming recovery cycle. 
In closing, I want to thank our team of associates for their hard work and efforts to serve our residents this past quarter, with a special nod to our team in Texas who worked through the winter storm in freezing temperatures in February. Your commitment to our mission of serving those who depend on our company is much appreciated. 
Tom?"

This drove blended pricing achieved during the quarter up 2.7%. This is even with the very strong start we had in the first quarter of 2020 and up 200 basis points from the fourth quarter.  In addition, we were able to maintain strong average daily occupancy of 95.7%, and all in-place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved to 1.3% in the first quarter. 
Collections during the quarter were strong. We collected 99.1% billed rent in the first quarter. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistance has dropped over time. In April of last year, we have 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants has decreased to just 325 for the April of this year under assistance plan. This represents only 20 basis points of April billed rent. 
We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. We're off to a strong start for the year on our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile controlled lights, thermostat in security as well as leak detection. We completed 964 redevelopment units and 13,975 Smart Home packages. For the full year of 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and install 22,000 Smart Home packages.  We are also in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first 6 full reposition properties and have another 8 that will begin this year. 
April's collections are in line with the good results we saw in the first quarter. As of April 27, we've collected 98.7% of rent billed, which is at least 10 basis points ahead of each of the comparable numbers for January, February and March of this year. Leasing activity for April is strong. New lease-over-lease pricing in April is running close to 4% of rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in April is running 6.5% ahead of the prior lease. 
Our resident satisfaction scores remained strong and are actually ahead of last year by 120 basis points, which should support continued strong renewal lease pricing. 
We still have a few down units in April as a result of the winter storm, and including the impact of those, average daily occupancy for the month of April is currently 96.1, which is 100 basis points better than April of last year. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.2%. This is 180 basis points better than the prior year and supports our ability to continue to prioritize a focus on rent growth. 
We are well positioned as we move into our busy leasing season. Led by job growth, which is expected to increase 4.9% in 2021 versus the negative 5% in 2020 for our markets, we expect to see the broad recovery in our region of the country continue. We expect Phoenix, Tampa, Raleigh and Jacksonville to be our strongest markets and expect Houston, Orlando and DC to recover but at a slower rate. 
I would like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They've shown tremendous adaptability and resilience over the last year. I'm proud of them and excited about their strong start to 2021. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brad."

Investor demand for multifamily product within our region of the country remains strong. However, a lack of properties for sale is causing a supply-demand imbalance that continues to drive already aggressive pricing. This robust investor demand, supported by continued low interest rates has further compressed cap rates, which are frequently in the mid-3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations within our markets. 
Transaction cap rates on closed projects that we underwrote were down 25 basis points from last quarter and down 50 basis points from first quarter of 2020. We remain active in the transaction market, but as outlined in our guidance, we are not forecasting executing on any acquisitions of existing communities between now and year-end. 
While acquiring existing assets is a challenge, we continue to make progress on the expansion of our development pipeline. As noted in our release, we closed on 2 land parcels in April as part of our prepurchase program, where we partner with third-party developers. We expect to start construction on both of these projects in the second quarter. Our Atlanta project is a 5-story mid-rise development located along the belt line extension in the West Midtown area of Atlanta, less than 2 miles from Microsoft's recently announced campus. We also closed on a 4-story surface park project in the Daybreak master-planned community of Salt Lake City, one of the top 5 master-planned communities in the United States.  We are excited to expand our footprint into Salt Lake City, a market that shares many of the attributes that characterize our overall footprint: good job growth, great migration trends and a highly educated workforce. 
In addition to these 2 projects, we have several other project -- or development sites within our footprint, owned or under contract, that we hope to start construction on later this year and into next year. 
We have seen material run-up in construction costs, and specifically lumber. But our construction team as well as our partners have done a good job helping us to mitigate some of this increase. We continue to see some supply chain disruptions on appliances, cabinets, windows and other items, but on the majority of our projects, we've been able to work around these issues with minimal impact to our delivery schedules. 
We continue to see strong leasing demand in our region of the country, and our 2 lease-up properties in Dallas and Fort Worth as well as our under construction property in Phoenix, all continue to perform very well, with rents and leasing velocity in line with or ahead of our pre-COVID expectations. 
As part of our planned dispositions for 2021, we took our Jackson, Mississippi properties to market in the first quarter and received very strong investor interest, with the strongest bidding coming from portfolio buyers wanting all 4 properties. The properties are currently under contract with our buyers inspection period ending soon. We expect this transaction to close in the third quarter. We are also on track to execute on the remainder of our 2021 disposition plan in the fourth quarter. 
Our view of new supply remains unchanged with the expectation that 2021 looks very similar to 2020. Based on 2020's permitting trends, we still expect new deliveries to start trending down late this year and into next year before possibly increasing in 2023, reflecting the recent increase in permitting and starts data. 
That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn the call over to Al."

Core FFO per share performance of $1.64 for the first quarter was $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. As expected, operating trends continued to improve through the quarter, producing same-store revenue and NOI performance that was slightly ahead of our forecast, providing about $0.01 per share in favorability for the quarter. We continue to expect stable occupancy and strong pricing trends to have a growing impact on effective rents over the remainder of the year. But keep in mind that only about 20% of our leases were effective in the first quarter, and we still have the majority of our leases to be signed during the summer leasing season in the second and third quarter. 
The remaining favorability came from overhead and interest expense, which were both lower than projections for the quarter. So overhead costs are expected to grow more in line with our original projections as the year progresses as our travel and other activities move toward more normalized levels. 
Winter Storm Uri impacted a portion of our portfolio during the quarter, where unusually cold temperature and electrical outages led to frozen pipes and damage in a number of our Texas communities. Our operating teams worked hard to take care of our residents and get affected units back online quickly. We incurred some casualty losses during the first quarter related to the storm. We established a receivable for the vast majority of the costs, which are expected to be reimbursed through insurance coverage.  Net earnings impact to MAA during the quarter was only about $765,000, primarily related to down units. 
Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the quarter, we paid off the $118 million of secured mortgages at an expiring rate of 5.1%. We also funded an additional $64 million of cost toward completion of our development pipeline, which, at quarter end, included 7 communities with total projected cost of $528 million, of which $193 million remains to be funded. 
As Brad mentioned, we acquired 2 land parcels in April as part of repurchase development deals, which should begin construction later this year. And as discussed previously, we expect our development pipeline to grow to around $800 million by year-end, which is well within our development [ autonomous limits ]. 
As Tom mentioned, we also continue to make good progress during the quarter on our 3 internal investment programs: interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home legislations. We funded a total of $22.7 million toward these programs during the first quarter, which are expected to begin contributing to our growth more strongly in late 2021 and 2022. 
We ended the quarter with low leverage, debt-to-EBITDA of only 4.9x and with $644 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under a line of credit. And finally, in a way to reflect the first quarter earnings performance, we increased our full year guidance range for core FFO by $0.05 to a range of $6.35 to $6.65 per share. Our same-store performance trends were essentially in line with our forecast, and we expect pricing trends to continue to improve over the remainder of the year, with the most favorable prior year revenue comparisons coming in the second quarter due to the initial impact of COVID-19 last year. 
We plan to revisit guidance after the second quarter when we'll have more clarity on several key assumptions. So that's all we have with prepared comments. 
So Christi, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions. Christy, are you there?"

So we're certainly encouraged by the trends that we've seen in the pricing that Tom talked about.

And so I think that at the end of the day, we're looking at adding stabilized yields to our portfolio that will increase the overall earnings potential of the portfolio long term. 
And I think that right now, what we see happening on the acquisition side, frankly, requires a level of reach and a level of assumption for a very long period of time that we just don't -- we have a hard time sort of getting comfortable with. We can make the numbers work on both the prepurchase program and on the new development. Certainly, it's dilution associated with the lease-up and the construction process there. But once those assets get fully stabilized, I mean, the yield is there pretty quick. 
On the acquisition front, I think right now, frankly, you would have to be comfortable with, I believe, a level of dilution that is longer, frankly, than what we're able to do on the development front and prepurchase front. So we think we're pushing it in terms of assumptions about as hard as we should, and beyond what we're doing right now would require a level of reach that, frankly, we're just not comfortable with.

I think that, that overall sort of dynamic has clearly begun to shift. And that shift was underway, certainly somewhat prior to COVID. And as much has been reported on, I think COVID accelerated a lot of those trends. And so I think that, that's one factor that would suggest to me that the demand dynamics and the driver of rent growth dynamics for Sunbelt versus non-Sunbelt, I think it's a new day in that regard. 
The second thing I would tell you is that, I think, cap rates have begun to adjust a bit in terms of how real estate is being priced in gateway versus Sunbelt markets. I think for many, many years that a lot of investor demand really drove cap rates down in a lot of these gateway markets, particularly a lot of international capital that, frankly, was just more familiar with and more knowledgeable of some of these bigger gateway markets. 
I think, again, the last few years, particularly the past year, has begun to, I think, open eyes in investment community a bit about the shifts that are going on in the U.S. regarding job growth and population trends and taxes and all the other sort of factors that continue to favor the Sunbelt. And I think international capital is also paying attention to that. And I think as a consequence of that, I think the historic delta between cap rates for gateway versus nongateway markets, I think that those cap rates have compressed certainly today. And I think they will remain more compressed or that gap will be more narrow than it has been historically. 
So I think there is some logic to what you're saying for both of those reasons, and I think the next few years will tell a lot about how these companies are able to perform, the platform is able to perform and how investor appetite continues to evolve. And I do think that there is some logic to what you used to think about 5 or 6 years ago in terms of pricing of real estate in Sunbelt markets versus where he should be pricing it today on a relative basis to non-Sunbelt. It's a different day."

Currently, what we have rolling is an expanded -- call center solution is out and that allowed us to make some staffing headcount reduction changes about how leasing phone calls are handled on-site. We've also deployed a lead nurturing software, which is automated prospect engagement technology, so to interact with the prospects earlier in the sales process and automates the follow ups. We've upgraded the virtual touring. We've implemented mobile inspections, which really makes it a lot clearer to the resident the condition of their apartment when they move in, and then clearly document the deficiencies if they move out. That's helped us with speed of inspection as well as clarity on billing and resident satisfaction.

I certainly hope so, but I don't know. I'm skeptical that certainly that the pressures that we've seen thus far are sufficient to have any meaningful impact to slowing the interest level on development at the moment because of the fact that we are seeing the demand growth and the rent growth opportunity continue to improve and get stronger. And I think that's fueling a level of tolerance and optimism on the underwriting side and the ability to withstand some level of cost increase. 
Where I think that you could see -- and the other thing I would also add, as long as cap rates continue to remain as low as they are, providing the developer the opportunity to exit at today's cap rate environment, I think that -- again, that, that supports, at some level, the ability to withstand some increase in cost. 
One of the things, though, that we're beginning to see increasingly affect development more than anything other than land cost is just the permitting and zoning processes are getting increasingly difficult. And I think that as we continue to see some of these Sunbelt markets facing much population growth and demand growth and some of these infrastructure start to get under a little pressure, I think you may see a little bit more stringent behavior out of some of the local governments and zoning and permitting folks to be a little bit more restrictive than they have been in the past. And I think that probably as much, as anything else, may start to moderate things. 
I'm comfortable that with all the things that I just went through, that it's likely that supply is not likely to materially increase the levels that we see happening right now. I think the pipelines are full and there's just too much pressure at this point to see any material increase in supply pressure.

We are encouraged with the solid start to the year as core FFO results were well ahead of our expectations. A recovery in rent growth is clearly getting started. Our overall blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis are running slightly ahead of last year, and our forecast is for continued improvement. A combination of the recovery within the Sunbelt economies that is just starting to build, coupled with the continued migration of employers and jobs to this region, are driving higher level of demand across our portfolio. We like the trends that we're seeing as we head into the important summer leasing season.
Our teams are off to a strong start this year with our unit interior redevelopment program, the rollout of our Smart Home technology platform as well as several new projects aimed at full repositioning of communities to higher price points. We're excited about the upside in rent growth to capture from all 3 of these programs. It was about this time last year when we hit the pause button on these projects in order to protect residents and staff during the initial months of COVID, and we expect to make solid progress this year.
Our new development platform continues to expand, and we're excited to have closed this month on our first opportunity in the Salt Lake City market. We see continued strong job growth and positive migration trends to this market and look forward to expanding our presence there. Supported by our strong balance sheet and growing demand for apartment housing across our Sunbelt markets, we believe we are poised to capture increasing earnings contribution from our development pipeline over the next few years.
As the Sunbelt market economies begin to reopen, it seems clear that based on the trends that we're seeing, that the worst of the pressures associated with COVID are behind us. MAA's unique approach to diversifying across the Sunbelt has clearly worked to soften some of the pressures surrounding the recession and the slowdown in leasing over the past few quarters. However, we're frankly more excited about the prospects for outperformance over the coming recovery cycle, the growing appeal of the Sunbelt markets, the upside that we have to capture in redevelopment within our existing portfolio, higher efficiencies, we expect to harvest from several new technology initiatives, and finally, a growing impact from our external growth pipeline, all combined to put MAA in a solid position for the coming recovery cycle.
In closing, I want to thank our team of associates for their hard work and efforts to serve our residents this past quarter, with a special nod to our team in Texas who worked through the winter storm in freezing temperatures in February. Your commitment to our mission of serving those who depend on our company is much appreciated.

This drove blended pricing achieved during the quarter up 2.7%. This is even with the very strong start we had in the first quarter of 2020 and up 200 basis points from the fourth quarter. In addition, we were able to maintain strong average daily occupancy of 95.7%, and all-in place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved to 1.3% in the first quarter.
Collections during the quarter were strong. We collected 99.1% billed rent in the first quarter. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistance has dropped over time. In April of last year, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants has decreased to just 325 for the April of this year rental assistance plan. This represents only 20 basis points of April billed rent.
We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. We're off to a strong start for the year on our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile controlled lights, thermostat in security as well as leak detection. We completed 964 redevelopment units and 13,975 Smart Home packages. For the full year of 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and install 22,000 Smart Home packages. We are also in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first 6 full reposition properties and have another 8 that will begin this year.
April's collections are in line with the good results we saw in the first quarter. As of April 27, we've collected 98.7% of rent billed, which is at least 10 basis points ahead of each of the comparable numbers for January, February and March of this year. Leasing activity for April is strong. New lease-over-lease pricing in April is running close to 4% of rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in April is running 6.5% ahead of the prior lease. Our resident satisfaction scores remained strong and are actually ahead of last year by 120 basis points, which should support continued strong renewal lease pricing.
We still have a few down units in April as a result of the winter storm, and including the impact of those, average daily occupancy for the month of April is currently 96.1%, which is 100 basis points better than April of last year. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.2%. This is 180 basis points better than the prior year and supports our ability to continue to prioritize our focus on rent growth.
We are well positioned as we move into our busy leasing season. Led by job growth, which is expected to increase 4.9% in 2021 versus the negative 5% in 2020 for our markets, we expect to see the broad recovery in our region of the country continue. We expect Phoenix, Tampa, Raleigh and Jacksonville to be our strongest markets and expect Houston, Orlando and DC to recover but at a slower rate.
I would like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They've shown tremendous adaptability and resilience over the last year. I'm proud of them and excited about their strong start to 2021.
I'll now turn the call over to Brad."

Investor demand for multifamily product within our region of the country remains strong. However, a lack of properties for sale is causing a supply-demand imbalance that continues to drive already aggressive pricing. This robust investor demand supported by continued low interest rates has further compressed cap rates, which are frequently in the mid-3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations within our markets.
Transaction cap rates on closed projects that we underwrote were down 25 basis points from last quarter and down 50 basis points from first quarter of 2020. We remain active in the transaction market, but as outlined in our guidance, we are not forecasting executing on any acquisitions of existing communities between now and year-end.
While acquiring existing assets is a challenge, we continue to make progress on the expansion of our development pipeline. As noted in our release, we closed on 2 land parcels in April as part of our prepurchase program, where we partner with third-party developers. We expect to start construction on both of these projects in the second quarter.
Our Atlanta project is a 5-story mid-rise development located along the belt line extension in the West Midtown area of Atlanta, less than 2 miles from Microsoft's recently announced campus. We also closed on a 4-story surface park project in the Daybreak master-planned community of Salt Lake City, one of the top 5 master-planned communities in the United States. We are excited to expand our footprint into Salt Lake City, a market that shares many of the attributes that characterize our overall footprint: good job growth, great migration trends and a highly educated workforce.
In addition to these 2 projects, we have several other project -- or development sites within our footprint, owned or under contract, that we hope to start construction on later this year and into next year.
We have seen material run-up in construction costs, and specifically lumber. But our construction team as well as our partners have done a good job helping us to mitigate some of this increase. We continue to see some supply chain disruptions on appliances, cabinets, windows and other items, but on the majority of our projects, we've been able to work around these issues with minimal impact to our delivery schedules.
We continue to see strong leasing demand in our region of the country, and our 2 lease-up properties in Dallas and Fort Worth as well as our under construction property in Phoenix, all continue to perform very well, with rents and leasing velocity in line with or ahead of our pre-COVID expectations.
As part of our planned dispositions for 2021, we took our Jackson, Mississippi properties to market in the first quarter and received very strong investor interest, with the strongest bidding coming from portfolio buyers wanting all 4 properties. The properties are currently under contract with our buyers inspection period ending soon. We expect this transaction to close in the third quarter. We are also on track to execute on the remainder of our 2021 disposition plan in the fourth quarter.
Our view of new supply remains unchanged with the expectation that 2021 looks very similar to 2020. Based on 2020's permitting trends, we still expect new deliveries to start trending down late this year and into next year before possibly increasing in 2023, reflecting the recent increase in permitting and starts data.
That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn the call over to Al."

As expected, operating trends continued to improve through the quarter, producing s",591,"Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Core FFO per share performance of $1.64 for the first quarter was $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. As expected, operating trends continued to improve through the quarter, producing same-store revenue and NOI performance that was slightly ahead of our forecast, providing about $0.01 per share on favorability for the quarter. We continue to expect stable occupancy and strong pricing trends to have a growing impact on effective rents over the remainder of the year. But keep in mind that only about 20% of our leases were effective in the first quarter, and we still have the majority of our leases to be signed during the summer leasing season in the second and third quarter.
The remaining favorability came from overhead and interest expense, which were both lower than projections for the quarter. So overhead costs are expected to grow more in line with our original projections as the year progresses as our travel and other activities move toward more normalized levels.
Winter storm Uri impacted a portion of our portfolio during the quarter, where unusually cold temperature and electrical outages led to frozen pipes and damage at a number of our Texas communities. Our operating teams worked hard to take care of our residents and get affected units back online quickly. We incurred some casualty losses during the first quarter related to the storm. We established a receivable for the vast majority of the costs, which are expected to be reimbursed through insurance coverage. Net earnings impact to MAA during the quarter was only about $765,000, primarily related to down units.
Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the quarter, we paid off the $118 million of secured mortgages at an expiring rate of 5.1%. We also funded an additional $64 million of cost toward completion of our development pipeline, which, at quarter end, included 7 communities with total projected cost of $528 million, of which $193 million remains to be funded.
As Brad mentioned, we acquired 2 land parcels in April as part of repurchase development deals, which should begin construction later this year. And as discussed previously, we expect our development pipeline to grow to around $800 million by year-end, which is well within our development autonomous limits.
As Tom mentioned, we also continue to make good progress during the quarter on our 3 internal investment programs: interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home legislations. We funded a total of $22.7 million toward these programs during the first quarter, which are expected to begin contributing to our growth more strongly in late 2021 and 2022.
We ended the quarter with low leverage, debt-to-EBITDA of only 4.9x and with $644 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our line of credit. And finally, in a way to reflect the first quarter earnings performance, we increased our full year guidance range for core FFO by $0.05 to a range of $6.35 to $6.65 per share. Our same-store performance trends were essentially in line with our forecast, and we expect pricing trends to continue to improve over the remainder of the year, with the most favorable prior year revenue comparisons coming in the second quarter due to the initial impact of COVID-19 last year.
We plan to revisit guidance after the second quarter when we'll have more clarity on several key assumptions. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments.
So Christy, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions."

So we're certainly encouraged by the trends that we see in the pricing that Tom talked about.

We can make the numbers work on both the prepurchase program and on the new development. Certainly, it's dilution associated with the lease-up and the construction process there.

On the acquisition front, I think right now, frankly, you would have to be comfortable with, I believe, a level of dilution that is longer, frankly, than what we're able to do on the development front and prepurchase front.

I think that, that overall sort of dynamic has clearly begun to shift. And that shift was underway, certainly somewhat prior to COVID. And as much has been reported on, I think COVID accelerated a lot of those trends. And so I think that, that's one factor that would suggest to me that the demand dynamics and the driver of rent growth dynamics for Sunbelt versus non-Sunbelt, I think it's a new day in that regard.
The second thing I would tell you is that, I think, cap rates have begun to adjust a bit in terms of how real estate is being priced in gateway versus Sunbelt markets. I think for many, many years that a lot of investor demand really drove cap rates down in a lot of these gateway markets, particularly a lot of international capital that, frankly, was just more familiar with and more knowledgeable of some of these bigger gateway markets.
I think, again, the last few years, particularly, the past year, has begun to, I think, open eyes in the investment community a bit about the shifts that are going on in the U.S. regarding job growth and population trends and taxes and all the other sort of factors that continue to favor the Sunbelt. And I think international capital is also paying attention to that. And I think as a consequence of that, I think the historic delta between cap rates for gateway versus nongateway markets, I think that those cap rates have compressed certainly today. And I think they will remain more compressed or that gap will be more narrow than it has been historically.
So I think there is some logic to what you're saying for both of those reasons, and I think the next few years will tell a lot about how these companies are able to perform, the platform is able to perform and how investor appetite continues to evolve. And I do think that there is some logic to what you used to think about 5 or 6 years ago in terms of pricing of real estate in Sunbelt markets versus where we should be pricing it today on a relative basis to non-Sunbelt. It's a different day."

I mean, there's a transformation underway in our business. Currently, what we have rolling is an expanded -- call center solution is out and that allowed us to make some staffing headcount reduction changes about how leasing phone calls are handled on-site. We've also deployed a lead nurturing software, which is automated prospect engagement technology, so to interact with the prospects earlier in the sales process and automates the follow ups. We've upgraded the virtual touring. We've implemented mobile inspections, which really makes it a lot clearer to the resident, the condition of their apartment when they move in, and then clearly document the deficiencies if they move out. That's helped us with speed of inspection as well as clarity on billing and resident satisfaction.
We're midway through deploying our mobile maintenance solution, which will give us some efficiency on that side of the business. We're also -- what's coming next, has improved. I mean, we've got self-touring, but automating that process. We've got some tests ongoing with improved multi-location sales support, covering one property from another one.

I certainly hope so, but I don't know. I'm skeptical that certainly that the pressures that we've seen thus far are sufficient to have any meaningful impact to slowing the interest level on development at the moment because of the fact that we are seeing the demand growth and the rent growth opportunity continue to improve and get stronger. And I think that's fueling a level of tolerance and optimism on the underwriting side and the ability to withstand some level of cost increase.
Where I think that you could see -- and the other thing I would also add, as long as cap rates continue to remain as low as they are, providing the developer the opportunity to exit at today's cap rate environment, I think that -- again, that, that supports, at some level, the ability to withstand some increase in cost.
One of the things, though, that we're beginning to see increasingly affect development more than anything other than land cost is just the permitting and zoning processes are getting increasingly difficult. And I think that as we continue to see some of these Sunbelt markets facing much population growth and demand growth and some of these infrastructure start to get under a little pressure, I think you may see a little bit more stringent behavior out of some of the local governments and zoning and permitting folks to be a little bit more restrictive than they have been in the past. And I think that probably as much, as anything else, may start to moderate things.
I'm comfortable that with all the things that I just went through, that it's likely that supply is not likely to materially increase the levels that we see happening right now. I think the pipelines are full and there's just too much pressure at this point to see any material increase in supply pressure. But I think we're a ways away from seeing a material decline in pressure."

MAA had a strong second quarter with rent growth, same-store NOI and core FFO results ahead of expectations. Strong job growth and positive migration trends continue to drive higher demand for housing across our Sunbelt markets, and we expect continued strong rent growth. As noted in our earnings release, we are adjusting our performance expectations for the year and meaningfully increasing guidance for core FFO performance. The various factors that were driving employers and households to the Sunbelt markets before the impact of COVID continue. 
In addition, the COVID-related recalibrating by both employers and employees about where they choose to do business and live continues to also fuel higher demand trends across the Sunbelt, and those trends are accelerating. The new residents that we moved in year-to-date from outside of our Sunbelt footprint increased another 265 basis points as compared to the first 6 months of last year during the peak of COVID-related relocations. 
New move-ins from renters relocating to the Sunbelt currently constitute almost 13% of our new leases so far this year and are trending higher. During the second quarter in a number of markets such as Phoenix, Tampa, Nashville and Charleston, the percentage of new residents moving to our properties from outside the Sunbelt was even higher. 
As housing demand grows across the region, investor appetite for apartment real estate in the Sunbelt is also increasing. As Brad will touch on, we continue to see very aggressive bidding in the acquisition market with downward pressure on cap rates. M&A is well positioned to harvest the opportunities surrounding our long-time focus on the Sunbelt markets with a uniquely diversified strategy across the region. 
Strong leasing fundamentals, coupled with extensive redevelopment and repositioning opportunities along with the continued rollout of new technology initiatives that will drive further margin expansion have us excited about the momentum from the same-store portfolio. 
In addition, as noted in our earnings release, we continue to expand our external growth platform with earnings accretive new development and have several other projects currently under contract and in predevelopment. As always, I want to send a big thank you and message of well done to our team of MAA associates. Your dedication and commitment to serving our and supporting each other is critical to our success and is key in driving our strong performance. Tom?"

We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the second quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing during the quarter was up 8.2%.

Blended lease-over-lease pricing during the quarter was up 8.2%. As a result, all in-place rents on a year-over-year basis grew to 3.1%. This is more than double the 1.3% growth rate of the first quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen through the remainder of the year. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter increased to 96.4%. 
As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress on our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat in security as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and installed 22,000 Smart Home packages. We're also in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first 8 full repositioned properties and have another 8 that will begin this year. 
Leasing activity for July has been strong. New lease-over-lease pricing month-to-date for July is running close to 17% ahead of rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in July is running 9% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended pricing for the portfolio is up 12% so far in July. 
Average daily occupancy for the month is currently 96.1%, which is 80 basis points better than July of last year. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.1%. This is 100 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth and indicates that new lease pricing will peak seasonally later than historic norms. We are well positioned as we move into the third quarter. 
I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They have shown tremendous adaptability and resilience over the last year. I'm proud of them and excited for their progress in '21. 
Thanks, and I'll turn it over to Brad."

The strong investor demand for multifamily properties in our footprint that began prior to COVID continues to strengthen today. Transaction volume is up significantly since the first quarter as investors look to buy into the strong rent growth outlook in our Sunbelt markets. 
Strong leasing fundamentals, coupled with robust investor demand, have accelerated pricing growth, putting additional downward pressure on cap rates. Cap rates deals we underwrote in the second quarter have compressed another 25 basis points from first quarter and the compression has accelerated in the last 30 days, pushing cap rates down approximately 100 basis points since first quarter of '20. 
We like the overall balance and unique diversification of our Sunbelt-oriented portfolio and have no need to change our market weightings by participating in the aggressive pricing market for existing properties. Therefore, we will continue to focus our capital deployment efforts on new development and prepurchase opportunities, which provide higher yields, higher growth and a much lower basis than the acquisition opportunities we're seeing in the current market. 
We continue to make progress on our development pipeline. As noted in our release, we closed and started construction on 2 previous projects in the second quarter, bringing our prepurchase and development pipeline, both under construction and in lease-up to 3,347 units at a total cost of $775 million. 
In addition to these 2 projects, we have a number of other development sites owned or under contract and hope to start construction on several projects later this year and into 2022. Our predevelopment opportunities are in Denver, Salt Lake City, Tampa, Raleigh and Nashville, all existing markets within our portfolio footprint. 
We continue to see very strong leasing demand in our region of the country, and our recently completed properties in Dallas and Phoenix that are currently in lease-up reflect this strong demand. Both properties continue to perform very well with rents and leasing velocity at or above pro forma. 
All of our under construction projects remain on budget and on schedule despite continued cost pressures and supply chain disruptions. Our under-construction projects have fixed cost construction contracts, so they remain on budget, but we are seeing continued cost pressure on new projects. While the lumber-related run-up in construction costs that we saw in the first half of the year has begun to mitigate a bit, we are seeing cost pressures related to other commodities that we will continue to monitor. 
Supply chain disruptions related to appliances, cabinets, windows and electrical components are occurring, but our teams have done a great job working around these issues with very minimal impact to our delivery schedules. As part of our planned dispositions for 2021, we exited the Jackson, Mississippi market at the end of the second quarter with the sale of our 4 properties. For these assets with an average age of 36 years, we achieved strong pricing of $160 million, which was above the top end of our expectations. We are early in the process, but we're in the market with 3 other properties that we expect to close before the end of the year. 
That's all I have in the way of comments. I'll turn it over to Al."

The strong second quarter operating performance produced core FFO that was at the top end of our prior guidance range or $0.08 per share above the midpoint, which also supports improved performance expectations over the remainder of the y",433,"Thank you, Brad. The strong second quarter operating performance produced core FFO that was at the top end of our prior guidance range or $0.08 per share above the midpoint, which also supports improved performance expectations over the remainder of the year. 
As you saw in our release, we are significantly increasing our guidance for both core FFO and same-store performance for the full year. The increases are primarily based on projections of continued high occupancy levels remaining essentially full between 95.5% and 96% over the remainder of the year and continued strong rental pricing growth over the second half, particularly during the third quarter with some typical seasonal moderation expected in the fourth quarter. This supports a revised revenue growth projection for the full year of 4% at the midpoint of guidance, which is 200 basis points above the prior midpoint. 
Same-store operating expenses have largely been in line with our expectations for the year. As outlined earlier in the year, we expected expenses to be somewhat elevated during the first half, mainly related to the impact of our Double Play program, the difficult prior year insurance renewal as well as some continued pressure on real estate taxes, which represent about 40% of our total operating costs overall. 
The growth rate for total operating expenses over the second half is still expected to moderate as originally projected with some impact from increased property level performance-based awards and inflationary pressures on repair and maintenance costs, driving an increase to the midpoint of the expected growth by about 50 basis points for the full year. 
Finally, our balance sheet remains very strong. As Brad outlined in his comments, our development opportunities continue to grow. We expect our total pipeline of development communities in construction and lease-up, comprised of both in-house and prepurchase deals, to end the year just over $800 million, which is well within our defined risk tolerances while we expect the new high-yielding projects to be very accretive to earnings and value in 2023 and beyond. 
Our financing plans continue to include some activity over the second half of the year. Current market conditions appear to be stable and strong, supporting good pricing expectations across the maturity curve. We also continue to have positive discussions with the rating agencies regarding our corporate rating. We believe our current ratings are fairly conservative, and we look forward to continued discussions with all agencies over the next few quarters. 
That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So now we will now turn the call back over to you for any questions."

But I guess my -- what I'm wondering is when we look at the data, it feels like those markets right now you blend what's going on with rent growth this year and last year is actually looking better than pre-COVID. And maybe that migration is a benefit or there's other factors, but just wanted to hear your thoughts on some of these really high rent growth markets, which are not -- they didn't have concessions. So this is pure rent growth you're seeing and it looks stronger than 2019. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you think is driving that excess growth now versus pre-COVID?"

And we certainly continue to see evidence that the demand level is going to remain strong other than sort of normal seasonal patterns that we've alluded to. It's hard for me to point to any sort of definitive reason as to why the demand side of the equation is likely to show any significant moderation. 
I think that if you want to think about some level of catch-up occurring, if you will, as a consequence of what went on last year, we went back and took a look at what we expected to occur last year in the second quarter in our pricing before we knew about COVID. And obviously, last year, during COVID, we came in short of those original expectations to the tenure of about 250 basis points in terms of blended lease-over-lease pricing. 
So if one wants to think about this year's performance has somewhat of an extra to it as a consequence of recovery from last year from a lease-over-lease perspective, I would argue that probably no more than 200, 250 basis points of that is a function of recovery from last year. Overwhelmingly, what's driving it is just all the factors that are driving the really strong demand side of the business in terms of employers and employees finding reasons to come to the region and the new jobs is continuing to form here. 
And as I pointed out a moment ago, with our markets constituting collectively, 42% of the household formation -- projected household formations in 2021, and that's growing to 44% based on the information we get from economy.com and some of these other services, it suggests to us that the demand side of the equation is likely to remain pretty robust. And we do think that it's unlikely for all the reasons Brad alluded to surrounding what's going on with construction costs, land sites and things of that nature. We think that we probably see supply levels remain fairly elevated like they are now going into next year, but it's hard for me to envision supply levels picking up materially from where they are. So as we sit here today, I think we're pretty optimistic that we're going to see pretty good favorable demand-supply relationship for us going into next year."

But given where current occupancy is and more importantly, where exposure is, I would sort of expect us to stay in that 96.1 and above range for the next couple of months.

So it takes some time to get through that process. But frankly, really what we're doing on those is working through the predevelopment process and our approvals. And then really, once we get to a point where we can have a GMP and known construction prices locked in, that's acceptable to us. We look to move forward with those opportunities. I would say the prepurchase time line is a bit more truncated because, again, we're putting off some of the risk associated with the predevelopment work to the developers that we're partnering with. So those have a little bit shorter time period on them. Sometimes, not all the time. So we're able to work those in kind of our starts a little quicker than stuff that we're doing in-house.

MAA had a strong second quarter with rent growth, same-store NOI and core FFO results ahead of expectations. Strong job growth and positive migration trends continue to drive higher demand for housing across our Sunbelt markets, and we expect continued strong rent growth. As noted in our earnings release, we are adjusting our performance expectations for the year and meaningfully increasing guidance for core FFO performance. The various factors that were driving employers and households to the Sunbelt markets before the impact of COVID continue.
In addition, the COVID-related recalibrating by both employers and employees about where they choose to do business and live continues to also fuel higher demand trends across the Sunbelt, and those trends are accelerating. The new residents that we moved in year-to-date from outside of our Sunbelt footprint increased another 265 basis points as compared to the first 6 months of last year during the peak of COVID-related relocations.
New move-ins from renters relocating to the Sunbelt currently constitute almost 13% of our new leases so far this year and are trending higher. During the second quarter in a number of markets such as Phoenix, Tampa, Nashville and Charleston, the percentage of new residents moving to our properties from outside the Sunbelt was even higher.
As housing demand grows across the region, investor appetite for apartment real estate in the Sunbelt is also increasing. As Brad will touch on, we continue to see very aggressive bidding in the acquisition market with downward pressure on cap rates. MAA is well positioned to harvest the opportunities surrounding our long-time focus on the Sunbelt markets with a uniquely diversified strategy across the region. Strong leasing fundamentals, coupled with extensive redevelopment and repositioning opportunities along with the continued roll-out of new technology initiatives that will drive further margin expansion have us excited about the momentum from the same-store portfolio.
In addition, as noted in our earnings release, we continue to expand our external growth platform with earnings-accretive new development and have several other projects currently under contract and in predevelopment. As always, I want to send a big thank you and message of well done to our team of MAA associates. Your dedication and commitment to serving our residents and supporting each other is critical to our success and is key in driving our strong performance. Tom?"

Blended lease-over-lease pricing during the quarter was up 8.2%. As a result, all in-place rents on a year-over-year basis grew to 3.1%. This is more than double the 1.3% growth rate of the first quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen through the remainder of the year. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter increased to 96.4%.
As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress on our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and install 22,000 Smart Home packages. We're also in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first 8 full repositioned properties and have another 8 that will begin this year.
Leasing activity for July has been strong. New lease-over-lease pricing month to date for July is running close to 17% ahead of rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in July is running 9% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended pricing for the portfolio is up 12% so far in July.
Average daily occupancy for the month is currently 96.1%, which is 80 basis points better than July of last year. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.1%. This is 100 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth and indicates that new lease pricing will peak seasonally later than historic norms. We are well positioned as we move into the third quarter.
I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They have shown tremendous adaptability and resilience over the last year. I'm proud of them and excited for their progress in '21.
Thanks, and I'll turn it over to Brad."

The strong investor demand for multifamily properties in our footprint that began prior to COVID continues to strengthen today. Transaction volume is up significantly since the first quarter as investors look to buy into the strong rent growth outlook in our Sunbelt markets.
Strong leasing fundamentals, coupled with robust investor demand, have accelerated pricing growth, putting additional downward pressure on cap rates. Cap rates on deals we underwrote in the second quarter have compressed another 25 basis points from first quarter and the compression has accelerated in the last 30 days, pushing cap rates down approximately 100 basis points since first quarter of '20.
We like the overall balance and unique diversification of our Sunbelt-oriented portfolio and have no need to change our market weightings by participating in the aggressive pricing market for existing properties. Therefore, we will continue to focus our capital deployment efforts on new development and prepurchase opportunities, which provide higher yields, higher growth and a much lower basis than the acquisition opportunities we're seeing in the current market.
We continue to make progress on our development pipeline. As noted in our release, we closed and started construction on 2 prepurchase projects in the second quarter, bringing our prepurchase and development pipeline, both under construction and in lease-up, to 3,347 units at a total cost of $775 million.
In addition to these 2 projects, we have a number of other development sites owned or under contract and hope to start construction on several projects later this year and into 2022. Our predevelopment opportunities are in Denver, Salt Lake City, Tampa, Raleigh and Nashville, all existing markets within our portfolio footprint.
We continue to see very strong leasing demand in our region of the country and our recently completed properties in Dallas and Phoenix that are currently in lease-up reflect this strong demand. Both properties continue to perform very well with rents and leasing velocity at or above pro forma.
All of our under-construction projects remain on budget and on schedule despite continued cost pressures and supply chain disruptions. Our under-construction projects have fixed cost construction contracts, so they remain on budget, but we are seeing continued cost pressure on new projects. While the lumber-related run-up in construction costs that we saw in the first half of the year has begun to mitigate a bit, we are seeing cost pressures related to other commodities that we will continue to monitor.
Supply chain disruptions related to appliances, cabinets, windows and electrical components are occurring, but our teams have done a great job working around these issues with very minimal impact to our delivery schedules. As part of our planned dispositions for 2021, we exited the Jackson, Mississippi market at the end of the second quarter with the sale of our 4 properties. For these assets with an average age of 36 years, we achieved strong pricing of $160 million, which was above the top end of our expectations. We are early in the process, but we're in the market with 3 other properties that we expect to close before the end of the year.
That's all I have in the way of comments. I'll turn it over to Al."

The strong second quarter operating performance produced core FFO that was at the top end of our prior guidance range or $0.08 per share above the midpoint, which also supports improved performance expectations over the remainder of the year.
As you saw in our release, we are significantly increasing our guidance for both core FFO and same-store performance for the full year. The increases are primarily based on projections of continued high occupancy levels remaining essentially full between 95.5% and 96% over the remainder of the year and continued strong rental pricing growth over the second half, particularly during the third quarter with some typical seasonal moderation expected in the fourth quarter. This supports a revised revenue growth projection for the full year of 4% at the midpoint of guidance, which is 200 basis points above the prior midpoint.
Same-store operating expenses have largely been in line with our expectations for the year. As outlined earlier in the year, we expected expenses to be somewhat elevated during the first half, mainly related to the impact of our Double Play program, the difficult prior year insurance renewal as well as some continued pressure on real estate taxes, which represent about 40% of our total operating costs overall.
The growth rate for total operating expenses over the second half is still expected to moderate as originally projected with some impact from increased property level performance-based awards and inflationary pressures on repair and maintenance costs driving an increase to the midpoint of the expected growth by about 50 basis points for the full year.
Finally, our balance sheet remains very strong. As Brad outlined in his comments, our development opportunities continue to grow. We expect our total pipeline of development communities in construction and lease-up comprised of both in-house and prepurchase deals to end the year just over $800 million, which is well within our defined risk tolerances while we expect the new high-yielding projects to be very accretive to earnings and value in 2023 and beyond.
Our financing plans continue to include some activity over the second half of the year. Current market conditions appear to be stable and strong, supporting good pricing expectations across the maturity curve. We also continue to have positive discussions with the rating agencies regarding our corporate rating. We believe our current ratings are fairly conservative, and we look forward to continued discussions with all agencies over the next few quarters.
That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Malorie, we will now turn the call back over to you for any questions."

So I think, obviously, as you saw in the second quarter, we had tremendous trend coming from the first quarter. Our average pricing -- our blended pricing was 2.7 for the first quarter, 8.2 in the second quarter. And so as you look at the back half, and you take the guidance that we put out of 6.5 to 7.5 for the full year, we're obviously assuming continued strength in that.
And as I mentioned a bit in my calls, primarily in the third quarter because, July, we're seeing, and it's already very strong, we expect that to continue, we do expect some normal seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter, but still have strong numbers, but that blends down. So you can do the math on that. You're around -- somewhere around 8% for the back half of the year when you did the math on our new guidance. And so that's -- obviously, with continued strong and stable occupancy that we talked about, those are under guidance on that."

But I guess my -- what I'm wondering is when we look at the data, it feels like those markets right now if you blend what's going on with rent growth this year and last year is actually looking better than pre-COVID. And maybe that migration is a benefit or there's other factors, but just wanted to hear your thoughts on some of these really high rent growth markets, which are not -- they didn't have concessions.

And so I'll say this, we're still projecting a fourth quarter that's well above probably anything we've recently done in recent history for sure. So it's strong, but we will have -- there's just less demand in that period. And good thing is that we've designed it. So those are less leases being signed as well.

And we certainly continue to see evidence that the demand level is going to remain strong other than sort of normal seasonal patterns that we've alluded to. It's hard for me to point to any sort of definitive reason as to why the demand side of the equation is likely to show any significant moderation.
I think that if you want to think about some level of catch-up occurring, if you will, as a consequence of what went on last year, we went back and took a look at what we expected to occur last year in the second quarter in our pricing before we knew about COVID. And obviously, last year, during COVID, we came in short of those original expectations to the tune of about 250 basis points in terms of blended lease-over-lease pricing.
So if one wants to think about this year's performance has somewhat of an extra [indiscernible] to it as a consequence of recovery from last year from a lease-over-lease perspective, I would argue that probably no more than 200, 250 basis points of that is a function of recovery from last year. Overwhelmingly, what's driving it is just all the factors that are driving the really strong demand side of the business in terms of employers and employees finding reasons to come to the region and the new jobs is continuing to form here.
And as I pointed out a moment ago, with our markets constituting collectively, 42% of the household formation -- projected household formations in 2021, and that's growing to 44% based on the information we get from economy.com and some of these other services, it suggests to us that the demand side of the equation is likely to remain pretty robust. And we do think that it's unlikely for all the reasons Brad alluded to surrounding what's going on with construction costs, land sites and things of that nature, we think that we probably see supply levels remain fairly elevated like they are now going into next year, but it's hard for me to envision supply levels picking up materially from where they are. So as we sit here today, I think we're pretty optimistic that we're going to see pretty good favorable demand-supply relationship for us going into next year."

So it takes some time to get through that process. But frankly, really what we're doing on those is working through the predevelopment process and our approvals. 
And then really, once we get to a point where we can have a GMP and known construction prices locked in that's acceptable to us, we look to move forward with those opportunities. I would say the prepurchase time line is a bit more truncated because, again, we're putting off some of the risk associated with the predevelopment work to the developers that we're partnering with. So those have a little bit shorter time period on them. Sometimes, not all the time. So we're able to work those in kind of at our starts a little quicker than stuff that we're doing in-house.

Our third quarter results were well ahead of expectations. Growing demand across our Sunbelt markets continues to drive strong rent growth and high occupancy steady job growth, favorable migration trends, wage growth and escalating pricing of single-family housing are all driving strong performance for apartment rents across our portfolio. 
We're carrying significant pricing momentum into calendar year '22. Resident turnover remains low. Collections remain strong, occupancy is high and rent-to-income ratios remain very affordable.
This all suggests to us that we have good capacity in the market for the pricing trends that we are currently capturing. As we think about next year, we believe leasing conditions across our markets will remain favorable. Our Sunbelt markets continue to capture good job growth, driving positive migration trends. New move-ins year-to-date from households relocating to our Sunbelt markets constitute 14% of our new leases as compared to just over 10% in the same time frame of 2020. 
High pricing trends associated with single-family housing are further supporting strong demand for apartment housing. In the third quarter, move-outs among our resident base to buy a home were down 12% as compared to prior year, and move-outs to rent a home were down 38%. 
We continue to keep an eye on pressure surrounding supply chain challenges and inflation trends. Year-to-date, our biggest pressure on operating expenses is building repairs and maintenance costs, which are up just over 6%. Pressure is associated with both materials and labor. We expect year-over-year increases in repair and maintenance expenses will likely hold in the 6% range through the end of the year. Our current development pipeline remains on budget for both development costs and timing for unit deliveries. 
We're working into our planning and pro formas more cost and unit delivery contingencies as we expect the supply chain challenges to be with us through next year. But again, at this point, our current predevelopment pipeline remains fully on track and we expect to start several additional new projects in 2022. 
In summary, our markets continue to capture strong demand driving robust rent growth that will carry into 2022. And MAA's uniquely diversified approach across the Sunbelt region, supported by a very strong balance sheet, has the company well positioned to take advantage of the outlook for continued strong leasing fundamentals in our markets. 
We continue to build strength in our technology platform and their operating capabilities. Our redevelopment program and several repositioning projects will drive higher earnings opportunity from our existing portfolio. We expect to capture meaningful expansion in our operating margins over the next couple of years. 
In addition, our external growth pipeline continues to expand and will deliver meaningful value accretion over the coming years. MAA is well positioned heading into 2022 and we're excited about the prospects for continued outperformance in the coming year. I'd like to thank the MAA team for the tremendous progress this year and the very positive results. I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?"

Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 15%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis grew 6.3%. 
This is nearly 5x the 1.3% growth of the first quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen through the remainder of the year. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 96.4%. 
As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress from our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. 
For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and installed 22,000 Smart Home packages. This will bring our total number of smart units up to 47,000 units. We're in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first 8 full repositioned properties and have another 8 that are underway this year. 
Leasing activity for October has been strong. new lease-over-lease pricing month to date for October is running close to 20% ahead of the rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in October is running 13% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended pricing for the portfolio is up approximately 16% so far for October. 
Average daily occupancy for the month is currently 95.9% which is 30 basis points better than October of last year. exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 6.8%. This is 10 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth. We are well positioned as we move into the fourth quarter and '22. 
I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well, have shown tremendous aptability and resilience over the last year. I'm proud of them and excited about their progress in 2021. Brad?"

The already robust investor demand for multifamily properties in our footprint has strengthened. Transaction volume is at a record high as investors are looking to buy into the strong rent growth outlook in our Sunbelt markets. Strong leasing fundamentals, coupled with robust investor demand continues to push pricing growth. putting further downward pressure on cap rates. 
While the main focus of our capital deployment effort is currently on development through our in-house development and our repurchase program with third-party developers, we remain active in the transaction market and are actively evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities. 
For the moment, new development provides a more attractive investment basis, higher stabilized NOI yield and higher long-term returns to capital. We believe that as we move further into the recovery part of the cycle, we will likely find more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties. 
Our prepurchase and development pipeline that includes both under construction and in lease-up projects stands at 2,999 units with a total cost of $710 million. While the size of our development pipeline will fluctuate due to the timing differences of starts and completions, we continue to make good progress towards growing the pipeline. Our in-house development team has multiple sites either owned or under contract that we expect to start construction on in 2022. 
We have 3 sites in Denver, 1 of which is a 3-phase site, a 2-phase site in Raleigh and a site in Tampa. Additionally, we are negotiating on prepurchase projects in Charlotte and Salt Lake City that we hope to start next year as well. Despite inflationary pressures on materials and labor, we expect stabilized NOI yields on our new projects to remain in the 5.5 to 5.75 range. 
The strong leasing demand we're seeing across our portfolio is also evident in our lease-up properties, where we're seeing rents and velocity well above our pro forma. Because of this strong demand, we've moved up the expected stabilization date of our Sand Lake property in Orlando by 2 quarters with an expected stabilization date of third quarter '22. 
All of our under-construction projects remain on budget and on schedule with yield expectations at or above our original projections. These projects have fixed cost construction contracts, so they remain on budget, but we are seeing increased material shortages due to strong demand and shipping delays. Our construction management team has done a great job in navigating these challenges and minimizing the impact to our schedules. 
However, we expect these supply chain disruptions could add 60 days or so to any new starts next year. We've made great progress on our remaining dispositions for the year, which includes 2 properties in Savannah and 1 in Charlotte. The buyers are through their due diligence processes with hard earnest money deposits so the closing should wrap up fairly soon. Pricing on these 31-year-old assets is very strong, generating a levered investment IRR of 30%. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Al."

The continued very strong pricing trends and high occupancy through the third quarter produced revenue performance well above our prior expectations. Core FFO was $0.10 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, with the outperformance essentially all coming from revenue. Rent and lease pricing for the third quarter was 5% higher than projections, supported by an average physical occupancy about 50 basis points above projections. And as we expected, operating expense growth for the quarter moderated given some favorable prior year comparisons, but it is projected to return to the full year range during the fourth quarter. 
As you saw in the release, this third quarter performance produced a significant increase to both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased projected core FFO for the year to $6.94 per share, which is $0.19 per share above our prior midpoint and now represents a 7.9% growth over the prior year. 
The increase is driven by revised same-store revenue growth projection for the full year of 5.1% at the midpoint, which is based on continued strong pricing trends through the fourth quarter with some late seasonal moderation expected and we're assuming blended lease pricing averaging somewhere around 10% for full quarter. 
We left our operating expense expectation for the year unchanged at 4.25% and 4.75% growth which produces revised same-store NOI growth for the year of 5.5% at the midpoint. We do expect some growing pressure from operating expenses as we move into 2022 with personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs and real estate taxes which combined to make up over 2/3 of operating expenses, all expected to begin showing some inflationary increases during 2022. 
Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We completed several important financing transactions during the third quarter, which further enhanced our strength. We issued a combined $600 million in public bonds during the quarter, a barbell deal pairing 5-year and 30-year notes, which had very good pricing for both, have lended to a 2.1% effective rate, which supports our view that our current ratings are conservative. 
These transactions also fixed over 99% of our debt and extended our average debt maturities to almost 9 years, providing employee protection from a rising interest rate environment. We also executed an 18-month forward equity transaction which provides around $210 million of future funding for our growing development pipeline and based on current projections, this takes care of our equity needs for the next couple of years. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Mallory, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions."

I do think that we believe that if we do find ourselves in a rising rate environment, that first, this business that we're in, the apartment business offers, I think, some degree of hedge against rising pricing and rising cost in general as we have the ability to sort of reprice our service and our product pretty quickly. 
Al and Andrew have done a terrific job of the balance sheet. We've got the -- all the metrics in a very, very strong position and I think, in a position to withstand pressures that we may see a various sorts in the capital markets. So I think that -- and then I think some of the supply chain issues that we've been referencing will continue to be with us for some time. Eventually, that get fixed, but I think it's going to be a while happening probably a couple of years or so. 
And that may -- it will create some issues for us. But I think it will also potentially caused some delays in deliveries of some of the competing supply that may be coming into the market. So there's -- it's hard to sort of underwrite things right now. There's -- and obviously, there's just a whole lot of noise coming out of Washington, D.C. these days and discussions surrounding changes in tax policies and what degree that may or may not affect the economy and capital and how capital chooses to allocate and invest. 
So I think there are a lot of worry beads out there in that regard. And from our perspective, we've long believed that the right thing for us to do is just simply orient our capital towards markets where we believe the demand for what we do is likely to be the most stable and the strongest over a full year over a full cycle. You've over the years have heard that -- me oftentimes make reference to the notion that we're trying to be the best full cycle performer we can be. And I think it starts, frankly, with protecting the downside in protecting against risk. 
And for that reason, that's why we focus the way we do on the Sun Belt and have for 27 years. And then it's also, frankly, why we choose to allocate capital the way we do across the region with a real bend towards both a healthy combination of larger markets as well as secondary markets and with an affordable price point, we think it all just combines to create a higher degree of appeal for our product and thereby sort of sort of drive more stability and the ability to weather down cycles better. 
I'm excited about the opportunities that are coming in terms of the emerging recovery cycle, and we've got some exciting things happening with development. We've got ample capacity and strengthen the balance sheet to cover risks surrounding that. We've got some pretty exciting things we're doing with redevelopment, which are going to drive revenue growth opportunities off our existing asset base. And then we've got some exciting things we're doing with technology then I think it could continue to create performance advantages for us in the markets where we do business. So I feel like we're probably as well positioned as we could be for whatever the future holds. And time will tell."

Second quarter, they were at, call it, 3.75%. This quarter, that's down to about 3.25%. And these are really trailing 3-month cap rates. So these are trailing cap rates that we're looking at. So you can see in the last quarter, we've seen probably a 50 basis points or so further compression of cap rates versus what we saw in the second quarter. 
So we continue to see a significant amount of capital looking in our markets, looking for to deploy for reasons I mentioned in my comments. So we don't see any reason on the horizon right now that, that is going to stop. In fact, we are hearing more and more stories from our brokers that we're talking to that cap rates are in the mid- to upper 2s in some of the markets, depending on what the growth looks like. 
So again, as I mentioned last quarter, I think from here, it feels like cap rates probably come down a little bit more. But we have certainly seen, as we get later in the year and as often is the case, we have seen bid sheets lighten up a little bit. Some of that is because we've had a historical amount of volume this year. So folks maybe have met their allocation or maybe there's just a little bit of deal fatigue as we get later in the year. 
But Nevertheless, the pricing that the winning bidder is willing to pay is -- continues to be aggressive driving those cap rates down. That's fantastic insight. Thank you so much for all this color and congratulations once again."

Now we do not actually act as a general contractor ourselves. We always contract that with third-party general contractors. So we're not actually building it ourselves, but we are overseeing the construction. And then in addition to the in-house execution that we've got what we refer to as a prepurchase program, we're essentially joint venturing with third-party developers, and they really do the construction.

We think about the baked-in trends that we have. And we -- and then at a top level, we think about job growth, we think about sort of the variables that drive demand, all of which we think are going to continue to be very positive into next year.

I mean we certainly, in October 2019, did not foresee what happened over the last couple of years. I would tell you that, yes, I think, broadly speaking, when you think about a long-term sort of top line performance for our asset class.

I just think that, that's a pretty reasonable assumption to make. And then our challenge as a management team is then to think about how do we take volatility out of that performance stream I think that, particularly as a REIT paying hopefully a steady growing dividend, it's really important to think about that. 
And that's why we have the strategy that we do in an effort to try to remove some of the volatility, but yet still be in a position to drive that kind of top line growth. Now we do believe that over time, also with platform capabilities that we should deliver results -- top line results that would be if you will, superior to normal market trends, both as a combination of just balance sheet strength we have, the technology platform that continues to build out and add capabilities, a very robust revenue management system. 
And then the things that we're doing with repositioning and redevelopment.

But in terms of what we're selling this year, the 2 in Savannah, the 1 in Charlotte, we raised our guidance in terms of that. Pricing was quite a bit higher than what we expected, frankly. 
The way we look at our pricing on these assets is we're looking at a yield our trailing 12-month NOI yield and what we're getting on the proceeds there. And from that basis, we're getting about a 4.2% yield on those. And just for cap rate comparison purposes, just so you can compare across markets, that's about a, call it, a 3.25 to 3.5 market cap rate.

But in an effort to sort of push back some of the pressures surrounding what's happening in the labor markets, broadly speaking, where we probably to date experienced the most pressure from a labor cost perspective is on contract labor we are forced to go out and hire third-party vendors or third-party contractors to come in and do certain activities that's where we've seen more of the pressure from a labor perspective. 
But we believe that through various programs that we have within our company from an HR perspective, coupled with the efforts that we've got underway with new technologies and the ability to get more efficient with our headcount levels. that we'll probably keep the labor cost itself. I'm going to put it in probably a 4% to 5% range would be, I would think, comfortable to be able to deliver on that kind of performance."

And then my second question is just on rental pricing and how we should think about this because in the third quarter, right, you had -- blended pricing was up 16% -- I'm sorry, that was October 16%. I think it was 15% for the third quarter. When we look at some of the industry data, a year ago, rents in your markets were kind of not up -- they weren't really impacted here. They were sort of slightly down year-over-year or maybe flattish -- And so it really feels like what's happening here in this quarter right now is you have this comparison period where the numbers are very high because a year ago, there was no rent growth. And so you're almost getting like 2 years of rent growth in 1 quarter or in October right now. 
And so as we just kind of think about where rents could be trending going forward, realizing there's -- eventually hit some comp issues next year in the second quarter, third quarter because you had very strong quarters this year for markets. But really the way -- is it the right way for us to think about blended pricing right now is something like half of what the number is, so it's maybe really 7% to 8% on an annual basis, not -- because it's not -- it's very hard to see how it continues at 15%. But is there a reasonable thing to think that, really, on an annual basis, it's sort of half of that right now?"

It's kind of hard to answer that specifically. The thing -- let me break it down this way and explain to you the renewal pricing performance is driven by a different set of factors. Renewal pricing as we've alluded to earlier in",559,"Well, Nick, this is Eric. It's kind of hard to answer that specifically. The thing -- let me break it down this way and explain to you the renewal pricing performance is driven by a different set of factors. Renewal pricing as we've alluded to earlier in 1 of the earlier questions, it has a lot more influence rounding the ability for us to be a little bit more aggressive there because people really just want to avoid the hassle of moving obviously, supply-demand dynamics factor into what we can do on renewal pricing to some degree as well. 
But also, are they happy, have we done a good job of keeping them serviced and responsive to their needs and so on and so forth. So I think that what we find is that renewal pricing which is, call it, roughly half or so of the blended performance is it tends to be a lot more stable and tends to be a lot steadier, if you will, over the course of the year. 
And I would tell you that back to what Tom was mentioning a moment ago, when you look at the absolute rent amount that is being charged for new moving customers versus the absolute rent amount being charged for renewal customers there is room to continue to push pretty hard on the renewal pricing without eclipsing or going above the new lease pricing. 
So we think that the outlook and the trajectory for renewal pricing is likely to remain fairly stable and growing and positive more or less consistent with what we're seeing now and don't really see why that would materially weaken. 
New lease pricing for new customers coming in tends to be a much more volatile number. And not only do you have market dynamics that come into play there, but you've also got seasonal factors that work into the equation a little bit. And so I think that as we think about what's driving rent growth this year and particularly as it relates to new lease pricing, new customers moving in. 
There is some of the COVID unbundling, if you will, that's going on that, as you point out, will start to taper off, if you will, at some point. But the other variables surrounding job growth, migration trends, the inability for people to go out and buy homes at pricing that has gotten above what they can afford and so forth. Those variables are likely to continue for some time as we see. 
And certainly, overall migration trends, the demand for apartment housing across our region has continued to be very robust. So I think that new lease pricing is probably inflated a little bit right now as a consequence of sort of coming out of COVID. 
And so to some degree, if you want to think about moderation taking place as we get sort of past the code at influence altogether, it probably does show up a little bit more so in new lease pricing and to put a number to that right now is kind of hard because we don't know which of those variables is necessarily creating the most impact. I would tell you, probably as job growth and migration trends and what's happening to single-family housing more so than any sort of COVID unbundling effect that's going on."

Our third quarter results were well ahead of expectations. Growing demand across our Sunbelt markets continues to drive strong rent growth and high occupancy, steady job growth, favorable migration trends, wage growth and escalating pricing of single-family housing are all driving strong performance for apartment rents across our portfolio.  
We're carrying significant pricing momentum into calendar year '22. Resident turnover remains low. Collections remain strong, occupancy Is high, and rent-to-income ratios remain very affordable. 
This all suggests to us that we have good capacity in the market for the pricing trends that we are currently capturing. As we think about next year, we believe leasing conditions across our markets will remain favorable. Our Sunbelt markets continue to capture good job growth, driving positive migration trends. New move-ins, year-to-date, from households relocating to our Sunbelt markets, constitute 14% of our new leases as compared to just over 10% in the same time frame of 2020.  
High pricing trends associated with single-family housing, are further supporting strong demand for apartment housing. In the third quarter, move-outs among our resident base to buy a home, were down 12% as compared to prior year, and move-outs to rent a home, were down 38%.  
We continue to keep an eye on pressure surrounding supply chain challenges and inflation trends. Year-to-date, our biggest pressure on operating expenses is building repairs and maintenance costs, which are up just over 6%. Pressures associated with both materials and labor. We expect year-over-year increases in repair and maintenance expenses will likely hold in the 6% range through the end of the year. Our current development pipeline remains on budget for both development costs and timing for unit deliveries.  
We're working into our planning and pro formas more cost and unit delivery contingencies, as we expect the supply chain challenges to be with us through next year. But again, at this point, our current predevelopment pipeline remains fully on track and we expect to start several additional new projects in 2022.  
In summary, our markets continue to capture strong demand, driving robust rent growth that will carry into 2022. And MAA's uniquely diversified approach across the Sunbelt region, supported by a very strong balance sheet, has the company well positioned to take advantage of the outlook for continued strong leasing fundamentals in our markets.  
We continue to build strength in our technology platform and their operating capabilities. Our redevelopment program and several repositioning projects will drive higher earnings opportunity from our existing portfolio. We expect to capture meaningful expansion in our operating margins over the next couple of years.  
In addition, our external growth pipeline continues to expand and will deliver meaningful value accretion over the coming years. MAA is well positioned, heading into 2022, and and we're excited about the prospects for continued outperformance in the coming year. I'd like to thank the MAA team for the tremendous progress this year and the very positive results. I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?"

Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 15%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth, on a year-over-year basis, grew 6.3%.  
This is nearly 5x the 1.3% growth of the first quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen through the remainder of the year. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 96.4%.  
As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress from our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection.  
For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and installed 22,000 Smart Home packages. This will bring our total number of smart units up to 47,000 units. We're in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first 8 full-repositioned properties and have another 8 that are underway this year.  
Leasing activity for October has been strong. new lease-over-lease pricing month to date for October is running close to 20% ahead of the rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in October is running 13% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended pricing for the portfolio is up approximately 16%, so far, for October.  
Average daily occupancy for the month is currently 95.9%, which is 30 basis points better than October of last year. Exposure, which is all vacant units, plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 6.8%. This is 10 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth. We are well positioned, as we move into the fourth quarter and '22.  
I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well, who have shown tremendous aptability and resilience over the last year. I'm proud of them and excited about their progress in 2021. Brad?"

The already robust investor demand for multifamily properties in our footprint, has strengthened. Transaction volume is at a record high, as investors are looking to buy into the strong rent-growth outlook in our Sunbelt markets. Strong leasing fundamentals, coupled with robust investor demand, continues to push pricing growth, putting further downward pressure on cap rates.  
While the main focus of our capital deployment effort is currently on development through our in-house development and our prepurchase program with third-party developers, we remain active in the transaction market and are actively evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities.  
For the moment, new development provides a more attractive investment basis, higher stabilized NOI yield and higher long-term returns to capital. We believe that as we move further into the recovery part of the cycle, we will likely find more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties.  
Our prepurchase and development pipeline that includes both under construction and in lease-up projects, stands at 2,999 units, with a total cost of $710 million. While the size of our development pipeline will fluctuate due to the timing differences of starts and completions, we continue to make good progress towards growing the pipeline. Our in-house development team has multiple sites, either owned or under contract, that we expect to start construction on in 2022.  
We have 3 sites in Denver, 1 of which is a 3-phase site, a 2-phase site in Raleigh and a site in Tampa. Additionally, we are negotiating on prepurchase projects in Charlotte and Salt Lake City that we hope to start next year as well. Despite inflationary pressures on materials and labor, we expect stabilized NOI yields on our new projects to remain in the 5.5 to 5.75 range.  
The strong leasing demand, we're seeing across our portfolio, is also evident in our lease-up properties, where we're seeing rents and velocity well above our pro forma. Because of this strong demand, we've moved up the expected stabilization date of our Sand Lake property in Orlando by 2 quarters, with an expected stabilization date of third quarter '22.  
All of our under-construction projects remain on budget and on schedule, with yield expectations at or above our original projections. These projects have fixed-cost construction contracts, so they remain on budget, but we are seeing increased material shortages due to strong demand and shipping delays. Our construction management team has done a great job in navigating these challenges and minimizing the impact to our schedules.  
However, we expect these supply chain disruptions could add 60 days or so to any new starts next year. We've made great progress on our remaining dispositions for the year, which includes 2 properties in Savannah and 1 in Charlotte. The buyers are through their due diligence processes with hard-earnest money deposits, so the closing should wrap up fairly soon. Pricing on these 31-year-old assets is very strong, generating a levered investment IRR of 30%. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Al."

The continued very-strong pricing trends and high occupancy through the third quarter produced revenue performance well above our prior expectations. Core FFO was $0.10 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, with the outperformance essentially, all coming from revenue. Run and lease pricing for the third quarter was 5% higher than projections, supported by an average physical occupancy about 50 basis points above projections. And as we expected, operating expense growth for the quarter moderated, given some favorable prior year comparisons, but it is projected to return to the full-year range during the fourth quarter.  
As you saw in the release, this third quarter performance produced a significant increase to both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased projected core FFO for the year to $6.94 per share, which is $0.19 per share above our prior midpoint and now represents a 7.9% growth over the prior year.  
The increase is driven by revised Same Store revenue growth projection for the full year of 5.1% at the midpoint, which is based on continued strong-pricing trends through the fourth quarter with some late seasonal moderation expected, and we're assuming blended lease pricing averaging somewhere around 10% for full quarter.  
We left our operating expense expectation for the year unchanged at 4.25% and 4.75% growth, which produces revised Same Store NOI growth for the year of 5.5% at the midpoint. We do expect some growing pressure from operating expenses as we move into 2022 with personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs and real estate taxes, which combined to make up over 2/3 of operating expenses, all expected to begin showing some inflationary increases during 2022.  
Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We completed several important financing transactions during the third quarter, which further enhanced our strength. We issued a combined $600 million in public bonds during the quarter, a barbell deal pairing 5-year and 30-year notes, which had very good pricing for both, have lended to a 2.1% effective rate, which supports our view that our current ratings are conservative.  
These transactions also fixed over 99% of our debt and extended our average debt maturities to almost 9 years, providing employee protection from a rising interest-rate environment. We also executed an 18-month forward equity transaction, which provides around $210 million of future funding for our growing development pipeline, and based on current projections, this takes care of our equity needs for the next couple of years. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Mallory, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions."

I do think that -- we believe that if we do find ourselves in a rising-rate environment, that first, this business that we're in, the apartment business offers, I think, some degree of hedge against rising pricing and rising cost, in general, as we have the ability to, sort of, reprice our service and our product, pretty quickly.  
Al and Andrew have done a terrific job, at the balance sheet. We've got the -- all the metrics in a very, very strong position and I think, in a position to withstand pressures that we may see a various sorts in the capital markets. So I think that -- and then I think, some of the supply chain issues, that we've been referencing, will continue to be with us for some time. Eventually, that get fixed, but I think it's going to be a while in happening, probably a couple of years or so.  
And that may -- it will create some issues for us. But I think it will also potentially cause some delays in deliveries of some of the competing supply that may be coming into the market. So there's -- it's hard to, sort of, underwrite things right now. There's -- and obviously, there's just a whole lot of noise coming out of Washington, D.C. these days and discussions surrounding changes in tax policies and what degree that may or may not affect the economy and capital and how capital chooses to allocate and invest.  
So I think there are a lot of worry beads out there, in that regard. And from our perspective, we've long believed that the right thing for us to do, is just simply orient our capital towards markets, where we believe the demand for what we do, is likely to be the most stable and the strongest over a full cycle. You've, over the years, have heard that -- me oftentimes, make reference to the notion that we're trying to be the best full cycle performer we can be. And I think it starts, frankly, with protecting the downside, in protecting against risk. 
And for that reason, that's why we focus, the way we do, on the Sunbelt and have for 27 years. And then it's also, frankly, why we choose to allocate capital, the way we do, across the region with a real bend towards, both a healthy combination of larger markets as well as secondary markets and with an affordable price point, we think it all just combines to create a higher degree of appeal for our product and thereby, sort of, drive more stability and the ability to weather down cycles better. 
I'm excited about the opportunities that are coming, in terms of the emerging recovery cycle, and we've got some exciting things happening with development. We've got ample capacity and strengthen the balance sheet to cover risks, surrounding that. We've got some pretty exciting things we're doing with redevelopment, which are going to drive revenue growth opportunities of our existing asset base. And then, we've got some exciting things we're doing with technology, then I think it could continue to create performance advantages for us in the markets, where we do business. So I feel like we're probably as well positioned as we could be for whatever the future holds. And time will tell."

If we go back to, call it, first quarter of this year, cap rates on new deals in the market that we were underwriting and looking at, cap rates were about 4%. 
Second quarter, they were at, call it, 3.75%. This quarter, that's down to about 3.25%. And these are really trailing 3-month cap rates. So these are trailing cap rates that we're looking at. So you can see in the last quarter, we've seen, probably a 50 basis points or so further compression of cap rates versus what we saw in the second quarter. 
So we continue to see a significant amount of capital, looking in our markets, looking for -- to deploy for reasons I mentioned in my comments. So we don't see any reason on the horizon, right now, that, that is going to stop. In fact, we are hearing more and more stories from our brokers, that we're talking to, that cap rates are in the mid-upper 2s in some of the markets, depending on what the growth looks like. 
So again, as I mentioned, last quarter, I think, from here, it feels like cap rates probably come down a little bit more. But we have certainly seen -- as we get later in the year and as often is the case, we have seen bid sheets lighten up a little bit. Some of that is because we've had a historical amount of volume this year. So folks maybe, have met their allocation, or maybe there's just a little bit of deal fatigue as we get later in the year. 
But nevertheless, the pricing that the winning bidder is willing to pay is -- continues to be aggressive, driving those cap rates down."

We think about the baked-in trends that we have. And we -- and then, at a top level, we think about job growth, we think about, sort of, the variables that drive demand, all of which, we think, are going to continue to be very positive into next year.

I mean, we certainly, in October 2019, did not foresee what happened over the last couple of years. I would tell you that, yes, I think, broadly speaking, when you think about a long-term, sort of, top line performance for our asset class. We would put it at -- call it, 3.5%, plus or minus, over a long period of time. And I think, in a highly competitive business like ours, where pricing is part of the competition tool set, I just think that, that's a pretty reasonable assumption to make. And then, our challenge as a management team is then to think about how do we take volatility out of that performance stream. I think that, particularly as a REIT paying, hopefully a steady-growing dividend, it's really important to think about that. 
And that's why we have the strategy that we do, in an effort to try to remove some of the volatility, but yet, still be in a position to drive that kind of top line growth. Now we do believe that over time, also with platform capabilities, that we should deliver results -- top line results that would be, if you will, superior to normal market trends, both as a combination of just balance sheet strength we have, the technology platform that continues to build out and add capabilities, a very robust revenue management system. 
And then, the things that we're doing with repositioning and redevelopment.

But I think that, broadly speaking, the portfolio did, what we hoped it would do. 
And then some of our more-secondary markets, markets like Greenville and Charleston and Savannah, Nashville, Jacksonville have continued to produce the kind of the more steady results that we count on, during times of volatility. And Atlanta has been -- it was a little weaker earlier last year, but it's come back really strong. So I wouldn't point to anything really surprising, other than just those few I mentioned there."

There are areas that are more aggressive, that we do expect more pressure. We talked often about, particularly Texas and Florida. Those two are the most aggressive programs, and they're both combined a little over 50% of our tax liability. 
So we expect that to be the biggest area in 2022 to -- really, a challenge. Now we'll fight everything, as we do. And we'll see what happens. There's some factors that help us a bit in 2022, and then we'll have some areas that aren't assessing. I think Tennessee, North Carolina, they're not reassessing this year, parts of our Georgia portfolio, because we've appealed and we've completed those, and there's, kind of, a lot for 1 year or 2, when you've completed appeals. 
So there some areas that are not going to see assessments, that's going to be helpful. But Texas and Florida are going to really challenge us. And so we're preparing for that. And with the growing top lines and driving cap rates, you expect that -- we've talked about mid- to upper single-digit kind of expectations in some of those markets. And so that's what -- we'll have more to say about that as we end the year and put out guidance and it's certainly -- as we move into next year. But that's where the pressure should come from."

That involves looking at properties that have some cash flow and CapEx needs, that are above what we're looking for, in our overall portfolio, has generally trend to older properties. 
We've got some, where maybe there's some regulatory issues that we're looking at, that we evaluate. We've got properties that are in markets, where the rent growth is not really what we want it to be. So we go through that process every year, really to identify the opportunities for us to sell for the following year. 
The other side of that is, we're looking at what can we handle, in terms of dilution, and then what our cash flow needs for the year, our funding needs. So all of that, kind of, goes into our process, and we're in the process of doing that now, for next year. So we'll certainly have more to say about that, with our re-lease for next year. But in terms of what we're selling this year, the 2 in Savannah, the 1 in Charlotte, we raised our guidance, in terms of that. Pricing was quite a bit higher than what we expected, frankly. 
The way we look at our pricing on these assets is -- we're looking at a yield -- our trailing 12-month NOI yield and what we're getting on the proceeds there. And from that basis, we're getting about a 4.2% yield on those. And just for cap rate comparison purposes, just so you can compare across markets, that's about a, call it, a 3.25 to 3.5 market cap rate. 
So very good pricing that we're able to achieve. And just as a reminder, those are 31-year-old assets that we're selling in those markets. And so very, very strong pricing that we're seeing."

But in an effort to, sort of, push back some of the pressures surrounding, what's happening in the labor markets, broadly speaking, where we, probably to date, experienced the most pressure, from a labor-cost perspective, is on contract labor, where we are forced to go out and hire third-party vendors or third-party contractors to come in and do certain activities. That's where we've seen more of the pressure, from a labor perspective. 
But we believe that through various programs that we have within our company, from an HR perspective, coupled with the efforts that we've got underway with new technologies and the ability to get more efficient with our headcount levels. then we'll probably keep the labor cost itself.

The renewal pricing performance is driven by a different set of factors. Renewal pricing, as we've alluded to, earlier, in one of the earlier questions, it has a lot more influence rounding the ability for us to be a little bit more aggressive there because people really just want to avoid the hassle of moving. Obviously, supply-demand dynamics factor into what we can do on renewal pricing, to some degree as well. 
But also, are they happy, have we done a good job of keeping them serviced and responsive to their needs and so on and so forth. So I think that -- what we find is that renewal pricing, which is, call it, roughly half or so of the blended performance is -- it tends to be a lot more stable and tends to be a lot steadier, if you will, over the course of the year. 
And I would tell you that, back to what Tom was mentioning, a moment ago, when you look at the absolute rent amount that is being charged for new moving customers versus the absolute rent amount being charged for renewal customers, there is room to continue to push pretty hard on the renewal pricing, without eclipsing or going above the new lease pricing. 
So we think that the outlook and the trajectory for renewal pricing is likely to remain fairly stable and growing and positive, more or less consistent with what we're seeing now and don't really see why that would materially weaken. 
New lease pricing for new customers coming in, tends to be a much more volatile number. And not only do you have market dynamics that come into play there, but you've also got seasonal factors that work into the equation a little bit. And so I think that as we think about what's driving rent growth this year and particularly, as it relates to new lease pricing, new customers moving in. 
There is some of the COVID unbundling, if you will, that's going on that, as you point out, will start to taper off, if you will, at some point. But the other variables surrounding job growth, migration trends, the inability for people to go out and buy homes at pricing that has gotten above what they can afford and so forth, those variables are likely to continue for some time as we see. 
And certainly, overall migration trends, the demand for apartment housing across our region, has continued to be very robust. So I think that new lease pricing is probably inflated a little bit, right now, as a consequence of, sort of, coming out of COVID. 
And so to some degree, if you want to think about moderation taking place as we get, sort of, past the COVID influence, altogether, it probably does show up a little bit, more so in new lease pricing and to put a number to that right now, is kind of hard because we don't know which of those variables is necessarily creating the most impact. I would tell you, probably as job growth and migration trends and what's happening to single-family housing more so than any sort of COVID unbundling effect that's going on."
