Our fourth quarter capped a year in which the pandemic challenged our customers and our business. It highlighted some core strengths for the company, introduced some obstacles to overcome and triggered some changes for us.",1468,"Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter capped a year in which the pandemic challenged our customers and our business. It highlighted some core strengths for the company, introduced some obstacles to overcome and triggered some changes for us. 
To put the year and quarter in context, let me first review some of the numbers. Procedures grew 6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 1% for the full year over 2019, resulting in approximately 1.25 million procedures in 2020. We placed 326 systems in the quarter, down from 336 systems in Q4 of 2019. For the full year, we placed 936 systems in 2020, down from 1,119 systems in 2019. Finally, revenue fell 3% in 2020 as the result of delays in surgical procedures as hospitals focused on treating COVID patients. 
Digging a little deeper, our core business remains healthy. After the first surge of COVID abated during this past summer, our customers returned to more routine use of our systems and solutions. We believe that the Intuitive ecosystem enabled increased access to and practice of high-quality minimally invasive surgery, which may have helped hospitals conserve valuable intensive care resources during the pandemic. Despite pressure on utilization of our systems due to COVID, our hospital customers continue to invest in building their Intuitive's robotics programs with additional systems, evidenced by a 7% increase in the clinical installed base in 2020. We saw committed customers strengthening their programs, likely due to their analysis of how well the Intuitive ecosystem satisfied their quadruple aim objectives, better outcomes, better care team experiences, better patient experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. 
Lastly, we believe our investments in our analytics programs have helped customers routinely analyze their performance, supporting their programmatic insights in the year. Our confidence in our core business and our long-term opportunity remains robust. In spite of near term uncertainty, which is as follows: first, the pandemic is resurgent in many regions, powered now by more contagious variants. While hospitals have better protocols to manage patients today than they did earlier in 2020, our weekly surgical data in December 2020 and continuing today, shows another clamp down on surgeries. Furthermore, we believe diagnostic procedures are slowing in hard hit regions. With diagnostic procedures running significantly below pre-pandemic levels, patients and hospitals will acutely feel the impact through disease progression and the more complex therapies necessary when patients do return for care. This delay in diagnostic pipelines will likely take several quarters to resolve, even after the threat of COVID begins to abate. 
Second, we know that future of new capital installs are highly sensitive to utilization rates. Delayed surgeries will also impact the growth of surgical departments, pressuring new system installs until excess capacity is consumed. Third, in countries where the government pays the health care bill, budget strain and economic fallout from COVID may impact health care spending in new and variable ways in different countries. 
Lastly, the trend that started prior to the pandemic for increased data requirements and longer clearance time lines from regulators in the United States and Europe for our industry has continued this year. Taken together, these obstacles make predictions for the next several quarters difficult. As I mentioned earlier, 2020 has broadly eliminated some longer-term trends in health care that validate our thesis. The increased pressure on health care systems to conserve acute care resources for the sickest patients may have accelerated investments that enable patients to get the care they need with fast recovery, minimizing consumption of scarce hospital resources and reducing complications. The compounding value of analyzing real-time data and offline health care data to drive insights, to drive better care has become obvious this year. 
Lastly, we saw an acceleration of remote technology used to enable proctoring, learning and analysis. I've heard it said that in good times, we develop ourselves to become who we want to be while hard times reveal who we really are. In the year, we set our priorities based on our values. We implemented community relief and customer relief, launched our extended use instruments program, mobilized local and remote training resources to support customers differently and continued to listen carefully to our customers to best understand their needs. We've seen positive customer response to this approach, which is reflected in our Net Promoter Score. You can find more information on these scores in our JPMorgan Healthcare Conference presentation from this month posted on our website. 
Over the past several years, we've been building our capabilities in different countries to better serve their health care systems. I'd like to take a moment to take you through how we performed outside the United States in the year. Turning first to Asia. Our business in Japan is moving beyond urology, given reimbursements for a broad slate of procedures obtained in Japan in 2018 and 2020. Government hospitals in Japan have been conserving resources for COVID care and the pandemic has introduced noticeable delays as the health care system reacts to outbreaks. In Korea, our business continues to be dynamic with an innovation-oriented customer group adopting new products like our da Vinci SP. In China, we saw accelerated customer acceptance of our partnership with Fosun Pharma and our products, with growth in procedures and the business overall outpacing our pre-pandemic plans. In 2020, China emerged as our #2 procedure market. 
Turning to Europe. Our team in Germany has had success in engaging larger German hospital groups with increased system placements broadening our market access. Constraints on elective surgery have been implemented assertively in Germany in light of COVID. In Germany, France, U.K., Italy and the Nordics, our goals have been to broaden da Vinci use beyond Urology. Progress therein has been hampered significantly by COVID. Lastly, we see relatively low public sector reimbursements in Europe for benign procedures. Innovations from Intuitive like da Vinci S and our extended use instruments are providing an option for more price-sensitive customers in these markets. 
With regard to our innovation and product engines, we spent time walking through our progress at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference this month and our presentation is available online at our website, intuitive.com. I'd recommend to the interested listener to review of those materials for greater insight into our progress. 
Summarizing briefly here, we're making good progress in advancing many elements of our ecosystem, including our advanced instruments, deepening our imaging and informatics programs, including our augmented reality program, Iris, and extending the launches of our new platforms. We grew the installed base in procedures for our single port platform, da Vinci SP. We're focused on advancing clinical indications for SP in several regions as well as extending its instrument and accessory portfolio. 
For our flexible robotics platform, Ion, we saw strong clinical results and demand in the year, but met manufacturing and supply performance challenges in the fourth quarter as catheter demand outpaced our forecasting models and the need for important quality improvement implementations and COVID quarantines hampered our production. We are currently shipping Ion product and expect to meet the demand curve in the first half of 2021. 
Before Marshall takes you through our finances in detail, I'd like to touch on our financial strategy. Our operating model withstood the strains of 2020 well. Starting with our decision several years ago to shift to greater flexibility in system placement models, the incorporation of sales, leasing and risk shared models allowed us to meet customers' needs during a disruptive time. Our investments in advanced instruments, including stapling and energy have been fruitful with growing revenues, improving margins and growing customer appreciation for advanced instruments. We've been investing capital in our manufacturing methods to increase quality and lower our costs, which in turn has allowed us to extend savings to our customers to allow them greater flexibility and deploying our products in more cost-sensitive environments. This has triggered a virtuous cycle that allows us greater volume, which in turn gives us greater ability to invest in higher volume processes. We'll continue to invest in this cycle going forward. 
We believe we are still in the early innings of a long opportunity to substantially improve the quadruple aim and acute medical interventions using robotics, computing, advanced imaging and informatics. As a result, we continue to invest in our innovation engines to create and pursue these opportunities. 
In closing, our priorities for 2021 are as follows: first, we'll support our customers' recovery of surgery during and post pandemic; second, we'll focus on outstanding regional performance; third, we'll advance our priority programs and launches, SP, Ion, imaging and analytics, including new indications; and finally, continued expansion of clinical, economic and analytical evidence base for key procedures and countries. 
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail."

I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. 
Revenue and procedures are consistent with our preliminary press release of January 13. Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows: fourth quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased approximately 10% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter system placements of 326 systems decreased 3% compared with 336 systems last year and increased 67% compared with 195 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over last year by 7% to approximately 5,989 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% in the last quarter and 12% last year. 
Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, declined approximately 2% compared with last year and increased 8% compared with last quarter. The impact of COVID on da Vinci procedures vary by region. Resurgence of COVID in parts of Europe had significant impacts on procedures, including in Italy, U.K., Nordics and France. While the impact of COVID on procedures in the Asia Pacific region, including China, Japan and Korea, was far less significant. 
In the U.S., fourth quarter procedure growth was impacted by the COVID resurgence, resulting in 5% year-over-year growth compared to 7% growth in the third quarter. The resurgence in U.S. and Europe was more acute and had a greater impact on procedures late in the quarter, a trend that continued into January. The impact of a resurgence can be significant. For example, in California, the fourth quarter COVID resurgence turned a year-over-year da Vinci procedure growth in October of 8% to a year-over-year decline of 6% in December. We also believe that reduced diagnosis reflecting patient concern over COVID exposure has impacted certain procedures globally. This has had its most pronounced effect on prostatectomies. Despite the fact that hospitals are better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared to the outset of the pandemic, COVID-19 resurgences like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and the U.S. have challenged hospital care capabilities and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions will also continue to negatively impact da Vinci procedures. 
Uncertainties in this COVID environment are not predictable, and the vaccine rollout and its impact on controlling COVID spread is also not predictable. Given these uncertainties, we are not providing procedure guidance at this time. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. Fourth quarter capital placements exceeded our expectations, reflecting several factors. In certain cases, hospitals exhausted 2020 budgets and spend capacities. And in some cases, hospitals purchased systems in preparation for post pandemic environment. We also experienced a higher level of trade-ins of Si systems for fourth generation systems, reflecting hospital desire to standardize fleet and to avail themselves to fourth generation technology and lower cost extended use instruments. 
Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue headwinds. Utilization declined 2% year-over-year, resulting in excess system capacity at hospitals. We expect customers to fill existing system capacity before purchasing additional capital. Some of the fourth quarter capital placements reflected hospitals exhausting 2020 budgets. As budgets reset for 2021, hospitals could reduce their capital spend, particularly as COVID strains hospital profitability. We expect leasing to continue to increase as a percentage of overall placements. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could also impact hospital capital spending. And as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. 
Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: total fourth quarter revenue was $1.329 billion, representing a 4% increase from last year and a 23% increase from last quarter. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from U.S. customer stocking of extended use instruments and higher than expected system placements. Leasing represented 37% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last quarter. Fourth quarter placements included some larger IDN transactions where the IDN prefers purchase transactions. Excluding those transactions, leasing as a percentage of total placements would have been several percentage points higher. In an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 
Approximately half of the systems placed in the fourth quarter involve trade-ins, which is higher than the 40% last quarter and higher than the average over the last couple of years. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. 
Fourth quarter average selling prices declined to $1.43 million from $1.61 million last year and $1.55 million in the third quarter. The decrease relative to last year reflects a lower mix of systems placed in China and Japan and a higher proportion of trade transactions. The decrease relative to last quarter reflects a higher proportion of trade-in transactions and a higher mix of indirect market placements. We recognized $14 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $34 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure increased to approximately $2,060 per procedure compared with $1,910 per procedure in the third quarter of 2020 and $1,980 realized in the fourth quarter of last year. The entirety of the increase compared to the third quarter reflects U.S. hospital stocking extended use instruments. We launched extended use instruments early in the quarter in the U.S. and mid-quarter in Europe. We will launch extended use instruments in other markets in 2021 and 2022, depending on regulatory requirements. 
Going forward, we expect customers to adjust their instrument buying patterns and reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument. In addition, extended use instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower I&A revenue per procedure to Intuitive. The impact and timing of customer buying patterns and lower per use revenue will likely begin to impact revenues in the first quarter, but will depend on customer inventory practices and procedure volumes. While we expect price elasticity associated with extended use instruments to enable greater penetration into available markets, that benefit will be delayed by COVID and otherwise will take time. 12 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were SP systems, reflecting continued measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our installed base of SP systems is now 69, 8 in Korea and 61 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We expect to initiate first cases associated with a U.S. colorectal clinical trial this quarter. 
We placed 4 Ion systems in the quarter, beginning -- bringing the installed base to 36 systems. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. Ion system placements were affected by supply chain issues described by Gary earlier in the call. We expect to remediate these supply issues in the first half of 2021. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Procedures under the PRECISE study are expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021. Outside the U.S., we placed 130 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 140 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 79 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 22 into Japan and 13 into China compared with 54 into Europe, 26 into Japan and 39 into China in the fourth quarter of 2019. System placements into China in the fourth quarter of 2019 were higher as hospitals accelerated tenders in anticipation of the possibility of higher tariffs. 
Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 69.7% compared with 72.2% for the fourth quarter 2019 and 70.2% last quarter. The fourth quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 reflects higher period costs associated with lower production, higher excess and obsolete inventory charges and lower system ASPs. 
As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under-absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. In addition, product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and could cause fluctuations in gross margins. 
Pro forma operating expenses decreased 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased 11% compared with the third quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2020 includes a $25 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation compared with a $5 million contribution in the fourth quarter of 2019 and no contribution last quarter. Fourth quarter operating expenses continued to reflect reduced spending on activities directly impacted by COVID-19, including marketing events, travel and in person training as well as lower variable compensation. These costs will naturally increase as the impact of COVID declines. We continue to believe we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world, and we'll continue to invest in the business for the long term. During this period of COVID, we continue to invest in product development activities, including informatics, advanced imaging, advanced instruments and our Ion and SP platforms. Accordingly, you should expect the growth rate of R&D expenses in 2021 to significantly exceed the 2020 growth rate. 
We expect the growth rate of SG&A expenses to also increase significantly in 2021 compared to 2020. SG&A spending can be categorized as follows: investments in OUS markets will increase over 2020 spend as we expand our capabilities and investment in clinical data. Variable compensation will increase over 2020 as we reset goals and targets. Core spending on resources and infrastructure will increase over 2020 to prepare for a post-COVID environment. Spend on activities impacted by COVID like travel, marketing events and in person training will increase as the impact of COVID decline. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.7% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, primarily reflecting the geographic mix of income. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items. Our fourth quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $436 million or $3.58 per share compared with $426 million or $3.48 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and $341 million or $2.77 per share for last quarter. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $364 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with GAAP net income of $363 million or $2.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $317 million or $2.60 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements. 
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and third quarters of 2020 also included pretax gains of $4.7 million and $61.7 million on our investments in private entities, resulting from our purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains, net of tax, was $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.39 per share in the third quarter. These gains are excluded from our pro forma results. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.9 billion compared with $6.4 billion at September 30, 2020 and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash in the fourth quarter reflected cash from operations, a reduction in inventory and overall working capital and stock exercises. We repurchased $34 million of shares in the quarter with an average price of -- at an average price of $661.10 per share. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over our procedure performance."

Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was 6% compared to 19% growth during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7% growth last quarter. Our Q4 procedure growth was driven by 5% growth in the U.S. and 11% growth OUS. Resurgences of COVID in the U.S. and Europe impacted our growth rates in the quarter and we saw procedure growth rates decline as the quarter progressed, particularly late in the quarter. 
With respect to key contributors to growth, overall procedures in China and bariatrics in the U.S. were the largest drivers of procedure growth in Q4. In the U.S., within general surgery, bariatric, chole and hernia were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Bariatrics may be benefiting from certain patients prioritizing weight loss as obesity is a significant COVID risk factor. In addition, we continue to receive positive reviews of our short-form 60 stapler, which provides surgeons an optimized robotic tool set and feedback for bariatric procedures. 
In China, procedure growth accelerated as new systems installed under the quota began to provide additional capacity for incremental growth. Q4 China procedures had broad-based growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology. With respect to our more mature procedure categories in the U.S., Q4 gynecology procedure growth was up, reflecting growth in cancer procedures, partially offset by declines in benign procedures. On a worldwide basis, dVP procedures in the fourth quarter declined year-over-year and had similar trends as we described last quarter. COVID is impacting the diagnostic and patient pipeline related to dVP. 
Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. Dr. Clark A. Wilson and Jihad Kaouk from the Cleveland clinic and colleagues in a paper published in neurology described their experience evaluating robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with da Vinci SP through an extraperitoneal approach and enhanced recovery protocol for same-day surgery. 60 subjects with organ confined disease underwent an SP procedure with no patients requiring conversion to another approach. Median length of stay for all patients was 4.2 hours. 75% of all patients enrolled were discharged on the day of surgery and 96% of patients discharged within 24 hours, when excluding those either with surgery after 6:00 p.m or with preplanned admissions due to patient preference or significant comorbidities. The authors concluded a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with the da Vinci SP system and extraperitoneal approach can be performed safely and reproducibly as the same-day surgery. 
This publication adds to the number of early studies around the emerging SP technology, demonstrating encouraging results within robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy as a same-day surgery and acceptable, very operative, functional and short-term oncological outcomes in the hands of experienced surgeons for the appropriate patients. We look forward to the growth of the body of evidence around da Vinci SP. 
Lastly, we'd like to highlight that our second annual sustainability report will be available after the call on our Investor Relations website. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

Well, we're talking about what we shared with you in the talk at JPMorgan, most of that is programmatic analysis. And it's not so much something that we think is going to be revenue-generating directly. We think that it illuminates the value of our ecosystem and strong da Vinci programs, and that is a benefit to us. It increases the stick rate, it allows people to see in a verifiable way within their own data sets, the value they're bringing. It gives them action plans to find opportunity for standardization and other kinds of efficiency improvements, so it's of high-value to the customer and high-value to us. Some of the other things that we've shared with you, for example, Iris, those things are something that we'll collect revenue for. They probably won't become huge revenue arms in and of themselves, but they bring value on a per case basis, and it's something that we can talk to the customer about in terms of value creation there. They also strengthen the ecosystem. 
So I think for shareholders who are asking the question, hey, one is informatics and machine learning create a revenue arm of its own. I'm not sure that's the right question. I think that analytics and informatics power the ecosystem as a whole. We're pretty agnostic as to how we get paid for that. If we get paid for that through increased utilization, wonderful. That works great. We look at the cost to develop those programs and kind of overall their contribution to our financial health. But we don't have to charge for them individually if that's not how a customer wants to pay for it. 
Let me turn it to you, Marshall, and any color you want to add."

But I got to tell you, the point of my -- the reason I pointed this all out in terms of the increases in expenses that we were able -- this year, we saw a long period where COVID impacted us. And we -- some of the variable expenses I outlined came in pretty low relative to what they historically had been. And those will increase as COVID goes away. But in addition to that, there are other expenses that we will continue to spend. The increase -- there will be increases regardless of what happens to COVID. I think we want to continue to invest in the R&D areas that I mentioned. And we want to -- because we see that there's a real opportunity to continue to expand our marketplace and to expand penetration in the long term, and so we're going to increase those costs. I know I haven't given you what you're looking for, but it's just a very difficult environment to predict revenue and procedures at this point."

So I think you said that other companies are saying that Q1 could be worse, it could be. But again, we're not going to try to predict exactly where it's going to come out, given the uncertainties around it. But it's clear coming into the quarter, it was at the bottom end of what was going on in Q4. 
As far as extended use instruments go, we launched it in the U.S. in -- at the beginning of the quarter and in Europe in the middle of the quarter, about 3/4 of our customers are now acquiring extended use instruments. They're starting to be used on procedures. It's really hard for us to predict exactly when we'll start to see the benefits of those extended use instruments in terms of elasticity and price elasticity, and it's certainly going to be confounded by COVID. So I think it will take time. I think it's going to take a while before we start to see that. Sometimes you have to point out the benefits to the hospital. You have to sell it a little bit.

There's a d",507,"Bob, on the first one, the U.S., I won't predict for you, but let's talk about the puts and the takes, the things that are going to be the push-pull about it. Clearly, hospitals want to get back to treating patients who are non-COVID patients. There's a demand and the desire to do that. It takes a couple of things. One is that resources get freed up from treating COVID patients to allow them to treat other things, and some of that is ICU resources and a lot of it is staff. So as COVID surges go, so it does access to that set of resources. You're tracking and analysis is as good as ours in terms of looking at how well the vaccine is going to go out and what the COVID numbers might be. So I think that's a large part of it. 
In terms of the diagnostic pipelines, kind of the same thing. I think everybody wants to get patients back in to get diagnosed. There's -- we think a backlog that's been building for surgical patients as the search happens. And then you have this longer backlog of folks who have been forgoing normal checkups, whether it's colonoscopies or PSA screening or what have you, that will start coming back in. And of course, disease doesn't take a holiday. And as a result, those things will be more advanced when they're caught. We've seen this before. We've been in this movie when we saw changes to PSA testing recommendations. That will again create a backlog, but it will take longer for it to realize and longer for it to process through. I don't think it's going to drive substantive share shifts between treatment modalities. I think it's going to be hard on patients as they go through that. And that will provide a headwind for us in -- certainly, in 2021 and then tailwinds thereafter as those folks are diagnosed and come back into the pipe. So that's kind of where I see the U.S. 
Moving to China. Long term, we're quite excited. Pretty clearly, Chinese patients are interested in high quality care. Chinese surgeons are quite interested in robotics and in da Vinci and our partnership with Fosun and the joint venture is going well for us. So in the near term, that feels great. And I think there's a lot of strong underlying. As we've talked about before, the medical marketplace in China is complicated. Right now, systems are under quota, centrally managed quota. We see changes occurring in the Chinese regulatory environment over time as the FDA implements new policies and processes and we see that there are Chinese companies that are interested in this opportunity are pushing hard to field competitive systems. So we are committed long-term to China. I think it's going to be a strong demand market and a bouncy, sometimes turbulent marketplace due to policy changes and some of the central controls that are in place. We'll keep you updated as we get more clarity there."

If your clinical trial sites are having to manage COVID as well as whatever your clinical trial is, that can put pressure on you. That's kind of a near term thing. I think longer term, the question of what does this do if clinical trial requirements and general data requirements in the U.S. and Europe for computer-aided systems and robotics have become greater, what does that imply? And it probably implies a couple of things. One is that systems in the market are likely to stay in the market a little longer because it's just extended time lines for innovation. I think the other thing is that it probably resequences when you see different products where in the world because some health care systems, Korea being notable, are allowing innovative products into their systems a little more quickly and other ones are becoming a little less. So for a company like us, you'll see increased investment in headcount and in resources for clinical and regulatory staff, and you'll see a reordering of where we go with new innovations over time.

But yes, Asia-Pac is absolutely on our mind, and we'd like to get them out to our direct markets in Asia as soon as possible. 
As far as the impact on elasticity, we did 2 things in the United States, if you recall. We modified the -- we obviously launched extended use instruments, which lower the cost of care for hospitals. But we also -- simultaneous with that, lowered the price of a few select instruments that are used typically in lower benign, lower acuity procedure or benign lower acuity procedures like cholecystectomy, benign hysterectomies and inguinal hernias. And then in totality, then the use that -- if you look at an instrument, set that might be used in cholecystectomies, then the cost is competitive with other minimally invasive approaches. 
In each country, we have modified the pricing differently and we're targeting those procedures that are pressured by reimbursement. So you can't kind of paint or butter spread the comment of what elasticity will do in the United States will happen in the other countries. But we are targeting specified procedures in each of those countries where reimbursement is stressed, and we believe we provide value. And we'll see.

Just on the -- just speaking to the international side, the first thing I'd remind everybody is it's not really a robot versus robot question for customers. It's really a robotically-enabled ecosystem that drives outcomes versus a robotically-enabled ecosystem that drives different outcomes. That is -- it's programmatic versus programmatic. So in each of these, when they come out, you kind of look at it and say, ""Okay, what's the robot capable of? Do they have the instruments and the accessories, the imaging systems, the advanced tools that are required, some of those software and analytic capabilities, training capabilities and so on."" And you see a pretty different skill set and capability out of each of these ecosystems. And that's true as well for some of the bigger competitors that are domestic. So that's how we think about it. And I think that's how customers, by and large, will think about it. There will always be some customers who are interested in trialing and seeing what's capable out of something new, so I'd expect that. 
Nothing architecturally that I've seen of any of them, including the most recent announcements, has surprised me. I think we've seen a lot of these ideas. We've trialed personally a lot of them inside the company. And so I think time will tell. We have made the trade-offs we've made for a reason based on evaluation, building product and kind of scientific method. And I think that customers will evaluate those trade-offs over time. We've also seen the idea that some of the bigger players want to bundle, that they're going to put all these things together, maybe lower the price of capital and try to throw some other things in to see if they can entice folks. And I think the way I'd ask customers and shareholders to think about it is bundling makes sense if the underlying products are commodities, if everybody is selling 2 ply toilet paper and one brand is not that different than the other, it's all fine. But that's not where we are. Robotic systems and the instrumentation and the imaging systems are not commoditized. And as a result, there'll be strong differences and how they're used and what the outcomes are. And in that regard, I think that's what we'll point our customers to and our sales force to understand as these different things come up."

I think the thing I would point to that, I think, is kind of a economics question for everybody is just going to be something to look at is they will make their estimates as to how fast folks will return and whether they want to accelerate, so that they have capacity available for dealing with the backlog. I think that will differ by hospital groups. So some folks will have the capital capacity to lean in and see this as an opportunity to deepen their exposure or their presence in market. Others will feel conservative, and we'll want to wait and see so I do not think it's going to be a one size fits all in terms of how they do their financial planning. 
That was our last question. So I'll conclude from here. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim, better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. 
Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking to you again in 3 months."

Our fourth quarter capped a year in which the pandemic challenged our customers and our business. It highlighted some core strengths for the company, introduced some obstacles to overcome and triggered some changes for us.",1464,"Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter capped a year in which the pandemic challenged our customers and our business. It highlighted some core strengths for the company, introduced some obstacles to overcome and triggered some changes for us.
To put the year and quarter in context, let me first review some of the numbers. Procedures grew 6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 1% for the full year over 2019, resulting in approximately 1.25 million procedures in 2020. We placed 326 systems in the quarter, down from 336 systems in Q4 of 2019. For the full year, we placed 936 systems in 2020, down from 1,119 systems in 2019. Finally, revenue fell 3% in 2020 as the result of delays in surgical procedures as hospitals focused on treating COVID patients.
Digging a little deeper, our core business remains healthy. After the first surge of COVID abated during this past summer, our customers returned to more routine use of our systems and solutions. We believe that the Intuitive ecosystem enabled increased access to and practice of high-quality minimally invasive surgery, which may have helped hospitals conserve valuable intensive care resources during the pandemic.
Despite pressure on utilization of our systems due to COVID, our hospital customers continue to invest in building their Intuitive's robotics programs with additional systems, evidenced by a 7% increase in the clinical installed base in 2020. We saw committed customers strengthening their programs, likely due to their analysis of how well the Intuitive ecosystem satisfied their quadruple aim objectives, better outcomes, better care team experiences, better patient experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. Lastly, we believe our investments in our analytics programs have helped customers routinely analyze their performance, supporting their programmatic insights in the year.
Our confidence in our core business and our long-term opportunity remains robust. In spite of near term uncertainty, which is as follows: first, the pandemic is resurgent in many regions, powered now by more contagious variants. While hospitals have better protocols to manage patients today than they did earlier in 2020, our weekly surgical data in December 2020 and continuing today shows another clamp down on surgeries.
Furthermore, we believe diagnostic procedures are slowing in hard-hit regions. With diagnostic procedures running significantly below pre-pandemic levels, patients and hospitals will acutely feel the impact through disease progression and the more complex therapies necessary when patients do return for care. This delay in diagnostic pipelines will likely take several quarters to resolve, even after the threat of COVID begins to abate.
Second, we know that future of new capital installs are highly sensitive to utilization rates. Delayed surgeries will also impact the growth of surgical departments, pressuring new system installs until excess capacity is consumed. Third, in countries where the government pays the health care bill, budget strain and economic fallout from COVID may impact health care spending in new and variable ways in different countries.
Lastly, the trend that started prior to the pandemic for increased data requirements and longer clearance time lines from regulators in the United States and Europe for our industry has continued this year. Taken together, these obstacles make predictions for the next several quarters difficult.
As I mentioned earlier, 2020 has broadly eliminated some longer-term trends in health care that validate our thesis. The increased pressure on health care systems to conserve acute care resources for the sickest patients may have accelerated investments that enable patients to get the care they need with fast recovery, minimizing consumption of scarce hospital resources and reducing complications. The compounding value of analyzing real-time data and offline health care data to drive insights, to drive better care has become obvious this year. Lastly, we saw an acceleration of remote technology used to enable proctoring, learning and analysis.
I've heard it said that in good times, we develop ourselves to become who we want to be while hard times reveal who we really are. In the year, we set our priorities based on our values. We implemented community relief and customer relief, launched our extended use instruments program, mobilized local and remote training resources to support customers differently and continued to listen carefully to our customers to best understand their needs. We've seen positive customer response to this approach, which is reflected in our Net Promoter Score. You can find more information on these scores in our JPMorgan Healthcare Conference presentation from this month posted on our website.
Over the past several years, we've been building our capabilities in different countries to better serve their health care systems. I'd like to take a moment to take you through how we performed outside the United States in the year.
Turning first to Asia. Our business in Japan is moving beyond urology, given reimbursements for a broad slate of procedures obtained in Japan in 2018 and 2020. Government hospitals in Japan have been conserving resources for COVID care, and the pandemic has introduced noticeable delays as the health care system reacts to outbreaks.
In Korea, our business continues to be dynamic with an innovation-oriented customer group adopting new products like our da Vinci SP. In China, we saw accelerated customer acceptance of our partnership with Fosun Pharma and our products, with growth in procedures and the business overall outpacing our pre-pandemic plans. In 2020, China emerged as our #2 procedure market.
Turning to Europe. Our team in Germany has had success in engaging larger German hospital groups with increased system placements broadening our market access. Constraints on elective surgery have been implemented assertively in Germany in light of COVID.
In Germany, France, U.K., Italy and the Nordics, our goals have been to broaden da Vinci use beyond Urology. Progress therein has been hampered significantly by COVID. Lastly, we see relatively low public sector reimbursements in Europe for benign procedures. Innovations from Intuitive like da Vinci S and our extended use instruments are providing an option for more price-sensitive customers in these markets.
With regard to our innovation and product engines, we spent time walking through our progress at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference this month and our presentation is available online at our website, intuitive.com. I'd recommend to the interested listener a review of those materials for greater insight into our progress.
Summarizing briefly here, we're making good progress in advancing many elements of our ecosystem, including our advanced instruments, deepening our imaging and informatics programs, including our augmented reality program, Iris, and extending the launches of our new platforms. We grew the installed base in procedures for our single-port platform, da Vinci SP. We're focused on advancing clinical indications for SP in several regions as well as extending its instrument and accessory portfolio.
For our flexible robotics platform, Ion, we saw strong clinical results and demand in the year but met manufacturing and supply performance challenges in the fourth quarter as catheter demand outpaced our forecasting models, and the need for important quality improvement implementations and COVID quarantines hampered our production. We are currently shipping Ion product and expect to meet the demand curve in the first half of 2021.
Before Marshall takes you through our finances in detail, I'd like to touch on our financial strategy. Our operating model withstood the strains of 2020 well, starting with our decision several years ago to shift to greater flexibility in system placement models, the incorporation of sales, leasing and risk-shared models allowed us to meet customers' needs during a disruptive time.
Our investments in advanced instruments, including stapling and energy have been fruitful with growing revenues, improving margins and growing customer appreciation for advanced instruments. We've been investing capital in our manufacturing methods to increase quality and lower our costs, which in turn has allowed us to extend savings to our customers to allow them greater flexibility and deploying our products in more cost-sensitive environments. This has triggered a virtuous cycle that allows us greater volume, which in turn gives us greater ability to invest in higher volume processes. We'll continue to invest in this cycle going forward.
We believe we are still in the early innings of a long opportunity to substantially improve the quadruple aim in acute medical interventions using robotics, computing, advanced imaging and informatics. As a result, we continue to invest in our innovation engines to create and pursue these opportunities.
In closing, our priorities for 2021 are as follows: first, we'll support our customers' recovery of surgery during and post-pandemic; second, we'll focus on outstanding regional performance; third, we'll advance our priority programs and launches, SP, Ion, imaging and analytics, including new indications; and finally, continued expansion of clinical, economic and analytical evidence base for key procedures and countries.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail."

I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.",2056,"Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Revenue and procedures are consistent with our preliminary press release of January 13.
Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows: fourth quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased approximately 10% compared with last quarter. Fourth quarter system placements of 326 systems decreased 3% compared with 336 systems last year and increased 67% compared with 195 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci Systems over last year by 7% to approximately 5,989 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% in the last quarter and 12% last year.
Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, declined approximately 2% compared with last year and increased 8% compared with last quarter. The impact of COVID on da Vinci procedures vary by region. Resurgence of COVID in parts of Europe had significant impacts on procedures, including in Italy, U.K., Nordics and France. While the impact of COVID on procedures in the Asia Pacific region, including China, Japan and Korea, was far less significant.
In the U.S., fourth quarter procedure growth was impacted by the COVID resurgence, resulting in 5% year-over-year growth compared to 7% growth in the third quarter. The resurgence in U.S. and Europe was more acute and had a greater impact on procedures late in the quarter, a trend that continued into January.
The impact of a resurgence can be significant. For example, in California, the fourth quarter COVID resurgence turned a year-over-year da Vinci procedure growth in October of 8% to a year-over-year decline of 6% in December.
We also believe that reduced diagnosis reflecting patient concern over COVID exposure has impacted certain procedures globally. This has had its most pronounced effect on prostatectomies.
Despite the fact that hospitals are better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared to the outset of the pandemic, COVID-19 resurgences like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and the U.S. have challenged hospital care capabilities and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions will also continue to negatively impact da Vinci procedures.
Uncertainties in this COVID environment are not predictable, and the vaccine rollout and its impact on controlling COVID spread is also not predictable. Given these uncertainties, we are not providing procedure guidance at this time. Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call.
Fourth quarter capital placements exceeded our expectations, reflecting several factors. In certain cases, hospitals exhausted 2020 budgets and spend capacities. And in some cases, hospitals purchased systems in preparation for post-pandemic environment. We also experienced a higher level of trade-ins of SI systems for fourth generation systems, reflecting hospital desire to standardize fleet and to avail themselves to fourth generation technology of lower cost extended use instruments.
Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue headwinds. Utilization declined 2% year-over-year, resulting in excess system capacity at hospitals. We expect customers to fill existing system capacity before purchasing additional capital. Some of the fourth quarter capital placements reflected hospitals exhausting 2020 budgets. As budgets reset for 2021, hospitals could reduce their capital spend, particularly as COVID strains hospital profitability.
We expect leasing to continue to increase as a percentage of overall placements. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could also impact hospital capital spending. And as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures.
Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: total fourth quarter revenue was $1.329 billion, representing a 4% increase from last year and a 23% increase from last quarter. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from U.S. customer stocking of extended use instruments and higher-than-expected system placements.
Leasing represented 37% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last quarter. Fourth quarter placements included some larger IDN transactions where the IDN prefers purchase transactions. Excluding those transactions, leasing as a percentage of total placements would have been several percentage points higher. In an environment of COVID-19 as economic pressures increase, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates.
Approximately half of the systems placed in the fourth quarter involve trade-ins, which is higher than the 40% last quarter and higher than the average over the last couple of years. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict.
Fourth quarter average selling prices declined to $1.43 million from $1.61 million last year and $1.55 million in the third quarter. The decrease relative to last year reflects a lower mix of systems placed in China and Japan and a higher proportion of trade transactions. The decrease relative to last quarter reflects a higher proportion of trade-in transactions and a higher mix of indirect market placements.
We recognized $14 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $34 million last year. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so.
Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure increased to approximately $2,060 per procedure compared with $1,910 per procedure in the third quarter of 2020 and $1,980 realized in the fourth quarter of last year.
The entirety of the increase compared to the third quarter reflects U.S. hospital stocking extended use instruments. We launched extended use instruments early in the quarter in the U.S. and mid-quarter in Europe. We will launch extended use instruments in other markets in 2021 and 2022, depending on regulatory requirements.
Going forward, we expect customers to adjust their instrument buying patterns and reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument. In addition, extended use instruments and lower instrument pricing will result in lower I&A revenue per procedure to Intuitive.
The impact and timing of customer buying patterns and lower per-use revenue will likely begin to impact revenues in the first quarter but will depend on customer inventory practices and procedure volumes. While we expect price elasticity associated with extended use instruments to enable greater penetration into available markets, that benefit will be delayed by COVID and, otherwise, will take time.
12 of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were SP systems, reflecting continued measured rollout of SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our installed base of SP systems is now 69: 8 in Korea and 61 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP surgical system will continue to be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users, while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We expect to initiate first cases associated with a U.S. colorectal clinical trial this quarter.
We placed 4 Ion systems in the quarter, beginning -- bringing the installed base to 36 systems. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. Ion system placements were affected by supply chain issues described by Gary earlier in the call. We expect to remediate these supply issues in the first half of 2021. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Procedures under the PRECISE study are expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021.
Outside the U.S., we placed 130 systems in the fourth quarter compared with 140 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 79 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe, 22 into Japan and 13 into China compared with 54 into Europe, 26 into Japan and 39 into China in the fourth quarter of 2019. System placements into China in the fourth quarter of 2019 were higher as hospitals accelerated tenders in anticipation of the possibility of higher tariffs.
Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 69.7% compared with 72.2% for the fourth quarter 2019 and 70.2% last quarter. The fourth quarter of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The decrease relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 reflects higher period costs associated with lower production, higher excess and obsolete inventory charges and lower system ASPs.
As revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels, which may result in higher labor costs and under-absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. In addition, product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and could cause fluctuations in gross margins.
Pro forma operating expenses decreased 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased 11% compared with the third quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2020 includes a $25 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation compared with a $5 million contribution in the fourth quarter of 2019 and no contribution last quarter.
Fourth quarter operating expenses continued to reflect reduced spending on activities directly impacted by COVID-19, including marketing events, travel and in-person training as well as lower variable compensation. These costs will naturally increase as the impact of COVID declines.
We continue to believe we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer-aided surgery and acute interventions around the world, and we'll continue to invest in the business for the long term. During this period of COVID, we continue to invest in product development activities, including informatics, advanced imaging, advanced instruments and our Ion and SP platforms. Accordingly, you should expect the growth rate of R&D expenses in 2021 to significantly exceed the 2020 growth rate. We expect the growth rate of SG&A expenses to also increase significantly in 2021 compared to 2020.
SG&A spending can be categorized as follows: investments in OUS markets will increase over 2020 spend as we expand our capabilities and investment in clinical data. Variable compensation will increase over 2020 as we reset goals and targets. Core spending on resources and infrastructure will increase over 2020 to prepare for a post-COVID environment. Spend on activities impacted by COVID like travel, marketing events and in-person training will increase as the impact of COVID declines.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.7% compared with our expectations of 20% to 21%, primarily reflecting the geographic mix of income. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items. Our fourth quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $436 million or $3.58 per share compared with $426 million or $3.48 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and $341 million or $2.77 per share for last quarter.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $364 million or $3.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with GAAP net income of $363 million or $2.99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $317 million or $2.60 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlements.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and third quarters of 2020 also included pretax gains of $4.7 million and $61.7 million on our investments in private entities, resulting from our purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains net of tax was $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.39 per share in the third quarter. These gains are excluded from our pro forma results.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $6.9 billion compared with $6.4 billion at September 30, 2020 and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash in the fourth quarter reflected cash from operations, a reduction in inventory and overall working capital and stock exercises. We repurchased $34 million of shares in the quarter with an average price of -- at an average price of $661.10 per share.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over our procedure performance."

Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was 6% compared to 19% growth during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7% growth last quarter. Our Q4 procedure growth was driven by 5% growth in the U.S. and 11% growth OUS. Resurgences of COVID in the U.S. and Europe impacted our growth rates in the quarter, and we saw procedure growth rates decline as the quarter progressed, particularly late in the quarter.
With respect to key contributors to growth, overall procedures in China and bariatrics in the U.S. were the largest drivers of procedure growth in Q4. In the U.S., within General Surgery, bariatric, cole and hernia were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Bariatrics may be benefiting from certain patients prioritizing weight loss as obesity is a significant COVID risk factor. In addition, we continue to receive positive reviews of our short-form 60 stapler, which provides surgeons an optimized robotic toolset and feedback for bariatric procedures.
In China, procedure growth accelerated as new systems installed under the quota began to provide additional capacity for incremental growth. Q4 China procedures had broad-based growth in urology, thoracic, general surgery and gynecology.
With respect to our more mature procedure categories in the U.S., Q4 gynecology procedure growth was up, reflecting growth in cancer procedures, partially offset by declines in benign procedures. On a worldwide basis, dVP procedures in the fourth quarter declined year-over-year and had similar trends as we described last quarter. COVID is impacting the diagnostic and patient pipeline related to dVP.
Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.
Dr. Clark A. Wilson and Jihad Kaouk from the Cleveland Clinic and colleagues in a paper published in neurology described their experience evaluating robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with da Vinci SP through an extraperitoneal approach and enhanced recovery protocol for same-day surgery. 60 subjects with organ-confined disease underwent an SP procedure with no patients requiring conversion to another approach.
Median length of stay for all patients was 4.2 hours. 75% of all patients enrolled were discharged on the day of surgery and 96% of patients discharged within 24 hours, when excluding those either with surgery after 6:00 p.m or with preplanned admissions due to patient preference or significant comorbidities.
The authors concluded a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with the da Vinci SP system and extraperitoneal approach can be performed safely and reproducibly as the same-day surgery. This publication adds to the number of early studies around the emerging SP technology, demonstrating encouraging results within robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy as a same-day surgery and acceptable, very operative, functional and short-term oncological outcomes in the hands of experienced surgeons for the appropriate patients. We look forward to the growth of the body of evidence around da Vinci SP.
Lastly, we'd like to highlight that our second annual sustainability report will be available after the call on our Investor Relations website.
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

Having said that, if you look at where we were winning relative to other priorities, even if there is some budget pull forward, large customers were -- that already had robotics programs were expressing confidence with us, which we think is a positive.
The caution we're sending you now in this call is just that, over time, there'll be an equilibration, which is there is some excess capacity in the field because COVID is suppressing procedures.
And at some point, COVID will lift and that capacity will be absorbed. Some folks will invest ahead, getting ready and being able to work on backlog and others will be conservative and wait till they consume that capacity. Forecasting that is hard. And so that's how we're trying to help you navigate through this.

And it's not so much something that we think is going to be revenue-generating directly. We think that it illuminates the value of our ecosystem and strong da Vinci programs, and that is a benefit to us.
It increases the stick rate. It allows people to see in a verifiable way within their own data sets, the value they're bringing. It gives them action plans to find opportunity for standardization and other kinds of efficiency improvements, so it's of high value to the customer and high value to us.
Some of the other things that we've shared with you, for example, Iris, those things are something that we'll collect revenue for. They probably won't become huge revenue arms in and of themselves, but they bring value on a per-case basis, and it's something that we can talk to the customer about in terms of value creation there. They also strengthen the ecosystem.
So I think for shareholders who are asking the question, ""Hey, when does informatics and machine learning create a revenue arm of its own?"" I'm not sure that's the right question. I think that analytics and informatics power the ecosystem as a whole. We're pretty agnostic as to how we get paid for that. If we get paid for that through increased utilization, wonderful. That works great. We look at the cost to develop those programs and kind of overall their contribution to our financial health. But we don't have to charge for them individually if that's not how a customer wants to pay for it.

But I got to tell you, the point of my -- the reason I pointed this all out in terms of the increases in expenses that we were able -- this year, we saw a long period where COVID impacted us. And we -- some of the variable expenses I outlined came in pretty low relative to what they historically had been. And those will increase as COVID goes away.
But in addition to that, there are other expenses that we will continue to spend. The increase -- there will be increases regardless of what happens to COVID. I think we want to continue to invest in the R&D areas that I mentioned. And we want to -- because we see that there's a real opportunity to continue to expand our marketplace and to expand penetration in the long term. And so we're going to increase those costs. I know I haven't given you what you're looking for, but it's just a very difficult environment to predict revenue and procedures at this point."

I just wonder if you could sort of comment on sort of what you're seeing from the procedure environment here in the first quarter?
And then just secondarily, on the extended use program, obviously, we saw kind of a  bolus on revenue per procedure this particular quarter as hospitals didn't change inventory patterns. Are you seeing any evidence? I know it's hard in COVID that it's driving higher demand, the extended use program driving higher demand. And when would you expect those revenue per procedure numbers to begin to reverse? Is that as early as the first quarter or probably more likely middle part of the year? Sorry for both questions."

I made the comment that as we went through the quarter, the resurgence became more acute and it had a greater impact on procedures. And so I gave you the California example of where you go from growth in October to reduction in December. That should be an indication of the level of sort of impact they can have.
And then I may -- I also made the comment that we saw the trends at the end of the quarter continue into January. So I think you said that other companies are saying that Q1 could be worse, it could be. But again, we're not going to try to predict exactly where it's going to come out, given the uncertainties around it. But it's clear coming into the quarter, it was at the bottom end of what was going on in Q4.
As far as extended use instruments go, we launched it in the U.S. in -- at the beginning of the quarter and in Europe in the middle of the quarter, about 3/4 of our customers are now acquiring extended use instruments. They're starting to be used on procedures. It's really hard for us to predict exactly when we'll start to see the benefits of those extended use instruments in terms of elasticity and -- price elasticity, and it's certainly going to be confounded by COVID.
So I think it will take time. I think it's going to take a while before we start to see that. Sometimes you have to point out the benefits to the hospital. You have to sell it a little bit. And I just think we'll be patient about it."

Clearly, hospitals want to get back to treating patients who are non-COVID patients. There's a demand and the desire to do that.
It takes a couple of things. One is that resources get freed up from treating COVID patients to allow them to treat other things, and some of that is ICU resources and a lot of it is staff. So as COVID surges go, so does access to that set of resources. You're tracking and analysis is as good as ours in terms of looking at how well the vaccine is going to go out and what the COVID numbers might be. So I think that's a large part of it.
In terms of the diagnostic pipelines, kind of the same thing. I think everybody wants to get patients back in to get diagnosed. There's -- we think a backlog that's been building for surgical patients as the surge happens. And then you have this longer backlog of folks who have been forgoing normal checkups, whether it's colonoscopies or PSA screening or what have you, that will start coming back in. And of course, disease doesn't take a holiday. And as a result, those things will be more advanced when they're caught.
We've seen this before. We've been in this movie when we saw changes to PSA testing recommendations. That will again create a backlog, but it will take longer for it to realize and longer for it to process through. I don't think it's going to drive substantive share shifts between treatment modalities. I think it's going to be hard on patients as they go through that. And that will provide a headwind for us in -- certainly, in 2021 and then tailwinds thereafter as those folks are diagnosed and come back into the pipe. So that's kind of where I see the U.S.
Moving to China. Long term, we're quite excited. Pretty clearly, Chinese patients are interested in high quality care. Chinese surgeons are quite interested in robotics and in da Vinci, and our partnership with Fosun and the joint venture is going well for us. So in the near term, that feels great. And I think there's a lot of strong underlying interest.
As we've talked about before, the medical marketplace in China is complicated. Right now, systems are under a quota, centrally managed quota. We see changes occurring in the Chinese regulatory environment over time as the FDA implements new policies and processes and we see that there are Chinese companies that are interested in this opportunity and are pushing hard to field competitive systems.
So we are committed long-term to China. I think it's going to be a strong demand market and a bouncy, sometimes turbulent marketplace due to policy changes and some of the central controls that are in place. We'll keep you updated as we get more clarity there."

So I think that has been a positive for us and something that we had, thankfully, made some investments prior to the pandemic.
The second part is, I think, that people are seeing changes in resource consumption, days in the hospital, ICU time, patient comforted being housed in hospitals in the pandemic has declined.

I think we're starting to see the contours of the regulation side in the U.S. stabilize. So it's stabilizing at a requirement level that's greater than it was in year's past, but I don't think it's continuously moving. That's been good.
I think the thing that's challenged some time lines for us and others is COVID. If your clinical trial sites are having to manage COVID as well as whatever your clinical trial is, that can put pressure on you. That's kind of a near-term thing.
I think longer term, the question of what does this do if clinical trial requirements and general data requirements in the U.S. and Europe for computer-aided systems and robotics have become greater, what does that imply? And it probably implies a couple of things. One is that systems in the market are likely to stay in the market a little longer because it's just extended time lines for innovation. I think the other thing is that it probably resequences when you see different products where in the world because some health care systems, Korea being notable, are allowing innovative products into their systems a little more quickly and other ones are becoming a little less so.
So for a company like us, you'll see increased investment in head count and in resources for clinical and regulatory staff, and you'll see a reordering of where we go with new innovations over time. You'll probably see for the industry, platforms sit a little longer, that probably benefits incumbents a little more than it does insurgents."

The rollout into other parts of the world will depend on the regulatory time lines. As you could imagine, in China, it will take a long time. In some of the other markets, it might be a little bit quicker. I don't have a complete road map of every country. But yes, Asia-Pac is absolutely on our mind, and we'd like to get them out to our direct markets in Asia as soon as possible.
As far as the impact on elasticity, we did 2 things in the United States, if you recall. We modified the -- we obviously launched extended use instruments, which lower the cost of care for hospitals. But we also, simultaneous with that, lowered the price of a few select instruments that are used typically in lower benign -- lower acuity procedure -- or benign lower acuity procedures like cholecystectomy, benign hysterectomies and inguinal hernias. And then in totality, then the use that -- if you look at an instrument, set that might be used in cholecystectomies, then the cost is competitive with other minimally invasive approaches.
In each country, we have modified the pricing differently, and we're targeting those procedures that are pressured by reimbursement. So you can't kind of peanut butter spread the comment of what elasticity will do in the United States, will happen in the other countries. But we are targeting specified procedures in each of those countries where reimbursement is stressed, and we believe we provide value. And we'll see. We believe that we'll create some elasticity in each country. It will just vary in terms of magnitude."

Just on the -- just speaking to the international side, the first thing I'd remind everybody is it's not really a robot-versus-robot question for customers. It's really a robotically-enabled ecosystem that drives outcomes versus a robotically-enabled ecosystem that drives different outcomes. That is -- it's programmatic versus programmatic.
So in each of these, when they come out, you kind of look at it and say, ""Okay, what's the robot capable of? Do they have instruments any accessories, the imaging systems, the advanced tools that are required, some of those software and analytic capabilities, training capabilities and so on?"" And you see a pretty different skill set and capability out of each of these ecosystems. And that's true as well for some of the bigger competitors that are domestic. So that's how we think about it. And I think that's how customers, by and large, will think about it. There will always be some customers who are interested in trialing and seeing what's capable out of something new, so I'd expect that.
Nothing architecturally that I've seen of any of them, including the most recent announcements, has surprised me. I think we've seen a lot of these ideas. We've trialed personally a lot of them inside the company. And so I think time will tell.
We have made the trade-offs we've made for a reason based on evaluation, building product and kind of scientific method. And I think that customers will evaluate those trade-offs over time.
We've also seen the idea that some of the bigger players want to bundle, that they're going to put all these things together, maybe lower the price of capital and try to throw some other things in and see if they can entice folks. And I think the way I'd ask customers and shareholders to think about it is bundling makes sense if the underlying products are commodities, if everybody is selling 2 ply toilet paper and one brand is not that different than the other, it's all fine. But that's not where we are.
Robotic systems and the instrumentation and the imaging systems are not commoditized. And as a result, there'll be strong differences in how they're used and what the outcomes are. And in that regard, I think that's what we'll point our customers to and our sales force to understand as these different things come out."

I think the thing I would point to that, I think, is kind of a economics question for everybody is just going to be something to look at is they will make their estimates as to how fast folks will return and whether they want to accelerate so that they have capacity available for dealing with the backlog. I think that will differ by hospital groups. So some folks will have the capital capacity to lean in and see this as an opportunity to deepen their exposure or their presence in market. Others will feel conservative, and we'll want to wait and see, so I do not think it's going to be a one size fits all in terms of how they do their financial planning.
That was our last question. So I'll conclude from here. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better and more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately, a lower total cost of care. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients in care teams, their needs and their environment.

In the quarter, we saw a healthy recovery of surgery and use of our products. Strong capital placements continued in Q1 2021, and utilization of installed systems increased through the quarter, indicating a need by our customers to return to surgery. 
We're in the early innings of commercialization of 2 new platforms for Intuitive while advancing digital enablement of our ecosystem. Our teams are making good progress in all 3 areas. Overall, we're seeing some pandemic recovery, but improvement has been uneven with significant regional variation. Our experience shows that our business rebounds as COVID drops. 
Starting with procedures. General surgery in the United States was a source of strength in the quarter, driven by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and other procedures. Bariatric surgery has been on a multi-quarter growth trajectory. The result of aligned development and commercial activity, starting with a capable system, using advanced instruments and combined with a focused commercial team. 
Ventral hernia surgery is recovering while inguinal hernia tracking behind aligned to hospital and patient prioritization. In the U.S., gynecology and urology returned to growth after pandemic-related declines. Growth in our second largest market, China, continued to be strong with multiple specialties contributing. 
Lastly, procedures that have long diagnostic journeys such as prostatectomy and thoracic surgery remain below historical levels. Philip will take you through procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call. 
On the capital side, new system placements continue to exceed our expectations with the United States, China, France and the U.K. standing out in the quarter. We know that new system placements are closely tied to anticipated procedure volumes and system utilization in mature markets. 
System utilization grew in the quarter on average with significant regional variance due to pandemic differences. Overall, capital strength indicates anticipation of future procedure opportunity by our customers. A significant number of systems were part of multisystem deals by hospitals and integrated delivery networks, supporting a theme in which customers who know robotic-assisted surgery well continue to invest with us. 
Lastly, the use of leasing and other alternative capital placement models ticked up again this quarter. Marshall will take you through capital placements in more detail later in the call. 
Surveying our business around the world, our business in China is growing quickly from a small base and we are pleased with the performance of our joint venture with Fosun Pharma. We believe there is significant long-term opportunity in China and remind you that it is currently a quota controlled market. 
We expect China to be dynamic and competitive in coming years, and we're investing in the market to bolster our place as a leading provider to the Chinese health care system. 
In Japan, growth remains healthy, though below pre pandemic levels. In Europe, our business in France and Germany have performed well, considering the pandemic. In the U.K., tightly controlled surgery resulted in procedure declines, but we've also seen an increased commitment to robotic-assisted surgery in the form of increased capital placements, anticipating a return of da Vinci surgery post pandemic. Italy and Spain are rapidly returning to growth after substantial pandemic impacts. 
Speaking to our finances in the quarter, procedures recovered nicely in Q1. System placements came in above plan and I&A revenue per procedure was above our expectations, together, driving 18% revenue growth over Q1 2020. 
The product gross margins were strong in the quarter, largely due to above-average system ASPs, lower-than-expected excess and obsolescence charges and higher volumes through our factories. Other spending was constrained in the quarter, driven by 3 factors. 
First, travel and associated costs did not recur at pre pandemic levels. This spend will increase as COVID wanes and our customers and our staff reach immunity. Second, COVID delayed some work in R&D, leading to some underspend in prototypes. We expect these programs to ramp up as COVID wanes and our labs and development programs recover efficiency. 
Third, we deferred some investments in infrastructure that were unnecessary during the pandemic. We think most of these factors will normalize over time, and we consider them onetime events related to the pandemic. We are still in the early stages of developing robotic-assisted surgery globally, and we will continue investing in R&D and our regional capabilities to realize these opportunities. 
As I mentioned at the start of the call, we're in the early phases of our commercialization efforts for new platforms, which we expect to play out over future quarters. Our single port surgery platform, da Vinci SP, we performed our first cases in the U.S. and Korea of an important accessory, or SP access port, which enables surgery close to the [indiscernible] and eases assistant surgeon access through the single incision. 
The access port is an important -- is important in the SP ecosystem, facilitating access and workflow and many procedures in which SP is used. We've had very strong customer feedback on the port to date. We are also increasing our investments to accelerate new indications in key countries. In the U.S., we have 2 clear indications for SP and expect to initiate cases as part of our colorectal IDE this quarter. 
We've seen strong interest in SP use in various specialties, and we're in the process of designing trials for additional indications, including thoracic surgery and other surgical disciplines. Overall, we've received robust customer feedback for SPUs under existing clearances. 
Turning to our flexible robotics platform, Ion, we installed 14 systems in the quarter. We are recovering from our supply backlog and our meeting demand for ion procedures at all our installed accounts while working to fill customer inventory stocking requests and our internal inventory goals, which we expect to complete around midyear. Our precise trial evaluating the ability to reach and diagnose suspicious pulmonary lesions is on track to finish enrollment by Q2 this year. Our eye on clinical performance is meeting our expectations and customer acceptance remains highly encouraging. 
In our digital ecosystem enablement, we broadened access to our mobile surgeon portal, the My Intuitive app, this April as part of our phased launch. My Intuitive is a mobile app that allows surgeons to manage their da Vinci experience, log into da Vinci systems and as their training and view their operative data from the form of this hand. 
Our Intuitive telepresence program supported 45% of all case observations in Q1 2021, up from less than 5% a year ago, a significant achievement accelerated by the pandemic, improving convenience for our customers and reducing costs for our team. 
Year-over-year surgical stimulation usage in the quarter grew roughly 46% over Q1 2020, validating the power of digital tools. Finally, our team made significant progress in automating customer-facing analytics as part of our robotics program consulting services, which allow our customers to analyze the relative performance of their da Vinci programs. Now we retain part of customer engagement in United States. 
In conclusion, we're seeing adjustments in the health care system that favor our offerings, increased depreciation of high-quality MIS in the current and post pandemic environment, increased openness to digital technologies, increased use of analytics to assess care and increasing sensitivity by health systems to total cost to treat. 
We have and will continue to position ourselves to perform well in this environment. I'll now turn the time over to Marshall to take you through our financial performance in greater detail."

I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted to our website. 
Key business metrics for the first quarter were as follows: first quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 16% compared with the first quarter of 2020. It was approximately the same as last quarter. On a day-adjusted basis, procedures grew 18% year-over-year. 
First quarter system placements of 298 systems increased 26% compared with 237 systems for the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 9% compared with the 326 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 8% to approximately 6,142 systems. 
This growth rate compares with 11% last year and 7% last quarter. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system increased approximately 8% compared with last year and decreased 2% compared with last quarter. 
The impact of COVID on da Vinci procedures varied by region. In the U.S., COVID resurgence affected procedures later in the fourth quarter continued well into January. Then as COVID has cited, procedures experienced a steady improvement through February and March. In Europe, the spread of COVID varied regionally and procedure growth rates were mixed with strength in France and a year-over-year decline in the U.K. 
While there have been covet hotspots within some of our Asia Pacific markets, they tended to be isolated, and in general, procedures performed well. China growth was far higher than other regions reflecting the severity of the COVID impact on China in the first quarter of last year and the additional system installations over the past year. 
Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. 
Despite the fact that hospitals are better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared with the outset of the pandemic, resurgences of COVID-19 and its variants, like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and the U.S. have challenged hospital care capabilities and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. 
In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions have continued to negatively impact da Vinci procedures. While there is a backlog of patients, it is unpredictable when those patients will ultimately seek diagnosis in treatment and whether they will be treated in surgery. 
Jamie will be providing procedure guidance later in this call. That guidance is based on our experience in the first quarter and the pace at which vaccines have been and are forecasted to be rolled out. Changes in the spread of COVID and its variance in the pace of vaccine rollouts could significantly impact our guidance. 
Moving on to capital placements. Placements in the quarter reflected procedure growth hospitals purchasing systems in preparation for a post pandemic environment and hospitals upgrading in order to access or standardize on fourth generation capabilities. First quarter capital placements exceeded our expectations. 
We believe that generally, COVID has had less of an impact on hospital capital spending capacity and that customers recognize that da Vinci surgery meets their quadruple aim objectives better than other surgical approaches. 
Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets to the extent that impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. Leasing and alternative financing arrangements have enabled customers access to capital. 
We believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. The trade in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline. 
Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending. And as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. Total first quarter revenue was $1.292 billion, representing an 18% increase from last year and a 3% decrease from last quarter. 
First quarter revenue growth reflected procedure growth and higher-than-expected system placements. Leasing represented 43% of current quarter placements compared with 32% last year and 37% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, given hospital [indiscernible]
We anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. At 44% of systems placed in the first quarter involved trade-ins, which is lower than the 57% last year and 49% last quarter. Trade in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. 
First quarter system average selling prices increased to $1.65 million from $1.44 million last year and $1.43 million in the fourth quarter. The increase relative to last year reflects a higher mix of systems placed in China and our direct markets relative to our indirect markets, a higher mix of dual console systems and a lower proportion of trade in transactions. 
The increase relative to last quarter reflects a higher mix of dual consoles and a lower proportion of trade-in transactions. We recognized $19 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $12 billion last year and $14 million last quarter. 
Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure for the first quarter of $1,950 decreased compared with $1,990 per procedure for the first quarter of last year. And $2,060 per procedure in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Extended use instruments were introduced in the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter. While we saw increased usage of extended use instruments in these markets, full adoption will occur over the next few quarters as customers burn off lower use product. In addition, we saw customers begin to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument. 
Increased usage of extended use instruments and customer buying patterns are the primary reasons for the decrease in instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in the first quarter relative to prior quarters. We expect this trend to continue over the next few quarters. While we expect price elasticity associated with extended use instruments to enable greater penetration into available markets, that benefit is delayed by COVID and otherwise will take time. 6% of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, reflecting a continued measured rollout of SP. 
Our installed base of SP Systems is now 75, 8 in Korea and 67 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP Surgical system continues to be measured putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We expect to initiate first cases associated with the U.S. colorectal trial in the next few months. 
We placed 14 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 50 systems. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The supply issues we called out last quarter had less of an impact on Ion placements and procedures this quarter. 
We expect to have resolved those supply issues this quarter. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Procedures under the precise study are expected to complete this quarter. Outside of the U.S., we placed 108 systems in the first quarter compared with 55 in the first quarter of 2020 and 130 systems last quarter. 
Current quarter system placements included 59 into Europe, 8 into Japan and 23 into China compared with 25 into Europe, 10 into Japan and 9 into China in the first quarter of 2020. 22 of the 59 systems placed in Europe this quarter were in the U.K. Placements in many markets like the U.K. can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter. While we are pleased with the performance of the U.K. team, we do not anticipate this level of placements in the U.K. in future quarters. 
Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 71.8% compared with 69.7% for both the first and fourth quarters of 2020. The first and fourth quarters of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production in higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. 
In addition, the first quarter of 2021 reflected leveraging fixed costs over higher production levels. Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. In addition, if revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels which may result in higher labor costs and under-absorbed overhead and reduced product margins. 
COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While we carry safety stocks of critical components and are otherwise working to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, global shortages could result in higher production costs or production delays. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 5% compared with the first quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2020 included a $25 million contribution to the Intuitive foundation, while there were no contributions in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. 
The increase compared to the prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount and increased variable compensation, partially offset by lower spending in areas impacted by COVID. First quarter spending was below our expectations for the reasons outlined by Gary in his opening remarks. 
Looking to the remainder of the year, we expect spending impacted by COVID-19, including clinical development, in person training, marketing events and travel costs to increase as COVID impacts decrease and spending deferred due to COVID and other timing matters to increase. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20%, meeting our expectations. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items. Our pro forma 2020 -- our first quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $427 million or $3.52 per share compared with $323 million or $2.69 per share for the first quarter of 2020 and $434 million or $3.58 per share for last quarter. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $426 million or $3.51 per share for the first quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $314 million or $2.62 per share for the first quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of $365 million or $3.02 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include or excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlement. 
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 also included pretax gains of $4.7 million and $14.3 million on our investments in private companies resulting from our purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains, net of tax, was $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.09 per share in the first quarter. These gains are excluded from our pro forma results. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.2 billion compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020. And the increase in cash in the first quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over procedure performance."
30239,710343543,2254108,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 16% year-over-year compared to 10% growth during the first quarter of 2020 and 6% growth last quarter. Our Q1 procedure growth was driven by 14% year-over-year growth in the U.S. and 23%",804,"Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 16% year-over-year compared to 10% growth during the first quarter of 2020 and 6% growth last quarter. Our Q1 procedure growth was driven by 14% year-over-year growth in the U.S. and 23% growth OUS. 
Procedures in the U.S. recovered steadily after January as COVID cases declined and the associated impact on hospital resources improved. In the U.S., within general surgery, bariatric, cholecystectomy and hernia were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Bariatrics growth remained strong with positive customer feedback on our advanced instrument portfolio. Cholecystectomy growth was driven by the continued expansion of robotic procedures by general surgeons throughout their total practice. Inguinal hernia growth trailed dental growth in the quarter. 
With respect to our more mature procedure categories in the U.S., Q1 gynecology procedures grew double digits the prior year growth comparison that was negative due to COVID. While DVP in the U.S. stabilized in Q1 from previous declines, it remains unclear when patients who have been impacted from delays in diagnosis and treatment will ultimately come back. 
In aggregate, on a worldwide basis, prostatectomy in the first quarter largely stabilized. More broadly, OUS procedure growth was driven by urology, earlier stage growth in general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures. With respect to OUS markets, China procedure growth was strong and benefited from the severe first quarter 2020 impact of COVID and an increase in the installed base over the past year. China had broad-based growth in all procedure categories. 
In Japan, procedure growth moderated somewhat due to restrictions associated with COVID. Procedure growth in South Korea was encouraging with SP utilization continuing to be above Xi. In Europe, France had a solid quarter with broad-based strength in a wide range of procedure categories. The U.K. remained challenged due to COVID. 
Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. 
A recent article by Dr. Mohamed A. [indiscernible] and David Larson, with colleagues from the Mayo clinic published in surgical endoscopy provided results from a real-world study aimed to analyze national trends of conversion during elective colectomies in addition to MIS utilization trends. Using the ACS national surgical quality improvement program database, elective laparoscopic or robotic-assisted colectomy between January 2013 and December 2018, a total of 66,652 patients were identified. 
Overall conversion rates from MIS to open were approximately 42% lower for robotic-assisted procedures when compared to laparoscopic procedures, 4.9% versus 8.5%. The rate was also lower for obese patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 36% versus 10.3%. The authors concluded, in part, ""This large-scale study identified a decreasing trend in conversion rates 6-year inclusion period, both overall and in patients with obesity, paralleling, increased utilization of the robotics platform. Given the potential negative impact of conversion on patient outcomes, individual institutions, so consider a review of their own conversion data as this may represent an opportunity for quality improvement."" 
In February of this year, Dr. Amir of the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle, Washington; and Dr. Robert Cleary of St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, published a real-world observational study, which compared the rates of long-term opioid prescriptions for patients who underwent minimally invasive and open collectomies. This study utilized the IBM Marketscan research database and analyzed 14,887 eligible patients who underwent a colon resection via the open laparoscopic or robotic-assisted approach between 2013 and 2017. 
In the 1:1 propensity score matched analysis comparing the MIS and open approaches with over 5,000 patients in each arm, the MIS approach has significantly lower incidence rate of long-term prescriptions of any opioids by approximately 36%, 13.3% versus 20.9%; schedule 2 and 3 opioids by approximately 39%, 11.7% versus 19.2%; and high dose opioids by approximately 44%, 4.3% versus 7.7% from 90 to 180 days postoperatively. 
Looking at the matched analysis between robotic-assisted surgery and laparoscopy with over 1,100 subjects in each group, the robotic-assisted approach demonstrated approximately 45% lower long-term prescription rates of high-dose opioids, 2.1% versus 3.8% when compared to the laparoscopic approach. Furthermore, in subgroup analysis, the robotic-assisted approach showed significantly lower rates of long-term prescriptions in any opioids, schedule 2 and 3 opioids and high dose opioids compared to the laparoscopic approach for subjects undergoing colectomy for nonmalignant conditions. 
The authors concluded in part, ""Choosing an MIS option in robotic-assisted surgery for some colorectal operations is a modifiable factor that may contribute to less long-term opioid use."" And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie, who will review our financial outlook."
30239,710343543,2254108,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. While there continues to be uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and given moderating coverage hospitalization trends and vaccination progress, particularly in the U.S., which accounted for approximately 70% of our 2020 pro",696,"Good afternoon. While there continues to be uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and given moderating coverage hospitalization trends and vaccination progress, particularly in the U.S., which accounted for approximately 70% of our 2020 procedures, we are reestablishing our financial guidance. 
In providing this guidance, we note that there are emerging supply constraints in our supply chain, for example, in the semiconductor industry. The outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to these supply constraints. 
Our financial outlook for 2021 is as follows: starting with procedures, total 2020 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 1% to roughly 1,243,000 procedures performed worldwide. For 2021 and we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 22% to 26%. We expect 2021 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside of the United States where we are at earlier stages of adoption. 
The high end of the range assumes the cove cases and the impact on da Vinci procedures to continue to decline throughout the year, the vaccine rollouts continue at the level currently expected by governments around the world and that recovery of patient backlog will progress. Modeling quarterly results is difficult given the impact that COVID had on 2020 procedures. Therefore, with respect to procedure seasonality, we expect similar quarterly patterns for 2019. 
With respect to capital, system placements are generally driven by procedure demand, prompting hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. System placement demand is also the result of customers standardizing our fourth generation technology through trade-ins. 
Sales can vary substantially from period-to-period based upon many factors, including government health care policies, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Within this framework, we'd expect 2021 capital placements generally be driven by procedures and the adequacy of existing capacity in the installed base. 
During the first quarter of 2021, 43% of systems shipped for under operating leases we expect that the proportion of systems placed under operating leases will vary from quarter-to-quarter and could continue to trend up in the future. 
Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2020 pro forma gross profit margin was 68.4%, reflecting the impact of fixed -- higher fixed overhead costs relative to revenue, higher excess and obsolete inventory charges, and the customer relief program that was implemented in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our full year 2019 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.7%. And in 2021, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade in mix, the impact of product cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and competitive pricing pressure. With respect to operating expenses, in 2019, our pro forma operating expenses grew 27%. 
And in 2020, given the impact of the pandemic, they grew 3%. And in 2021, we expect pro forma full year operating expense growth to be between 18% and 22%, reflecting increases in investments in our digital ecosystem, Ion, SP, OUS expansion, higher regulatory-related costs and infrastructure investments to allow us to scale. 
2021 spending also expected to be impacted by a return over the course of the year to higher rates of travel, increased customer training and a greater proportion of marketing events being held in person and by a variable compensation. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million to $470 million in 2021 compared to $396 million in 2020. We expect pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $45 million and $55 million in 2021, reflecting lower interest rates relative to 2020. 
With regard to income tax, in 2020, our pro forma income tax rate was 22.5%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2021 pro forma tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pretax income. Our 2021 outlook for the pro forma tax rate does not reflect any potential change in U.S. tax rates. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

I'll start with the low end of the procedure guidance. So we consider 3 factors in the low end. We see the possibility of extended impact of COVID in certain OUS geographies with slower vaccine rollouts and resurgences in some of those geographies. We see that in parts of Europe currently. Secondly, we embedded in the lower end of the procedure guidance, a slower recovery of diagnostic pipelines that have been impacted during the pandemic. And then the third item in the low end of the guidance, is the possibility of regionalized resurgence of COVID in the U.S. as we race towards the rollout of vaccines and ultimately, at some point, achieve herd immunity in the U.S. With respect to the backlog, the backlog accumulated really for 3 factors: lower diagnostic pipelines, deferred elective surgery as hospital systems getting in dated with COVID cases and patient reluctance to undergo surgery during COVID resurgences. These subcomponents, we think, get recovered over different periods of time. The backlog is actually constantly netting between increases and recovery. So the total accumulative backlog is difficult to predict. The rate of recovery is also difficult to predict, but we expect it to go through into 2022. And so the '21 procedure guidance that we provided reflects our best estimate of the range of the impact of backlog in the year."

The use case I was talking about there is the ability for people who are interested in observing a case by an expert to log in online, through a secure network, high-speed streaming and view that case on da Vinci accounts. And that's an important part of both knowledge transfer from those high-volume accounts as well as an introductory exposure for surgeons who are thinking about it. So that has been great. There are other use cases for streaming connections, video streaming connections into our products that along detail now. It's pretty neat. And so prior, we had started that. I was a believer or we, as a company, we're believers that those kinds of access, think of it as kind of surgical face time or surgical Skype over a distance that kind of access would be important to folks and the pandemic really accelerated it. And so we had the technology infrastructure in place. And as people started to be more open to the use of digital tools to do their learning and exposure and wanted to stay off the planes and out of cars, we saw it really accelerate.

I don't think it's exhausted the whole impact. I think if you go back to our previous script, you see that we said that had you implemented this in 2019, it would have affected total revenue by about $150 million to $170 million or about 7% of Ion per procedure, and we've only seen a part of that so far.

I would just say, I don't know if it's pent-up spending, but I would say that clearly, the hospitals had more capital spend than we had anticipated. And as a -- and what's really driving then their spending on da Vinci capital is procedure growth. Procedure growth is the #1 thing that drives capital. But also the trade-in cycle and the desire to access fourth generation product, including the extended use instruments we mentioned earlier. And then finally, I think that you also have them getting ready for post pandemic environment. And just a general recognition that da Vinci surgery meets their quadruple aim objectives, better than other approaches. 
All right. Well, thank you. Okay. Well, that was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients better experiences for their care teams, and ultimately, a lower total cost of care.

Our first quarter of 2021 was a step in the right direction. In the quarter, we saw a healthy recovery of surgery and use of our products. Strong capital placements continued in Q1 2021, and utilization of installed systems",1238,"Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter of 2021 was a step in the right direction. In the quarter, we saw a healthy recovery of surgery and use of our products. Strong capital placements continued in Q1 2021, and utilization of installed systems increased through the quarter, indicating a need by our customers to return to surgery.  We're in the early innings of commercialization of 2 new platforms for Intuitive while advancing digital enablement of our ecosystem. Our teams are making good progress in all 3 areas. 
Overall, we're seeing some pandemic recovery, but improvement has been uneven with significant regional variation. Our experience shows that our business rebounds as COVID drops.  
Starting with procedures. General surgery in the United States was a source of strength in the quarter, driven by bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and other procedures. Bariatric surgery has been on a multi-quarter growth trajectory, the result of aligned development and commercial activity, starting with a capable system, using advanced instruments and combined with a focused commercial team.  Ventral hernia surgery is recovering, with inguinal hernia tracking behind, aligned to hospital and patient prioritization.  
In the U.S., gynecology and urology returned to growth after pandemic-related declines. Growth in our second largest market, China, continued to be strong with multiple specialties contributing.  
Lastly, procedures that have long diagnostic journeys such as prostatectomy and thoracic surgery, remain below historical levels. Philip will take you through procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call.  
On the capital side, new system placements continue to exceed our expectations with the United States, China, France and the U.K. standing out in the quarter. We know that new system placements are closely tied to anticipated procedure volumes and system utilization in mature markets.  
System utilization grew in the quarter on average with significant regional variance due to pandemic differences. Overall, capital strength indicates anticipation of future procedure opportunity by our customers. A significant number of systems were part of multisystem deals by hospitals and integrated delivery networks, supporting a theme in which customers who know robotic-assisted surgery well continue to invest with us.  
Lastly, the use of leasing and other alternative capital placement models ticked up again this quarter. Marshall will take you through capital placements in more detail later in the call.  
Surveying our business around the world, our business in China is growing quickly from a small base, and we are pleased with the performance of our joint venture with Fosun Pharma. We believe there is significant long-term opportunity in China and remind you that it is currently a quota-controlled market.  We expect China to be dynamic and competitive in coming years, and we're investing in the market to bolster our place as a leading provider to the Chinese health care system.  
In Japan, growth remains healthy, though below pre-pandemic levels. In Europe, our business in France and Germany have performed well, considering the pandemic. In the U.K., tightly controlled surgery resulted in procedure declines, but we've also seen an increased commitment to robotic-assisted surgery in the form of increased capital placements, anticipating a return of da Vinci surgery post pandemic.  
Italy and Spain are rapidly returning to growth after substantial pandemic impacts.  
Speaking to our finances in the quarter, procedures recovered nicely in Q1. System placements came in above plan and I&A revenue per procedure was above our expectations, together, driving 18% revenue growth over Q1 2020. The product gross margins were strong in the quarter, largely due to above-average system ASPs, lower-than-expected excess and obsolescence charges and higher volumes through our factories. 
Other spending was constrained in the quarter, driven by 3 factors.  First, travel and associated costs did not recur at pre-pandemic levels. This spend will increase as COVID wanes and our customers and our staff reach immunity. 
Second, COVID delayed some work in R&D, leading to some underspend in prototypes. We expect these programs to ramp up as COVID wanes and our labs and development programs recover efficiency.  
Third, we deferred some investments in infrastructure that were unnecessary during the pandemic. We think most of these factors will normalize over time, and we consider them onetime events related to the pandemic. We are still in the early stages of developing robotic-assisted surgery globally, and we will continue investing in R&D and our regional capabilities to realize these opportunities.  
As I mentioned at the start of the call,  we are in the early phases of our commercialization efforts for new platforms, which we expect to play out over future quarters. Our single port surgery platform, da Vinci SP, we performed our first cases in the U.S. and Korea of an important accessory,  our SP access port, which enables surgery close to the [ body wall ] and eases assistant surgeon access through the single incision.  The access port is an important -- is important in the SP ecosystem, facilitating access and workflow in many procedures in which SP is used. We've had very strong customer feedback on the port to date. 
We are also increasing our investments to accelerate new indications in key countries. In the U.S., we have 2 cleared indications for SP and expect to initiate cases as part of our colorectal IDE this quarter.  We've seen strong interest in SP use in various specialties, and we're in the process of designing trials for additional indications, including thoracic surgery and other surgical disciplines. Overall, we've received robust customer feedback for SPUs under existing clearances.  
Turning to our flexible robotics platform, Ion, we installed 14 systems in the quarter. We are recovering from our supply backlog and are meeting demand for ion procedures at all our installed accounts while working to fill customer inventory stocking requests and our internal inventory goals, which we expect to complete around midyear. Our precise trial evaluating the ability to reach and diagnose suspicious pulmonary lesions is on track to finish enrollment by Q2 this year.  Our Ion clinical performance is meeting our expectations and customer acceptance remains highly encouraging.  
In our digital ecosystem enablement, we broadened access to our mobile surgeon portal, the My Intuitive app, this April as part of our phased launch. My Intuitive is a mobile app that allows surgeons to manage their da Vinci experience, log into da Vinci systems, manage their training and view their operative data from the palm of their hand.  
Our Intuitive telepresence program supported 45% of all case observations in Q1 2021, up from less than 5% a year ago, a significant achievement accelerated by the pandemic, improving convenience for our customers and reducing costs for our team. Year-over-year surgical stimulation usage in the quarter grew roughly 46% over Q1 2020, validating the power of digital tools. Finally, our team made significant progress in automating customer-facing analytics as part of our robotics program consulting services, which allow our customers to analyze the relative performance of their da Vinci programs. Now we retain part of customer engagement in the United States.  
In conclusion, we're seeing adjustments in the health care system that favor our offerings. Increased depreciation of high-quality MIS in the current and post-pandemic environment, increased openness to digital technologies, increased use of analytics to assess care and increasing sensitivity by health systems to total cost to treat.  
We have and will continue to position ourselves to perform well in this environment. I'll now turn the time over to Marshall to take you through our financial performance in greater detail."

I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted to our website.  
Key business metrics for the first quarter were as follows: 
First quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 16% compared with the first quarter of 2020, was approximately the same as last quarter. On a day-adjusted basis, procedures grew 18% year-over-year.  
First quarter system placements of 298 systems increased 26% compared with 237 systems for the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 9% compared with the 326 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 8% to approximately 6,142 systems.  This growth rate compares with 11% last year and 7% last quarter. 
Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system increased approximately 8% compared with last year and decreased 2% compared with last quarter.  
The impact of COVID on da Vinci procedures varied by region. In the U.S., COVID resurgence affected procedures later in the fourth quarter continued well into January. Then as COVID subsided, procedures experienced a steady improvement through February and March. In Europe, the spread of COVID varied regionally and procedure growth rates were mixed with strength in France and a year-over-year decline in the U.K.  
While there have been COVID hotspots within some of our Asia Pacific markets, they tended to be isolated, and in general, procedures performed well. China growth was far higher than other regions reflecting the severity of the COVID impact on China in the first quarter of last year and the additional system installations over the past year.  
Philip will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call.  
Despite the fact that hospitals are better equipped to handle COVID patients today compared with the outset of the pandemic, resurgences of COVID-19 and its variants, like those currently being experienced in parts of Europe and the U.S., have challenged hospital care capabilities and have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures.  In addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions have continued to negatively impact da Vinci procedures. While there is a backlog of patients, it is unpredictable when those patients will ultimately seek diagnosis in treatment and whether they will be treated in surgery.  
Jamie will be providing procedure guidance later in this call. That guidance is based on our experience in the first quarter and the pace at which vaccines have been and are forecasted to be rolled out. Changes in the spread of COVID and its variance in the pace of vaccine rollouts could significantly impact our guidance.  
Moving on to capital placements. Placements in the quarter reflected procedure growth, hospitals purchasing systems in preparation for a post-pandemic environment, and hospitals upgrading in order to access or standardize on fourth generation capabilities. First quarter capital placements exceeded our expectations.  We believe that generally, COVID has had less of an impact on hospital capital spending capacity and that customers recognize that da Vinci surgery meets their quadruple aim objectives better than other surgical approaches.  
Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics: Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets. To the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. 
Leasing and alternative financing arrangements have enabled customers access to capital.  We believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. 
The trade-in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline.  
Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending. And as we face competition in various markets, we may experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Total first quarter revenue was $1.292 billion, representing an 18% increase from last year and a 3% decrease from last quarter.  
First quarter revenue growth reflected procedure growth and higher-than-expected system placements. Leasing represented 43% of current quarter placements compared with 32% last year and 37% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, given hospital [indiscernible], we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 
44% of systems placed in the first quarter involved trade-ins, which is lower than the 57% last year and 49% last quarter. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict.  
First quarter system average selling prices increased to $1.65 million from $1.44 million last year and $1.43 million in the fourth quarter. The increase relative to last year reflects a higher mix of systems placed in China and our direct markets relative to our indirect markets, a higher mix of dual console systems and a lower proportion of trade-in transactions.  The increase relative to last quarter reflects a higher mix of dual consoles and a lower proportion of trade-in transactions. We recognized $19 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $12 million last year and $14 million last quarter.  Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. 
Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure for the first quarter of $1,950 decreased compared with $1,990 per procedure for the first quarter of last year and $2,060 per procedure in the fourth quarter of 2020.  
Extended use instruments were introduced in the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter. While we saw increased usage of extended use instruments in these markets, full adoption will occur over the next few quarters as customers burn off lower use product. In addition, we saw customers begin to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument.  
Increased usage of extended use instruments and customer buying patterns are the primary reasons for the decrease in instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in the first quarter relative to prior quarters. We expect this trend to continue over the next few quarters. While we expect price elasticity associated with extended use instruments to enable greater penetration into available markets, that benefit is delayed by COVID and otherwise will take time. 
6% of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, reflecting a continued measured rollout of SP.  Our installed base of SP systems is now 75; 8 in Korea and 67 in the U.S. Our rollout of the SP Surgical System continues to be measured putting systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users while we pursue additional indications and optimize training pathways in our supply chain. We expect to initiate first cases associated with the U.S. colorectal trial in the next few months.  
We placed 14 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 50 systems. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The supply issues we called out last quarter had less of an impact on Ion placements and procedures this quarter.  We expect to have resolved those supply issues this quarter. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. Procedures under the precise study are expected to complete this quarter. 
Outside of the U.S., we placed 108 systems in the first quarter compared with 55 in the first quarter of 2020 and 130 systems last quarter.  
Current quarter system placements included 59 into Europe, 8 into Japan and 23 into China compared with 25 into Europe, 10 into Japan and 9 into China in the first quarter of 2020. 22 of the 59 systems placed in Europe this quarter were in the U.K. Placements in many markets like the U.K. can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter.  While we are pleased with the performance of the U.K. team, we do not anticipate this level of placements in the U.K. in future quarters.  
Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 71.8% compared with 69.7% for both the first and fourth quarters of 2020. The first and fourth quarters of 2020 included higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges.  In addition, the first quarter of 2021 reflected leveraging fixed costs over higher production levels. 
Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. In addition, if revenues are pressured by COVID-19, production levels may operate at below normal levels which may result in higher labor costs and under-absorbed overhead and reduced product margins.
COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While we carry safety stocks of critical components and are otherwise working to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, global shortages could result in higher production costs or production delays.  
Pro forma operating expenses increased 5% compared with the first quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter of 2020 included a $25 million contribution to the Intuitive foundation, while there were no contributions in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020.  
The increase compared to the prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount and increased variable compensation, partially offset by lower spending in areas impacted by COVID. First quarter spending was below our expectations for the reasons outlined by Gary in his opening remarks.  
Looking to the remainder of the year, we expect spending impacted by COVID-19, including clinical development, in-person training, marketing events and travel costs to increase as COVID's impacts decrease and spending deferred due to COVID and other timing matters to increase. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call.  
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20%, meeting our expectations. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities, and with the impact of onetime items. Our pro forma 2020 -- our first quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $427 million or $3.52 per share compared with $323 million or $2.69 per share for the first quarter of 2020 and $434 million or $3.58 per share for last quarter.  
I will now summarize our GAAP results. 
GAAP net income was $426 million, or $3.51 per share for the first quarter of 2021, compared with GAAP net income of $314 million or $2.62 per share for the first quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of $365 million or $3.02 per share for last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include: excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal settlement.  
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 also included pretax gains of $4.7 million and $14.3 million on our investments in private companies resulting from our purchases of certain technologies. The EPS impact of these gains, net of tax, was $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.09 per share in the first quarter. These gains are excluded from our pro forma results. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.2 billion compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020. the increase in cash in the first quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Philip, who will go over procedure performance."

Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 16% year-over-year compared to 10% growth during the first quarter of 2020 and 6% growth last quarter.

Our overall first quarter procedure growth was 16% year-over-year compared to 10% growth during the first quarter of 2020 and 6% growth last quarter. Our Q1 procedure growth was driven by 14% year-over-year growth in the U.S. and 23% growth OUS. 
Procedures in the U.S. recovered steadily after January as COVID cases declined and the associated impact on hospital resources improved. In the U.S., within general surgery, bariatric, cholecystectomy and hernia were the largest contributors to procedure growth within the quarter. Bariatrics growth remained strong with positive customer feedback on our advanced instrument portfolio. Cholecystectomy growth was driven by the continued expansion of robotic procedures by general surgeons throughout their total practice. Inguinal hernia growth trailed dental growth in the quarter. 
With respect to our more mature procedure categories in the U.S., Q1 gynecology procedures grew double digits the prior year growth comparison that was negative due to COVID. While dVP in the U.S. stabilized in Q1 from previous declines, it remains unclear when patients who have been impacted from delays in diagnosis and treatment will ultimately come back. 
In aggregate, on a worldwide basis, prostatectomy in the first quarter largely stabilized. More broadly, OUS procedure growth was driven by urology, earlier stage growth in general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures. 
With respect to OUS markets, China procedure growth was strong and benefited from the severe first quarter 2020 impact of COVID and an increase in the installed base over the past year. China had broad-based growth in all procedure categories. 
In Japan, procedure growth moderated somewhat due to restrictions associated with COVID. Procedure growth in South Korea was encouraging with SP utilization continuing to be above Xi. In Europe, France had a solid quarter with broad-based strength in a wide range of procedure categories. The U.K. remained challenged due to COVID. 
Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. 
A recent article by Dr. Mohamed A. Abd El Aziz, Fabian Grass, and David Larson, with colleagues from the Mayo Clinic published in Surgical Endoscopy provided results from a real-world study aimed to analyze national trends of conversion during elective colectomies in addition to MIS utilization trends. Using the ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for elective laparoscopic or robotic-assisted colectomy between January 2013 and December 2018, a total of 66,652 patients were identified.  Overall conversion rates from MIS to open were approximately 42% lower for robotic-assisted procedures when compared to laparoscopic procedures, 4.9% versus 8.5%. The rate was also lower for obese patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 36% versus 10.3%. 
The authors concluded in part, ""This large-scale study identified a decreasing trend in conversion rates 6-year inclusion period, both overall and in patients with obesity, paralleling, increased utilization of the robotics platform. Given the potential negative impact of conversion on patient outcomes, individual institutions should consider a review of their own conversion data as this may represent an opportunity for quality improvement."" 
In February of this year, Dr. Amir Bastawrous,  of the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle, Washington; and Dr. Robert Cleary of St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, published a real-world observational study, which compared the rates of long-term opioid prescriptions for patients who underwent minimally invasive and open colectomies. This study utilized the IBM MarketScan research database and analyzed 14,887 eligible patients who underwent a colon resection via the open laparoscopic or robotic-assisted approach between 2013 and 2017.
In the 1:1 propensity score matched analysis comparing the MIS and open approaches with over 5,000 patients in each arm, the MIS approach has significantly lower incidence rate of long-term prescriptions of any opioids by approximately 36%, 13.3% versus 20.9%; schedule 2 and 3 opioids by approximately 39%, 11.7% versus 19.2%; and high-dose opioids by approximately 44%, 4.3% versus 7.7%, from 90 to 180 days postoperatively.  Looking at the matched analysis between robotic-assisted surgery and laparoscopy with over 1,100 subjects in each group, the robotic-assisted approach demonstrated approximately 45% lower long-term prescription rates of high-dose opioids, 2.1% versus 3.8% when compared to the laparoscopic approach. 
Furthermore, in subgroup analyses, the robotic-assisted approach showed significantly lower rates of long-term prescriptions in any opioids, schedule 2 and 3 opioids and high-dose opioids compared to the laparoscopic approach for subjects undergoing colectomy for nonmalignant conditions. 
The authors concluded in part, ""Choosing an MIS option in robotic-assisted surgery for some colorectal operations is a modifiable factor that may contribute to less long-term opioid use."" 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie, who will review our financial outlook."
30239,710343543,2254173,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. While there continues to be uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and given moderating coverage hospitalization trends and vaccination progress, particularly in the U.S., which accounted for approximately 70% of our 2020 pro",692,"Good afternoon. While there continues to be uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and given moderating coverage hospitalization trends and vaccination progress, particularly in the U.S., which accounted for approximately 70% of our 2020 procedures, we are reestablishing our financial guidance. 
In providing this guidance, we note that there are emerging supply constraints in our supply chain, for example, in the semiconductor industry. The outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to these supply constraints. 
Our financial outlook for 2021 is as follows: starting with procedures, total 2020 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 1% to roughly 1,243,000 procedures performed worldwide. For 2021 and we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 22% to 26%. We expect 2021 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and procedures outside of the United States where we are at earlier stages of adoption. 
The high end of the range assumes that COVID cases and the impact on da Vinci procedures continue to decline throughout the year, the vaccine rollouts continue at the level currently expected by governments around the world, and that recovery of patient backlog will progress. Modeling quarterly results is difficult given the impact that COVID had on 2020 procedures. Therefore, with respect to procedure seasonality, we expect similar quarterly patterns for 2019. 
With respect to capital, system placements are generally driven by procedure demand, prompting hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. System placement demand is also the result of customers standardizing our fourth generation technology through trade-ins. 
Capital sales can vary substantially from period-to-period based upon many factors, including government health care policies, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Within this framework, we'd expect 2021 capital placements generally be driven by procedures and the adequacy of existing capacity in the installed base. 
During the first quarter of 2021, 43% of systems shipped were under operating leases. We expect that the proportion of systems placed under operating leases will vary from quarter-to-quarter and could continue to trend up in the future. 
Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2020 pro forma gross profit margin was 68.4%, reflecting the impact of fixed -- higher fixed overhead costs relative to revenue, higher excess and obsolete inventory charges, and the customer relief program that was implemented in the second quarter of 2020.  Our full year 2019 pro forma gross profit margin was 71.7%. In 2021, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70% and 71% of revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter, depending largely on product, regional trade-in mix, the impact of product cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and competitive pricing pressure. With respect to operating expenses, in 2019, our pro forma operating expenses grew 27%.  And in 2020, given the impact of the pandemic, they grew 3%. 
In 2021, we expect pro forma full year operating expense growth to be between 18% and 22%, reflecting increases in investments in our digital ecosystem, Ion, SP, OUS expansion, higher regulatory-related costs and infrastructure investments to allow us to scale. 
2021 spending also expected to be impacted by a return over the course of the year to higher rates of travel, increased customer training and a greater proportion of marketing events being held in person and by a variable compensation. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million to $470 million in 2021 compared to $396 million in 2020. We expect pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $45 million and $55 million in 2021, reflecting lower interest rates relative to 2020. 
With regard to income tax, in 2020, our pro forma income tax rate was 22.5%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2021 pro forma tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pretax income. Our 2021 outlook for the pro forma tax rate does not reflect any potential change in U.S. tax rates. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

I'll start with the low end of the procedure guidance. 
So we considered 3 factors in the low end. We see the possibility of extended impact of COVID in certain OUS geographies with slower vaccine rollouts and resurgences in some of those geographies. We see that in parts of Europe currently. 
Secondly, we embedded in the lower end of the procedure guidance, a slower recovery of diagnostic pipelines that have been impacted during the pandemic. 
And then the third item in the low end of the guidance, is the possibility of regionalized resurgence of COVID in the U.S. as we race towards the rollout of vaccines and, ultimately, at some point, achieve herd immunity in the U.S. 
With respect to the backlog, the backlog's accumulated really for 3 factors: lower diagnostic pipelines, deferred elective surgery as hospital systems get inundated with COVID cases and patient reluctance to undergo surgery during COVID resurgences. These subcomponents, we think, get recovered over different periods of time. The backlog is actually constantly netting between increases and recovery. So the total accumulative backlog is difficult to predict. The rate of recovery is also difficult to predict, but we expect it to go through into 2022. And so the '21 procedure guidance that we provided reflects our best estimate of the range of the impact of backlog in the year."

We brought a team over as well as some of the technology and have put it in our hands. 
The use case I was talking about there is the ability for people who are interested in observing a case by an expert, to log in online through a secure network, high-speed streaming, and view that case on da Vinci accounts. And that's an important part of both knowledge transfer from those high-volume accounts, as well as an introductory exposure for surgeons who are thinking about it. So that has been great. 
There are other use cases for streaming connections, video streaming connections into our products that I won't detail now. It's pretty neat. And so prior, we had started that. I was a believer -- or we, as a company, were believers that those kinds of access, think of it as kind of surgical Face Time or surgical Skype over a distance. That kind of access would be important to folks, and the pandemic really accelerated it. And so we had the technology infrastructure in place.

So we introduced extended use instruments into Europe and into the U.S. in Q4. We did see increased usage of extended use instruments. They still have some level of inventory of shorter life use instruments and they're burning that off. 
We also had commented last quarter that we saw stocking orders of extended use instruments. And we're seeing some adjustment of their buying patterns to recognize the increased number of uses per instrument. 
So the quarter, as I called out, instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was lower than last quarter, and it primarily reflects those factors: the use of extended instruments and adjustments of inventory buying patterns. 
I don't think it's exhausted the whole impact. I think if you go back to our previous script, you'd see that we said that had you implemented this in 2019, it would have affected total revenue by about $150 million to $170 million, or about 7% of Ion  [ aid ] per procedure, and we've only seen a part of that so far. When the rest of it will hit is questionable. It will roll out over time as they continue to use those instruments and as we roll it out to other countries."

In terms of procedure types, I think there's this interesting mix. The prioritization that folks are making as they come back in the hospitals, I think, is a mixture of patient desire, depending on what they think their condition might be, for example, bariatrics, and hospital and surgeons prioritization around urgency, for example, diagnosed cancers and changes or challenges to the diagnostic pipeline. I was pleased by U.S. general surgery. I think that, that has shown some resilience. A lot of that is benign procedures. And I think that, that has been kind of on the upside of our models.

Our second quarter 2021 performance was encouraging, with use of our systems for procedures growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and healthy capital placements. Looking at the past 8 quarters in context, our compound annual",1396,"Thank you for joining us today. 
Our second quarter 2021 performance was encouraging, with use of our systems for procedures growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and healthy capital placements. Looking at the past 8 quarters in context, our compound annual growth rate for procedures for the period Q2 2019 through Q2 2021 of 16.5% is approximately the growth we would have expected absent the pandemic. The pandemic has reordered the quarter in which procedures were performed, and we believe it has delayed some procedures that are likely to return in the future and may cause a small number of patients to permanently forgo surgery. 
To understand our system placement and capital performance over this period, we look to annual system utilization trends, which have recovered the utilization rates at the high end of our historical averages. Taken together, this combination of a recovery in procedures and healthy utilization supports our solid capital placement trends and rounds out a healthy commercial recovery year-to-date. 
Examining procedure trends more deeply. In the United States, procedure growth was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in bariatric surgery, hernia repair and cholecystectomy. Both gynecology and urology procedure annualized growth strengthened in the quarter, as pandemic pressures eased in the U.S. Annualized U.S. procedure growth rates are returning to historical levels for procedures with longer diagnostic pipelines as patients have started returning to screening and diagnostic testing. 
Growth in our second largest market, China, continued to be strong with multiple specialties contributing. European procedure growth was generally healthy, though varied by country. Recovery in the U.K. was healthy in the quarter as NHS increased access to surgeries broadly. The pandemic is not behind us and additional infection growth may again strain hospital resources and impact our results in the future. Jamie will take you through procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call. 
On the capital side, new system placements continue to be healthy, with the United States, China, Germany, France and Japan, notable in the quarter. We know that new system placements are closely tied to anticipated procedure volumes and system utilization in mature markets. We continue to see significant utilization variance by region due to pandemic differences. 
In the quarter, strong trade-ins of older generation systems for our fourth generation products and strength in multi-system deals, continue to support our thesis that customers that know us best continue to invest with us going forward. We also saw an increase in our IDN customers opening new da Vinci and Ion programs in hospitals within their network that did not previously have an Intuitive robotics program, indicating their interest in diversifying access to Intuitive programs across their networks. 
Looking to our finances in the quarter. Procedures recovered nicely in Q2. System placements came in above plan, and system ASP and I&A revenue per procedure track slightly above our expectations, together driving revenue of $1.46 billion in Q2. Our pro forma spending grew over 24% from a year ago, representing increased investment in our business. 
However, our expense growth rate was modestly lower than our plan, driven by pandemic-related factors.  COVID has delayed some work in R&D and clinical trials, leading to some underspend in programs, prototypes and some delay in hiring. We expect these programs to continue their ramp as our labs and development programs recover efficiency. 
Travel and associated costs in support of our field have also not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Field and marketing costs will tick up if the pandemic wanes. In short, our commercial business has recovered more quickly than our spending due to the different ways that pandemic impacts our customers, our supply chains and our hiring. Marshall will take you through our financial picture later in the call. 
Turning to our innovation and commercialization efforts. We are developing and deploying technology-enabled ecosystems to support our customers' pursuit of the quadruple lane, better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. We are in the execution and launch phase of 4 efforts. First, we are broadening access to our advanced instruments for our da Vinci Fourth Generation Multiport Systems through pursuit of additional clearances and launches outside the U.S. Second, we are expanding our da Vinci SP offering by broadening its regional and clinical indications and by adding it to its suite of instruments and accessories. Third, we are launching and refining our flexible diagnostic platform, Ion, by working with early customers to help establish high-performing sites and by improving our technology and supply chain capabilities. Finally, we are strengthening our digital capabilities across our ecosystem. 
Our fully integrated advanced instruments portfolio has been a strong addition to our multiport ecosystem, allowing for high-quality tissue interaction controlled from the surgeon's console while optimizing workflow. These system-controlled staplers, vessel sealers and energy instruments support a range of procedures from bariatrics to colorectal procedures to thoracic and gynecologic applications. Customer appreciation and recurring use of our products has been growing nicely. 
In Q2, we launched our Sureform stapling line in India. We launched our Force bipolar energy instrument along with our extended use instruments program in Japan, and we launched our synchroseal energy instrument and E-100 energy generator in Korea. 
Turning to our single port system. We placed 4 SP systems in the quarter, bringing the total installed base to 79. SP procedures grew 133% year-over-year, with much of that growth coming from the United States. First cases in our SP colorectal IDE trial were completed in the quarter as we seek to bring SP capability to additional procedures. We are also working on our regulatory filings to bring SP to Europe under the European Union's new medical device regulation framework. 
Our flexible robotics program, first targeted towards diagnostic bronchoscopy, has had a strong quarter. We placed an additional 20 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 70. Ion procedures grew sixfold over Q2 2020 to nearly 1,500 procedures in the quarter, reflecting recovery from the pandemic, the growth in new sites and growth in utilization at existing sites. Our total Ion clinical experience is approximately 4,000 cases to date. Clinical trial sites completed enrollment for our precise clinical trial. Finally, our team is making good progress in scaling our operations. 
Lastly, we continue to digitally enhance our ecosystem. In the quarter, we continued to engage customers in data analytics and opportunity analysis for surgical programs, cornerstone of our your data, your truth analytics efforts. We have continued the launch of our My Intuitive app, including launching to first users in Europe. My Intuitive allows surgeons and care team members to access their data, to manage their profile, their learning and otherwise interact with Intuitive through an easy-to-use mobile app in the palm of their hand. Our digital learning programs continue to be an important part of our overall learning initiatives. These programs together trained over 2,200 care team members in the quarter, showing organizational strength and localizing programs and responding with agility to pandemic influence demand. 
As the phases of the pandemic evolved, we're supporting our team in addressing the opportunities and challenges posed by the pandemic in the ways we work. Intuitive has managed multiple ways of working for many years. Roughly 1/3 of our team works in the manufacturer test and distribution of our products, another 1/3 works closely with customers in the field, and the remaining 1/3 have traditionally worked in lab and office environments. We're taking a first principles approach to return-to-office environments with our team, bringing back face-to-face interactions for those tasks best completed in person while enabling hybrid work environments for tasks that are well accomplished by distributed teams. 
Most of our offices globally are reopening with this hybrid approach. We anticipate iterating our approach as we learn in the year progresses. 
As I conclude, for the balance of the year, we're focused on the following: first, agile and flexible support for our customers globally as they need it, often addressing the return of surgical patients to treatment. Second, disciplined execution of our launches, including our advanced instruments, SP, Ion and digital efforts. Third, driving depth and excellence in regional performance, particularly in Europe and Asia. And finally, expanding our clinical, economic and analytical evidence base for key procedures and countries. 
I'll now turn the time over to Marshall to take you through our financial performance in greater detail."

COVID had a significant impact on da Vinci procedure volumes in the second quarter of 2020. That impact was most pronounced in the U.S. and Europe varied market to market complicating year-over-year comparisons. In the U.S., as COVID continued to subside in the second quarter of 2021, we saw a lower impact on da Vinci procedures. Procedure growth in the U.S. was led by bariatric cholecystectomy and hernia procedures. We also believe that growth benefited from some procedures that were previously deferred due to delays in testing and patient concern over COVID. While there is likely some amount of backlog that has not yet been addressed, it is difficult to estimate the extent of the remaining backlog and when it will affect future procedure growth. 
In Europe, the impact of COVID in the second quarter of 2021 varied regionally with slower recovery in Italy and France, while we saw early stages of a recovery in the U.K. While there continues to be coved hotspots within some of our Asia Pacific markets, overall procedures in the region performed well. China growth in the second quarter continued to be far higher than our other regions, primarily reflecting the 40% system installation growth over the past year. Jamie will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. 
Hospitalizations of patients due to COVID have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. To the extent that hospitalizations expand significantly due to COVID and its variants, like currently being experienced in parts of the world, it could negatively impact da Vinci procedures. 
Key business metrics for the second quarter were as follows: second quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 68% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and increased approximately 13% compared with last quarter. Compound annual growth between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 16.5%. Second quarter system placements of 328 systems increased 84% compared with 178 systems for the second quarter of 2020 and increased 10% compared with 298 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci Systems over the last year by 10% and to approximately 6,335 systems. This growth rate compares with 9% last year and 8% last quarter. 
Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 55% compared with last year and increased 11% compared with last quarter. The compounded annual utilization growth rate between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 6%. 
Moving on to capital placements. System placements in the quarter reflected procedure growth and hospitals upgrading to -- in order to access or standardize on fourth-generation capabilities. Capital placements for the first 6 months of 2021 were in line with procedure and utilization growth. 
Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets. To the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. The trade in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline over time. Leasing and alternative financing arrangements enable customer access to capital. While the percentage of systems placed under operating leases fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, we believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. 
Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending. And as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. 
Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: total second quarter revenue was $1.464 billion, representing a 72% increase from last year and a 13% increase from last quarter. The compound annual revenue growth rate between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 15%. Second quarter revenue reflected growth in both procedures and system placements. 
Leasing represented 33% of current quarter placements compared with 29% last year and 43% last quarter. In the quarter, we completed a number of placements with larger IDNs that prefer to purchase rather than lease product. Leasing as a percentage of total sales lag has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 
38% of systems placed in the second quarter involved trade-ins, which is lower than the 40% last year, into 44% last quarter. As customers continue to upgrade to fourth generation capabilities, the population of installed SIs is decreasing, particularly in the U.S. were 110 trade-ins were completed in the second quarter, leaving an installed base of SIs of approximately 500 systems. As a result, we expect lower trade-in transactions over time. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. 
Second quarter system average selling prices decreased to $1.55 million from $1.65 million for both the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. The decrease relative to these prior periods reflects geographic mix and volume discounts provided to customers purchasing multiple systems. We recognized $26 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $9 million last year and $19 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. 
Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure of $1,940 increased compared with $1,900 per procedure for the second quarter of last year, and decreased compared with $1,950 per procedure in the first quarter. Extended use instruments were introduced into the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter, in most other markets in the first 6 months of this year, except China due to regulatory timelines. In the U.S. and Europe, extended use instruments were nearly fully adopted in the second quarter. The year-over-year increase in I&A revenue per procedure reflects increased usage of our advanced instruments, partially offset by the impact of extended use instruments. We believe that globally, customers have had not completely adjusted their instrument buying patterns to reflect the additional uses per instrument. Customer adjustment of buying patterns will reduce I&A revenue per procedure. 
4 of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP Systems, reflecting continued measure rollout of SP. Our installed base of SP Systems is now 79: 8 in Korea and 71 in the U.S. We completed first cases associated with a U.S. colorectal clinical trial in the second quarter. We placed 20 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 70 systems. There were nearly 1,500 Ion procedures completed in the second quarter. 
Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The supply issues we called out in the first quarter did not impact Ion placements and procedures in this quarter. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 115 systems in the second quarter compared with 72 in the second quarter of 2020 and 108 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 63 into Europe, 16 into Japan and 19 into China compared with 18 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 21 into China in the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 71.7% compared with 62.4% for the second quarter of 2020 and 71.8% last quarter. The second quarter of 2020 included $59 million of service credits issued in conjunction with our Customer Relief Program, higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The first and second quarters of 2021 reflect leveraging fixed costs over higher production levels. 
Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products, while we carry safety stocks of critical components and are otherwise working to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, global shortages could result in higher production costs and production development and regulatory delays. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 24% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and increased 5% compared with last quarter. The increase compared to prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount, increased variable compensation and increased spending in areas impacted by COVID. Second quarter spending was below our expectations due to activities restricted by COVID, including clinical development, marketing events and travel costs. In addition, COVID delayed some R&D work, resulting in underspend on prototypes. We expect spending on activities restricted by COVID to increase as the impacts of the pandemic decline. We also expect spending to increase as a percentage of revenue as investments in headcount, infrastructure and other support areas catch up to the growth in the business. Finally, we expect to continue to invest in expanding and accelerating our ecosystem of products and capabilities. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%. In the second quarter, we modified the useful life of a deferred tax asset, which resulted in a current charge to pro forma income. However, that charge generated -- that change generated a long-term benefit of $66 million that is recognized currently in GAAP income and will be recognized ratably over approximately 10 years in pro forma income. The charge associated with the deferred tax asset and a higher mix of U.S. income drove the 25% current quarter pro forma rate. We expect our pro forma rate for the last 6 months of 2021 to be between 21% and 22% versus our previous guidance of 20% to 21%, reflecting a greater proportion of U.S. income for the year. 
Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items. Our second quarter pro forma net income was $477 million or $3.92 per share compared with $132 million or $1.11 per share for the second quarter of 2020 and $427 million or $3.52 per share for the last quarter. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $517 million or $4.25 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $68 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of $426 million or $3.51 per share for the last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.7 billion compared with $7.2 billion last quarter. The increase in cash in the second quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie."

Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 68% compared to a decline of 19% during the second quarter of 2020, which reflected a significant adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The compound annual growth rate between the second quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2021 was 16.5%. 
In Q2, U.S. procedures grew 77% year-over-year, which equates to 16% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. OUS markets grew 51% year-over-year or 19% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. In the U.S., Q2 procedure results were positively impacted by a continuing recovery from COVID-19, including, we believe, a number of procedures that had been previously deferred. Q2 growth was driven by particular strength in benign procedures, including bariatrics, hernia repair, cholecystectomy and benign hysterectomy, reflecting in part, we believe, a partial catch-up in these procedures related to the previous deferral of elective surgeries. 
General surgery growth in the U.S. was strong. And in addition to the positive impact from patient backlogs, reflected increasing access for surgeons to our fourth generation technology. In the U.S., procedures that are dependent on diagnostic pipelines also grew, albeit at lower rates as compared to benign procedures. Colorectal growth was strong, with solid growth in malignant hysterectomy, thoracic and prostatectomy procedures. Based on market data, we believe that diagnostic pipelines in the U.S. began to recover from the impact of the pandemic in March, with a lag in the recovery of associated procedures. 
Second quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 51% compared with a 7% decline for the second quarter of 2020 and 23% growth last quarter. Second quarter 2021 OUS procedure growth was driven by growth in prostatectomy procedures and earlier-stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery, gynecology and thoracic. 
China procedure growth remains strong and broad-based as a result of continued expansion of the installed base under the current quota. Growth in Japan was solid, but was impacted by a relatively slow rollout of vaccines and the impact of localized lockdowns as a result of ongoing efforts to prevent resurgences of COVID-19. In Europe, procedure growth varied by country based on the relative impact of and recovery from the pandemic. Growth in the U.K. was strong, with a slower recovery in France, Italy and Germany. 
Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. 
During the quarter, the group from the Shenzhen Hospital Naval Medical University in China, published a meta-analysis in BMC cancer comparing robotic-assisted thoracic surgery versus video-assisted thoracic surgery, or VATs, for lung lobectomy or segmentectomy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The meta-analysis combined 18 studies across different countries containing over 11,000 patients, of which just over 5,000 received da Vinci robotic-assisted thoracic surgery and just over 6,000 received VATs. 
The results of the meta-analysis found that robotic-assisted thoracic surgery compared to VATs was associated with, among others, the following significant findings: 50.4 milliliters as lower blood loss, a 50% lower chance of conversion to an open procedure, a 1.1 day shorter stay in the hospital and a 10% less chance of patient experience to postoperative complication. The authors concluded, ""The results revealed that robotic-assisted thoracic surgery is a feasible and safe technique compared with VATs in terms of short-term and long-term outcomes"". 
In May of this year, Dr. Karl LeBlanc from our Lady of the Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, published results from a multi-center study comparing short-term outcomes for incisional hernia, published in the Hernia Journal entitled Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic and Open Incisional Hernia Repair Early Outcomes from the Prospective Hernia study. The study contains 371 patients that underwent an incisional hernia repair procedure across 17 institutions within the United States between May 2016 and September 2019. Of those patients, 43% were in the da Vinci robotic cohort, 35% in the laparoscopic cohort and 22% in the open cohort. 
In reporting the results, adjusted using a propensity weighted approach, the authors noted that during the 2- to 4-week standard of care visit period, fewer patients report the need to take prescription pain medication for the robotic cohort as compared to the laparoscopic and open cohorts: 65.2% for the robotic cohort as compared to 78.8% for the laparoscopic cohort compared to 79.8% for the open cohort. Conversion rates to open surgery were lower in the robotic group compared to the laparoscopic group, 0.6% as compared to 4.9% and reoperation rates in the 30 days post procedure were comparable between robotic and laparoscopic and lower for robotic as compared to open 0.6% as compared to 3.1%. 
The authors concluded in part, ""When compared to open, the robotic-assisted surgery group is associated with a comparable operative time, shorter length of stay and lower reoperation rate through 30 days. The difference in the number of subjects reporting the need for prescription pain medication favored the robotic-assisted group in both comparisons. 
I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. We continue to operate in a challenging supply chain environment and have experienced longer lead times and delayed deliveries from our suppliers. While this did not have a material impact to our operating results in Q2, the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to supply constraints. 
We also note the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in certain geographies associated with the Delta variant. The outlook we are providing on today's call does not reflect risks associated with a significant increase in COVID-related hospitalizations in relation to the Delta variant or other potential new variants. 
Starting with procedures. Last quarter, we forecast 2021 procedure growth of 22% to 26%. Given the stronger recovery of procedures we have experienced so far, particularly in the U.S. and strength in U.S. general surgery, we are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 30%. The high end of the range assumes strength in U.S. general surgery, a return to normalized diagnostic pipelines, the vaccines are effective against any new COVID-19 variants and the vaccine rollouts in OUS markets continue as currently expected by governments around the world. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2021 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70% and 71% of revenue. We are now slightly increasing our forecast and expect full year gross profit margin to be between 70.5% and 71.5% of revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade in mix, the impact of product cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and pricing pressure. 
With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast to grow full year pro forma 2021 operating expenses between 18% and 22% above 2020 levels. We are refining our estimate and expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 17% and 21%. Consistent with the last quarter's forecast, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million and $470 million in 2021. 
We expect pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $50 million and $55 million in 2021. With regard to income tax, we expect the range of our second half 2021 pro forma tax rate to be between 21% and 22% of pretax income, slightly higher than the range we provided on the last call, reflecting a higher mix of U.S. income. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

From the low end perspective, the 27% reflected there is greater summer seasonality and that reflects the possibility of an impact due to pent-up demand for vacation, especially for health care workers that have worked extensively during this period with COVID. It also reflects lower diagnostic pipelines and perhaps some reluctance for patients to visit hospitals. In there is OUS markets continue to be choppy given that, in many cases, those markets are behind the U.S., for example, in their vaccination rollouts, and that leaves the possibility of continued resurgences and localized lockdowns. That low end also reflects some impact of a resurgence in the U.S. But as you heard in our prepared comments, a significant increase in hospitalization is not reflected in the guidance range."

And then now we have rolled it out to most other markets in the first 6 months of this year, except for China where there are longer regulatory time lines. It's a short period, but we believe that there is elasticity, and we've seen elasticity in markets where reimbursements are very low. And we've received feedback -- positive feedback from surgeons who have indicated that system access has been a key driver for increased procedures. And we think that the extended use instruments lowers barriers for purchases of systems. Having said all of that, it's been a short period since they've had extended use instruments. Even though we've seen growth in the procedures that were specifically targeted by extended use instruments, it's hard to discern what is COVID-related versus what is not. And so we'll see over time, we'll be able to measure a little bit better over time, and we'll monitor it."

The instrumentation updates, there are other things, imaging updates and software updates that are really all focused around right instruments, right features for the right extension or right expansion. So customers are asking us for advanced instrumentation. So energy and stapling and other things, we think that is possible. So we're making those investments to move that forward. We think we can bring some outstanding imaging capabilities, including florescence imaging into that space. And we're building into the broader digital ecosystem for SP.

And so I think you're going to see this quarter was extraordinary in terms of the operating profit margin and that we'll it will be lower in future quarters, given what I just described.

So when we talk about My Intuitive, that really is putting the power of interaction and data at the surgeon level in their hands or at the robotics coordinator level in their hands. So we're excited about that because it gives them fast and easy access. It links into some of the other things you're talking about. We are building tools and capabilities that allow hospital departments and departments of surgery to manage their program and look across programmatics for efficiency, for learning for outcomes and these things interlink. 
So short answer there is just kind of a reminder of what we're trying to do. We think there is an opportunity to accelerate learning and to drive increased insight for a surgeon into their own progress. We're doing that as combination of My Intuitive plus some of the simulation work that we do, plus some of the machine learning and video analysis work that we do. We think there's an opportunity to look at correlations between surgeon performance and outcomes. And that has implications for the kind of imaging we do, it has implications for task analysis and we're doing those things, and those can be aggregated across a surgical platform. And there's a lot of opportunities for OR efficiencies and standardization, controlling operating costs, controlling consumables costs. Those things are ongoing now. 
So several of those things are in the markets, the very first kind of Gen 1, some of them are on Gen 2. Some of them are included in our service contracts, some of them are on a per use basis. Some of them are fully included because we feel like they make us more efficient and to make them more efficient. So we don't really call them out as individual revenue lines.

We've seen a few teams come out in field systems that are alternatives to ours. Transitory was out a few years ago and CMR has been out and now Medtronic. 
A couple of things I'd say. One is we are focused on making sure that our ecosystem, our products, our systems, everything goes around it really delivers against the quadruple lane all the way through. It's not just the robot. Building a great robot is a hard first step. You have to do it. And -- but right now, I think that remains to be seen how strong those other systems are. 
Even then, it's not enough. Instruments and accessories, training programs, support staff, analytics capability, publication, scientific publications, demonstrating what you've done, the analytics and evidence-based build are all, I think, important. So I'd encourage those folks on the call, it's likely to be a comparison of ecosystems in delivering a over time. That said, other teams are out. They're calling on customers. They're giving their PowerPoints about what they think is going to happen next and some other things. And our posture to that has been -- it may delay some sales, we may have some competitive conversations and tenders, and we'll lose some. 
What we've seen, though, is that what happens in the PowerPoints and what happens a year later is different. And that if it hasn't delivered against the quad, if these systems can do some cases well, but not all cases well or they have stability issues or other things, that wears in pretty quickly. We also find that our economic offerings with da Vinci X and EUP, we have choices that we ourselves can offer our customers. So I think all of you on the call, you should expect increased alternatives for the customer base. I think the noise levels will go up. I think our customers will take their time to evaluate new things as they go. We're okay. We're not frightened of that. We think we stand up pretty well to those comparisons, and we're ready to help them pursue their aims as it proceeds."

And so we watch that number because we know it's highly sensitive. And we're pleased. Again, if you look across that 2-year period, try to look through the pandemic kind of ups and downs, what we're seeing is that procedure demand is there. And the capital to support that demand has not run ahead of the procedure demand. In fact, our commentary is a little bit the opposite that these are being highly utilized. That's great. That says that we're not putting out more capital than folks need, even though it's been healthy capital quarters, it means our customers are getting good benefit out of what they're using those systems for. 
Jamie in his commentary said that a lot of those procedures are benign procedures, many of them are shorter duration than longer or more complex disease states. That means that utilization will go up kind of naturally that, that mix moves toward a higher utilization mix. All of that indicates that the business feels in balance.

I've had the privilege of seeing Intuitive develop the use of robotics and multiple clinical indications over the years. And recently, we've had a series of very encouraging conversations on the adoption of bariatrics, very encouraging. And basically, still underpenetrated, big opportunity. Doctor is talking to us about further expansion of utilization. And I'd just be curious to -- since you all are calling it out repeatedly as an important incremental growth driver. Where are we now, in your view, in that, I'm sure, multiyear long-term adoption process? What's left to do from maybe a product or procedure or instrument point of view? Where are we going with this one?"

Having said that, it's a difficult procedure for surgeons to perform. It's physically demanding. And as we've said in the past, if we can bring the right system with the right instruments, the right imaging, in the right usability, the right ease of use, we think that surgeons will care. And we've seen both good clinical outcomes, but also high surgeon satisfaction and better ergonomics. I think that's what's been driving our success in the early market. It's taking getting the advanced instruments together as a set, getting our workflows and our clinical pathways right, and I think that's been powerful to date.

Our second quarter 2021 performance was encouraging, with use of our systems for procedures growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and healthy capital placements. Looking at the past 8 quarters in context, our compound annual",1396,"Thank you for joining us today. 
Our second quarter 2021 performance was encouraging, with use of our systems for procedures growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and healthy capital placements. Looking at the past 8 quarters in context, our compound annual growth rate for procedures for the period Q2 2019 through Q2 2021 of 16.5% is approximately the growth we would have expected absent the pandemic. The pandemic has reordered the quarter in which procedures were performed, and we believe it has delayed some procedures that are likely to return in the future and may cause a small number of patients to permanently forgo surgery. 
To understand our system placement and capital performance over this period, we look to annual system utilization trends, which have recovered the utilization rates at the high end of our historical averages. Taken together, this combination of a recovery in procedures and healthy utilization supports our solid capital placement trends and rounds out a healthy commercial recovery year-to-date. 
Examining procedure trends more deeply. In the United States, procedure growth was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in bariatric surgery, hernia repair and cholecystectomy. Both gynecology and urology procedure annualized growth strengthened in the quarter, as pandemic pressures eased in the U.S. Annualized U.S. procedure growth rates are returning to historical levels for procedures with longer diagnostic pipelines as patients have started returning to screening and diagnostic testing. 
Growth in our second largest market, China, continued to be strong with multiple specialties contributing. European procedure growth was generally healthy, though varied by country. Recovery in the U.K. was healthy in the quarter as NHS increased access to surgeries broadly. The pandemic is not behind us and additional infection growth may again strain hospital resources and impact our results in the future. Jamie will take you through procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call. 
On the capital side, new system placements continue to be healthy, with the United States, China, Germany, France and Japan, notable in the quarter. We know that new system placements are closely tied to anticipated procedure volumes and system utilization in mature markets. We continue to see significant utilization variance by region due to pandemic differences. 
In the quarter, strong trade-ins of older generation systems for our fourth generation products and strength in multi-system deals, continue to support our thesis that customers that know us best continue to invest with us going forward. We also saw an increase in our IDN customers opening new da Vinci and Ion programs in hospitals within their network that did not previously have an Intuitive robotics program, indicating their interest in diversifying access to Intuitive programs across their networks. 
Looking to our finances in the quarter. Procedures recovered nicely in Q2. System placements came in above plan, and system ASP and I&A revenue per procedure track slightly above our expectations, together driving revenue of $1.46 billion in Q2. Our pro forma spending grew over 24% from a year ago, representing increased investment in our business. 
However, our expense growth rate was modestly lower than our plan, driven by pandemic-related factors.  COVID has delayed some work in R&D and clinical trials, leading to some underspend in programs, prototypes and some delay in hiring. We expect these programs to continue their ramp as our labs and development programs recover efficiency. 
Travel and associated costs in support of our field have also not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Field and marketing costs will tick up if the pandemic wanes. In short, our commercial business has recovered more quickly than our spending due to the different ways that pandemic impacts our customers, our supply chains and our hiring. Marshall will take you through our financial picture later in the call. 
Turning to our innovation and commercialization efforts. We are developing and deploying technology-enabled ecosystems to support our customers' pursuit of the quadruple lane, better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. We are in the execution and launch phase of 4 efforts. First, we are broadening access to our advanced instruments for our da Vinci Fourth Generation Multiport Systems through pursuit of additional clearances and launches outside the U.S. Second, we are expanding our da Vinci SP offering by broadening its regional and clinical indications and by adding it to its suite of instruments and accessories. Third, we are launching and refining our flexible diagnostic platform, Ion, by working with early customers to help establish high-performing sites and by improving our technology and supply chain capabilities. Finally, we are strengthening our digital capabilities across our ecosystem. 
Our fully integrated advanced instruments portfolio has been a strong addition to our multiport ecosystem, allowing for high-quality tissue interaction controlled from the surgeon's console while optimizing workflow. These system-controlled staplers, vessel sealers and energy instruments support a range of procedures from bariatrics to colorectal procedures to thoracic and gynecologic applications. Customer appreciation and recurring use of our products has been growing nicely. 
In Q2, we launched our Sureform stapling line in India. We launched our Force bipolar energy instrument along with our extended use instruments program in Japan, and we launched our synchroseal energy instrument and E-100 energy generator in Korea. 
Turning to our single port system. We placed 4 SP systems in the quarter, bringing the total installed base to 79. SP procedures grew 133% year-over-year, with much of that growth coming from the United States. First cases in our SP colorectal IDE trial were completed in the quarter as we seek to bring SP capability to additional procedures. We are also working on our regulatory filings to bring SP to Europe under the European Union's new medical device regulation framework. 
Our flexible robotics program, first targeted towards diagnostic bronchoscopy, has had a strong quarter. We placed an additional 20 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 70. Ion procedures grew sixfold over Q2 2020 to nearly 1,500 procedures in the quarter, reflecting recovery from the pandemic, the growth in new sites and growth in utilization at existing sites. Our total Ion clinical experience is approximately 4,000 cases to date. Clinical trial sites completed enrollment for our precise clinical trial. Finally, our team is making good progress in scaling our operations. 
Lastly, we continue to digitally enhance our ecosystem. In the quarter, we continued to engage customers in data analytics and opportunity analysis for surgical programs, cornerstone of our your data, your truth analytics efforts. We have continued the launch of our My Intuitive app, including launching to first users in Europe. My Intuitive allows surgeons and care team members to access their data, to manage their profile, their learning and otherwise interact with Intuitive through an easy-to-use mobile app in the palm of their hand. Our digital learning programs continue to be an important part of our overall learning initiatives. These programs together trained over 2,200 care team members in the quarter, showing organizational strength and localizing programs and responding with agility to pandemic influence demand. 
As the phases of the pandemic evolved, we're supporting our team in addressing the opportunities and challenges posed by the pandemic in the ways we work. Intuitive has managed multiple ways of working for many years. Roughly 1/3 of our team works in the manufacturer test and distribution of our products, another 1/3 works closely with customers in the field, and the remaining 1/3 have traditionally worked in lab and office environments. We're taking a first principles approach to return-to-office environments with our team, bringing back face-to-face interactions for those tasks best completed in person while enabling hybrid work environments for tasks that are well accomplished by distributed teams. 
Most of our offices globally are reopening with this hybrid approach. We anticipate iterating our approach as we learn in the year progresses. 
As I conclude, for the balance of the year, we're focused on the following: first, agile and flexible support for our customers globally as they need it, often addressing the return of surgical patients to treatment. Second, disciplined execution of our launches, including our advanced instruments, SP, Ion and digital efforts. Third, driving depth and excellence in regional performance, particularly in Europe and Asia. And finally, expanding our clinical, economic and analytical evidence base for key procedures and countries. 
I'll now turn the time over to Marshall to take you through our financial performance in greater detail."

I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. 
COVID had a significant impact on da Vinci procedure volumes in the second quarter of 2020. That impact was most pronounced in the U.S. and Europe varied market to market complicating year-over-year comparisons. In the U.S., as COVID continued to subside in the second quarter of 2021, we saw a lower impact on da Vinci procedures. Procedure growth in the U.S. was led by bariatric cholecystectomy and hernia procedures. We also believe that growth benefited from some procedures that were previously deferred due to delays in testing and patient concern over COVID. While there is likely some amount of backlog that has not yet been addressed, it is difficult to estimate the extent of the remaining backlog and when it will affect future procedure growth. 
In Europe, the impact of COVID in the second quarter of 2021 varied regionally with slower recovery in Italy and France, while we saw early stages of a recovery in the U.K. While there continues to be coved hotspots within some of our Asia Pacific markets, overall procedures in the region performed well. China growth in the second quarter continued to be far higher than our other regions, primarily reflecting the 40% system installation growth over the past year. Jamie will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. 
Hospitalizations of patients due to COVID have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. To the extent that hospitalizations expand significantly due to COVID and its variants, like currently being experienced in parts of the world, it could negatively impact da Vinci procedures. 
Key business metrics for the second quarter were as follows: second quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 68% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and increased approximately 13% compared with last quarter. Compound annual growth between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 16.5%. Second quarter system placements of 328 systems increased 84% compared with 178 systems for the second quarter of 2020 and increased 10% compared with 298 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci Systems over the last year by 10% and to approximately 6,335 systems. This growth rate compares with 9% last year and 8% last quarter. 
Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 55% compared with last year and increased 11% compared with last quarter. The compounded annual utilization growth rate between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 6%. 
Moving on to capital placements. System placements in the quarter reflected procedure growth and hospitals upgrading to -- in order to access or standardize on fourth-generation capabilities. Capital placements for the first 6 months of 2021 were in line with procedure and utilization growth. 
Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets. To the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. The trade in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline over time. Leasing and alternative financing arrangements enable customer access to capital. While the percentage of systems placed under operating leases fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, we believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. 
Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending. And as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. 
Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: total second quarter revenue was $1.464 billion, representing a 72% increase from last year and a 13% increase from last quarter. The compound annual revenue growth rate between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 15%. Second quarter revenue reflected growth in both procedures and system placements. 
Leasing represented 33% of current quarter placements compared with 29% last year and 43% last quarter. In the quarter, we completed a number of placements with larger IDNs that prefer to purchase rather than lease product. Leasing as a percentage of total sales lag has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 
38% of systems placed in the second quarter involved trade-ins, which is lower than the 40% last year, into 44% last quarter. As customers continue to upgrade to fourth generation capabilities, the population of installed SIs is decreasing, particularly in the U.S. were 110 trade-ins were completed in the second quarter, leaving an installed base of SIs of approximately 500 systems. As a result, we expect lower trade-in transactions over time. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. 
Second quarter system average selling prices decreased to $1.55 million from $1.65 million for both the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. The decrease relative to these prior periods reflects geographic mix and volume discounts provided to customers purchasing multiple systems. We recognized $26 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $9 million last year and $19 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. 
Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure of $1,940 increased compared with $1,900 per procedure for the second quarter of last year, and decreased compared with $1,950 per procedure in the first quarter. Extended use instruments were introduced into the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter, in most other markets in the first 6 months of this year, except China due to regulatory timelines. In the U.S. and Europe, extended use instruments were nearly fully adopted in the second quarter. The year-over-year increase in I&A revenue per procedure reflects increased usage of our advanced instruments, partially offset by the impact of extended use instruments. We believe that globally, customers have had not completely adjusted their instrument buying patterns to reflect the additional uses per instrument. Customer adjustment of buying patterns will reduce I&A revenue per procedure. 
4 of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP Systems, reflecting continued measure rollout of SP. Our installed base of SP Systems is now 79: 8 in Korea and 71 in the U.S. We completed first cases associated with a U.S. colorectal clinical trial in the second quarter. We placed 20 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 70 systems. There were nearly 1,500 Ion procedures completed in the second quarter. 
Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The supply issues we called out in the first quarter did not impact Ion placements and procedures in this quarter. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 115 systems in the second quarter compared with 72 in the second quarter of 2020 and 108 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 63 into Europe, 16 into Japan and 19 into China compared with 18 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 21 into China in the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 71.7% compared with 62.4% for the second quarter of 2020 and 71.8% last quarter. The second quarter of 2020 included $59 million of service credits issued in conjunction with our Customer Relief Program, higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The first and second quarters of 2021 reflect leveraging fixed costs over higher production levels. 
Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products, while we carry safety stocks of critical components and are otherwise working to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, global shortages could result in higher production costs and production development and regulatory delays. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 24% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and increased 5% compared with last quarter. The increase compared to prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount, increased variable compensation and increased spending in areas impacted by COVID. Second quarter spending was below our expectations due to activities restricted by COVID, including clinical development, marketing events and travel costs. In addition, COVID delayed some R&D work, resulting in underspend on prototypes. We expect spending on activities restricted by COVID to increase as the impacts of the pandemic decline. We also expect spending to increase as a percentage of revenue as investments in headcount, infrastructure and other support areas catch up to the growth in the business. Finally, we expect to continue to invest in expanding and accelerating our ecosystem of products and capabilities. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%. In the second quarter, we modified the useful life of a deferred tax asset, which resulted in a current charge to pro forma income. However, that charge generated -- that change generated a long-term benefit of $66 million that is recognized currently in GAAP income and will be recognized ratably over approximately 10 years in pro forma income. The charge associated with the deferred tax asset and a higher mix of U.S. income drove the 25% current quarter pro forma rate. We expect our pro forma rate for the last 6 months of 2021 to be between 21% and 22% versus our previous guidance of 20% to 21%, reflecting a greater proportion of U.S. income for the year. 
Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items. Our second quarter pro forma net income was $477 million or $3.92 per share compared with $132 million or $1.11 per share for the second quarter of 2020 and $427 million or $3.52 per share for the last quarter. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $517 million or $4.25 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $68 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of $426 million or $3.51 per share for the last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.7 billion compared with $7.2 billion last quarter. The increase in cash in the second quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie."

Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 68% compared to a decline of 19% during the second quarter of 2020, which reflected a significant adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The compound annual growth rate between the second quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2021 was 16.5%. 
In Q2, U.S. procedures grew 77% year-over-year, which equates to 16% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. OUS markets grew 51% year-over-year or 19% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. In the U.S., Q2 procedure results were positively impacted by a continuing recovery from COVID-19, including, we believe, a number of procedures that had been previously deferred. Q2 growth was driven by particular strength in benign procedures, including bariatrics, hernia repair, cholecystectomy and benign hysterectomy, reflecting in part, we believe, a partial catch-up in these procedures related to the previous deferral of elective surgeries. 
General surgery growth in the U.S. was strong. And in addition to the positive impact from patient backlogs, reflected increasing access for surgeons to our fourth generation technology. In the U.S., procedures that are dependent on diagnostic pipelines also grew, albeit at lower rates as compared to benign procedures. Colorectal growth was strong, with solid growth in malignant hysterectomy, thoracic and prostatectomy procedures. Based on market data, we believe that diagnostic pipelines in the U.S. began to recover from the impact of the pandemic in March, with a lag in the recovery of associated procedures. 
Second quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 51% compared with a 7% decline for the second quarter of 2020 and 23% growth last quarter. Second quarter 2021 OUS procedure growth was driven by growth in prostatectomy procedures and earlier-stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery, gynecology and thoracic. 
China procedure growth remains strong and broad-based as a result of continued expansion of the installed base under the current quota. Growth in Japan was solid, but was impacted by a relatively slow rollout of vaccines and the impact of localized lockdowns as a result of ongoing efforts to prevent resurgences of COVID-19. In Europe, procedure growth varied by country based on the relative impact of and recovery from the pandemic. Growth in the U.K. was strong, with a slower recovery in France, Italy and Germany. 
Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. 
During the quarter, the group from the Shenzhen Hospital Naval Medical University in China, published a meta-analysis in BMC cancer comparing robotic-assisted thoracic surgery versus video-assisted thoracic surgery, or VATs, for lung lobectomy or segmentectomy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The meta-analysis combined 18 studies across different countries containing over 11,000 patients, of which just over 5,000 received da Vinci robotic-assisted thoracic surgery and just over 6,000 received VATs. 
The results of the meta-analysis found that robotic-assisted thoracic surgery compared to VATs was associated with, among others, the following significant findings: 50.4 milliliters as lower blood loss, a 50% lower chance of conversion to an open procedure, a 1.1 day shorter stay in the hospital and a 10% less chance of patient experience to postoperative complication. The authors concluded, ""The results revealed that robotic-assisted thoracic surgery is a feasible and safe technique compared with VATs in terms of short-term and long-term outcomes"". 
In May of this year, Dr. Karl LeBlanc from our Lady of the Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, published results from a multi-center study comparing short-term outcomes for incisional hernia, published in the Hernia Journal entitled Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic and Open Incisional Hernia Repair Early Outcomes from the Prospective Hernia study. The study contains 371 patients that underwent an incisional hernia repair procedure across 17 institutions within the United States between May 2016 and September 2019. Of those patients, 43% were in the da Vinci robotic cohort, 35% in the laparoscopic cohort and 22% in the open cohort. 
In reporting the results, adjusted using a propensity weighted approach, the authors noted that during the 2- to 4-week standard of care visit period, fewer patients report the need to take prescription pain medication for the robotic cohort as compared to the laparoscopic and open cohorts: 65.2% for the robotic cohort as compared to 78.8% for the laparoscopic cohort compared to 79.8% for the open cohort. Conversion rates to open surgery were lower in the robotic group compared to the laparoscopic group, 0.6% as compared to 4.9% and reoperation rates in the 30 days post procedure were comparable between robotic and laparoscopic and lower for robotic as compared to open 0.6% as compared to 3.1%. 
The authors concluded in part, ""When compared to open, the robotic-assisted surgery group is associated with a comparable operative time, shorter length of stay and lower reoperation rate through 30 days. The difference in the number of subjects reporting the need for prescription pain medication favored the robotic-assisted group in both comparisons. 
I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. We continue to operate in a challenging supply chain environment and have experienced longer lead times and delayed deliveries from our suppliers. While this did not have a material impact to our operating results in Q2, the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to supply constraints. 
We also note the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in certain geographies associated with the Delta variant. The outlook we are providing on today's call does not reflect risks associated with a significant increase in COVID-related hospitalizations in relation to the Delta variant or other potential new variants. 
Starting with procedures. Last quarter, we forecast 2021 procedure growth of 22% to 26%. Given the stronger recovery of procedures we have experienced so far, particularly in the U.S. and strength in U.S. general surgery, we are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 30%. The high end of the range assumes strength in U.S. general surgery, a return to normalized diagnostic pipelines, the vaccines are effective against any new COVID-19 variants and the vaccine rollouts in OUS markets continue as currently expected by governments around the world. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2021 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70% and 71% of revenue. We are now slightly increasing our forecast and expect full year gross profit margin to be between 70.5% and 71.5% of revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade in mix, the impact of product cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and pricing pressure. 
With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast to grow full year pro forma 2021 operating expenses between 18% and 22% above 2020 levels. We are refining our estimate and expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 17% and 21%. Consistent with the last quarter's forecast, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million and $470 million in 2021. 
We expect pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $50 million and $55 million in 2021. With regard to income tax, we expect the range of our second half 2021 pro forma tax rate to be between 21% and 22% of pretax income, slightly higher than the range we provided on the last call, reflecting a higher mix of U.S. income. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

We kind of outlined what was assumed in the high end of the procedure guidance. From the low end perspective, the 27% reflected there is greater summer seasonality and that reflects the possibility of an impact due to pent-up demand for vacation, especially for health care workers that have worked extensively during this period with COVID. It also reflects lower diagnostic pipelines and perhaps some reluctance for patients to visit hospitals. In there is OUS markets continue to be choppy given that, in many cases, those markets are behind the U.S., for example, in their vaccination rollouts, and that leaves the possibility of continued resurgences and localized lockdowns. That low end also reflects some impact of a resurgence in the U.S. But as you heard in our prepared comments, a significant increase in hospitalization is not reflected in the guidance range."

It's a short period, but we believe that there is elasticity, and we've seen elasticity in markets where reimbursements are very low. And we've received feedback -- positive feedback from surgeons who have indicated that system access has been a key driver for increased procedures. And we think that the extended use instruments lowers barriers for purchases of systems. Having said all of that, it's been a short period since they've had extended use instruments. Even though we've seen growth in the procedures that were specifically targeted by extended use instruments, it's hard to discern what is COVID-related versus what is not.

The instrumentation updates, there are other things, imaging updates and software updates that are really all focused around right instruments, right features for the right extension or right expansion. So customers are asking us for advanced instrumentation. So energy and stapling and other things, we think that is possible. So we're making those investments to move that forward. We think we can bring some outstanding imaging capabilities, including florescence imaging into that space. And we're building into the broader digital ecosystem for SP.

So when we talk about My Intuitive, that really is putting the power of interaction and data at the surgeon level in their hands or at the robotics coordinator level in their hands. So we're excited about that because it gives them fast and easy access. It links into some of the other things you're talking about. We are building tools and capabilities that allow hospital departments and departments of surgery to manage their program and look across programmatics for efficiency, for learning for outcomes and these things interlink. 
So short answer there is just kind of a reminder of what we're trying to do. We think there is an opportunity to accelerate learning and to drive increased insight for a surgeon into their own progress. We're doing that as combination of My Intuitive plus some of the simulation work that we do, plus some of the machine learning and video analysis work that we do. We think there's an opportunity to look at correlations between surgeon performance and outcomes. And that has implications for the kind of imaging we do, it has implications for task analysis and we're doing those things, and those can be aggregated across a surgical platform. And there's a lot of opportunities for OR efficiencies and standardization, controlling operating costs, controlling consumables costs. Those things are ongoing now. 
So several of those things are in the markets, the very first kind of Gen 1, some of them are on Gen 2. Some of them are included in our service contracts, some of them are on a per use basis. Some of them are fully included because we feel like they make us more efficient and to make them more efficient. So we don't really call them out as individual revenue lines.

We've seen a few teams come out in field systems that are alternatives to ours. Transitory was out a few years ago and CMR has been out and now Medtronic. 
A couple of things I'd say. One is we are focused on making sure that our ecosystem, our products, our systems, everything goes around it really delivers against the quadruple lane all the way through. It's not just the robot. Building a great robot is a hard first step. You have to do it. And -- but right now, I think that remains to be seen how strong those other systems are. 
Even then, it's not enough. Instruments and accessories, training programs, support staff, analytics capability, publication, scientific publications, demonstrating what you've done, the analytics and evidence-based build are all, I think, important. So I'd encourage those folks on the call, it's likely to be a comparison of ecosystems in delivering a over time. That said, other teams are out. They're calling on customers. They're giving their PowerPoints about what they think is going to happen next and some other things. And our posture to that has been -- it may delay some sales, we may have some competitive conversations and tenders, and we'll lose some. 
What we've seen, though, is that what happens in the PowerPoints and what happens a year later is different. And that if it hasn't delivered against the quad, if these systems can do some cases well, but not all cases well or they have stability issues or other things, that wears in pretty quickly. We also find that our economic offerings with da Vinci X and EUP, we have choices that we ourselves can offer our customers. So I think all of you on the call, you should expect increased alternatives for the customer base. I think the noise levels will go up. I think our customers will take their time to evaluate new things as they go. We're okay. We're not frightened of that. We think we stand up pretty well to those comparisons, and we're ready to help them pursue their aims as it proceeds."

And so we watch that number because we know it's highly sensitive. And we're pleased. Again, if you look across that 2-year period, try to look through the pandemic kind of ups and downs, what we're seeing is that procedure demand is there. And the capital to support that demand has not run ahead of the procedure demand. In fact, our commentary is a little bit the opposite that these are being highly utilized. That's great. That says that we're not putting out more capital than folks need, even though it's been healthy capital quarters, it means our customers are getting good benefit out of what they're using those systems for. 
Jamie in his commentary said that a lot of those procedures are benign procedures, many of them are shorter duration than longer or more complex disease states. That means that utilization will go up kind of naturally that, that mix moves toward a higher utilization mix. All of that indicates that the business feels in balance. I'll caution that with the next couple of quarters or next 4 quarters looks like in terms of hospital access to capital and their decision-making. Capital is always lumpy. It has been. Just so really speaking backward-looking so far, so good."

Our second quarter 2021 performance was encouraging, with use of our systems for procedures growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and healthy capital placements. Looking at the past 8 quarters in context, our compound annual",1396,"Thank you for joining us today. 
Our second quarter 2021 performance was encouraging, with use of our systems for procedures growing beyond pre-pandemic levels and healthy capital placements. Looking at the past 8 quarters in context, our compound annual growth rate for procedures for the period Q2 2019 through Q2 2021 of 16.5% is approximately the growth we would have expected absent the pandemic. The pandemic has reordered the quarter in which procedures were performed, and we believe it has delayed some procedures that are likely to return in the future and may cause a small number of patients to permanently forgo surgery. 
To understand our system placement and capital performance over this period, we look to annual system utilization trends, which have recovered to utilization rates at the high end of our historical averages. Taken together, this combination of a recovery in procedures and healthy utilization supports our solid capital placement trends and rounds out a healthy commercial recovery year-to-date. 
Examining procedure trends more deeply. In the United States, procedure growth was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in bariatric surgery, hernia repair and cholecystectomy. Both gynecology and urology procedure annualized growth strengthened in the quarter, as pandemic pressures eased in the U.S. Annualized U.S. procedure growth rates are returning to historical levels for procedures with longer diagnostic pipelines as patients have started returning to screening and diagnostic testing. 
Growth in our second largest market, China, continued to be strong with multiple specialties contributing. European procedure growth was generally healthy, though varied by country. Recovery in the U.K. was healthy in the quarter as NHS increased access to surgeries broadly. The pandemic is not behind us and additional infection growth may again strain hospital resources and impact our results in the future. Jamie will take you through procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call. 
On the capital side, new system placements continue to be healthy, with the United States, China, Germany, France and Japan, notable in the quarter. We know that new system placements are closely tied to anticipated procedure volumes and system utilization in mature markets. We continue to see significant utilization variance by region due to pandemic differences. 
In the quarter, strong trade-ins of older generation systems for our fourth generation products and strength in multi-system deals, continue to support our thesis that customers that know us best continue to invest with us going forward. We also saw an increase in our IDN customers opening new da Vinci and Ion programs in hospitals within their network that did not previously have an Intuitive robotics program, indicating their interest in diversifying access to Intuitive programs across their networks. 
Looking to our finances in the quarter. Procedures recovered nicely in Q2, system placements came in above plan, and system ASP and I&A revenue per procedure tracked slightly above our expectations, together driving revenue of $1.46 billion in Q2. Our pro forma spending grew over 24% from a year ago, representing increased investment in our business. 
However, our expense growth rate was modestly lower than our plan, driven by pandemic-related factors.  COVID has delayed some work in R&D and clinical trials, leading to some underspend in programs, prototypes and some delay in hiring. We expect these programs to continue their ramp as our labs and development programs recover efficiency. 
Travel and associated costs in support of our field have also not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Field and marketing costs will tick up if the pandemic wanes. In short, our commercial business has recovered more quickly than our spending due to the different ways that pandemic impacts our customers, our supply chains and our hiring. Marshall will take you through our financial picture later in the call. 
Turning to our innovation and commercialization efforts. We are developing and deploying technology-enabled ecosystems to support our customers' pursuit of the Quadruple Aim, better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. We are in the execution and launch phase of 4 efforts. First, we are broadening access to our advanced instruments for our da Vinci Fourth Generation Multiport Systems through pursuit of additional clearances and launches outside the U.S. Second, we are expanding our da Vinci SP offering by broadening its regional and clinical indications and by adding it to its suite of instruments and accessories. Third, we are launching and refining our flexible diagnostic platform, Ion, by working with early customers to help establish high-performing sites and by improving our technology and supply chain capabilities. Finally, we are strengthening our digital capabilities across our ecosystem. 
Our fully integrated advanced instruments portfolio has been a strong addition to our multiport ecosystem, allowing for high-quality tissue interaction controlled from the surgeon's console while optimizing workflow. These system-controlled staplers, vessel sealers and energy instruments support a range of procedures from bariatrics to colorectal procedures, to thoracic and gynecologic applications. Customer appreciation and recurring use of our products has been growing nicely. 
In Q2, we launched our SureForm stapling line in India. We launched our Force bipolar energy instrument along with our extended use instruments program in Japan, and we launched our SynchroSeal energy instrument and E-100 energy generator in Korea. 
Turning to our single port system. We placed 4 SP systems in the quarter, bringing the total installed base to 79. SP procedures grew 133% year-over-year, with much of that growth coming from the United States. First cases in our SP colorectal IDE trial were completed in the quarter as we seek to bring SP capability to additional procedures. We are also working on our regulatory filings to bring SP to Europe under the European Union's new medical device regulation framework. 
Our flexible robotics program, first targeted towards diagnostic bronchoscopy, has had a strong quarter. We placed an additional 20 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 70. Ion procedures grew sixfold over Q2 2020 to nearly 1,500 procedures in the quarter, reflecting recovery from the pandemic, the growth in new sites and growth in utilization at existing sites. Our total Ion clinical experience is approximately 4,000 cases to date. Clinical trial sites completed enrollment for our PRECIsE clinical trial. Finally, our team is making good progress in scaling our operations. 
Lastly, we continue to digitally enhance our ecosystem. In the quarter, we continued to engage customers in data analytics and opportunity analysis for surgical programs, cornerstone of our Your Data, Your Truth analytics efforts. We have continued the launch of our My Intuitive app, including launching to first users in Europe. My Intuitive allows surgeons and care team members to access their data, to manage their profile, their learning and otherwise interact with Intuitive through an easy-to-use mobile app in the palm of their hand. Our digital learning programs continue to be an important part of our overall learning initiatives. These programs together trained over 2,200 care team members in the quarter, showing organizational strength and localizing programs and responding with agility to pandemic influenced demand. 
As the phases of the pandemic evolve, we're supporting our team in addressing the opportunities and challenges posed by the pandemic and the ways we work. Intuitive has managed multiple ways of working for many years. Roughly 1/3 of our team works in the manufacturer test and distribution of our products, another 1/3 works closely with customers in the field, and the remaining 1/3 have traditionally worked in lab and office environments. We're taking a first principles approach to return-to-office environments with our team, bringing back face-to-face interactions for those tasks best completed in person while enabling hybrid work environments for tasks that are well accomplished by distributed teams. 
Most of our offices globally are reopening with this hybrid approach. We anticipate iterating our approach as we learn and the year progresses. 
As I conclude, for the balance of the year, we're focused on the following: first, agile and flexible support for our customers globally as they need it, often addressing the return of surgical patients to treatment. Second, disciplined execution of our launches, including our advanced instruments, SP, Ion and digital efforts. Third, driving depth and excellence in regional performance, particularly in Europe and Asia. And finally, expanding our clinical, economic and analytical evidence base for key procedures and countries. 
I'll now turn the time over to Marshall to take you through our financial performance in greater detail."

I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. 
COVID had a significant impact on da Vinci procedure volumes in the second quarter of 2020. That impact was most pronounced in the U.S. and Europe, varied market to market, complicating year-over-year comparisons. In the U.S., as COVID continued to subside in the second quarter of 2021, we saw a lower impact on da Vinci procedures. Procedure growth in the U.S. was led by bariatric cholecystectomy and hernia procedures. We also believe that growth benefited from some procedures that were previously deferred due to delays in testing and patient concern over COVID. While there is likely some amount of backlog that has not yet been addressed, it is difficult to estimate the extent of the remaining backlog and when it will affect future procedure growth. 
In Europe, the impact of COVID in the second quarter of 2021 varied regionally with slower recovery in Italy and France, while we saw early stages of a recovery in the U.K. While there continues to be COVID hotspots within some of our Asia Pacific markets, overall procedures in the region performed well. China growth in the second quarter continued to be far higher than our other regions, primarily reflecting the 40% system installation growth over the past year. Jamie will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call. 
Hospitalizations of patients due to COVID have negatively impacted da Vinci procedures. To the extent that hospitalizations expand significantly due to COVID and its variants, like currently being experienced in parts of the world, it could negatively impact da Vinci procedures. 
Key business metrics for the second quarter were as follows: second quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 68% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and increased approximately 13% compared with last quarter. Compound annual growth between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 16.5%. 
Second quarter system placements of 328 systems increased 84% compared with 178 systems for the second quarter of 2020 and increased 10% compared with 298 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci Systems over the last year by 10% to approximately 6,335 systems. This growth rate compares with 9% last year and 8% last quarter. 
Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 55% compared with last year and increased 11% compared with last quarter. The compounded annual utilization growth rate between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 6%. 
Moving on to capital placements. System placements in the quarter reflected procedure growth and hospitals upgrading to -- in order to access or standardize on fourth-generation capabilities. Capital placements for the first 6 months of 2021 were in line with procedure and utilization growth. 
Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets. To the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases. The trade in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline over time. Leasing and alternative financing arrangements enable customer access to capital. While the percentage of systems placed under operating leases fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, we believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. 
Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending. And as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressures. 
Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: total second quarter revenue was $1.464 billion, representing a 72% increase from last year and a 13% increase from last quarter. The compound annual revenue growth rate between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 15%. Second quarter revenue reflected growth in both procedures and system placements. 
Leasing represented 33% of current quarter placements compared with 29% last year and 43% last quarter. In the quarter, we completed a number of placements with larger IDNs that prefer to purchase rather than lease product. Leasing as a percentage of total sales lag has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates. 
38% of systems placed in the second quarter involved trade-ins, which is lower than the 40% last year, and the 44% last quarter. As customers continue to upgrade to fourth generation capabilities, the population of installed SIs is decreasing, particularly in the U.S. were 110 trade-ins were completed in the second quarter, leaving an installed base of SIs of approximately 500 systems. As a result, we expect lower trade-in transactions over time. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. 
Second quarter system average selling prices decreased to $1.55 million from $1.65 million for both the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. The decrease relative to these prior periods reflects geographic mix and volume discounts provided to customers purchasing multiple systems. We recognized $26 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter compared with $9 million last year and $19 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. 
Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure of $1,940 increased compared with $1,900 per procedure for the second quarter of last year, and decreased compared with $1,950 per procedure in the first quarter. Extended use instruments were introduced into the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter, in most other markets in the first 6 months of this year, except China due to regulatory timelines. In the U.S. and Europe, extended use instruments were nearly fully adopted in the second quarter. The year-over-year increase in I&A revenue per procedure reflects increased usage of our advanced instruments, partially offset by the impact of extended use instruments. We believe that globally, customers have had not completely adjusted their instrument buying patterns to reflect the additional uses per instrument. Customer adjustment of buying patterns will reduce I&A revenue per procedure. 
4 of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP Systems, reflecting continued measured rollout of SP. Our installed base of SP Systems is now 79: 8 in Korea and 71 in the U.S. We completed first cases associated with a U.S. colorectal clinical trial in the second quarter. We placed 20 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 70 systems. There were nearly 1,500 Ion procedures completed in the second quarter. 
Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall system and procedure counts. The supply issues we called out in the first quarter did not impact Ion placements and procedures in this quarter. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain. 
Outside the U.S., we placed 115 systems in the second quarter compared with 72 in the second quarter of 2020 and 108 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 63 into Europe, 16 into Japan and 19 into China compared with 18 into Europe, 18 into Japan and 21 into China in the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 71.7% compared with 62.4% for the second quarter of 2020 and 71.8% last quarter. The second quarter of 2020 included $59 million of service credits issued in conjunction with our Customer Relief Program, higher period costs associated with lower production and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges. The first and second quarters of 2021 reflect leveraging fixed costs over higher production levels. 
Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products, while we carry safety stocks of critical components and are otherwise working to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, global shortages could result in higher production costs and production development and regulatory delays. 
Pro forma operating expenses increased 24% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and increased 5% compared with last quarter. The increase compared to prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount, increased variable compensation and increased spending in areas impacted by COVID. Second quarter spending was below our expectations due to activities restricted by COVID, including clinical development, marketing events and travel costs. In addition, COVID delayed some R&D work, resulting in underspend on prototypes. 
We expect spending on activities restricted by COVID to increase as the impacts of the pandemic decline. We also expect spending to increase as a percentage of revenue as investments in headcount, infrastructure and other support areas catch up to the growth in the business. Finally, we expect to continue to invest in expanding and accelerating our ecosystem of products and capabilities. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call. 
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%. In the second quarter, we modified the useful life of a deferred tax asset, which resulted in a current charge to pro forma income. However, that charge generated -- that change generated a long-term benefit of $66 million that is recognized currently in GAAP income and will be recognized ratably over approximately 10 years in pro forma income. The charge associated with the deferred tax asset and a higher mix of U.S. income drove the 25% current quarter pro forma rate. We expect our pro forma rate for the last 6 months of 2021 to be between 21% and 22% versus our previous guidance of 20% to 21%, reflecting a greater proportion of U.S. income for the year. 
Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items. Our second quarter pro forma net income was $477 million or $3.92 per share compared with $132 million or $1.11 per share for the second quarter of 2020 and $427 million or $3.52 per share for the last quarter. 
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $517 million or $4.25 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $68 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2020 and GAAP net income of $426 million or $3.51 per share for the last quarter. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.7 billion compared with $7.2 billion last quarter. The increase in cash in the second quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie."

Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 68% compared to a decline of 19% during the second quarter of 2020, which reflected a significant adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The compound annual growth rate between the seco",1294,"Good afternoon. 
Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 68% compared to a decline of 19% during the second quarter of 2020, which reflected a significant adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The compound annual growth rate between the second quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2021 was 16.5%. 
In Q2, U.S. procedures grew 77% year-over-year, which equates to 16% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. OUS markets grew 51% year-over-year or 19% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. In the U.S., Q2 procedure results were positively impacted by a continuing recovery from COVID-19, including, we believe, a number of procedures that had been previously deferred. Q2 growth was driven by particular strength in benign procedures, including bariatrics, hernia repair, cholecystectomy and benign hysterectomy, reflecting in part, we believe, a partial catch-up in these procedures related to the previous deferral of elective surgeries. 
General surgery growth in the U.S. was strong, and in addition to the positive impact from patient backlogs, reflected increasing access for surgeons to our fourth generation technology. In the U.S., procedures that are dependent on diagnostic pipelines also grew, albeit at lower rates as compared to benign procedures. Colorectal growth was strong, with solid growth in malignant hysterectomy, thoracic and prostatectomy procedures. Based on market data, we believe that diagnostic pipelines in the U.S. began to recover from the impact of the pandemic in March, with a lag in the recovery of associated procedures. 
Second quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 51% compared with a 7% decline for the second quarter of 2020 and 23% growth last quarter. Second quarter 2021 OUS procedure growth was driven by growth in prostatectomy procedures and earlier-stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery, gynecology and thoracic. 
China procedure growth remains strong and broad-based as a result of continued expansion of the installed base under the current quota. Growth in Japan was solid, but was impacted by a relatively slow rollout of vaccines and the impact of localized lockdowns as a result of ongoing efforts to prevent resurgences of COVID-19. In Europe, procedure growth varied by country based on the relative impact of and recovery from the pandemic. Growth in the U.K. was strong, with a slower recovery in France, Italy and Germany. 
Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. 
During the quarter, a group from the Shenzhen Hospital Naval Medical University in China, published a meta-analysis in BMC cancer comparing robotic-assisted thoracic surgery versus video-assisted thoracic surgery, or VATs, for lung lobectomy or segmentectomy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The meta-analysis combined 18 studies across different countries containing over 11,000 patients, of which just over 5,000 received da Vinci robotic-assisted thoracic surgery and just over 6,000 received VATs. 
The results of the meta-analysis found that robotic-assisted thoracic surgery compared to VATs was associated with, among others, the following significant findings: 50.4 milliliters lower blood loss, a 50% lower chance of conversion to an open procedure, a 1.1 day shorter stay in the hospital and a 10% less chance of patient experience to postoperative complication. The authors concluded, ""The results revealed that robotic-assisted thoracic surgery is a feasible and safe technique compared with VATs in terms of short-term and long-term outcomes"". 
In May of this year, Dr. Karl LeBlanc from our Lady of the Lake Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, published results from a multi-center study comparing short-term outcomes for incisional hernia, published in the Hernia Journal entitled Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic and Open Incisional Hernia Repair: Early Outcomes from the Prospective Hernia study. The study contains 371 patients that underwent an incisional hernia repair procedure across 17 institutions within the United States between May 2016 and September 2019. Of those patients, 43% were in the da Vinci robotic cohort, 35% in the laparoscopic cohort and 22% in the open cohort. 
In reporting the results, adjusted using a propensity weighted approach, the authors noted that during the 2- to 4-week standard of care visit period, fewer patients report the need to take prescription pain medication for the robotic cohort as compared to the laparoscopic and open cohorts: 65.2% for the robotic cohort as compared to 78.8% for the laparoscopic cohort compared to 79.8% for the open cohort. Conversion rates to open surgery were lower in the robotic group compared to the laparoscopic group, 0.6% as compared to 4.9% and reoperation rates in the 30 days post procedure were comparable between robotic and laparoscopic and lower for robotic as compared to open, 0.6% as compared to 3.1%. 
The authors concluded in part, ""When compared to open, the robotic-assisted surgery group is associated with a comparable operative time, shorter length of stay and lower reoperation rate through 30 days. The difference in the number of subjects reporting the need for prescription pain medication favored the robotic-assisted group in both comparisons.""
I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. We continue to operate in a challenging supply chain environment and have experienced longer lead times and delayed deliveries from our suppliers. While this did not have a material impact to our operating results in Q2, the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to supply constraints. 
We also note the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in certain geographies associated with the Delta variant. The outlook we are providing on today's call does not reflect risks associated with a significant increase in COVID-related hospitalizations in relation to the Delta variant or other potential new variants. 
Starting with procedures. Last quarter, we forecast 2021 procedure growth of 22% to 26%. Given the stronger recovery of procedures we have experienced so far, particularly in the U.S. and strength in U.S. general surgery, we are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 30%. The high end of the range assumes strength in U.S. general surgery, a return to normalized diagnostic pipelines, the vaccines are effective against any new COVID-19 variants and the vaccine rollouts in OUS markets continue as currently expected by governments around the world. 
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2021 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70% and 71% of revenue. We are now slightly increasing our forecast and expect full year gross profit margin to be between 70.5% and 71.5% of revenue. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, the impact of product cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and pricing pressure. 
With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast to grow full year pro forma 2021 operating expenses between 18% and 22% above 2020 levels. We are refining our estimate and expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 17% and 21%. Consistent with the last quarter's forecast, we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million and $470 million in 2021. 
We expect pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between $50 million and $55 million in 2021. With regard to income tax, we expect the range of our second half 2021 pro forma tax rate to be between 21% and 22% of pretax income, slightly higher than the range we provided on the last call, reflecting a higher mix of U.S. income. 
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions."

We kind of outlined what was assumed in the high end of the procedure guidance. From the low end perspective, the 27% reflected there is greater summer seasonality that reflects the possibility of an impact due to pent-up demand for vacation, especially for health care workers that have worked extensively during this period with COVID. It also reflects lower diagnostic pipelines and perhaps some reluctance for patients to visit hospitals. 
In there is OUS markets continue to be choppy given that, in many cases, those markets are behind the U.S., for example, in their vaccination rollouts, and that leaves the possibility of continued resurgences and localized lockdowns. That low end also reflects some impact of a resurgence in the U.S. But as you heard in our prepared comments, a significant increase in hospitalization is not reflected in the guidance range."

We rolled out the extended use instruments in Europe and the U.S. back in the fourth quarter. And then now we have rolled it out to most other markets in the first 6 months of this year, except for China where there are longer regulatory time lines. It's a short period, but we believe that there is elasticity, and we've seen elasticity in markets where reimbursements are very low. And we've received feedback -- positive feedback from surgeons who have indicated that system access has been a key driver for increased procedures. And we think that the extended use instruments lowers barriers for purchases of systems. 
Having said all of that, it's been a short period since they've had extended use instruments. Even though we've seen growth in the procedures that were specifically targeted by extended use instruments, it's hard to discern what is COVID-related versus what is not. And so we'll see over time, we'll be able to measure a little bit better over time, and we'll monitor it."

So that's a multi-quarter conversation. We're doing what we call the procedure development and the trial development around other indications, we think there'll be an opportunity in thoracic as well as other ones beyond it. 
The instrumentation updates, there are other things, imaging updates and software updates that are really all focused around right instruments, right features for the right extension or right expansion. So our customers are asking us for advanced instrumentation. So energy and stapling and other things, we think that is possible. So we're making those investments to move that forward. We think we can bring some outstanding imaging capabilities, including florescence imaging into that space. And we're building into the broader digital ecosystem for SP. 
Our focus right now is not rapid expansion of the installed base. Our focus is in clinical capability and productivity of the installed base we have. In other words, happy, very satisfied customers. And sequential growth in what they can do with the system remains our focus on SP for now."

The painful part is the investment troughs are deep in the early and middle years of those product cycles. And we're early in the Ion product cycle, and we're early in the SP or early mid in SP. So it takes a while. But once you develop a really capable ecosystem, then it has a lot of platform use and that investment can be recovered over time.

So when we talk about My Intuitive, that really is putting the power of interaction and data at the surgeon level in their hands or at the robotics coordinator level in their hands. So we're excited about that because it gives them fast and easy access. It links into some of the other things you're talking about. We are building tools and capabilities that allow hospital departments and departments of surgery to manage their program and look across programmatics for efficiency, for learning, for outcomes, and these things interlink. 
So short answer there is just kind of a reminder of what we're trying to do. We think there is an opportunity to accelerate learning and to drive increased insight for a surgeon into their own progress. We're doing that as a combination of My Intuitive plus some of the simulation work that we do, plus some of the machine learning and video analysis work that we do. We think there's an opportunity to look at correlations between surgeon performance and outcomes. And that has implications for the kind of imaging we do, it has implications for task analysis and training, and we're doing those things, and those can be aggregated across a surgical platform. And there's a lot of opportunities for OR efficiencies and standardization, controlling operating costs, controlling consumables costs. Those things are ongoing now. 
So several of those things are in the markets, the very first kind of Gen 1, some of them are on Gen 2. Some of them are included in our service contracts, some of them are on a per use basis. Some of them are fully included because we feel like they make us more efficient and to make them more efficient. So we don't really call them out as individual revenue lines. I think they are ecosystem enablers and can result in very high customer satisfaction when done well."

We've seen a few teams come out and field systems that are alternatives to ours. Transitory was out a few years ago and CMR has been out and now Medtronic. 
A couple of things I'd say. One is we are focused on making sure that our ecosystem, our products, our systems, everything goes around it really delivers against the Quadruple Aim all the way through. It's not just the robot. Building a great robot is a hard first step. You have to do it. And -- but right now, I think that remains to be seen how strong those other systems are. 
Even then, it's not enough. Instruments and accessories, training programs, support staff, analytics capability, publication, scientific publications demonstrating what you've done, the analytics and evidence-based build are all, I think, important. So I'd encourage those folks on the call, it's likely to be a comparison of ecosystems in delivering the Quad Aim over time. That said, other teams are out. They're calling on customers. They're giving their PowerPoints about what they think is going to happen next and some other things. And our posture to that has been -- it may delay some sales as we may have some competitive conversations and tenders, and we'll lose some. 
What we've seen, though, is that what happens in the PowerPoints and what happens a year later is different. And that if it hasn't delivered against the Quad Aim, if these systems can do some cases well, but not all cases well or they have stability issues or other things, that wears in pretty quickly. We also find that our economic offerings with da Vinci X and EUP, we have choices that we ourselves can offer our customers. 
So I think all of you on the call, you should expect increased alternatives for the customer base. I think the noise levels will go up. I think our customers will take their time to evaluate new things as they go. We're okay. We're not frightened of that. We think we stand up pretty well to those comparisons, and we're ready to help them pursue their aims as the year proceeds."

And so we watch that number because we know it's highly sensitive. And we're pleased. Again, if you look across that 2-year period, try to look through the pandemic kind of ups and downs, what we're seeing is that procedure demand is there. And the capital to support that demand has not run ahead of the procedure demand. 
In fact, our commentary is a little bit the opposite that these are being highly utilized. That's great. That says that we're not putting out more capital than folks need, even though it's been healthy capital quarters, it means our customers are getting good benefit out of what they're using those systems for. 
Jamie in his commentary said that a lot of those procedures are benign procedures, many of them are shorter duration than longer or more complex disease states. That means that utilization will go up kind of naturally, that, that mix moves toward a higher utilization mix. All of that, to me, indicates that the business feels in balance. I'll caution that what the next couple of quarters or next 4 quarters looks like in terms of hospital access to capital and their decision-making, capital is always lumpy. It has been. Just so really speaking backward-looking, so far, so good."

The rise of the Delta variant and stresses in some hospitals pressured the demand for surgery. Global supply chain disruption has yet to abate, necessitating redirection of internal resources to continue to meet our customers' demand. Despite these challenges, growth in the use of our products continued in the quarter and capital demand remained robust. Our new platforms advanced in their commercialization in their innovation and in their clinical programs.
Turning first to procedures. The increased COVID burden tempered the recovery we saw in the second quarter, particularly in the month of August. The impact of the Delta variant drove procedures in the United States below our expectations at the start of the quarter with run rate stabilizing the last couple of weeks of September.
Adoption continues in the United States, driven particularly by benign general surgery procedures, including bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Trends and malignant procedures remain solid, including prostatectomy, hysterectomy lobectomy and colon resection.
Two trends that have emerged over the past few years are the increased use of da Vinci in benign procedures and rising use of our advanced instrumentation and targeted procedures. Both are the result of focusing on our customers' needs and delivering product and economic solutions to match.
Outside the United States, procedure performance varied as a function of regional pandemic impact. In China, growth in the quarter was strong and spanned multiple specialties, reflecting continued adoption. In Japan and Korea, our procedure business remains healthy with slight sequential procedure growth Q2 to Q3 despite code-related surgery disruption. Germany, the U.K. and France had reasonable year-over-year procedure growth, and our customers are having success in diversifying procedure categories beyond urology.
Regarding the capital environment, new system placements continue to be robust. The United States had an outstanding capital quarter with a balanced mix of hospitals new to da Vinci as well as healthy incremental placements for existing customers and trade-ins of older technology. This performance has been driven by collaboration with U.S. integrated delivery networks as they thoughtfully manage and expand the capacity of their da Vinci fleets. Elsewhere, China, Japan and Europe had solid placements in the quarter, and our placements in Brazil showed strength.
Turning to our newer platforms. Our single port system, da Vinci SP, had a solid quarter as we pursue additional indications. Placements of our flexible bronchoscopy platform, Ion, grew nicely sequentially Q2 to Q3 and powered by continued strong customer experiences in the field.
Our finances were strong again this quarter, though they followed an unusual path. System strength and favorable system sales mix drove strong system revenue. Procedures grew at the low end of our expectations as a result of the Delta variant. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure moved down modestly as benign procedures continue to make up more of the procedure mix and our extended use instrument program reaches equilibrium in the field.
Our spending grew sequentially and year-over-year as we continue to invest in expanding our new platforms and digital programs as well as build our go-to-market capabilities globally. Our expense growth was again modestly lower than planned, driven by some increase in time to fill open positions in a tight labor market, lower travel-related spending given the pandemic and some underspending and prototypes. We will continue to invest in programs that fulfill the mission and built the company.
Turning to our innovation efforts. We develop and deploy technology-enabled solutions to support our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim, better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode.
I'd like to take a moment to overview the clinical status of our programs. For our da Vinci system, there are now over 9.7 million lifetime procedures performed with over 28,000 peer-reviewed clinical publications. Da Vinci X and XI now have over 70 representative clinical uses, allowing broad use across multiple clinical specialties, from urology to gynecology, thoracic surgery, general surgery and transoral surgery.
Tens of thousands of surgeons routinely use our multiport systems. We continue to invest in our multiport products, instruments and services to further expand their capabilities and indications. Leading surgeons continue to work with us to pursue new learning with several prospective studies ongoing.
Our flexible bronchoscopy system, Ion, continues to build momentum clinically and commercially with several presentations and manuscripts updating Ion clinical progress at the 2021 CHEST conference this weekend. As described in yesterday's press release, early clinical trial results point to outstanding capability, allowing for definitive diagnosis of hard-to-reach lung lesions. Our teams are hard at work building our manufacturing and supply capabilities to meet rising demand.
Our single port system, SP has a clinical database of 28 peer-reviewed clinical publications. There are currently several ongoing prospective studies for SP in Korea and the United States, including our IDE trial for colorectal indications. This quarter, we received FDA approval of our uniportal thoracic IDE. Broad SP adoption will be paced by additional regional and clinical clearances, which remain our focus for the SP program.
Our digital solutions provide data-driven insights to surgeons, operative services and hospital administration. From virtual reality training to efficiency insights to custom comparative outcomes analysis, these tools are now routinely employed by our customers and our teams to improve programs. Our analytics program supported thousands of customers in the quarter.
Turning to machine learning. Our teams are at the leading edge of ML-based clinical science for surgery. Through our collaborations with leading academic centers, informing algorithmic and scientific discovery. Taken together, these programs allow our customers to quantify our collective impact on the quadruple aim, core to our mission.
Before turning the time over to Marshall, today, we announced some changes in responsibilities of our senior executive team. These changes are the result of a structured process over the past few years, and they are driven by our need to support growth in our product lines, commercial reach, operations capabilities and business infrastructure as we scale to meet the global opportunity to advance minimally invasive care.
Starting January 1, 2022, our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Dave Rosa, will take on an important new role of Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, leading our efforts to identify and realize long-term business opportunities, continuing to build the value of our integrated product offerings, and ensuring our customers clearly understand the value of our ecosystem in creating successful minimally invasive programs.
Henry Charlton, currently General Manager of the U.S. and Europe will succeed Dave as Chief Commercial Officer, overseeing global commercial sales, regional marketing and commercial enablement. Also, Marshall Mohr will take on an important new position that is Executive Vice President, Global Business Services. Leading Intuitive's continued growth in information technology and enterprise process, data and systems and global facilities.
Jamie Samath will succeed Marshall as Chief Financial Officer. They are each outstanding proven leaders and will report to me. We expect them to spearhead our efforts to achieve our mission and continue to position Intuitive as first choice of our customers in a growing marketplace.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through our financial highlights in greater detail."

I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. The information in our earnings release and within our prepared remarks, reflects the 3-for-1 stock split completed earlier in October.
Overall, third quarter procedures grew 20% year-over-year and reflected the impact of Delta variant resurgence. COVID also impacted third quarter 2020 procedures, making year-over-year comparisons complicated. In the U.S., procedures grew 16%, reflecting the impact the COVID resurgence had on hospital resources regionally.
The impact of the resurgence was most pronounced in August and early September, and regionally, in the South and Southeast. Later in the quarter, as COVID cases began to slow, procedures began to recover. However, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which this resurgence or future resurgences will impact da Vinci procedures.
Year-over-year OUS procedures grew 30%, with the impact of COVID varying regionally. In Europe, COVID had a greater impact in Italy and France and less in U.K. and Germany. While there are continued to be COVID hotspots within some of our Asia Pacific markets, overall procedures in the region performed well. China growth in the third quarter continued to be far higher than other regions, primarily reflecting system installation growth over the past year.
Relative to the beginning of the pandemic, many hospitals are able to better manage increased COVID patient hospitalization. However, staffing shortages and hospital supply chain issues are challenging in challenging some hospital capacities and could impact deferrable procedures, including da Vinci procedures going forward. Jamie will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call.
Key business metrics for the third quarter were as follows: third quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 20% compared with third quarter 2020 and decreased approximately 3% compared with last quarter, compound annual growth between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 13.5%; third quarter system placements of 336 systems increased 72% compared with 195 systems for the third quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with 328 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base da Vinci systems over the last year by 11% to approximately 6,525 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% last year and 10% last quarter.
Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system increased approximately 9% compared with last year and decreased 6% compared with last quarter. The compounded annual utilization growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 3%.
Moving on to capital placement. System placements in the quarter reflected a continued trend of IDN multisystem purchases and were driven by procedure growth and hospitals upgrading in order to access or standardize on fourth-generation capabilities. Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets. To the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases.
The trade-in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline over time. Leasing and alternative financing arrangements enable customer access to our system. While the percentage of systems placed under operating leases fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, we believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact the hospital capital spending. And as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressures.
Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Third quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, representing a 30% increase from last year and a 4% decrease from the last quarter. The compound annual revenue growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 12%; the year-over-year revenue increase reflected growth in both procedures and system placements. The decrease relative to the second quarter of 2021 reflects lower instrument and accessory revenue associated with lower procedures and increased leasing as a percentage of placements.
Leasing represented 41% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last year and 33% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates.
40% of systems placed in the third quarter involved trade-ins, which is consistent with the 40% last year, and higher than the 38% last quarter. As customers continue to upgrade to fourth generation capabilities, the population of installed SIs is decreasing, particularly in U.S., where 97 trade-ins were completed in the third quarter leaving an installed base of SIs of approximately 425 systems. As a result, we expect lower trade out transactions over time. Trading activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict.
Third quarter average selling prices increased to $1.57 million from $1.55 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. Average selling prices will fluctuate with geographic and product mix. Consistent with historical patterns, we expect a higher mix and systems sold to distributors in the fourth quarter, which carry lower prices.
We recognized $25 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared with $17 million last year and $26 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure of $1,900 decreased slightly compared with $1,910 per procedure for the third quarter of last year and decreased compared with $1,940 per procedure in the second quarter. The year-over-year change reflects increased usage of extended use instruments, mostly offset by increased usage of our advanced instruments. The decrease from the previous quarter reflects customers continuing to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reflect the additional uses per instrument included in extended use instruments.
10 of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems. Our installed base of SP systems is now 89, 10 in Korea and 79 in the U.S. We continue our measured rollout of SP as we work on gathering clinical data to gain additional procedure clearances in the U.S.
We placed 28 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 98 systems. There were approximately 2,000 Ion procedures completed in the third quarter. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall da Vinci system and procedure counts. Our rollout of Ion is progressing well.
Outside the U.S., we placed 109 systems in the third quarter compared with 79% in the third quarter of 2020 and 115 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 47 into Europe, 20 into Japan in 17 into China compared with 39 into Europe, 15 into Japan and 12 into China in the third quarter of 2020. We also placed 9 systems in Brazil in the third quarter and now have placed 23 systems in Brazil over the past 4 quarters.
Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 71.3% in compared with 70.2% for the third quarter of 2020 and 71.7% last quarter. The third quarter of 2020 included $23 million of service credits issued in conjunction with our customer relief program, higher period costs associated with lower production levels and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges.
The decline in gross margin relative to the second quarter primarily reflects product mix. Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins. COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While to date, we've been able to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, our teams are expending significant time and effort to bridge future supply with demand.
To date, we have experienced immaterial component increase -- cost increases in freight expedition fees. However, global shortages could result in future supply disruption as well as delayed development and regulatory activities. We also expect supply issues to result in higher production costs.
Pro forma operating expenses increased 21% compared with the third quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with last quarter. The increase compared to the prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount, increased variable compensation and increased spending in areas impacted by COVID. Third quarter spending was below our expectations due to delays in headcount hiring and lower spending on activities restricted by COVID, including clinical development, marketing events and travel costs.
In addition, COVID delayed some R&D work resulting in under spend on prototypes. We expect spending on activities restricted by COVID to increase as the impacts of the pandemic decline. We also expect spending to increase as a percentage of revenue as investments in headcount, infrastructure and other support areas catch up to the growth of the business. Finally, we expect to continue to invest in expanding and accelerating our ecosystem of products and capabilities. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%. We recorded expense of $11 million associated with periods prior to 2020 related to guidance recently provided by the IRS associated with stock-based compensation. We expect our pro forma tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 21.5%. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items.
Our third quarter pro forma net income was $435 million or $1.19 per share compared with $334 million or $0.92 per share for the third quarter of 2020 and $477 million or $1.31 per share for the last quarter. Third quarter 2021 and 2020 included pretax gains of approximately $8 million and $62 million associated with investments in companies that resulted from development agreements entered into in prior years.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $381 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $314 million or $0.87 per share for the third quarter of 2020, and GAAP net income of $517 million or $1.42 per share for last quarter.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.2 billion compared with $7.7 billion last quarter. The increase in cash in the third quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie."
30239,1678084231,2407641,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marshall. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was approximately 20% and compared to growth of 7% during the third quarter of 2020. Q3 procedure growth reflected 16% growth in U.S. procedures and 30% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S. pro",1418,"Thank you, Marshall. Our overall third quarter procedure growth was approximately 20% and compared to growth of 7% during the third quarter of 2020. Q3 procedure growth reflected 16% growth in U.S. procedures and 30% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S. procedures in Q3 were adversely impacted by an increase in COVID-related hospitalizations due to the Delta variant. Procedures were particularly impacted in those states with relatively lower vaccination rates.
As the number of COVID-related hospitalizations peaked and began to improve in September, we saw U.S. procedures start to recover. Q3 growth reflected relative strength in bariatrics procedures, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. In the more mature procedure categories, year-over-year growth in prostatectomy was strong relative to historical averages and benign hysterectomy grew in the low single-digit range.
Third quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 30% compared with 9% growth for the third quarter of 2020. Third quarter 2021 OUS procedures were driven by growth in prostatectomy and earlier stage growth in general surgery, gynecology, kidney cancer procedures and thoracic surgery. China procedure growth remained strong and broad-based as a result of continued expansion of the installed base under the current quota and the addition and training of surgeons new to the da Vinci platform.
Growth in Japan was solid but was impacted by localized lockdowns stemming from ongoing efforts to prevent resurgences of COVID. Growth in Korea was also solid, primarily driven by gynecology, urology and head and neck procedures. A little more than half of the procedures in these 3 key Asian markets are outside of urology.
In Europe, procedure growth varied by country based on the relative impact of the Delta variant, and the impact of COVID-related mitigation measures. Growth in the U.K. and Germany was solid with procedure growth in France and Italy impacted by reduced capacity for surgery as hospitals reserved resources for potential increases in COVID patients.
During Q3, customers in the U.S. and Europe effectively consumed their remaining inventory of 10-life instruments following the launch of extended use instruments in those regions in Q4 of last year. With this full adoption, in the U.S., customers are benefiting from I&A per procedure costs that reduced by approximately 10% in lower acuity procedures such as cholecystectomy and hernia repair. In Europe, customers are benefiting from an even larger reduction in INA costs for targeted procedures.
While recent procedure trends are confounded by the various waves of the pandemic, we believe, based on customer feedback with the adoption of extended use instruments is having a positive impact on targeted procedures. In our new platform, Ion procedures increased almost fourfold as compared to Q3 of 2020, driven by a significant expansion of the number of systems at customers and an increase in usage in the existing installed base. Our single port platform, which is gated by additional regional and clinical clearances showed solid performance with almost 50% year-over-year procedure growth.
Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.
During the quarter, Dr. Michael Kent from Beth Israel Deaconess Center Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, published results from a landmark multi-sensor pulmonary, open, robotic and thoracoscopic lobectomy or portal study in the annals of surgery. This retrospective study sponsored by Intuitive compared lobectomy outcomes associated with open VATS and robotic-assisted da Vinci surgery with over 6,000 cases included in this analysis.
After one-to-one propensity score matching, a comparison of open and da Vinci lobectomies with approximately 800 patients in each group should a 2-day shorter length of stay and a 9.5% lower rate of prolonged hospital stay associated with da Vinci lobectomy. The da Vinci cohort also had an approximately 8-minute short-term OR time for cases without a concomitant procedure. Postoperative complications were approximately 9% lower with the da Vinci robotic approach.
With regards to the propensity score match comparison of minimally invasive approaches, with over 1,700 patients in each group. The da Vinci approach evidenced a 1.1 day short of mean length of stay and a 6.1% low rate of conversion to thoracotomy when compared to vats, with the differences in conversion rates reported for each tumor stage in the analysis.
The authors concluded in part, ""in this retrospective multi-institutional data analysis both robotic-assisted and vasilabectomy were associated with improved perioperative outcomes compared to open lobectomy."" Robotic-assisted tabectomy was associated with additional differences compared to VATS such as a reduced length of stay and conversion rate.
In August of this year, Professor Umberto Bacali from the University of Naples Federico, the second in Naples, Italy, published a systematic review with metro analysis of transversus abdominis release or TAR for ventral hernia repair, assessing short-term outcomes of the open and robotic-assisted approaches. The metro analysis combined 6 studies containing over 800 patients, of which just over 200 patients underwent robotic-assisted da Vinci surgery and just under 600 patients who we went the open approach. Results of this metro analysis found that the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 4.4 day shorter length of stay, 64% lower risk of postoperative complications and 79% lower risk of developing systemic complications. Readmission and reoperations were comparable between both groups.
The office concluded in part, ""Based on the data from the meta analysis, the robotic approach for TAR seems safe and feasible even in more difficult cases. Robotic-assisted TAR shows the common advantages of minimally invasive procedures that improve short-term outcomes with significant benefits in the early postoperative period.""
Lastly, as noted in yesterday's press release, preliminary results from the PRECISE study evaluating outcomes associated with the Ion and Illumina system were presented at the annual CHEST conference. This preliminary analysis of 69 subjects showed a diagnostic yield of 83% with a sensitivity of malignancy of 84% to 88% from the biopsy of peripheral pulmonary nodules with a mean size of 17 millimeters. These initial outcomes regarding the performance of the Ion system are encouraging, and we look forward to the full study being published in the second half of 2022.
I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. During Q3, we experienced a more challenging supply chain environment with a deterioration in on-time delivery performance from our suppliers. We also saw increased supply chain costs. While this did not have a material impact to our operating results in Q3, the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to supply constraints.
Starting with procedures. Last quarter, we forecast 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 30%. Given Q3 results and the impact of the Delta variant we are now narrowing our forecast and expect full year 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 29%. This procedure outlook does not reflect a significant impact from OR staffing shortages or a resurgence of COVID-19. The high end of the range assumes the COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the U.S. continued the recovery that began in September and that COVID-related mitigation measures in OUS markets continue to ease.
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2021 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70.5% and 71.5% of revenue. We now expect 2021 pro forma gross profit margin to be within 71% and 71.5% of revenue. This range does not reflect any significant disruption associated with the current supply chain challenges. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix the impact of product cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and competitive pricing pressure.
With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast to grow full year pro forma 2021 operating expenses between 17% and 21% above 2020 levels. We are refining our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 17% and 19%. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million and $460 million in 2021. With regard to pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, we expect a range of between $50 million and $55 million in 2021. Finally, with respect to income tax, -- We expect our Q4 2021 pro forma tax rate to be approximately 21.5% of pretax income.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions."

But there is a risk and it's a real risk. And so we call it out to make sure that everybody is aware of that. From the perspective of cost, we saw some cost -- increased material costs last quarter, they were not significant. And we also incurred expediting fees associated with freight, again, not material.
But going forward, we do expect cost, increased cost that will probably hit the margin in Q4 or Q1. It's hard to predict exactly how much. And so I think that kind of summarizes it for you. It's a difficult environment right now."

I would say this, what's reflected in the high end of our procedure guidance is really 2 things that COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the U.S. continue the recovery that began in September, and that was kind of in the middle part of September that recovery commenced. So there's a progression there that continues through Q4.
It also assumes that the mitigation measures in OUS markets, which are typically a little more conservative than we see in the U.S. continue to ease. And those also start to ease in September. At the low end, what we see is a slower recovery in the U.S. from what we saw in Q3 and choppiness OUS in terms of kind of the on off of mitigation measures in various markets. And so that range of 27% to 29% that we provided really is just a function of the rate at which we recover from what occurred in Q3 with the Delta variants."

I mean, certainly, when the headline numbers when you look at other studies, it's a good number, but I'm just curious, is this the point where the market vacant to these numbers and should we see an inflection in adoption of Ion?
And just one quick one on 3Q. I know you called out the delta, but was there any labor shortage impact in 3Q itself? Because historically, we haven't seen the pandemic impact where Intuitive has outperformed peers. It just perhaps a little excessive in 3Q. Was there something else going on?"

On the first one, in terms of diagnostic yield, you had said 82%.

On the first one, in terms of diagnostic yield, you had said 82%. And I guess what I'd advise everybody is -- There's a couple of numbers that are important and they stay linked together, and that is what is the size of the lesion? And then what's the positive diagnostic rate ability to definitively diagnose? That's what the interventional pulmonologists are looking at.
So the bigger the lesion, if it's 3-centimeter lesion, your diagnostic yield rate is going to go up, your definitive dock because it's easier to hit. So you got to look at both numbers. It's not a single metric. So 82% for smaller lesions is leading as far as I can tell, for endobronchial approaches for that approach. Some folks can get to higher yield rates, but they're hitting bigger targets. So you need to look at both, and that's what I encourage you to do.
The second thing that I'd advise you is that there are other ways to examine or get a biopsy. There can be outside the body, CT-guided needle biopsies. And those outside the body CT needle-guided needle biopsies have high success rates at gathering the tissue, but they have a lower safety profile than in the bronchial approach. So there's kind of a third dimension, which is, did you get the tissue you needed to get a definitive diagnosis? How big was the lesion you were trying to target? And what was the complication rate?
And we think that Ion is really good at managing all 3 of those relative to competitive approaches, and we're seeing a nice uptick as a result. And is that a tipping point? We'll see. So far so good. That's what we had expected. This kind of performance, that's what we were targeting. But we're pleased to see it being borne out over multiple sites and multiple customers, and we think that's going to be helpful.
With regard to your second question, you were talking a little bit about are we seeing an unusual or more aggressive slowdown because of Delta than perhaps others. What I'd encourage you to think about there is where in the world everybody is exposed and where they're seeing their growth. So in our case, we have a certain regional profile and where our procedures are being done. Other companies may have much bigger exposure to, say, markets or countries that had a lower impact having to do with Delta. Frankly, I think as simple as that, but time will tell on that as well.
So let's go ahead and conclude. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care.
We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It follows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months."

The rise of the Delta variant and stresses in some hospitals pressured the demand for surgery. Global supply chain disruption has yet to abate, necessitating redirection of internal resources to continue to meet our customers' demand. Despite these challenges, growth in the use of our products continued in the quarter and capital demand remained robust. Our new platforms advanced in their commercialization, in their innovation and in their clinical programs.
Turning first to procedures. The increased COVID burden tempered the recovery we saw in the second quarter, particularly in the month of August. The impact of the Delta variant drove procedures in the United States below our expectations at the start of the quarter with run rate stabilizing the last couple of weeks of September.
Adoption continues in the United States driven particularly by benign general surgery procedures, including bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Trends in malignant procedures remain solid, including prostatectomy, hysterectomy, lobectomy and colon resection.
Two trends that have emerged over the past few years are the increased use of da Vinci in benign procedures and rising use of our advanced instrumentation in targeted procedures. Both are the result of focusing on our customers' needs and delivering product and economic solutions to match.
Outside the United States, procedure performance varied as a function of regional pandemic impact. In China, growth in the quarter was strong and spanned multiple specialties, reflecting continued adoption. In Japan and Korea, our procedure business remains healthy with slight sequential procedure growth Q2 to Q3 despite COVID-related surgery disruption. Germany, the U.K. and France had reasonable year-over-year procedure growth, and our customers are having success in diversifying procedure categories beyond urology.
Regarding the capital environment, new system placements continue to be robust. The United States had an outstanding capital quarter with a balanced mix of hospitals new to da Vinci as well as healthy incremental placements for existing customers and trade-ins of older technology. This performance has been driven by collaboration with U.S. integrated delivery networks as they thoughtfully manage and expand the capacity of their da Vinci fleets. Elsewhere, China, Japan and Europe had solid placements in the quarter, and our placements in Brazil showed strength.
Turning to our newer platforms. Our single port system, da Vinci SP, had a solid quarter as we pursue additional indications. Placements of our flexible bronchoscopy platform, Ion, grew nicely sequentially Q2 to Q3, powered by continued strong customer experiences in the field.
Our finances were strong again this quarter, though they followed an unusual path. System strength and favorable system sales mix drove strong system revenue. Procedures grew at the low end of our expectations as a result of the Delta variant. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure moved down modestly as benign procedures continue to make up more of the procedure mix and our extended use instrument program reaches equilibrium in the field.
Our spending grew sequentially and year-over-year as we continue to invest in expanding our new platforms and digital programs as well as build our go-to-market capabilities globally. Our expense growth was again modestly lower than planned, driven by some increase in time to fill open positions in a tight labor market, lower travel-related spending given the pandemic and some underspending in prototypes. We will continue to invest in programs that fulfill the mission and build the company.
Turning to our innovation efforts. We develop and deploy technology-enabled solutions to support our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim: better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode.
I'd like to take a moment to overview the clinical status of our programs. For our da Vinci system, there are now over 9.7 million lifetime procedures performed with over 28,000 peer-reviewed clinical publications. Da Vinci X and Xi now have over 70 representative clinical uses, allowing broad use across multiple clinical specialties, from urology, to gynecology, thoracic surgery, general surgery and transoral surgery.
Tens of thousands of surgeons routinely use our multiport systems. We continue to invest in our multiport products, instruments and services to further expand their capabilities and indications. Leading surgeons continue to work with us to pursue new learning with several prospective studies ongoing.
Our flexible bronchoscopy system, Ion, continues to build momentum clinically and commercially with several presentations and manuscripts updating Ion clinical progress at the 2021 CHEST conference this weekend. As described in yesterday's press release, early clinical trial results point to outstanding capability, allowing for definitive diagnosis of hard-to-reach lung lesions. Our teams are hard at work building our manufacturing and supply capabilities to meet rising demand.
Our single port system, SP, has a clinical database of 28 peer-reviewed clinical publications. There are currently several ongoing prospective studies for SP in Korea and the United States, including our IDE trial for colorectal indications. This quarter, we received FDA approval of our uniportal thoracic IDE. Broad SP adoption will be paced by additional regional and clinical clearances, which remain our focus for the SP program.
Our digital solutions provide data-driven insights to surgeons, operative services and hospital administration. From virtual reality training, to efficiency insights, to custom comparative outcomes analysis, these tools are now routinely employed by our customers and our teams to improve programs. Our analytics program supported thousands of customers in the quarter.
Turning to machine learning. Our teams are at the leading edge of ML-based clinical science for surgery through our collaborations with leading academic centers, informing algorithmic and scientific discovery. Taken together, these programs allow our customers to quantify our collective impact on the quadruple aim, core to our mission.
Before turning the time over to Marshall, today, we announced some changes in responsibilities of our senior executive team. These changes are the result of a structured process over the past few years, and they are driven by our need to support growth in our product lines, commercial reach, operations capabilities and business infrastructure as we scale to meet the global opportunity to advance minimally invasive care.
Starting January 1, 2022, our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Dave Rosa, will take on an important new role of Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, leading our efforts to identify and realize long-term business opportunities, continuing to build the value of our integrated product offerings and ensuring our customers clearly understand the value of our ecosystem in creating successful minimally invasive programs.
Henry Charlton, currently General Manager of the U.S. and Europe, will succeed Dave as Chief Commercial Officer, overseeing global commercial sales, regional marketing and commercial enablement. Also, Marshall Mohr will take on an important new position as Executive Vice President, Global Business Services, leading Intuitive's continued growth in information technology, enterprise process, data and systems and global facilities. Jamie Samath will succeed Marshall as Chief Financial Officer.
They are each outstanding proven leaders and will report to me. We expect them to spearhead our efforts to achieve our mission and continue to position Intuitive as first choice of our customers in a growing marketplace.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through our financial highlights in greater detail."

The information in our earnings release and within our prepared remarks reflects the 3-for-1 stock split completed earlier in October.
Overall, third quarter procedures grew 20% year-over-year and reflected the impact of Delta variant resurgence. COVID also impacted third quarter 2020 procedures, making year-over-year comparisons complicated. In the U.S., procedures grew 16%, reflecting the impact the COVID resurgence had on hospital resources regionally.
The impact of the resurgence was most pronounced in August and early September, and regionally, in the South and Southeast. Later in the quarter, as COVID cases began to slow, procedures began to recover. However, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which this resurgence or future resurgences will impact da Vinci procedures.
Year-over-year OUS procedures grew 30%, with the impact of COVID varying regionally. In Europe, COVID had a greater impact in Italy and France and less in U.K. and Germany. While there continued to be COVID hotspots within some of our Asia Pacific markets, overall procedures in the region performed well. China growth in the third quarter continued to be far higher than other regions, primarily reflecting system installation growth over the past year.
Relative to the beginning of the pandemic, many hospitals are able to better manage increased COVID patient hospitalization. However, staffing shortages and hospital supply chain issues are challenging some hospital capacities and could impact deferrable procedures, including da Vinci procedures going forward. Jamie will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call.
Key business metrics for the third quarter were as follows: third quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 20% compared with third quarter 2020 and decreased approximately 3% compared with last quarter, compound annual growth between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 13.5%, third quarter system placements of 336 systems increased 72% compared with 195 systems for the third quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with 328 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 11% to approximately 6,525 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% last year and 10% last quarter.
Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 9% compared with last year and decreased 6% compared with last quarter. The compounded annual utilization growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 3%.
Moving on to capital placement. System placements in the quarter reflected a continued trend of IDN multisystem purchases and were driven by procedure growth and hospitals upgrading in order to access or standardize on fourth-generation capabilities. Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets. To the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases.
The trade-in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline over time. Leasing and alternative financing arrangements enable customer access to our systems. While the percentage of systems placed under operating leases fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, we believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending. And as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressures.
Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Third quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, representing a 30% increase from last year and a 4% decrease from the last quarter. The compound annual revenue growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 12%. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected growth in both procedures and system placements. The decrease relative to the second quarter of 2021 reflects lower instrument and accessory revenue associated with lower procedures and increased leasing as a percentage of placements.
Leasing represented 41% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last year and 33% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates.
40% of systems placed in the third quarter involved trade-ins, which is consistent with the 40% last year and higher than the 38% last quarter. As customers continue to upgrade to fourth-generation capabilities, the population of installed Sis is decreasing, particularly in U.S., where 97 trade-ins were completed in the third quarter, leaving an installed base of Sis of approximately 425 systems. As a result, we expect lower trade-out transactions over time. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict.
Third quarter average selling prices increased to $1.57 million from $1.55 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. Average selling prices will fluctuate with geographic and product mix. Consistent with historical patterns, we expect a higher mix of systems sold to distributors in the fourth quarter which carry lower prices.
We recognized $25 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared with $17 million last year and $26 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure of $1,900 decreased slightly compared with $1,910 per procedure for the third quarter of last year and decreased compared with $1,940 per procedure in the second quarter. The year-over-year change reflects increased usage of extended use instruments, mostly offset by increased usage of our advanced instruments. The decrease from the previous quarter reflects customers continuing to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reflect the additional uses per instrument included in extended use instruments.
10 of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems. Our installed base of SP systems is now 89, 10 in Korea and 79 in the U.S. We continue our measured rollout of SP as we work on gathering clinical data to gain additional procedure clearances in the U.S.
We placed 28 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 98 systems. There were approximately 2,000 Ion procedures completed in the third quarter. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall da Vinci system and procedure counts. Our rollout of Ion is progressing well.
Outside the U.S., we placed 109 systems in the third quarter compared with 79 in the third quarter of 2020 and 115 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 47 into Europe, 20 into Japan and 17 into China compared with 39 into Europe, 15 into Japan and 12 into China in the third quarter of 2020. We also placed 9 systems in Brazil in the third quarter and now have placed 23 systems in Brazil over the past 4 quarters.
Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 71.3% compared with 70.2% for the third quarter of 2020 and 71.7% last quarter. The third quarter of 2020 included $23 million of service credits issued in conjunction with our Customer Relief Program, higher period costs associated with lower production levels and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges.
The decline in gross margin relative to the second quarter primarily reflects product mix. Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins.
COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While to date, we've been able to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, our teams are expending significant time and effort to bridge future supply with demand. To date, we have experienced immaterial component cost increases and freight expedition fees. However, global shortages could result in future supply disruption as well as delayed development and regulatory activities. We also expect supply issues to result in higher production costs.
Pro forma operating expenses increased 21% compared with the third quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with last quarter. The increase compared to the prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount, increased variable compensation and increased spending in areas impacted by COVID. Third quarter spending was below our expectations due to delays in headcount hiring and lower spending on activities restricted by COVID, including clinical development, marketing events and travel costs.
In addition, COVID delayed some R&D work resulting in underspend on prototypes. We expect spending on activities restricted by COVID to increase as the impacts of the pandemic decline. We also expect spending to increase as a percentage of revenue as investments in headcount, infrastructure and other support areas catch up to the growth of the business. Finally, we expect to continue to invest in expanding and accelerating our ecosystem of products and capabilities. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%. We recorded expense of $11 million associated with periods prior to 2020 related to guidance recently provided by the IRS associated with stock-based compensation. We expect our pro forma tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 21.5%. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items.
Our third quarter pro forma net income was $435 million or $1.19 per share compared with $334 million or $0.92 per share for the third quarter of 2020 and $477 million or $1.31 per share for the last quarter. Third quarter 2021 and 2020 included pretax gains of approximately $8 million and $62 million associated with investments in companies that resulted from development agreements entered into in prior years.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $381 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $314 million or $0.87 per share for the third quarter of 2020, and GAAP net income of $517 million or $1.42 per share for last quarter.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.2 billion compared with $7.7 billion last quarter. The increase in cash in the third quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie."
30239,1678084231,2407763,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marshall.Our overall third quarter procedure growth was approximately 20% compared to growth of 7% during the third quarter of 2020. Q3 procedure growth reflected 16% growth in U.S. procedures and 30% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., proce",1408,"Thank you, Marshall.
Our overall third quarter procedure growth was approximately 20% compared to growth of 7% during the third quarter of 2020. Q3 procedure growth reflected 16% growth in U.S. procedures and 30% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., procedures in Q3 were adversely impacted by an increase in COVID-related hospitalizations due to the Delta variant. Procedures were particularly impacted in those states with relatively lower vaccination rates.
As the number of COVID-related hospitalizations peaked and began to improve in September, we saw U.S. procedures start to recover. Q3 growth reflected relative strength in bariatrics procedures, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. In the more mature procedure categories, year-over-year growth in prostatectomy was strong relative to historical averages and benign hysterectomy grew in the low single-digit range.
Third quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 30% compared with 9% growth for the third quarter of 2020. Third quarter 2021 OUS procedures were driven by growth in prostatectomy and earlier stage growth in general surgery, gynecology, kidney cancer procedures and thoracic surgery. China procedure growth remained strong and broad-based as a result of continued expansion of the installed base under the current quota and the addition and training of surgeons new to the da Vinci platform.
Growth in Japan was solid but was impacted by localized lockdowns stemming from ongoing efforts to prevent resurgences of COVID. Growth in Korea was also solid, primarily driven by gynecology, urology and head and neck procedures. A little more than half of the procedures in these 3 key Asian markets are outside of urology.
In Europe, procedure growth varied by country based on the relative impact of the Delta variant and the impact of COVID-related mitigation measures. Growth in the U.K. and Germany was solid with procedure growth in France and Italy impacted by reduced capacity for surgery as hospitals reserved resources for potential increases in COVID patients.
During Q3, customers in the U.S. and Europe effectively consumed their remaining inventory of 10-life instruments following the launch of extended use instruments in those regions in Q4 of last year. With this full adoption in the U.S., customers are benefiting from I&A per procedure costs that are reduced by approximately 10% in lower acuity procedures such as cholecystectomy and hernia repair. In Europe, customers are benefiting from an even larger reduction in I&A costs for targeted procedures.
While recent procedure trends are confounded by the various waves of the pandemic, we believe, based on customer feedback, the adoption of extended use instruments is having a positive impact on targeted procedures. In our new platform, Ion procedures increased almost fourfold as compared to Q3 of 2020, driven by a significant expansion of the number of systems at customers and an increase in usage in the existing installed base. Our single port platform, which is gated by additional regional and clinical clearances showed solid performance with almost 50% year-over-year procedure growth.
Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.
During the quarter, Dr. Michael Kent from Beth Israel Deaconess Center, Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, published results from a landmark multicenter pulmonary open, robotic and thoracoscopic lobectomy or PORTaL study in the Annals of Surgery. This retrospective study sponsored by Intuitive compared lobectomy outcomes associated with open VATS and robotic-assisted da Vinci surgery with over 6,000 cases included in this analysis.
After one-to-one propensity score matching, a comparison of open and da Vinci lobectomies with approximately 800 patients in each group showed a 2-day shorter length of stay and a 9.5% lower rate of prolonged hospital stay associated with da Vinci lobectomies. The da Vinci cohort also had an approximately 8-minute shorter mean OR time for cases without a concomitant procedure. Postoperative complications were approximately 9% lower with the da Vinci robotic approach. With regards to the propensity score match comparison of minimally invasive approaches with over 1,700 patients in each group, the da Vinci approach evidenced a 1.1-day shorter mean length of stay and a 6.1% low rate of conversion to thoracotomy when compared to VATS, with the differences in conversion rates reported for each tumor stage in the analysis.
The authors concluded in part, ""In this retrospective multi-institutional data analysis, both robotic-assisted and VATS lobectomy were associated with improved perioperative outcomes compared to open lobectomy. Robotic-assisted lobectomy was associated with additional differences compared to VATS such as a reduced length of stay and conversion rate.""
In August of this year, Professor Umberto Bracale from the University of Naples Federico II in Naples, Italy, published a systematic review with meta-analysis of transversus abdominis release or TAR for ventral hernia repair, assessing short-term outcomes of the open and robotic-assisted approaches. The meta-analysis combined 6 studies containing over 800 patients, of which just over 200 patients underwent robotic-assisted da Vinci surgery and just under 600 patients who underwent the open approach. Results of this meta-analysis found that the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 4.4-day shorter length of stay, 64% lower risk of postoperative complications and 79% lower risk of developing systemic complications. Readmission and reoperations were comparable between both groups.
The authors concluded in part, ""Based on the data from the meta-analysis, the robotic approach for TAR seems safe and feasible even in more difficult cases. Robotic-assisted TAR shows the common advantages of minimally invasive procedures that improve short-term outcomes with significant benefits in the early postoperative period.""
Lastly, as noted in yesterday's press release, preliminary results from the PRECIsE study evaluating outcomes associated with the Ion endoluminal system were presented at the annual CHEST conference. This preliminary analysis of 69 subjects showed a diagnostic yield of 83% with a sensitivity of malignancy of 84% to 88% from the biopsy of peripheral pulmonary nodules with a mean size of 17 millimeters. These initial outcomes regarding the performance of the Ion system are encouraging, and we look forward to the full study being published in the second half of 2022.
I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. During Q3, we experienced a more challenging supply chain environment with a deterioration in on-time delivery performance from our suppliers. We also saw increased supply chain costs. While this did not have a material impact to our operating results in Q3, the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to supply constraints.
Starting with procedures. Last quarter, we forecast 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 30%. Given Q3 results and the impact of the Delta variant, we are now narrowing our forecast and expect full year 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 29%. This procedure outlook does not reflect a significant impact from OR staffing shortages or a resurgence of COVID-19. The high end of the range assumes that COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the U.S. continue the recovery that began in September and that COVID-related mitigation measures in OUS markets continue to ease.
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2021 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70.5% and 71.5% of revenue. We now expect 2021 pro forma gross profit margin to be within 71% and 71.5% of revenue. This range does not reflect any significant disruption associated with the current supply chain challenges. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix the impact of product cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and competitive pricing pressure.
With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast to grow full year pro forma 2021 operating expenses between 17% and 21% above 2020 levels. We are refining our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 17% and 19%. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million and $460 million in 2021. With regard to pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, we expect a range of between $50 million and $55 million in 2021. Finally, with respect to income tax, we expect our Q4 2021 pro forma tax rate to be approximately 21.5% of pretax income.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions."

And so we call it out to make sure that everybody is aware of that. From the perspective of cost, we saw some increased material costs last quarter. They were not significant. And we also incurred some expediting fees associated with freight, again, not material. But going forward, we do expect cost, increased cost that will probably hit the margin in Q4 or Q1.

So there's a progression there that continues through Q4.
It also assumes that the mitigation measures in OUS markets, which are typically a little more conservative than we see in the U.S., continue to ease. And those also started to ease in September. At the low end, what we see is a slower recovery in the U.S. from what we saw in Q3 and choppiness OUS in terms of kind of the on/off of mitigation measures in various markets. And so that range of 27% to 29% that we provided really is just a function of the rate at which we recover from what occurred in Q3 with the Delta variant."

I mean, certainly, the headline numbers when you look at other studies, it's a good number, but I'm just curious, is this the point where the market awakens to these numbers and should we see an inflection in adoption of Ion?
And just one quick one on 3Q. I know you called out the Delta, but was there any labor shortage impact in 3Q itself? Because historically, we haven't seen the pandemic impact where Intuitive has outperformed peers. It's just perhaps a little excessive in 3Q. Was there something else going on?"

On the first one, in terms of diagnostic yield, you had said 82%. And I guess what I'd advise everybody is, there's a couple of numbers that are important and they stay linked together. And that is, what is the size of the lesion? And then what's th",550,"Okay. On the first one, in terms of diagnostic yield, you had said 82%. And I guess what I'd advise everybody is, there's a couple of numbers that are important and they stay linked together. And that is, what is the size of the lesion? And then what's the positive diagnostic rate, the ability to definitively diagnose? That's what the interventional pulmonologists are looking at.
So the bigger the lesion, if it's a 3-centimeter lesion, your diagnostic yield rate is going to go up, your definitive diag, because it's easier to hit. So you got to look at both numbers. It's not a single metric. So 82% for smaller lesions is leading as far as I can tell for endobronchial approaches for that approach. Some folks can get to higher yield rates, but they're hitting bigger targets. So you need to look at both, and that's what I encourage you to do.
The second thing that I advise you is that, there are other ways to examine or get a biopsy. There can be outside the body, CT-guided needle biopsies. And those outside the body CT-guided needle biopsies have high success rates at gathering the tissue, but they have a lower safety profile than the endobronchial approach. So there's kind of a third dimension, which is, did you get the tissue you needed to get a definitive diagnosis? How big was the lesion you were trying to target? And what was the complication rate?
And we think that Ion is really good at managing all 3 of those relative to competitive approaches. And we're seeing a nice uptick as a result. And is that a tipping point? We'll see. So far so good. That's what we had expected. This kind of performance, that's what we were targeting. But we're pleased to see it being borne out over multiple sites and multiple customers, and we think that's going to be helpful.
With regard to your second question, you were talking a little bit about, are we seeing an unusual or more aggressive slowdown because of Delta than perhaps others? What I'd encourage you to think about there is, where in the world everybody is exposed and where they're seeing their growth. So in our case, we have a certain regional profile and where our procedures are being done. Other companies may have much bigger exposure to, say, markets or countries that had a lower impact having to do with Delta. Frankly, I think, it's as simple as that, but time will tell on that as well.
So let's go ahead and conclude. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care.
We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It follows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months."

The rise of the Delta variant and stresses in some hospitals pressured the demand for surgery. Global supply chain disruption has yet to abate, necessitating redirection of internal resources to continue to meet our customers' demand. Despite these challenges, growth in the use of our products continued in the quarter and capital demand remained robust. Our new platforms advanced in their commercialization, in their innovation and in their clinical programs.
Turning first to procedures. The increased COVID burden tempered the recovery we saw in the second quarter, particularly in the month of August. The impact of the Delta variant drove procedures in the United States below our expectations at the start of the quarter with run rate stabilizing the last couple of weeks of September.
Adoption continues in the United States driven particularly by benign general surgery procedures, including bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. Trends in malignant procedures remain solid, including prostatectomy, hysterectomy, lobectomy and colon resection.
Two trends that have emerged over the past few years are the increased use of da Vinci in benign procedures and rising use of our advanced instrumentation in targeted procedures. Both are the result of focusing on our customers' needs and delivering product and economic solutions to match.
Outside the United States, procedure performance varied as a function of regional pandemic impact. In China, growth in the quarter was strong and spanned multiple specialties, reflecting continued adoption. In Japan and Korea, our procedure business remains healthy with slight sequential procedure growth Q2 to Q3 despite COVID-related surgery disruption. Germany, the U.K. and France had reasonable year-over-year procedure growth, and our customers are having success in diversifying procedure categories beyond urology.
Regarding the capital environment, new system placements continue to be robust. The United States had an outstanding capital quarter with a balanced mix of hospitals new to da Vinci as well as healthy incremental placements for existing customers and trade-ins of older technology. This performance has been driven by collaboration with U.S. integrated delivery networks as they thoughtfully manage and expand the capacity of their da Vinci fleets. Elsewhere, China, Japan and Europe had solid placements in the quarter, and our placements in Brazil showed strength.
Turning to our newer platforms. Our single port system, da Vinci SP, had a solid quarter as we pursue additional indications. Placements of our flexible bronchoscopy platform, Ion, grew nicely sequentially Q2 to Q3, powered by continued strong customer experiences in the field.
Our finances were strong again this quarter, though they followed an unusual path. System strength and favorable system sales mix drove strong system revenue. Procedures grew at the low end of our expectations as a result of the Delta variant. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure moved down modestly as benign procedures continue to make up more of the procedure mix and our extended use instrument program reaches equilibrium in the field.
Our spending grew sequentially and year-over-year as we continue to invest in expanding our new platforms and digital programs as well as build our go-to-market capabilities globally. Our expense growth was again modestly lower than planned, driven by some increase in time to fill open positions in a tight labor market, lower travel-related spending given the pandemic and some underspending in prototypes. We will continue to invest in programs that fulfill the mission and build the company.
Turning to our innovation efforts. We develop and deploy technology-enabled solutions to support our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim: better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode.
I'd like to take a moment to overview the clinical status of our programs. For our da Vinci system, there are now over 9.7 million lifetime procedures performed with over 28,000 peer-reviewed clinical publications. Da Vinci X and Xi now have over 70 representative clinical uses, allowing broad use across multiple clinical specialties, from urology, to gynecology, thoracic surgery, general surgery and transoral surgery.
Tens of thousands of surgeons routinely use our multiport systems. We continue to invest in our multiport products, instruments and services to further expand their capabilities and indications. Leading surgeons continue to work with us to pursue new learning with several prospective studies ongoing.
Our flexible bronchoscopy system, Ion, continues to build momentum clinically and commercially with several presentations and manuscripts updating Ion clinical progress at the 2021 CHEST conference this weekend. As described in yesterday's press release, early clinical trial results point to outstanding capability, allowing for definitive diagnosis of hard-to-reach lung lesions. Our teams are hard at work building our manufacturing and supply capabilities to meet rising demand.
Our single port system, SP, has a clinical database of 28 peer-reviewed clinical publications. There are currently several ongoing prospective studies for SP in Korea and the United States, including our IDE trial for colorectal indications. This quarter, we received FDA approval of our uniportal thoracic IDE. Broad SP adoption will be paced by additional regional and clinical clearances, which remain our focus for the SP program.
Our digital solutions provide data-driven insights to surgeons, operative services and hospital administration. From virtual reality training, to efficiency insights, to custom comparative outcomes analysis, these tools are now routinely employed by our customers and our teams to improve programs. Our analytics program supported thousands of customers in the quarter.
Turning to machine learning. Our teams are at the leading edge of ML-based clinical science for surgery through our collaborations with leading academic centers, informing algorithmic and scientific discovery. Taken together, these programs allow our customers to quantify our collective impact on the quadruple aim, core to our mission.
Before turning the time over to Marshall, today, we announced some changes in responsibilities of our senior executive team. These changes are the result of a structured process over the past few years, and they are driven by our need to support growth in our product lines, commercial reach, operations capabilities and business infrastructure as we scale to meet the global opportunity to advance minimally invasive care.
Starting January 1, 2022, our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Dave Rosa, will take on an important new role of Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, leading our efforts to identify and realize long-term business opportunities, continuing to build the value of our integrated product offerings and ensuring our customers clearly understand the value of our ecosystem in creating successful minimally invasive programs.
Henry Charlton, currently General Manager of the U.S. and Europe, will succeed Dave as Chief Commercial Officer, overseeing global commercial sales, regional marketing and commercial enablement. Also, Marshall Mohr will take on an important new position as Executive Vice President, Global Business Services, leading Intuitive's continued growth in information technology, enterprise process, data and systems and global facilities. Jamie Samath will succeed Marshall as Chief Financial Officer.
They are each outstanding proven leaders and will report to me. We expect them to spearhead our efforts to achieve our mission and continue to position Intuitive as first choice of our customers in a growing marketplace.
I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through our financial highlights in greater detail."

I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. The information in our earnings release and within our prepared remarks reflects the 3-for-1 stock split completed earlier in October.
Overall, third quarter procedures grew 20% year-over-year and reflected the impact of Delta variant resurgence. COVID also impacted third quarter 2020 procedures, making year-over-year comparisons complicated. In the U.S., procedures grew 16%, reflecting the impact the COVID resurgence had on hospital resources regionally.
The impact of the resurgence was most pronounced in August and early September, and regionally, in the South and Southeast. Later in the quarter, as COVID cases began to slow, procedures began to recover. However, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which this resurgence or future resurgences will impact da Vinci procedures.
Year-over-year OUS procedures grew 30%, with the impact of COVID varying regionally. In Europe, COVID had a greater impact in Italy and France and less in U.K. and Germany. While there continued to be COVID hotspots within some of our Asia Pacific markets, overall procedures in the region performed well. China growth in the third quarter continued to be far higher than other regions, primarily reflecting system installation growth over the past year.
Relative to the beginning of the pandemic, many hospitals are able to better manage increased COVID patient hospitalization. However, staffing shortages and hospital supply chain issues are challenging some hospital capacities and could impact deferrable procedures, including da Vinci procedures going forward. Jamie will provide additional procedure commentary later in this call.
Key business metrics for the third quarter were as follows: third quarter 2021 procedures increased approximately 20% compared with third quarter 2020 and decreased approximately 3% compared with last quarter, compound annual growth between the second quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 13.5%, third quarter system placements of 336 systems increased 72% compared with 195 systems for the third quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with 328 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems over the last year by 11% to approximately 6,525 systems. This growth rate compares with 8% last year and 10% last quarter.
Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, increased approximately 9% compared with last year and decreased 6% compared with last quarter. The compounded annual utilization growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 3%.
Moving on to capital placement. System placements in the quarter reflected a continued trend of IDN multisystem purchases and were driven by procedure growth and hospitals upgrading in order to access or standardize on fourth-generation capabilities. Looking forward, we see the following capital revenue dynamics. Procedure growth drives capital purchases in many of our markets. To the extent that COVID impacts procedures, it will also impact capital purchases.
The trade-in cycle has been a tailwind to system placements. However, as the installed base of older generation product declines, the number of trade-ins will decline over time. Leasing and alternative financing arrangements enable customer access to our systems. While the percentage of systems placed under operating leases fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, we believe leasing will increase as a percentage of sales over time, which will result in the deferral of otherwise current revenue into future periods. Macroeconomic conditions created by COVID could regionally impact hospital capital spending. And as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and price pressures.
Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Third quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, representing a 30% increase from last year and a 4% decrease from the last quarter. The compound annual revenue growth rate between the third quarters of 2019 and 2021 was 12%. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected growth in both procedures and system placements. The decrease relative to the second quarter of 2021 reflects lower instrument and accessory revenue associated with lower procedures and increased leasing as a percentage of placements.
Leasing represented 41% of current quarter placements compared with 35% last year and 33% last quarter. Leasing as a percentage of total sales has and will continue to fluctuate with customer and geographic mix. However, we anticipate more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements than reflected in historical run rates.
40% of systems placed in the third quarter involved trade-ins, which is consistent with the 40% last year and higher than the 38% last quarter. As customers continue to upgrade to fourth-generation capabilities, the population of installed Sis is decreasing, particularly in U.S., where 97 trade-ins were completed in the third quarter, leaving an installed base of Sis of approximately 425 systems. As a result, we expect lower trade-out transactions over time. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict.
Third quarter average selling prices increased to $1.57 million from $1.55 million for both the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. Average selling prices will fluctuate with geographic and product mix. Consistent with historical patterns, we expect a higher mix of systems sold to distributors in the fourth quarter which carry lower prices.
We recognized $25 million of lease buyout revenue in the third quarter compared with $17 million last year and $26 million last quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to do so. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure of $1,900 decreased slightly compared with $1,910 per procedure for the third quarter of last year and decreased compared with $1,940 per procedure in the second quarter. The year-over-year change reflects increased usage of extended use instruments, mostly offset by increased usage of our advanced instruments. The decrease from the previous quarter reflects customers continuing to adjust their instrument buying patterns to reflect the additional uses per instrument included in extended use instruments.
10 of the systems placed in the third quarter were SP systems. Our installed base of SP systems is now 89, 10 in Korea and 79 in the U.S. We continue our measured rollout of SP as we work on gathering clinical data to gain additional procedure clearances in the U.S.
We placed 28 Ion systems in the quarter, bringing the installed base to 98 systems. There were approximately 2,000 Ion procedures completed in the third quarter. Ion system placements and procedures are excluded from our overall da Vinci system and procedure counts. Our rollout of Ion is progressing well.
Outside the U.S., we placed 109 systems in the third quarter compared with 79 in the third quarter of 2020 and 115 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 47 into Europe, 20 into Japan and 17 into China compared with 39 into Europe, 15 into Japan and 12 into China in the third quarter of 2020. We also placed 9 systems in Brazil in the third quarter and now have placed 23 systems in Brazil over the past 4 quarters.
Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 71.3% compared with 70.2% for the third quarter of 2020 and 71.7% last quarter. The third quarter of 2020 included $23 million of service credits issued in conjunction with our Customer Relief Program, higher period costs associated with lower production levels and higher excess and obsolete inventory charges.
The decline in gross margin relative to the second quarter primarily reflects product mix. Product and customer mix fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, which can cause fluctuations in gross margins.
COVID has impacted global supplies of semiconductors and other materials used in our products. While to date, we've been able to secure supply necessary to ensure fulfillment of customer demand, our teams are expending significant time and effort to bridge future supply with demand. To date, we have experienced immaterial component cost increases and freight expedition fees. However, global shortages could result in future supply disruption as well as delayed development and regulatory activities. We also expect supply issues to result in higher production costs.
Pro forma operating expenses increased 21% compared with the third quarter of 2020 and increased 2% compared with last quarter. The increase compared to the prior year reflects costs associated with higher headcount, increased variable compensation and increased spending in areas impacted by COVID. Third quarter spending was below our expectations due to delays in headcount hiring and lower spending on activities restricted by COVID, including clinical development, marketing events and travel costs.
In addition, COVID delayed some R&D work resulting in underspend on prototypes. We expect spending on activities restricted by COVID to increase as the impacts of the pandemic decline. We also expect spending to increase as a percentage of revenue as investments in headcount, infrastructure and other support areas catch up to the growth of the business. Finally, we expect to continue to invest in expanding and accelerating our ecosystem of products and capabilities. Jamie will provide spend guidance later in this call.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%. We recorded expense of $11 million associated with periods prior to 2020 related to guidance recently provided by the IRS associated with stock-based compensation. We expect our pro forma tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 21.5%. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items.
Our third quarter pro forma net income was $435 million or $1.19 per share compared with $334 million or $0.92 per share for the third quarter of 2020 and $477 million or $1.31 per share for the last quarter. Third quarter 2021 and 2020 included pretax gains of approximately $8 million and $62 million associated with investments in companies that resulted from development agreements entered into in prior years.
I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $381 million or $1.04 per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared with GAAP net income of $314 million or $0.87 per share for the third quarter of 2020, and GAAP net income of $517 million or $1.42 per share for last quarter.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $8.2 billion compared with $7.7 billion last quarter. The increase in cash in the third quarter primarily reflected cash from operations and stock exercises. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jamie."

Q3 procedure growth reflected 16% growth in U.S. procedures and 30% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., proce",1408,"Thank you, Marshall.
Our overall third quarter procedure growth was approximately 20% compared to growth of 7% during the third quarter of 2020. Q3 procedure growth reflected 16% growth in U.S. procedures and 30% growth in OUS markets. In the U.S., procedures in Q3 were adversely impacted by an increase in COVID-related hospitalizations due to the Delta variant. Procedures were particularly impacted in those states with relatively lower vaccination rates.
As the number of COVID-related hospitalizations peaked and began to improve in September, we saw U.S. procedures start to recover. Q3 growth reflected relative strength in bariatrics procedures, cholecystectomy and hernia repair. In the more mature procedure categories, year-over-year growth in prostatectomy was strong relative to historical averages and benign hysterectomy grew in the low single-digit range.
Third quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 30% compared with 9% growth for the third quarter of 2020. Third quarter 2021 OUS procedures were driven by growth in prostatectomy and earlier stage growth in general surgery, gynecology, kidney cancer procedures and thoracic surgery. China procedure growth remained strong and broad-based as a result of continued expansion of the installed base under the current quota and the addition and training of surgeons new to the da Vinci platform.
Growth in Japan was solid but was impacted by localized lockdowns stemming from ongoing efforts to prevent resurgences of COVID. Growth in Korea was also solid, primarily driven by gynecology, urology and head and neck procedures. A little more than half of the procedures in these 3 key Asian markets are outside of urology.
In Europe, procedure growth varied by country based on the relative impact of the Delta variant and the impact of COVID-related mitigation measures. Growth in the U.K. and Germany was solid with procedure growth in France and Italy impacted by reduced capacity for surgery as hospitals reserved resources for potential increases in COVID patients.
During Q3, customers in the U.S. and Europe effectively consumed their remaining inventory of 10-life instruments following the launch of extended use instruments in those regions in Q4 of last year. With this full adoption in the U.S., customers are benefiting from I&A per procedure costs that are reduced by approximately 10% in lower acuity procedures such as cholecystectomy and hernia repair. In Europe, customers are benefiting from an even larger reduction in I&A costs for targeted procedures.
While recent procedure trends are confounded by the various waves of the pandemic, we believe, based on customer feedback, the adoption of extended use instruments is having a positive impact on targeted procedures. In our new platform, Ion procedures increased almost fourfold as compared to Q3 of 2020, driven by a significant expansion of the number of systems at customers and an increase in usage in the existing installed base. Our single port platform, which is gated by additional regional and clinical clearances showed solid performance with almost 50% year-over-year procedure growth.
Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.
During the quarter, Dr. Michael Kent from Beth Israel Deaconess Center, Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, published results from a landmark multicenter pulmonary open, robotic and thoracoscopic lobectomy or PORTaL study in the Annals of Surgery. This retrospective study sponsored by Intuitive compared lobectomy outcomes associated with open VATS and robotic-assisted da Vinci surgery with over 6,000 cases included in this analysis.
After one-to-one propensity score matching, a comparison of open and da Vinci lobectomies with approximately 800 patients in each group showed a 2-day shorter length of stay and a 9.5% lower rate of prolonged hospital stay associated with da Vinci lobectomies. The da Vinci cohort also had an approximately 8-minute shorter mean OR time for cases without a concomitant procedure. Postoperative complications were approximately 9% lower with the da Vinci robotic approach. With regards to the propensity score match comparison of minimally invasive approaches with over 1,700 patients in each group, the da Vinci approach evidenced a 1.1-day shorter mean length of stay and a 6.1% low rate of conversion to thoracotomy when compared to VATS, with the differences in conversion rates reported for each tumor stage in the analysis.
The authors concluded in part, ""In this retrospective multi-institutional data analysis, both robotic-assisted and VATS lobectomy were associated with improved perioperative outcomes compared to open lobectomy. Robotic-assisted lobectomy was associated with additional differences compared to VATS such as a reduced length of stay and conversion rate.""
In August of this year, Professor Umberto Bracale from the University of Naples Federico II in Naples, Italy, published a systematic review with meta-analysis of transversus abdominis release or TAR for ventral hernia repair, assessing short-term outcomes of the open and robotic-assisted approaches. The meta-analysis combined 6 studies containing over 800 patients, of which just over 200 patients underwent robotic-assisted da Vinci surgery and just under 600 patients who underwent the open approach. Results of this meta-analysis found that the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 4.4-day shorter length of stay, 64% lower risk of postoperative complications and 79% lower risk of developing systemic complications. Readmission and reoperations were comparable between both groups.
The authors concluded in part, ""Based on the data from the meta-analysis, the robotic approach for TAR seems safe and feasible even in more difficult cases. Robotic-assisted TAR shows the common advantages of minimally invasive procedures that improve short-term outcomes with significant benefits in the early postoperative period.""
Lastly, as noted in yesterday's press release, preliminary results from the PRECIsE study evaluating outcomes associated with the Ion endoluminal system were presented at the annual CHEST conference. This preliminary analysis of 69 subjects showed a diagnostic yield of 83% with a sensitivity of malignancy of 84% to 88% from the biopsy of peripheral pulmonary nodules with a mean size of 17 millimeters. These initial outcomes regarding the performance of the Ion system are encouraging, and we look forward to the full study being published in the second half of 2022.
I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. During Q3, we experienced a more challenging supply chain environment with a deterioration in on-time delivery performance from our suppliers. We also saw increased supply chain costs. While this did not have a material impact to our operating results in Q3, the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to supply constraints.
Starting with procedures. Last quarter, we forecast 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 30%. Given Q3 results and the impact of the Delta variant, we are now narrowing our forecast and expect full year 2021 procedure growth of 27% to 29%. This procedure outlook does not reflect a significant impact from OR staffing shortages or a resurgence of COVID-19. The high end of the range assumes that COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the U.S. continue the recovery that began in September and that COVID-related mitigation measures in OUS markets continue to ease.
Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast our 2021 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 70.5% and 71.5% of revenue. We now expect 2021 pro forma gross profit margin to be within 71% and 71.5% of revenue. This range does not reflect any significant disruption associated with the current supply chain challenges. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix the impact of product cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies and competitive pricing pressure.
With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast to grow full year pro forma 2021 operating expenses between 17% and 21% above 2020 levels. We are refining our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 17% and 19%. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $450 million and $460 million in 2021. With regard to pro forma other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, we expect a range of between $50 million and $55 million in 2021. Finally, with respect to income tax, we expect our Q4 2021 pro forma tax rate to be approximately 21.5% of pretax income.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call to your questions."

And we also incurred some expediting fees associated with freight, again, not material. But going forward, we do expect cost, increased cost that will probably hit the margin in Q4 or Q1.

So there's a progression there that continues through Q4.
It also assumes that the mitigation measures in OUS markets, which are typically a little more conservative than we see in the U.S., continue to ease. And those also started to ease in September. At the low end, what we see is a slower recovery in the U.S. from what we saw in Q3 and choppiness OUS in terms of kind of the on/off of mitigation measures in various markets. And so that range of 27% to 29% that we provided really is just a function of the rate at which we recover from what occurred in Q3 with the Delta variant."

So I thought maybe just to follow up on the supply chain question was just a little bit more on just inflationary headwinds generally. And Marshall, just how you're seeing labor cost growth today versus kind of early in the year or more normal times and raw material cost growth versus normal, more normal times? And just how to, for us to start thinking about these things along with what you commented on the supply chain for next year, just qualitatively as we start to think about where operating margins might go?"

And frankly, our teams have done a marvelous job with sort of with efficiency and effectiveness to offset those increased costs. But we're hearing from suppliers that they're going to raise their prices. And so we're saying that, hey, we expect that costs will go up more. I'm not sure I want to say that the inflation word has hit us and it's here to stay, but we are seeing some suppliers raise cost."

The PRECIsE study, 83% diagnostic resolution. Is that good enough, Gary? I mean, certainly, the headline numbers when you look at other studies, it's a good number, but I'm just curious, is this the point where the market awakens to these numbers and should we see an inflection in adoption of Ion?
And just one quick one on 3Q. I know you called out the Delta, but was there any labor shortage impact in 3Q itself? Because historically, we haven't seen the pandemic impact where Intuitive has outperformed peers. It's just perhaps a little excessive in 3Q. Was there something else going on?"

On the first one, in terms of diagnostic yield, you had said 82%. And I guess what I'd advise everybody is, there's a couple of numbers that are important and they stay linked together.

And I guess what I'd advise everybody is, there's a couple of numbers that are important and they stay linked together. And that is, what is the size of the lesion? And then what's the positive diagnostic rate, the ability to definitively diagnose? That's what the interventional pulmonologists are looking at.
So the bigger the lesion, if it's a 3-centimeter lesion, your diagnostic yield rate is going to go up, your definitive diag, because it's easier to hit. So you got to look at both numbers. It's not a single metric. So 82% for smaller lesions is leading as far as I can tell for endobronchial approaches for that approach. Some folks can get to higher yield rates, but they're hitting bigger targets. So you need to look at both, and that's what I encourage you to do.
The second thing that I advise you is that, there are other ways to examine or get a biopsy. There can be outside the body, CT-guided needle biopsies. And those outside the body CT-guided needle biopsies have high success rates at gathering the tissue, but they have a lower safety profile than the endobronchial approach. So there's kind of a third dimension, which is, did you get the tissue you needed to get a definitive diagnosis? How big was the lesion you were trying to target? And what was the complication rate?
And we think that Ion is really good at managing all 3 of those relative to competitive approaches. And we're seeing a nice uptick as a result. And is that a tipping point? We'll see. So far so good. That's what we had expected. This kind of performance, that's what we were targeting. But we're pleased to see it being borne out over multiple sites and multiple customers, and we think that's going to be helpful.
With regard to your second question, you were talking a little bit about, are we seeing an unusual or more aggressive slowdown because of Delta than perhaps others? What I'd encourage you to think about there is, where in the world everybody is exposed and where they're seeing their growth. So in our case, we have a certain regional profile and where our procedures are being done. Other companies may have much bigger exposure to, say, markets or countries that had a lower impact having to do with Delta. Frankly, I think, it's as simple as that, but time will tell on that as well.
So let's go ahead and conclude. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost of care.
We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It follows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and their environment. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months."
