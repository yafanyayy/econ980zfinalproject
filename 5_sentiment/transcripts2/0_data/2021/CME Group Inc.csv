Our comments will be brief, as John said, so we can direct your questions. I hope you and your families well staying safe and healthy. We released our executive summary this morning, which provides extensive details on the fourth quarter and 2020. As John said, I have John; Sean; Derek; Sunil; and Julie Winkler here with me this morning, and we look forward to addressing any questions that you may have. 2020 was a challenge with low volatility in several asset classes, including the front end of the rate curve and in our WTI contract for much of the year. We did see some very encouraging signs with some of our higher-rate-per-contract products. Also, during 2020, metals had its fifth consecutive year of record annual volume and is off to a strong start in 2021. We saw very strong activity in our agricultural commodities in the fourth quarter, and they continued to rise in the first month of this year, up 36% versus last year. Soybean Futures had its second highest quarterly ADV, including record volume out of both Europe and Asia. After the extreme volatility of the first quarter of 2020, as the pandemic began. The volume -- the total volume came in at 15.6 million contracts per day in the third quarter and jumped to 16.2 million contracts per day in Q4. During this entire time, we have remained heavily engaged with our global customers. During 2020, our volume from clients outside the United States grew by 7%, reflecting the global relevance of our markets. I am encouraged by the January 2021 volume, which came in at more than   19-million   contracts per day. We are very pleased with the progress we've made integrating the next business during 2020, including back office migrations, to support finance and HR systems and the building of an integrated global sales team. Last week, we announced that BrokerTec has migrated to U.S. Treasury benchmark trading in EU government bond and repo markets onto Globex. With BrokerTec's dealer-to-dealer platform, now a fully integrated part of CME Globex, clients have an enhanced suite of government bond trading offerings across listed derivatives, cash and repo markets on a common platform, allowing greater operational and technological efficiencies when managing a risk across cash and futures. We remain excited about the mitigation -- or I should say, migration, excuse me, of EBS onto Globex by year-end and the ability to provide further efficiencies to our global customers in the FX market. During 2020 and the first quarter of this year, we have continued to innovate with several new products and will begin trading global emission offset contracts referred to as GEO futures on March 1. And we just launched our new Ether features earlier this week. We continue to work closely with our global customer base on solutions to help them manage their risks. These new products build on globally relevant products we have delivered recently, including SOFR futures, even the S&P ESG futures, the South American Soybean contract, Cobalt futures, Options on our popular bitcoin features and the popular micro products across several of our asset classes. With that, let me turn it over to John, who will discuss the financial results."

Throughout 2020, we navigated the difficult operating environment, executed on the integration with NEX, launched new and innovative products and actively manage our expenses. For the year, we delivered $4.9 billion in revenue, up slightly from the prior year, and with a strong focus on expenses, we achieved $6.72 in adjusted diluted EPS. During the year, we announced our annual variable dividend of $2.5 per share, and we recently announced a regular dividend of $0.90 per share for the first quarter of 2021, a 6% increase compared to the first quarter last year. In terms of fourth quarter revenue, our average rate per contract across the product areas were fairly stable with our micro contracts continued to perform well across several asset classes. Market data revenue was very strong with an all-time quarterly high of $140 million and was up over 7% compared to Q4 last year.
We were intensely focused on expense management throughout the year. At the beginning of 2020, we provided guidance for adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees of between $1.64 billion and $1.65 billion. For the year, we came in approximately $90 million below the midpoint of that range and $80 million below 2019 levels at $1.557 billion. In terms of synergies, we had initially targeted $110 million in run rate synergies by the end of 2020 related to the next acquisition. By year-end, we had exceeded that target and achieved a total of $140 million in synergies. This is net of the additional costs that we are carrying to run parallel infrastructures as we continue to work on the migrations to Globex. We remain committed to our target of $200 million of annual run rate synergies by the end of 2021. Turning to guidance. For 2021, we currently expect full year adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, to increase slightly from the already low 2020-levels to $1.575 billion. For capital expenditures, excluding onetime integration costs and net of leasehold improvement allowances, we expect to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million. In addition, we expect our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate to be between 23.2% and 24.2%. The finally, we are very excited about the recently announced joint venture with IHS market and the opportunities that it will provide our clients and our shareholders. The JV will be a leader in trade processing and risk mitigation services that offers the combined clients complementary services across the global OTC marketplace and interest rate, FX, equity and credit asset classes. We don't anticipate any material change to earnings as a result of the JV we will provide more information when the transaction closes. With that short summary, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Based on the number of analysts covering us, please limit yourself to one question, and then feel free to jump back into the queue. Thank you."

We had targeted $110 million by the end of this year that achieved $140 million and we're planning on achieving the full $200 million by the end of this year. So if you look at it on a year-by-year basis, we overachieved by, in terms of run rate synergies, by $14 million last year in 2,000 -- by the end of 2019, and again, overachieved by approximately the same amount this year, we overachieved by about 16 this year. In terms of run rate synergies. In terms of P&L, we anticipate our synergies being realized in our income statement in 2021 of $35 million. And so that is what we expect to have in our P&L. This is being offset by additional costs that we anticipate having in terms of increased depreciation related to our migrations onto Globex so the way that works is that we do some programming that goes into work in process and that goes from work in process into production and when it goes into production and that's amortized over several years. We also are building out our data center and disaster recovery center on the East Coast. That's partially being offset by the synergy capture. And lastly, in terms of our impacts, we do anticipate having some improved environment in terms of in terms of operating environment towards the back half of this year, and we anticipate having about $20 million in additional costs that we didn't have this year that we are building into the back half of 2021 related primarily to travel, marketing and events.

So we're are we very excited about this. Curve trades, spreads, very popular, especially in this market. And this new order type will allow you to reduce the risk of trading that order type by eliminating the net lag transactions. 1, 2, we are going to reduce the minimum price increment. In the spreads relative to the outrights. And then 3, we're going to have CME Globex implied to functionality, which means that when you have a spread order, let's say, between 2-year notes and 5-year notes, and you've got outright orders in 2-year notes, that then should theoretically, but not only theoretically actually does on Globex and imply outright orders in 5-year notes. So we're very excited about the new RV technology where we launched that in March. Shortly thereafter. We're also going to be reducing the non-pricing come in Centre year notes. We've got a total of 7 different initiatives that we will be taking in order to make that platform more attractive relative to alternatives. And in terms of pricing, I guess, I'm most focused on making sure that the platform is more valuable to our clients, and then we get more volume over our platform, and that's really our focus.

Yes, we did have a record year as data services. Our revenue being up 5% year-on-year. I think that work from home environment kind of further highlighted that need for real-time data access really across our global client base.
As well as the need for historical data, right, as we evaluated really the impacts of the volatile market conditions that we saw in Q2. We also made some investments in our business last year. And so bringing that data business closer to our commercial capabilities. We established a data sales team, and we also supported a number of new products and services. And so that's where we really feel kind of that continued investment is certainly helping to grow the data business and positioning us well as we head into 2021. Those solid trends, we continue to see in the professional subscriber device count was strong throughout the quarter. And in Q4, revenue was up 7% compared to where we were in Q4 2019. And so I think it's a strong -- definitely global demand as well as things on the drive data front that are really kind of propelling the business. And this is just that longer-term trend that we've talked about on other calls of customers' use of technology and their trading strategies is increasing the need for our data through a number of these non-display use cases. So we did have some minor fee adjustments that are being made in 2021 to really reflect how our customers are utilizing our data now and also just the value of the data that we offer and the services that we have and how our market data customers are really receiving and expecting to receive that data. So there was a $5 increase to our real-time data. From   $105   to   $110   per-dcm-per-month. That goes into effect in April. And then we also had some pricing changes on the non display and historical redistribution side. And those will kind of trickle in throughout the year since there's certainly some licensing and implementation that will need to be done between ourselves and our customers. But we feel well that we're in a good position. And as we onboard those customers and that we're really going to be in a good position to continue to grow the business going forward."

And a lot of questions in there, so I will start and then hand things back to Terry. So I really think -- and you mentioned it a couple of our broker partners in your question, and it's really because of that strong broker distribution network, the vast educational programs and really the content that we support, the diverse product mix that we were in a really good position to be able to take advantage of the increase in overall retail trading in '20 we saw record levels of participation in revenue globally. And the number of retail traders that were active at CME group last year increased over 50%. and so the biggest gains were definitely on the equity index product side, where the volatility there really led to a lot of increased trading opportunities. And we also saw great year-on-year gains in metals that were up over 20%, FX as well as eggs. And that really speaks to, again, the diverse product mix and the fact that people are looking for different opportunities. We have been investing quite a bit in our sales and marketing staff overseas, both in APAC and EMEA. And those are playing also a large role as we've grown the business globally on the retail side. So we saw both APAC and EMEA retail business was up double digits. Countries of strong growth continue to be: Korea; Taiwan; and Singapore; and then Germany; and Switzerland; and Europe. So I think that -- the work-from-home environment has allowed, I think, the potential, right, for even more retail customers become active. And our digital outreach, I think, was also just a real positive trend last year because we're able to just reach more retail and active traders than ever before and so the efforts through our education helped us reach over 2.5 million new active individual traders throughout the broker partner digital events that we have that were focused specifically on CME group products. The largest growth in Asia, we had events that the number of events increased over 65% over 2019, so well over 400-events and by going digital, we reach 15x more active traders than we have in the past when more of those events were in person, and also we're seeing somewhat strong trends in North America where the firms there were growing their webinar output by 225%. So we feel that this continued investment is leading us to have well dedicated retail traders, and that really kind of helps position us for continued success. And with that, I'll maybe turn it over to Terry."

It's really hard for us to predict, Brian, what we think 2021 future volumes are for any particular constituent or market participant going forward. But it doesn't take the last several weeks for us to think about the growth of retail trading. So I don't -- that's not the reason why we talk about retail trading. As you know, we've been building on this business for a number of years. But it's become more and more clear that, in my opinion, that retail traders want to have a participate in all different forms of markets. We are looking at all different ways to allow them to come into our markets. As Julie referenced, education is key though. He talked a little bit about the micros and the growth of them. We are looking at other ways to continually work with our partners to bring in more and more retail participants. It's just one of those things that's not going away. I don't believe it's going away. And I don't say that because of what happened with the run-up in some of the recent equities or even in what they perceive is running up in the silver. You can talk about fundamental stories that are in silver versus not fundamental stories of some of the other products that had runs on them. But there's no question about it that the proliferation of social media, the proliferation of access to marketplaces is allowing people to participate more and more, and they want to do that. And I think it's extremely encouraging for more and more young people to have interest in financial services and financial markets. So we want to take advantage of that with them and bring them along. Again, a very thoughtful, smart way, as Julie outlined. So it's not only micro products that we have, working retails, we're looking at new and innovative ways to continue to move forward with this growing constituency of clients. So very excited by the growth of that but at the same time, I don't mind you to think that we're just at putting all of our everything into 1 basket, such as retail because we're not -- I mean, the institutional clients of this company are critically important. The commercials are critically important. So all the different parts that go into making a trade work are very important as we continue to move forward and grow this business. But we do not want to deny on the access to the retail participant in a good, thoughtful, smart way. And I would like to talk a little bit about a couple of some of the fee changes associated with some of these micro products. And maybe I can ask John to do that."

For the micro. So those are some changes that we'll be rolling through beginning in February. Before that gives you a little color where we're at with that,"

We're extremely excited about the joint venture with IHS market for the customers and our shareholders. I'll be a leader in the trade processing and post-trade services and will benefit customers by providing more efficient access to services and we think it will be a great platform to launch new solutions across a broad set of asset classes, including interest rates, FX, equity and credit this will allow us to innovate and bring to market analytics, workflow tools and solutions that allow clients to manage their risk and process more efficiently. So when you look at when you look at the client base, there is a substantial overlap in terms of large global banks, utilizing the services both of market serve and our optimization businesses, but they're all across complementary asset classes. So the strengths of markets serve are very complementary to the strengths of our optimization businesses. So what does that mean for clients? That means a much more efficient way for them to access those services because a lot of the information going to those platforms are very similar and by providing one kind of point-of-access for that information, will provide a lot of efficiencies for the clients and also reduce the amount of errors that could potentially occur as processes could potentially break down as you're accessing multiple platforms across multiple businesses. So very, very excited about that. So like I said, the added value, I think, that we're going to be able to provide, which I think will be very compelling for the clients is around additional analytics, additional workflow tools and additional solutions that we're going to be able to offer clients because we're going to be in a place where we're going to be able to provide our clients a window into a lot of their trade processing and post-trade services across all those asset classes. So we think it's going to be pretty exciting. Just a couple of quick points on it. It is -- it's going to be a 50-50 joint venture so we will be using the equity method of accounting, and it will not be consolidated at CME group. So it will be -- so you'll see a shift in the geography of our income statement the revenue and expenses will be netted in the equity and unconsolidated subsidiary line of our income statement, similar to our indexing joint venture with S&P Global. And as I mentioned, we don't anticipate any material changes to our earnings. One other point, just from a financial perspective is between now and close, we'll be categorizing the optimization businesses as a held for sale asset in our 2021 financial statements. So this will mainly impact balance sheet presentation, and there will be minimal impact on our pro forma operating results. So some change in geography, but most importantly, a very positive change for the business. And I think a real positive for our clients."

Yes, we've seen a lot of action, actually, just in the last 6 weeks. If you look at the run-up of the activity over the last 6 weeks, you've seen crude recover you've seen WTI and Brent actually move up and lock that. There are a number of fundamental drivers as to what's going on. The market is generally responding to the increased expectation for economic activity with the vaccines rolling out. You've got significant reduced stocks in Cushing. If you actually look at the drop in barrels. We've seen about a 14% reduction in the existing stock in Cushing.
This reduction is about   14%   when you look at the -- what's actually driving the uncertainty around U.S. energy policy and the Biden-Administration and the increased flow of exports in the U.S., they're actually seeing the energy curve in WTI right now in what's called backwardation, where the front end of the curve is more expensive than the back end of the curve. And why is that important? That's hugely important because that actually feeds into the narrative that we're seeing more broadly play out in both metals and particularly in AGS, with an overall price rising cycle. What that means is you've got folks filing in on the increase and expectations for growth in pricing, what impact has that had in the business. We actually sell one of our biggest days in WTI. Yesterday, we traded about $1.3 million contracts. If you look at our February ADV, it's about $1.1 million. That's up from $784,000 in Q4 of last year. The reason that's important is that, that's actually driven us back to open interest levels, that we haven't seen for over 2.5 years. We're about 2.45 million contracts open interest versus where Brent is at about -- right about $2.6 million.
So as you've heard us talk about, Mike, as increasing economic activity takes place, that's representing itself in the form of use of our crew benchmark globally. OI on the rise. Institutional investments flowing in and there's broader talk of the overall commodity cycle resuming you've got soybeans and $13.5. You've got corn of $5 and you've got oil at highs in over 1 year or   9   now. So if the market is paying for economic recovery, you're seeing that reflecting both -- just below record levels of WTI, OI and record amounts of ag and metals product going through the franchise as well. So I think that's -- this is the place people are playing that global reflation trade, and that's where you're looking at roll yields in WTI at 8%. So institutional investors are looking for yield. This is the place to get it in this market right now."

And we are especia",561,"Yes. Thanks very much, Terry. Greatly appreciate it. So there's no question we're seeing a much better market environment in the last couple of months across the rates businesses. A very exciting development and one that we've expected. And we are especially seeing that further out the curve. Some examples in terms of the market itself. If you look at the 2-year versus 30-year spread, that has widened out to 1.81% or 181 basis points. We haven't seen an environment like that since February of 2017. So the market is expecting very strong growth, and that's a very good indicator of strong growth on a go-forward basis. Also, just very briefly, in terms of the treasury inflation protected securities or TIPS. If look at the 10-year TIPS, they're now implying an inflation rate, a consumer inflation rate over the next decade of 2.21%. That's the highest level we've seen in implied inflation since 2014. If you get the 5-year TIPS, it's even more impressive at 2.31% implied by the market for inflation over the next 5 years. We haven't seen anything like that since 2013. How is that impacting our markets? It's been a very big positive impact, especially on the long end. We've seen several new records this year in terms of open interest in terms of our ultra 10-year futures, in particular. We've also seen very good growth overall in the long end of the treasury curve. So if you look through January, the ultra 10-year ADV was up 44% year-over-year. The bond future is up 13%, the Ultra Bonds, up 7%. And if you look further out the curve, if you look at -- in particular, I guess, if you look at the back $32 million, the back 32-contracts in our your dollar futures. We've seen significant growth there in the fourth quarter, which was a very positive results. And further, I guess, I looked in detail at the greens and the Blues. So what are the greens? The Greens are the 2023 euro-dollar features and the Blues are the 2024 our futures. So 2023, your dollar futures are running, NADB up more than 100%. And this year versus total year last year, and the blue yard all features likewise, up more than 100% this year versus last year. The last thing I'll mention maybe on the market side that's directly impacting us if you go back to the third quarter of last year, the first implied tightening by the marketplace was in December of 2024. And if you look at today's marketplace, they're applying a tightening in the summer of 2023. So you see the much improved market outlook, the impact on market pricing. And significant impact on our volume. Actually, I will mention, I apologize, one last thing, large open interest holders have also seen a very nice balance. Actually, since December 1, our rates -- large open interest holders has increased by 9% and has recovered half of the losses basically that we saw during the recent crisis, rolling 9% below the all-time highs in our rates -- large major folders. The first time we reached that peak where we are -- sorry, last time we reached for the first time, I should say, we reached the current levels of LOIH rates with 2018. So we're seeing a big recovery there as well. Sorry, Terry."

So one of the things that we've been doing over time is making adjustments in the -- some of the incentive plans for micros. And also, as I just outlined, we made some fee adjustments so a couple of things to think about. Number one, the micros have been hugely successful. And I think when you look at the changes that we're making, I think from an overall company perspective, they're relatively modest. But when you look at the micros, I think there you'll see a more meaningful impact in terms of in terms of the revenue. And we don't think this is going to be impacting volume necessarily. We're providing a lot of value for the clients in a product that's highly liquid so we think -- so we think it will be, from a volume perspective, not as impactful.
When you look at the capture rate, generally speaking, it's roughly an 80-20 rule. 80% of the volume coming from coming from non members, I'm sorry, and then 20% coming from non members. So when you think about the capture rate that's something to think about. So about 20% of the volume roughly will be impacted by the fee increase on the equity side. In metals, it's a little bit different. It's a little bit heavier on the non-member side. A little bit higher than the 80 to 20 in terms of the non members."

The options. We're just listed on it, I believe, in the last several months.

Now the question might be is do we invite different types of regulation because of the retail client entering into the marketplace, I don't believe so only because we've got a growth of retail over the years regardless. And I think when people have access to marketplaces, it's not like the SEC, where the SEC's main mission is to protect the public for manipulation and fraud and other things, we have a global regulator that obviously is looking into those things as well. But I am very convinced that the retail participants will continue to grow, and it doesn't mean you have to have additional burdens from regulation against them or against the                 that wants to house them as your practices are in good housekeeping for lack of a better term from your margin requirements to the money that you have on deposit for -- at your FCM.

So that you have people talking about transaction tests you have people talking about well in taxes. People talking about high frequency trading, yet people talking about payment for order flow. Just overall clear. What happened in the marketplace last week could have happened without any of those things being in place at all. So it had nothing to do with it, but people are seeming to pick their favorite regulation mature or tax assure to add to what's going on in the marketplace over the last several weeks as it relates to some of this retail activity. Of which it has nothing to do with it. So I'm hopeful that we always have the ability to go voice our opinions as it relates to some of the potential regulatory conversations. There'll be a hearing coming up, I believe, through this week or next. And then we will always participate in needs to make sure that our voice is heard but again, I think what you're hearing right now is mostly headlines from a bunch of abundance about what they believe happen and how they believe they could have stopped it or not had it happened at all."

We're very excited actually about the developments and the success we've had recently in our FX futures marketplace. We have, over the last few years, been continuously reducing the minimum price increments. We've done it across 9-different instruments. Very excited actually late last year. We saw an all-time record open interest in our Euro versus USD futures. Which is really main thing, given the fact that volatility has been -- has had a tremendous dampening effect on volumes. If you look at last year across each of the major currency pairs, the volatility ranking was typically the lowest decile going back the last 20 years. So in other words, 90% of the time over the last 20 years, volatility was higher in each of the major currency pairs. Nonetheless, even in that environment. We saw a record number of record open interest in those Euro versus USD contracts. In addition to that, the changes we've been making in order to make our complex much more attractive. We've also seen recently good growth in box trading. So in the month of December, we saw our largest ever U.S. dollar versus sterling, options block trade, and that was the equivalent of $2 billion in a single trade. So market participants are migrating more of their options activity towards the listed space. That actually could accelerate through this year, why, something we haven't spoken about in a while because it was delayed last year relative to COVID. But we do expect there'll be 100-new participants, at least 100 new participants. That are required this year globally to adhere to the uncleared margin rules that in September of this year. That should drive more products requiring greater efficiencies, and in particular, could positively impact our FX options. In the month of January after we saw the record block size in December in Dollar versus Sterling, we saw a record block size in Aussie dollars, that was AUD 4 billion. So we have seen our efforts futures last year actually outperformed the spot marketplaces. And we're seeing now some uptick in the option space, particularly in box. In terms of what the team is doing in order to make the platform much more attractive and to take the unique set of assets we have right? So we now have the EBS as well as the futures data. So we are looking to use this unique set of assets in order to bring greater analytics, greater tools to the marketplace to cross-sell our products down, and particularly cross-sell the futures down the EBS distribution channel and to show participants the value of using both marketplaces. We have the analytics now that we've recently launched that show market participants that you really need to use both the futures as well as the spot liquidity pools. In order to optimize your execution and reduce your execution cost. Some of the new tools that we've launched. So we launched the new FX swap rate monitor. We did that now late summer of last year. More than 4,000 views, more than 3,000 users. This is using our FX link product. It's the first time ever. There's a central limit order book to standardized, clear lower total cost alternatives, FX swaps available to market participants we're seeing some greater uptake there. We are making some enhancements to technology that will come out later this year that will make it much easier to consume for participants, and we do expect to see significant growth once that technology is released. In addition to that, we also released the new FX Vol-converter tool. This takes all of our listed FX options and it converts it to OTC equivalents so all OTC participants can see our FX options on futures the same way they look at the OTC markets. We think that, that's a part of what drove that record block trade in December and the record block trade in January. Last thing I'll mention is our FX market profile tool. This for the first time, synchronizes the data between EBS spot foreign exchange and our foreign exchange futures. It shows the relative liquidity that did offer spread, the top of book, so the size available to hit a list in each of the 2 markets simultaneously, and it quantitatively shows participants the benefits. The benefits of using both marketplaces. So we're very excited about these new tools. We are distributing them out to the very large tail of clients who use EBS, especially regional banks across Europe and Asia. And most exciting is, I mentioned earlier, the excitement I have over the migration of BrokerTec over Globex and how that's going to allow us to offer new products and services with that greater technology. Similarly, on the EBS side, we'll be migrating CBS over the Globex later this year, which will allow us to offer many new products and services across that platform, #1. #2, it will also make it much simpler. Once we move it over for participants to trade on EBS. So we should be able to attract new participants. Last thing I'll mention is we've been investing in direct streaming technology. And we do expect to roll that out likewise later this year. We expect to have the State-of-the-Art                 strain platform available for participants in foreign exchange later this year. Once we do that foreign exchange, we will actually also roll that out in U.S. treasuries."

And I think what you're seeing right now, and you're absolutely right, there is an absence of mandates globally right now there. The existing markets, again, emissions tend to be very, very regional in nature. And why we're excited about working with CBL exchange on this, which is our partner developing this contract, is that this represents a significant change in that these carbon offset futures represent a contract that is an offset versus whatever it is, in fact, underlying product or emitter might be involved in, not limited just to the energy markets, imagine a farmer that wants to manage this carbon footprint. To imagine an aluminum company that wants to adhere to either voluntary standards or regional standards and emissions credit. So this is a product that very capably is able to extend outside of just the traditional space in energy and have an application across a full range of our commodities participants even non-commodities participants. The feedback that we've gotten both in the validation stage is going out to the market and assessing an interest in this. And actually, since we've announced has been bigger and actually more overwhelming than we had anticipated. So to remind everybody, this is a voluntary emission offset. It's based on standards that the market participants are agreeing to and the competitive space is one that is open right now. When you look at the position that we're in, in our commodities markets, we are the largest metals market. We are the largest energy market, we're the largest agricultural products market. So the application of these offset products extend well beyond just the energy space. So we think this is going to be a process of not just dealing with fossil fuels market in transition you look at most company charters right now.
Everybody is trying to adhere to ESG standards that apply to what they feel our covent footprint needs are. So this is broadly applicable to a lot of different market participants. The feedback we're getting validates that. We're excited to get this out. We've got a whole host of market makers and market takers lined up on this. So we're excited about what this could mean. And this is a slightly different product than what you're seeing in the existing product site that we have and others have that are really regionally focused. So we think this is early days in this. We think this is extensible out to the range of benchmark markets that we run and where we run the majority of liquidity in. And so we think this will be a great service to customers looking to extend their ESG credentials and managed our carbon footprint and really new and unique and market-oriented ways."

So it is an existing program we started this in 2003, and we continue to provide that service. What we're doing right now is enhancing that. So we are actively working with DTC now given that it is 2 clearing houses, 2 separate clearing houses and the fact that we are regulated by one is by the CFTC and the other is by the SEC. We just have to work through the process to get any enhancements improved. So that does take time. But we are very confident that we'll get through that process. It's just that it's very hard for us to give you a time frame when it comes to regulators what we're saying. So operationally, we continue to work actively in improving the margin efficiencies between our 2 clearing fees. I hope that helps."

And I think what you heard from Sean earlier, and I'm sure he'll references himself, but I didn't want to be remiss if I didn't say it again. When we're looking at the growth of the   back-32   of the euro-dollar contract like we're seeing today, we're looking at the growth of the SOFR futures contract, like we're seeing today of roughly 94%, 96% of the open interest being held here at CME, we are the beneficiaries of both products growing. And that is something we said is a strong possibility, and we're starting to see that mature in our favor, and we're very encouraged by that. So John can talk about the timing or the transition from LIBOR to sulfur and I guess, Sean, it could be a bit speculative, but there are some hard dates that people are talking about and fallbacks associated with it. But I would be remiss if I didn't remind folks that it is important that we have a really strong rate franchise with efficiencies that are almost unmatched anywhere in the world, and we are very excited that we can participate both in sulfur and in Euro-Dollars.

So thanks so much, Terry, for that, and thanks for the question. There are several points in there. So again, if you at the   back-32   between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter 10 the ADV grew. So it's in the euro-dollar futures, they grew by 36%. So a very positive result. As I said earlier, we've seen very good growth in January in the greens and the blues of the 2023 and 2024 contracts. So for that curve, the OR future is growing very strongly. At the same time, we've recently seen a number of records in our SOFR futures. 2020 was a record year for volume, so for futures of 51,000 contracts. And so far this year, we're doing more than 100,000 contracts a day. In January, we also saw an open interest cure of 727,000 SOFR futures contracts. We also saw a record number of large open interest holders in our SOFR futures of 175-large open interest holders. We have more than 500 participants trading in the SOFR future. Last thing I'll mention maybe in terms of SOFR is that if you look at the global software marketplace in terms of futures, we have about 80% of the average daily volume so far this year, and we are running 92%, 93% of the global open interest. So we see recently, good growth in the back end of the rafters, also extremely good growth in our SOFR features. They absolutely have somewhat different takes on the rate market and both very useful from a participant standpoint. We have seen from IBA and the FCA. They recently did launch a survey, I guess, of where they are potentially looking at whether or not LIBOR should continue to be published post June of 2023. So that's a long time away. There's a lot of uncertainty. In the meantime, our silver futures are growing strongly. The back end of the Euro-Dollar features are growing strongly. And I think we're exactly where we wanted to be. As Terry mentioned, in terms of efficiencies, with the huge open interest in there your all futures, the bulk of the open interest and silver futures. Obviously, from an execution clearing standpoint, both, right? In commodity spreads on the execution side, as well as then margin offsets between the 2 futures contracts, no one else can compete with those sets of efficiencies. In addition to that, we've got SOFR interest rate swaps as well as obviously all of our LIBOR-based interest rate swaps. And the potential for portfolio margining offsets then between all of those futures and all those swaps last. In terms of the portfolio margin, I think you talked about this on the last earnings call, but we did offer starting December of last year. Portfolio margining between her options and interest rate swaps. We've got more than a handful of participants taking advantage of that and already getting well over 100 million a day worth of margin efficiency. So we continue to enhance the efficiencies. Last thing, I will mention one last thing, don't forget, we have the single largest U.S. treasury repo platform on the planet. That is where SOFR is created every day to a large extent. So we also are providing that the actual transactions that go to making up so for every day in addition to our server future center service swaps, and I will end there."

We released our executive summary this morning, which provides extensive details on the fourth quarter and 2020. As John said, I have John; Sean; Derek; Sunil; and Julie Winkler here with me this morning, and we look forward to addressing any questions that you may have. 2020 was a challenge with low volatility in several asset classes, including the front end of the rate curve and in our WTI contract for much of the year. We did see some very encouraging signs with some of our higher-rate-per-contract products. Also, during 2020, metals had its fifth consecutive year of record annual volume and is off to a strong start in 2021. We saw very strong activity in our agricultural commodities in the fourth quarter, and they continued to rise in the first month of this year, up 36% versus last year. Soybean Futures had its second highest quarterly ADV, including record volume out of both Europe and Asia. After the extreme volatility of the first quarter of 2020, as the pandemic began. The volume -- the total volume came in at 15.6 million contracts per day in the third quarter and jumped to 16.2 million contracts per day in Q4. During this entire time, we have remained heavily engaged with our global customers. During 2020, our volume from clients outside the United States grew by 7%, reflecting the global relevance of our markets. I am encouraged by the January 2021 volume, which came in at more than   19-million   contracts per day. We are very pleased with the progress we've made integrating the next business during 2020, including back office migrations, to support finance and HR systems and the building of an integrated global sales team. Last week, we announced that BrokerTec has migrated to U.S. Treasury benchmark trading in EU government bond and repo markets onto Globex. With BrokerTec's dealer-to-dealer platform, now a fully integrated part of CME Globex, clients have an enhanced suite of government bond trading offerings across listed derivatives, cash and repo markets on a common platform, allowing greater operational and technological efficiencies when managing a risk across cash and futures. We remain excited about the mitigation -- or I should say, migration, excuse me, of EBS onto Globex by year-end and the ability to provide further efficiencies to our global customers in the FX market. During 2020 and the first quarter of this year, we have continued to innovate with several new products and will begin trading global emission offset contracts referred to as GEO futures on March 1. And we just launched our new Ether features earlier this week. We continue to work closely with our global customer base on solutions to help them manage their risks. These new products build on globally relevant products we have delivered recently, including SOFR futures, even the S&P ESG futures, the South American Soybean contract, Cobalt futures, Options on our popular bitcoin features and the popular micro products across several of our asset classes. With that, let me turn it over to John, who will discuss the financial results."

Throughout 2020, we navigated the difficult operating environment, executed on the integration with NEX, launched new and innovative products and actively manage our expenses. For the year, we delivered $4.9 billion in revenue, up slightly from the prior year, and with a strong focus on expenses, we achieved $6.72 in adjusted diluted EPS. During the year, we announced our annual variable dividend of $2.5 per share, and we recently announced a regular dividend of $0.90 per share for the first quarter of 2021, a 6% increase compared to the first quarter last year. In terms of fourth quarter revenue, our average rate per contract across the product areas were fairly stable with our micro contracts continued to perform well across several asset classes. Market data revenue was very strong with an all-time quarterly high of $140 million and was up over 7% compared to Q4 last year.
We were intensely focused on expense management throughout the year. At the beginning of 2020, we provided guidance for adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees of between $1.64 billion and $1.65 billion. For the year, we came in approximately $90 million below the midpoint of that range and $80 million below 2019 levels at $1.557 billion. In terms of synergies, we had initially targeted $110 million in run rate synergies by the end of 2020 related to the next acquisition. By year-end, we had exceeded that target and achieved a total of $140 million in synergies. This is net of the additional costs that we are carrying to run parallel infrastructures as we continue to work on the migrations to Globex. We remain committed to our target of $200 million of annual run rate synergies by the end of 2021. Turning to guidance. For 2021, we currently expect full year adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, to increase slightly from the already low 2020-levels to $1.575 billion. For capital expenditures, excluding onetime integration costs and net of leasehold improvement allowances, we expect to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million. In addition, we expect our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate to be between 23.2% and 24.2%. The finally, we are very excited about the recently announced joint venture with IHS market and the opportunities that it will provide our clients and our shareholders. The JV will be a leader in trade processing and risk mitigation services that offers the combined clients complementary services across the global OTC marketplace and interest rate, FX, equity and credit asset classes. We don't anticipate any material change to earnings as a result of the JV we will provide more information when the transaction closes. With that short summary, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Based on the number of analysts covering us, please limit yourself to one question, and then feel free to jump back into the queue. Thank you."

So if you look at it on a year-by-year basis, we overachieved by, in terms of run rate synergies, by $14 million last year in 2,000 -- by the end of 2019, and again, overachieved by approximately the same amount this year, we overachieved by about 16 this year. In terms of run rate synergies. In terms of P&L, we anticipate our synergies being realized in our income statement in 2021 of $35 million. And so that is what we expect to have in our P&L. This is being offset by additional costs that we anticipate having in terms of increased depreciation related to our migrations onto Globex so the way that works is that we do some programming that goes into work in process and that goes from work in process into production and when it goes into production and that's amortized over several years. We also are building out our data center and disaster recovery center on the East Coast. That's partially being offset by the synergy capture. And lastly, in terms of our impacts, we do anticipate having some improved environment in terms of in terms of operating environment towards the back half of this year, and we anticipate having about $20 million in additional costs that we didn't have this year that we are building into the back half of 2021 related primarily to travel, marketing and events.

We've got a total of 7 different initiatives that we will be taking in order to make that platform more attractive relative to alternatives.

Yes, we did have a record year as data services. Our revenue being up 5% year-on-year. I think that work from home environment kind of further highlighted that need for real-time data access really across our global client base.
As well as the need for historical data, right, as we evaluated really the impacts of the volatile market conditions that we saw in Q2. We also made some investments in our business last year. And so bringing that data business closer to our commercial capabilities. We established a data sales team, and we also supported a number of new products and services. And so that's where we really feel kind of that continued investment is certainly helping to grow the data business and positioning us well as we head into 2021. Those solid trends, we continue to see in the professional subscriber device count was strong throughout the quarter. And in Q4, revenue was up 7% compared to where we were in Q4 2019. And so I think it's a strong -- definitely global demand as well as things on the drive data front that are really kind of propelling the business. And this is just that longer-term trend that we've talked about on other calls of customers' use of technology and their trading strategies is increasing the need for our data through a number of these non-display use cases. So we did have some minor fee adjustments that are being made in 2021 to really reflect how our customers are utilizing our data now and also just the value of the data that we offer and the services that we have and how our market data customers are really receiving and expecting to receive that data. So there was a $5 increase to our real-time data. From   $105   to   $110   per-dcm-per-month. That goes into effect in April. And then we also had some pricing changes on the non display and historical redistribution side. And those will kind of trickle in throughout the year since there's certainly some licensing and implementation that will need to be done between ourselves and our customers. But we feel well that we're in a good position. And as we onboard those customers and that we're really going to be in a good position to continue to grow the business going forward."

And a lot of questions in there, so I will start and then hand things back to Terry. So I really think -- and you mentioned it a couple of our broker partners in your question, and it's really because of that strong broker distribution network, the vast educational programs and really the content that we support, the diverse product mix that we were in a really good position to be able to take advantage of the increase in overall retail trading in '20 we saw record levels of participation in revenue globally. And the number of retail traders that were active at CME group last year increased over 50%. and so the biggest gains were definitely on the equity index product side, where the volatility there really led to a lot of increased trading opportunities. And we also saw great year-on-year gains in metals that were up over 20%, FX as well as eggs. And that really speaks to, again, the diverse product mix and the fact that people are looking for different opportunities. We have been investing quite a bit in our sales and marketing staff overseas, both in APAC and EMEA. And those are playing also a large role as we've grown the business globally on the retail side. So we saw both APAC and EMEA retail business was up double digits. Countries of strong growth continue to be: Korea; Taiwan; and Singapore; and then Germany; and Switzerland; and Europe. So I think that -- the work-from-home environment has allowed, I think, the potential, right, for even more retail customers become active. And our digital outreach, I think, was also just a real positive trend last year because we're able to just reach more retail and active traders than ever before and so the efforts through our education helped us reach over 2.5 million new active individual traders throughout the broker partner digital events that we have that were focused specifically on CME group products. The largest growth in Asia, we had events that the number of events increased over 65% over 2019, so well over 400-events and by going digital, we reach 15x more active traders than we have in the past when more of those events were in person, and also we're seeing somewhat strong trends in North America where the firms there were growing their webinar output by 225%. So we feel that this continued investment is leading us to have well dedicated retail traders, and that really kind of helps position us for continued success. And with that, I'll maybe turn it over to Terry."

You answered a lot of the questions, but let me just add a little bit, and I'm going to ask John to comment a little bit on the cost of some of these products, too. It's really hard for us to predict, Brian, what we think 2021 future volumes are for any particular constituent or market participant going forward. But it doesn't take the last several weeks for us to think about the growth of retail trading. So I don't -- that's not the reason why we talk about retail trading. As you know, we've been building on this business for a number of years. But it's become more and more clear that, in my opinion, that retail traders want to have a participate in all different forms of markets. We are looking at all different ways to allow them to come into our markets. As Julie referenced, education is key though. He talked a little bit about the micros and the growth of them. We are looking at other ways to continually work with our partners to bring in more and more retail participants. It's just one of those things that's not going away. I don't believe it's going away. And I don't say that because of what happened with the run-up in some of the recent equities or even in what they perceive is running up in the silver. You can talk about fundamental stories that are in silver versus not fundamental stories of some of the other products that had runs on them. But there's no question about it that the proliferation of social media, the proliferation of access to marketplaces is allowing people to participate more and more, and they want to do that. And I think it's extremely encouraging for more and more young people to have interest in financial services and financial markets. So we want to take advantage of that with them and bring them along. Again, a very thoughtful, smart way, as Julie outlined. So it's not only micro products that we have, working retails, we're looking at new and innovative ways to continue to move forward with this growing constituency of clients. So very excited by the growth of that but at the same time, I don't mind you to think that we're just at putting all of our everything into 1 basket, such as retail because we're not -- I mean, the institutional clients of this company are critically important. The commercials are critically important. So all the different parts that go into making a trade work are very important as we continue to move forward and grow this business. But we do not want to deny on the access to the retail participant in a good, thoughtful, smart way. And I would like to talk a little bit about a couple of some of the fee changes associated with some of these micro products. And maybe I can ask John to do that."

As we as everybody here knows, the micros have been a tremendous success, not just in equities but also in metals as well. When you take a look at the equity micros, you've seen our RPC steadily increase over time. It was at $0.124 per round turn in Q4 of 2019, and it hit approximately 2 million contracts a day in Q4 of 2020. And the RBC increased to $0.14. This year, we're taking a very targeted approach to pricing and we're really -- we're focused on changes to the non-member fees in our micro products with increases in micro equities of $0.05 per side micro gold of $0.20 per side and micro silver of $0.40 per se, and those are for non member fees. So I think we're continuing to add value in that product, whether it's increasing liquidity working with our intermediary partners through education and also launching new products with the options on our equity products. For the micro. So those are some changes that we'll be rolling through beginning in February. Before that gives you a little color where we're at with that,"

We're extremely excited about the joint venture with IHS market for the customers and our shareholders. I'll be a leader in the trade processing and post-trade services and will benefit customers by providing more efficient access to services and we think it will be a great platform to launch new solutions across a broad set of asset classes, including interest rates, FX, equity and credit this will allow us to innovate and bring to market analytics, workflow tools and solutions that allow clients to manage their risk and process more efficiently. So when you look at when you look at the client base, there is a substantial overlap in terms of large global banks, utilizing the services both of market serve and our optimization businesses, but they're all across complementary asset classes. So the strengths of markets serve are very complementary to the strengths of our optimization businesses. So what does that mean for clients? That means a much more efficient way for them to access those services because a lot of the information going to those platforms are very similar and by providing one kind of point-of-access for that information, will provide a lot of efficiencies for the clients and also reduce the amount of errors that could potentially occur as processes could potentially break down as you're accessing multiple platforms across multiple businesses. So very, very excited about that. So like I said, the added value, I think, that we're going to be able to provide, which I think will be very compelling for the clients is around additional analytics, additional workflow tools and additional solutions that we're going to be able to offer clients because we're going to be in a place where we're going to be able to provide our clients a window into a lot of their trade processing and post-trade services across all those asset classes. So we think it's going to be pretty exciting. Just a couple of quick points on it. It is -- it's going to be a 50-50 joint venture so we will be using the equity method of accounting, and it will not be consolidated at CME group. So it will be -- so you'll see a shift in the geography of our income statement the revenue and expenses will be netted in the equity and unconsolidated subsidiary line of our income statement, similar to our indexing joint venture with S&P Global. And as I mentioned, we don't anticipate any material changes to our earnings. One other point, just from a financial perspective is between now and close, we'll be categorizing the optimization businesses as a held for sale asset in our 2021 financial statements. So this will mainly impact balance sheet presentation, and there will be minimal impact on our pro forma operating results. So some change in geography, but most importantly, a very positive change for the business. And I think a real positive for our clients."

Yes, we've seen a lot of action, actually, just in the last 6 weeks. If you look at the run-up of the activity over the last 6 weeks, you've seen crude recover you've seen WTI and Brent actually move up and lock that. There are a number of fundamental drivers as to what's going on. The market is generally responding to the increased expectation for economic activity with the vaccines rolling out. You've got significant reduced stocks in Cushing. If you actually look at the drop in barrels. We've seen about a 14% reduction in the existing stock in Cushing.
This reduction is about   14%   when you look at the -- what's actually driving the uncertainty around U.S. energy policy and the Biden-Administration and the increased flow of exports in the U.S., they're actually seeing the energy curve in WTI right now in what's called backwardation, where the front end of the curve is more expensive than the back end of the curve. And why is that important? That's hugely important because that actually feeds into the narrative that we're seeing more broadly play out in both metals and particularly in AGS, with an overall price rising cycle. What that means is you've got folks filing in on the increase and expectations for growth in pricing, what impact has that had in the business. We actually sell one of our biggest days in WTI. Yesterday, we traded about $1.3 million contracts. If you look at our February ADV, it's about $1.1 million. That's up from $784,000 in Q4 of last year. The reason that's important is that, that's actually driven us back to open interest levels, that we haven't seen for over 2.5 years. We're about 2.45 million contracts open interest versus where Brent is at about -- right about $2.6 million.
So as you've heard us talk about, Mike, as increasing economic activity takes place, that's representing itself in the form of use of our crew benchmark globally. OI on the rise. Institutional investments flowing in and there's broader talk of the overall commodity cycle resuming you've got soybeans and $13.5. You've got corn of $5 and you've got oil at highs in over 1 year or   9   now. So if the market is paying for economic recovery, you're seeing that reflecting both -- just below record levels of WTI, OI and record amounts of ag and metals product going through the franchise as well. So I think that's -- this is the place people are playing that global reflation trade, and that's where you're looking at roll yields in WTI at 8%. So institutional investors are looking for yield. This is the place to get it in this market right now."

So there's no question we're seeing a much better market environment in the last couple of months across the rates businesses. A very exciting development and one that we've expected. And we are especially seeing that further out the curve. Some examples in terms of the market itself. If you look at the 2-year versus 30-year spread, that has widened out to 1.81% or 181 basis points. We haven't seen an environment like that since February of 2017. So the market is expecting very strong growth, and that's a very good indicator of strong growth on a go-forward basis. Also, just very briefly, in terms of the treasury inflation protected securities or TIPS. If look at the 10-year TIPS, they're now implying an inflation rate, a consumer inflation rate over the next decade of 2.21%. That's the highest level we've seen in implied inflation since 2014. If you get the 5-year TIPS, it's even more impressive at 2.31% implied by the market for inflation over the next 5 years. We haven't seen anything like that since 2013. How is that impacting our markets? It's been a very big positive impact, especially on the long end. We've seen several new records this year in terms of open interest in terms of our ultra 10-year futures, in particular. We've also seen very good growth overall in the long end of the treasury curve. So if you look through January, the ultra 10-year ADV was up 44% year-over-year. The bond future is up 13%, the Ultra Bonds, up 7%. And if you look further out the curve, if you look at -- in particular, I guess, if you look at the back $32 million, the back 32-contracts in our your dollar futures. We've seen significant growth there in the fourth quarter, which was a very positive results. And further, I guess, I looked in detail at the greens and the Blues. So what are the greens? The Greens are the 2023 euro-dollar features and the Blues are the 2024 our futures. So 2023, your dollar futures are running, NADB up more than 100%. And this year versus total year last year, and the blue yard all features likewise, up more than 100% this year versus last year. The last thing I'll mention maybe on the market side that's directly impacting us if you go back to the third quarter of last year, the first implied tightening by the marketplace was in December of 2024. And if you look at today's marketplace, they're applying a tightening in the summer of 2023. So you see the much improved market outlook, the impact on market pricing. And significant impact on our volume. Actually, I will mention, I apologize, one last thing, large open interest holders have also seen a very nice balance. Actually, since December 1, our rates -- large open interest holders has increased by 9% and has recovered half of the losses basically that we saw during the recent crisis, rolling 9% below the all-time highs in our rates -- large major folders. The first time we reached that peak where we are -- sorry, last time we reached for the first time, I should say, we reached the current levels of LOIH rates with 2018. So we're seeing a big recovery there as well. Sorry, Terry."

And I think when you look at the changes that we're making, I think from an overall company perspective, they're relatively modest. But when you look at the micros, I think there you'll see a more meaningful impact in terms of in terms of the revenue. And we don't think this is going to be impacting volume necessarily. We're providing a lot of value for the clients in a product that's highly liquid so we think -- so we think it will be, from a volume perspective, not as impactful.
When you look at the capture rate, generally speaking, it's roughly an 80-20 rule. 80% of the volume coming from coming from non members, I'm sorry, and then 20% coming from non members. So when you think about the capture rate that's something to think about. So about 20% of the volume roughly will be impacted by the fee increase on the equity side. In metals, it's a little bit different. It's a little bit heavier on the non-member side. A little bit higher than the 80 to 20 in terms of the non members."

We need to make sure that we're comfortable going forward. We've always said we're going to walk before we run when it comes to cryptos, I think, with the launch of our new ether contract and people having the ability to trade one against another. We want to see how that starts to pan out for the parent trading or spread trading or other terms. And I think that's important before we decide we're going to move forward with a smaller version of a crypto contract. So again, I think this contract is not that old. It's a relatively new. The options. We're just listed on it, I believe, in the last several months. I'm a big believer, do you have to get a liquid options market along with your futures contracts, so you can continue to bring it to a broader audience? And that broader audience might be with the people that we referenced in the earlier part of this call, which is more on the retail side. And they will obviously not -- it's hard for them to participate in such a high-value contract. So smaller versions are something obviously, we're looking at it, but we have no plans to make any announcements on the launch of something of that nature just at this point."

You get that with all different participants. And that is one thing that I've said forever, which is a benefit to this organization, that we are a highly regulated entity, and I believe regulation lends the credibility of any business and allows us to grow globally, and that's exactly what we've been able to do because of good smart regulation. Now the question might be is do we invite different types of regulation because of the retail client entering into the marketplace, I don't believe so only because we've got a growth of retail over the years regardless. And I think when people have access to marketplaces, it's not like the SEC, where the SEC's main mission is to protect the public for manipulation and fraud and other things, we have a global regulator that obviously is looking into those things as well. But I am very convinced that the retail participants will continue to grow, and it doesn't mean you have to have additional burdens from regulation against them or against the                 that wants to house them as your practices are in good housekeeping for lack of a better term from your margin requirements to the money that you have on deposit for -- at your FCM. So the whole those are things that the smaller clients need to make sure that they have to understand that they still need to have those requirements. I'll ask Julie to make some comments on the retail globally and other places as well. Julie, do you want to comment a little bit about that? But I think on the regulation side, Chris, I don't believe, because the growth of these particular group of people that would invite new regulation. I think what you're seeing right now is a lot of headline regulation being discussed, it doesn't mean it's going to happen."

I think he makes a very good point about the differences in the market structure, right, between equity markets and futures. The other thing I'd just add is that this is a critical part of what our broker partners and intermediaries really do to ensure that the retail and active traders that are going to be trading futures are qualified to do so. And so we work with our partners throughout the globe to ensure that. So just because you're able to trade in the equity market that's not the same as having a futures account. And so there has to be an intentional opening of that account. Those restrictions are different varying on countries. But what we see is that typically, right, there's a graduation of retail and active traders from trading the equity markets into trading equity options and then coming into the derivatives marketplace. And so that lends itself to be a more sophisticated retail trader. And that's part of what we work with our broker partners on the education front as well. So they are well versed and what they're getting into and opening up accounts because they're ready to trade in our markets because we want to make sure they are well supported and that we have a good customer experience for them and a diverse set of products for them to access."

So it had nothing to do with it, but people are seeming to pick their favorite regulation mature or tax assure to add to what's going on in the marketplace over the last several weeks as it relates to some of this retail activity. Of which it has nothing to do with it. So I'm hopeful that we always have the ability to go voice our opinions as it relates to some of the potential regulatory conversations.

We're very excited actually about the developments and the success we've had recently in our FX futures marketplace. We have, over the last few years, been continuously reducing the minimum price increments. We've done it across 9-different instruments. Very excited actually late last year. We saw an all-time record open interest in our Euro versus USD futures. Which is really main thing, given the fact that volatility has been -- has had a tremendous dampening effect on volumes. If you look at last year across each of the major currency pairs, the volatility ranking was typically the lowest decile going back the last 20 years. So in other words, 90% of the time over the last 20 years, volatility was higher in each of the major currency pairs. Nonetheless, even in that environment. We saw a record number of record open interest in those Euro versus USD contracts. In addition to that, the changes we've been making in order to make our complex much more attractive. We've also seen recently good growth in box trading. So in the month of December, we saw our largest ever U.S. dollar versus sterling, options block trade, and that was the equivalent of $2 billion in a single trade. So market participants are migrating more of their options activity towards the listed space. That actually could accelerate through this year, why, something we haven't spoken about in a while because it was delayed last year relative to COVID. But we do expect there'll be 100-new participants, at least 100 new participants. That are required this year globally to adhere to the uncleared margin rules that in September of this year. That should drive more products requiring greater efficiencies, and in particular, could positively impact our FX options. In the month of January after we saw the record block size in December in Dollar versus Sterling, we saw a record block size in Aussie dollars, that was AUD 4 billion. So we have seen our efforts futures last year actually outperformed the spot marketplaces. And we're seeing now some uptick in the option space, particularly in box. In terms of what the team is doing in order to make the platform much more attractive and to take the unique set of assets we have right? So we now have the EBS as well as the futures data. So we are looking to use this unique set of assets in order to bring greater analytics, greater tools to the marketplace to cross-sell our products down, and particularly cross-sell the futures down the EBS distribution channel and to show participants the value of using both marketplaces. We have the analytics now that we've recently launched that show market participants that you really need to use both the futures as well as the spot liquidity pools. In order to optimize your execution and reduce your execution cost. Some of the new tools that we've launched. So we launched the new FX swap rate monitor. We did that now late summer of last year. More than 4,000 views, more than 3,000 users. This is using our FX link product. It's the first time ever. There's a central limit order book to standardized, clear lower total cost alternatives, FX swaps available to market participants we're seeing some greater uptake there. We are making some enhancements to technology that will come out later this year that will make it much easier to consume for participants, and we do expect to see significant growth once that technology is released. In addition to that, we also released the new FX Vol-converter tool. This takes all of our listed FX options and it converts it to OTC equivalents so all OTC participants can see our FX options on futures the same way they look at the OTC markets. We think that, that's a part of what drove that record block trade in December and the record block trade in January. Last thing I'll mention is our FX market profile tool. This for the first time, synchronizes the data between EBS spot foreign exchange and our foreign exchange futures. It shows the relative liquidity that did offer spread, the top of book, so the size available to hit a list in each of the 2 markets simultaneously, and it quantitatively shows participants the benefits. The benefits of using both marketplaces. So we're very excited about these new tools. We are distributing them out to the very large tail of clients who use EBS, especially regional banks across Europe and Asia. And most exciting is, I mentioned earlier, the excitement I have over the migration of BrokerTec over Globex and how that's going to allow us to offer new products and services with that greater technology. Similarly, on the EBS side, we'll be migrating CBS over the Globex later this year, which will allow us to offer many new products and services across that platform, #1. #2, it will also make it much simpler. Once we move it over for participants to trade on EBS. So we should be able to attract new participants. Last thing I'll mention is we've been investing in direct streaming technology. And we do expect to roll that out likewise later this year. We expect to have the State-of-the-Art                 strain platform available for participants in foreign exchange later this year. Once we do that foreign exchange, we will actually also roll that out in U.S. treasuries."

And I think what you're seeing right now, and you're absolutely right, there is an absence of mandates globally right now there. The existing markets, again, emissions tend to be very, very regional in nature. And why we're excited about working with CBL exchange on this, which is our partner developing this contract, is that this represents a significant change in that these carbon offset futures represent a contract that is an offset versus whatever it is, in fact, underlying product or emitter might be involved in, not limited just to the energy markets, imagine a farmer that wants to manage this carbon footprint. To imagine an aluminum company that wants to adhere to either voluntary standards or regional standards and emissions credit. So this is a product that very capably is able to extend outside of just the traditional space in energy and have an application across a full range of our commodities participants even non-commodities participants. The feedback that we've gotten both in the validation stage is going out to the market and assessing an interest in this. And actually, since we've announced has been bigger and actually more overwhelming than we had anticipated. So to remind everybody, this is a voluntary emission offset. It's based on standards that the market participants are agreeing to and the competitive space is one that is open right now. When you look at the position that we're in, in our commodities markets, we are the largest metals market. We are the largest energy market, we're the largest agricultural products market. So the application of these offset products extend well beyond just the energy space. So we think this is going to be a process of not just dealing with fossil fuels market in transition you look at most company charters right now.
Everybody is trying to adhere to ESG standards that apply to what they feel our covent footprint needs are. So this is broadly applicable to a lot of different market participants. The feedback we're getting validates that. We're excited to get this out. We've got a whole host of market makers and market takers lined up on this. So we're excited about what this could mean. And this is a slightly different product than what you're seeing in the existing product site that we have and others have that are really regionally focused. So we think this is early days in this. We think this is extensible out to the range of benchmark markets that we run and where we run the majority of liquidity in. And so we think this will be a great service to customers looking to extend their ESG credentials and managed our carbon footprint and really new and unique and market-oriented ways."

Is it improvement in revenue growth moving into different asset classes, adding nontransaction businesses. Just wondering kind of what the strategic priority is?"

I don't -- there hasn't been any change in terms of our M&A strategy. We are always looking for opportunities to create shareholder value and as you've heard across the board here, create efficiencies and opportunities for our clients. So the recently announced joint venture with IHS market is a great example of that. Where we're taking our assets, combining them with assets of a partner of ours and creating value for our clients and ultimately, our shareholders by providing more efficiencies for those clients and then using that as a platform to provide other services around that. So that's our primary focus. I wouldn't say that we necessarily are looking specifically for a type of revenue whether it's whether it's transactional or subscription, I would say we're more focused on optimizing the revenue and based on the industry that asset is in. We are very focused on completing the next -- the next integration as we mentioned previously, we're targeting $200 million in run rate synergies by the end of this year. We're well on track. We've exceeded our synergies each of the last 2 years. And we're well on track to achieve that $200 million for 2021. So that's our point of view. And with that, I'll I turn it over to the next question."

And I think what you heard from Sean earlier, and I'm sure he'll references himself, but I didn't want to be remiss if I didn't say it again. When we're looking at the growth of the   back-32   of the euro-dollar contract like we're seeing today, we're looking at the growth of the SOFR futures contract, like we're seeing today of roughly 94%, 96% of the open interest being held here at CME, we are the beneficiaries of both products growing. And that is something we said is a strong possibility, and we're starting to see that mature in our favor, and we're very encouraged by that. So John can talk about the timing or the transition from LIBOR to sulfur and I guess, Sean, it could be a bit speculative, but there are some hard dates that people are talking about and fallbacks associated with it.

So thanks so much, Terry, for that, and thanks for the question. There are several points in there. So again, if you at the   back-32   between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter 10 the ADV grew. So it's in the euro-dollar futures, they grew by 36%. So a very positive result. As I said earlier, we've seen very good growth in January in the greens and the blues of the 2023 and 2024 contracts. So for that curve, the OR future is growing very strongly. At the same time, we've recently seen a number of records in our SOFR futures. 2020 was a record year for volume, so for futures of 51,000 contracts. And so far this year, we're doing more than 100,000 contracts a day. In January, we also saw an open interest cure of 727,000 SOFR futures contracts. We also saw a record number of large open interest holders in our SOFR futures of 175-large open interest holders. We have more than 500 participants trading in the SOFR future. Last thing I'll mention maybe in terms of SOFR is that if you look at the global software marketplace in terms of futures, we have about 80% of the average daily volume so far this year, and we are running 92%, 93% of the global open interest. So we see recently, good growth in the back end of the rafters, also extremely good growth in our SOFR features. They absolutely have somewhat different takes on the rate market and both very useful from a participant standpoint. We have seen from IBA and the FCA. They recently did launch a survey, I guess, of where they are potentially looking at whether or not LIBOR should continue to be published post June of 2023. So that's a long time away. There's a lot of uncertainty. In the meantime, our silver futures are growing strongly. The back end of the Euro-Dollar features are growing strongly. And I think we're exactly where we wanted to be. As Terry mentioned, in terms of efficiencies, with the huge open interest in there your all futures, the bulk of the open interest and silver futures. Obviously, from an execution clearing standpoint, both, right? In commodity spreads on the execution side, as well as then margin offsets between the 2 futures contracts, no one else can compete with those sets of efficiencies. In addition to that, we've got SOFR interest rate swaps as well as obviously all of our LIBOR-based interest rate swaps. And the potential for portfolio margining offsets then between all of those futures and all those swaps last. In terms of the portfolio margin, I think you talked about this on the last earnings call, but we did offer starting December of last year. Portfolio margining between her options and interest rate swaps. We've got more than a handful of participants taking advantage of that and already getting well over 100 million a day worth of margin efficiency. So we continue to enhance the efficiencies. Last thing, I will mention one last thing, don't forget, we have the single largest U.S. treasury repo platform on the planet. That is where SOFR is created every day to a large extent. So we also are providing that the actual transactions that go to making up so for every day in addition to our server future center service swaps, and I will end there."

As John said, I have John; Sean; Derek; Sunil; and Julie Winkler here with me this morning, and we look forward to addressing any questions that you may have. 2020 was a challenge with low volatility in several asset classes, including the front end of the rate curve and in our WTI contract for much of the year. We did see some very encouraging signs with some of our higher-rate-per-contract products. Also, during 2020, metals had its fifth consecutive year of record annual volume and is off to a strong start in 2021. We saw very strong activity in our agricultural commodities in the fourth quarter, and they continued to rise in the first month of this year, up 36% versus last year. 
Soybean Futures had its second-highest quarterly ADV, including record volume out of both Europe and Asia. After the extreme volatility of the first quarter of 2020, as the pandemic began the volume -- the total volume came in at 15.6 million contracts per day in the third quarter and jumped to 16.2 million contracts per day in Q4. During this entire time, we have remained heavily engaged with our global customers. During 2020, our volume from clients outside the United States grew by 7%, reflecting the global relevance of our markets. I am encouraged by the January 2021 volume, which came in at more than 19 million contracts per day. We are very pleased with the progress we've made integrating the NEX business during 2020, including back-office migrations, to support finance and HR systems and the building of an integrated global sales team. 
Last week, we announced that BrokerTec has migrated to U.S. Treasury benchmark trading in EU government bond and repo markets onto Globex. With BrokerTec's dealer-to-dealer platform, now a fully integrated part of CME Globex, clients have an enhanced suite of government bond trading offerings across listed derivatives, cash and repo markets on a common platform, allowing greater operational and technological efficiencies when managing a risk across cash and futures. We remain excited about the mitigation -- or I should say, migration, excuse me, of EBS onto Globex by year-end and the ability to provide further efficiencies to our global customers in the FX market. During 2020 and the first quarter of this year, we have continued to innovate with several new products and will begin trading global emission offset contracts referred to as GEO futures on March 1. And we just launched our new Ether futures earlier this week. We continue to work closely with our global customer base on solutions to help them manage their risks.
 
These new products build on globally relevant products we have delivered recently, including SOFR futures, even the S&P ESG futures, the South American Soybean contract, Cobalt futures, Options on our popular Bitcoin futures and the popular micro products across several of our asset classes. With that, let me turn it over to John, who will discuss the financial results. John?"

For the year, we delivered $4.9 billion in revenue, up slightly from the prior year, and with a strong focus on expenses, we achieved $6.72 in adjusted diluted EPS. During the year, we announced our annual variable dividend of $2.50 per share, and we recently announced a regular dividend of $0.90 per share for the first quarter of 2021, a 6% increase compared to the first quarter last year. In terms of fourth quarter revenue, our average rate per contract across the product areas were fairly stable with our micro contracts continuing to perform well across several asset classes. Market data revenue was very strong, with an all-time quarterly high of $140 million and was up over 7% compared to Q4 last year.
We were intensely focused on expense management throughout the year. At the beginning of 2020, we provided guidance for adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees of between $1.64 billion and $1.65 billion. For the year, we came in approximately $90 million below the midpoint of that range and $80 million below 2019 levels at $1.557 billion. In terms of synergies, we had initially targeted $110 million in run rate synergies by the end of 2020 related to the next acquisition. By year-end, we had exceeded that target and achieved a total of $140 million in synergies. This is net of the additional costs that we are carrying to run parallel infrastructures as we continue to work on the migrations to Globex. We remain committed to our target of $200 million of annual run rate synergies by the end of 2021. 
Turning to guidance. For 2021, we currently expect full year adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, to increase slightly from the already low 2020 levels to $1.575 billion. For capital expenditures, excluding onetime integration costs and net of leasehold improvement allowances, we expect to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million. In addition, we expect our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate to be between 23.2% and 24.2%. Finally, we are very excited about the recently announced joint venture with IHS Markit and the opportunities that it will provide our clients and our shareholders. The JV will be a leader in trade processing and risk mitigation services that offers the combined clients complementary services across the global OTC marketplace and interest rate, FX, equity and credit asset classes. We don't anticipate any material change to earnings as a result of the JV. We will provide more information when the transaction closes. 
With that short summary, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Based on the number of analysts covering us, please limit yourself to one question, and then feel free to jump back into the queue. Thank you."

So if you take a look at where we're at in terms of run rate synergies, we had originally targeted $50 million in the first year, we achieved $64 million. We had targeted $110 million by the end of this year and achieved $140 million, and we're planning on achieving the full $200 million by the end of this year. So if you look at it on a year-by-year basis, we overachieved by -- in terms of run rate synergies, by $14 million last year in 2000 -- by the end of 2019, and again, overachieved by approximately the same amount this year. We overachieved by about $16 million this year, in terms of run rate synergies. 
In terms of P&L, we anticipate our synergies being realized in our income statement in 2021 of $35 million. And so that is what we expect to have in our P&L. This is being offset by additional costs that we anticipate having in terms of increased depreciation related to our migrations onto Globex, so the way that works is that we do some programming that goes into work in process and that goes from work in process into production and when it goes into production then that's amortized over several years. We also are building out our data center and disaster recovery center on the East Coast. That's partially being offset by the synergy capture. And lastly, in terms of our impacts, we do anticipate having some improved environment in terms of operating environment towards the back half of this year, and we anticipate having about $20 million in additional costs that we didn't have this year that we are building into the back half of 2021 related primarily to travel, marketing and events. So that's the story for 2021."

We are very excited about the migration of BrokerTec over to the Globex platform. I think I've spoken about before, but I'll mention it now. We are very excited, in particular, with the new technology of being able to offer new products and services, in particular, the new RV or relative value curve trading order type. So we're are -- why are we very excited about this? Curve trades, spreads, very popular, especially in this market. And this new order type will allow you to reduce the risk of trading that order type by eliminating the neutral ag transactions, one. Two, we are going to reduce the minimum price increments in the spreads relative to the outrights. And then three, we're going to have CME Globex implied to functionality, which means that when you have a spread order, let's say, between 2-year notes and 5-year notes, and you've got outright orders in 2-year notes that then should theoretically, but not only theoretically actually does on Globex imply outright orders in 5-year notes. 
So we're very excited about the new RV technology where we launched that in March. Shortly thereafter, we're also going to be reducing the known pricing come in those 2-year notes. We've got a total of 7 different initiatives that we will be taking in order to make that platform more attractive relative to alternatives. And in terms of pricing, I guess, I'm most focused on making sure that the platform is more valuable to our clients, and then we get more volume over our platform, and that's really our focus.

Yes, we did have a record year as data services. Our revenue being up 5% year-on-year. Yes, I think that work from home environment kind of further highlighted that need for real-time data access really across our global client base.
As well as the need for historical data, right, as we evaluated really the impacts of the volatile market conditions that we saw in Q2. We also made some investments in our business last year. And so bringing that data business closer to our commercial capabilities. We established a data sales team, and we also supported a number of new products and services. And so that's where we really feel kind of that continued investment is certainly helping to grow the data business and positioning us well as we head into 2021. Those solid trends, we continue to see in the professional subscriber device count was strong throughout the quarter. And in Q4, revenue was up 7% compared to where we were in Q4 2019. And so I think it's a strong -- definitely global demand as well as things on the drive data front that are really kind of propelling the business. 
And this is just that longer-term trend that we've talked about on other calls of customers' use of technology and their trading strategies is increasing the need for our data through a number of these nondisplay use cases. So we did have some minor fee adjustments that are being made in 2021. To really reflect how our customers are utilizing our data now and also just the value of the data that we offer and the services that we have and how our market data customers are really receiving and expecting to receive that data. So there was a $5 increase to our real-time data from $105 to $110 per DCM per month. That goes into effect in April. And then we also had some pricing changes on the nondisplay and historical redistribution side. And those will kind of trickle in throughout the year since there's certainly some licensing and implementation that will need to be done between ourselves and our customers. But we feel well that we're in a good position. And as we onboard those customers and that we're really going to be in a good position to continue to grow the business going forward."

And a lot of questions in there, so I will start and then hand things back to Terry. So I really think -- and you mentioned it, a couple of our broker partners in your question, and it's really because of that strong broker distribution network, the vast educational programs and really the content that we support, the diverse product mix that we were in a really good position to be able to take advantage of the increase in overall retail trading in 2020. We saw record levels of participation in revenue globally. And the number of retail traders that were active at CME Group last year increased over 50%. And so the biggest gains were definitely on the equity index product side, where the volatility there really led to a lot of increased trading opportunities. And we also saw great year-on-year gains in metals that were up over 20%, FX as well as ag. And that really speaks to, again, the diverse product mix and the fact that people are looking for different opportunities. 
We have been investing quite a bit in our sales and marketing staff overseas, both in APAC and EMEA. And those are playing also a large role as we've grown the business globally on the retail side. So we saw both APAC and EMEA retail business was up double digits. Countries of strong growth continue to be: Korea; Taiwan; and Singapore; and then Germany; and Switzerland; and Europe. So I think that -- the work-from-home environment has allowed, I think, the potential, right, for even more retail customers become active. And our digital outreach, I think, was also just a real positive trend last year because we're able to just reach more retail and active traders than ever before and so the efforts through our education helped us reach over 2.5 million new active individual traders throughout the broker partner digital events that we have that were focused specifically on CME Group products. 
The largest growth in Asia, we had events that -- the number of events increased over 65% over 2019, so well over 400 events and by going digital, we reach 15x more active traders than we have in the past when more of those events were in person, and also we're seeing somewhat strong trends in North America where the firms there were growing their webinar output by 225%. So we feel that this continued investment is leading us to have well-educated retail traders, and that really kind of helps position us for continued success. And with that, I'll maybe turn it over to Terry."

It's really hard for us to predict, Brian, what we think 2021 future volumes are for any particular constituent or market participant going forward. But it doesn't take the last several weeks for us to think about the growth of retail trading. So I don't -- that's not the reason why we talk about retail trading. As you know, we've been building on this business for a number of years. But it's become more and more clear that, in my opinion, that retail traders want to have a -- participate in all different forms of markets. We are looking at all different ways to allow them to come into our markets. 
As Julie referenced, education is key though. He talked a little bit about the micros and the growth of them. We are looking at other ways to continually work with our partners to bring in more and more retail participants. It's just one of those things that's not going away. I don't believe it's going away. And I don't say that because of what happened with the run-up in some of the recent equities or even in what they perceive as running up in the silver. You can talk about fundamental stories that are in silver versus not fundamental stories of some of the other products that had runs on them. But there's no question about it that the proliferation of social media, the proliferation of access to marketplaces is allowing people to participate more and more, and they want to do that. And I think it's extremely encouraging for more and more young people to have interest in financial services and financial markets. So we want to take advantage of that with them and bring them along in a very thoughtful, smart way, as Julie outlined. 
So it's not only micro products that we have, we're working on retails, we're looking at new and innovative ways to continue to move forward with this growing constituency of clients. So very excited by the growth of that but at the same time, I don't want you to think that we're just -- putting all of our -- everything into one basket, such as retail because we're not -- I mean, the institutional clients of this company are critically important. The commercials are critically important. So all the different parts that go into making a trade work are very important as we continue to move forward and grow this business. But -- and we do not want to deny the access to the retail participant in a good, thoughtful, smart way. And I would like to talk a little bit about a couple of some of the fee changes associated with some of these micro products. And maybe I can ask John to do that."

So I think we're continuing to add value in that product, whether it's increasing liquidity, working with our intermediary partners through education and also launching new products with the options on our equity products for the micros.

We're extremely excited about the joint venture with IHS Markit for the customers and our shareholders. It will be a leader in the trade processing and post-trade services and will benefit customers by providing more efficient access to services, and we think it will be a great platform to launch new solutions across a broad set of asset classes, including interest rates, FX, equity and credit. This will allow us to innovate and bring to market analytics, workflow tools and solutions that allow clients to manage their risk and process more efficiently. So when you look at the client base, there is a substantial overlap in terms of the large global banks, utilizing the services both of market serve and our optimization businesses, but they're all across complementary asset classes. So the strengths of markets serve are very complementary to the strengths of our optimization businesses. 
So what does that mean for clients? That means a much more efficient way for them to access those services because a lot of the information going to those platforms are very similar and by providing one kind of point-of-access for that information, will provide a lot of efficiencies for the clients and also reduce the amount of errors that could potentially occur as processes could potentially break down as you're accessing multiple platforms across multiple businesses. So very, very excited about that. So like I said, the added value, I think, that we're going to be able to provide, which I think will be very compelling for the clients is around additional analytics, additional workflow tools and additional solutions that we're going to be able to offer clients because we're going to be in a place where we're going to be able to provide our clients a window into a lot of their trade processing and post-trade services across all those asset classes. 
So we think it's going to be pretty exciting. Just a couple of quick points on it. It is -- it's going to be a 50-50 joint venture so we will be using the equity method of accounting, and it will not be consolidated at CME Group. So it will be -- so you'll see a shift in the geography of our income statement, the revenue and expenses will be netted in the equity and unconsolidated subsidiary line of our income statement, similar to our indexing joint venture with S&P Global. And as I mentioned, we don't anticipate any material changes to our earnings. One other point, just from a financial perspective is between now and close, we'll be categorizing the optimization businesses as a held-for-sale asset in our 2021 financial statements. So this will mainly impact balance sheet presentation, and there will be minimal impact on our pro forma operating results.

If you look at the run-up of the activity over the last 6 weeks, you've seen crude recover. You've seen WTI and Brent actually move up and lock that. There are a number of fundamental drivers as to what's going on. The market is generally responding to the increased expectation for economic activity with the vaccines rolling out. You've got significant reduced stocks in Cushing. If you actually look at the drop in barrels, we've seen about a 14% reduction in the existing stock in Cushing.
This reduction is about 14%. When you look at the -- what's actually driving the uncertainty around U.S. energy policy and the Biden administration and the increased flow of exports in the U.S., they're actually seeing the energy curve in WTI right now in what's called backwardation, where the front end of the curve is more expensive than the back end of the curve. And why is that important? That's hugely important because that actually feeds into the narrative that we're seeing more broadly play out in both metals and particularly in ags, with an overall price rising cycle. What that means is you've got folks piling in on the increase and expectations for growth in pricing, what impact has that had in the business? We actually sell one of our biggest days in WTI, yesterday. We traded about $1.3 million contracts. If you look at our February ADV, it's about $1.1 million. That's up from $784,000 in Q4 of last year. The reason that's important is that, that's actually driven us back to open interest levels, that we haven't seen for over 2.5 years. We're about 2.45 million contracts open interest versus where Brent is at about -- right about 2.6 million.
So as you've heard us talk about, Mike, as increasing economic activity takes place, that's representing itself in the form of use of our crew benchmark globally. OI on the rise. Institutional investments flowing in and there's broader talk of the overall commodity cycle resuming. You've got soybeans at $13.5. You've got corn at $5, and you've got oil at highs in over 1.5 years now. So if the market is paying for economic recovery, you're seeing that reflecting both -- just below record levels of WTI, OI and record amounts of ag and metals product going through the franchise as well. So I think that's -- this is the place people are playing that global reflation trade, and that's where you're looking at roll yields in WTI at 8%. So institutional investors are looking for yield. This is the place to get it in this market right now."

So there's no question we're seeing a much better market environment in the last couple of months across the rates businesses, a very exciting development and one that we've expected. And we are especia",560,"Yes. Thanks very much, Terry. Greatly appreciate it. So there's no question we're seeing a much better market environment in the last couple of months across the rates businesses, a very exciting development and one that we've expected. And we are especially seeing that further out the curve. Some examples in terms of the market itself. If you look at the 2-year versus 30-year spread, that has widened out to 1.81% or 181 basis points. We haven't seen an environment like that since February of 2017. So the market is expecting very strong growth, and that's a very good indicator of strong growth on a go-forward basis. Also, just very briefly, in terms of the treasury inflation protected securities or TIPS. If you look at the 10-year TIPS, they're now implying an inflation rate, a consumer inflation rate over the next decade of 2.21%. That's the highest level we've seen in implied inflation since 2014, which is at the 5-year TIPS, it's even more impressive at 2.31% implied by the market for inflation over the next 5 years. We haven't seen anything like that since 2013. 
How is that impacting our markets? It's been a very big positive impact, especially on the long end. We've seen several new records this year in terms of open interest in terms of our ultra 10-year futures, in particular. We've also seen very good growth overall in the long end of the treasury curve. So if you look through January, the ultra 10-year ADV was up 44% year-over-year. The bond future is up 13%, the ultra bonds, up 7%. And if you look further out the curve, if you look at -- in particular, I guess, if you look at the back 32, the back 32 contracts in our Eurodollar futures. We've seen significant growth there in the fourth quarter, which was a very positive results. And further, I guess, I looked in detail at the greens and the blues. So what are the greens? The Greens are the 2023 Eurodollar futures and the blues are the 2024 Eurodollar futures. So 2023, Eurodollar futures are running at an ADV up of more than 100%, this year versus total year last year, and the blue Eurodollar features likewise, up more than 100% this year versus last year. 
The last thing I'll mention maybe on the market side that's directly impacting us. If you go back to the third quarter of last year, the first implied tightening by the marketplace was in December of 2024. If you look at today's marketplace, they're implying a tightening in the summer of 2023. So you see the much-improved market outlook, the impact on market pricing and significant impact on our volumes. Actually, I will mention, I apologize, one last thing, large open interest holders have also seen a very nice balance. Actually, since December 1, our rates -- large open interest holders has increased by 9% and has recovered half of the losses basically that we saw during the recent crisis, rolling 9% below the all-time highs in our rates -- large open interest holders. The first time we reached that peak where we are -- sorry, last time we reached for the first time, I should say, we reached the current levels of LOIH rates was 2018. So we're seeing a big recovery there as well. Sorry, Terry."

So one of the things that we've been doing over time is making adjustments in the -- in some of the incentive plans for micros. And also, as I just outlined, we made some fee adjustments so a couple of things to think about. Number one, the micros have been hugely successful. And I think when you look at the changes that we're making, I think from an overall company perspective, they're relatively modest. But when you look at the micros, I think there you'll see a more meaningful impact in terms of the revenue. And we don't think this is going to be impacting volume necessarily. We're providing a lot of value for the clients in a product that's highly liquid so we think -- so we think it will be, from a volume perspective, not as impactful.
When you look at the capture rate, generally speaking, it's roughly an 80-20 rule. 80% of the volume coming from members, I'm sorry, and then 20% coming from nonmembers. So when you think about the capture rate that's something to think about. So about 20% of the volume roughly will be impacted by the fee increase on the equity side. In metals, it's a little bit different. It's a little bit heavier on the nonmember side. It's a little bit higher than the 80-20 in terms of the nonmembers."

And I think that's important before we decide we're going to move forward with a smaller version of a crypto contract. 
So again, I think this contract is not that old. It's relatively new. The options were just listed on it, I believe, in the last several months. I'm a big believer, do you have to get a liquid options market along with your futures contracts, so you can continue to bring it to a broader audience?

Now the question might be that do we invite different types of regulation because of the retail client entering into the marketplace? I don't believe so only because we've got a growth of retail over the years regardless. And I think when people have access to marketplaces, it's not like the SEC, where the SEC's main mission is to protect the public from manipulation and fraud and other things. 
We have a global regulator that obviously is looking into those things as well. But I am very convinced that the retail participants will continue to grow, and it doesn't mean you have to have additional burdens from regulation against them or against the entity that wants to house them as long as your practices are in good housekeeping for lack of a better term from your margin requirements to the money that you have on deposit for -- at your FCM. So the whole host of things that the smaller clients need to make sure that they have to understand that they still need to have those requirements. I'll ask Julie to make some comments on the retail globally and other places as well. Julie, do you want to comment a little bit about that?

The other thing I'd just add is that this is a critical part of what our broker partners and intermediaries really do to ensure that the retail and active traders that are going to be trading futures are qualified to do so.

And so there has to be an intentional opening of that account. Those restrictions are different varying on countries. But what we see is that typically, right, there's a graduation of retail and active traders from trading the equity markets into trading equity options and then coming into the derivatives marketplace. 
And so that lends itself to be a more sophisticated retail trader. And that's part of what we work with our broker partners on the education front as well.

We're very excited actually about the developments and the success we've had recently in our FX futures marketplace. We have, over the last few years, been continuously reducing the minimum price increments. We've done it across 9 different instruments. Very excited actually. Late last year, we saw an all-time record open interest in our Euro versus USD futures, which is really main thing, given the fact that volatility has been -- has had a tremendous dampening effect on volumes. If you look at last year across each of the major currency pairs, the volatility ranking was typically the lowest decile going back the last 20 years. So in other words, 90% of the time over the last 20 years, volatility was higher in each of the major currency pairs. 
Nonetheless, even in that environment we saw a record number of record open interest in those Euro versus USD contracts. In addition to that, the changes we've been making in order to make our complex much more attractive. We've also seen recently good growth in block trading. So in the month of December, we saw our largest-ever U.S. dollar versus sterling options block trade, and that was the equivalent of $2 billion in a single trade. So market participants are migrating more of their options activity towards the listed space. That actually could accelerate through this year, why?

But we do expect there'll be 100 new participants, at least 100 new participants that are required this year globally to adhere to the uncleared margin rules back in September of this year. That should drive more products requiring greater efficiencies, and in particular, could positively impact our FX options. 
In the month of January after we saw the record block size in December in dollar versus sterling, we saw a record block size in Aussie dollars, that was AUD 4 billion. So we have seen our efforts, futures last year actually outperformed the spot marketplaces. And we're seeing now some uptick in the option space, particularly in block. In terms of what the team is doing in order to make the -- our platform much more attractive and to take the unique set of assets we have, right? So we now have the EBS as well as the futures data. So we are looking to use this unique set of assets in order to bring greater analytics, greater tools to the marketplace to cross-sell our products down, and particularly cross-sell the futures down the EBS distribution channel and to show participants the value of using both marketplaces. We have the analytics now that we've recently launched that show market participants that you really need to use both the futures as well as the spot liquidity pools in order to optimize your execution and reduce your execution cost. 
Some of the new tools that we've launched. So we launched the new FX Swap Rate Monitor. We did that now late summer of last year. More than 4,000 views, more than 3,000 users. This is using our FX Link product. It's the first time ever. There's a central limit order book, a standardized, clear lower total cost alternatives, FX swaps available to market participants. We're seeing some greater uptake there. We are making some enhancements to technology that will come out later this year that will make it much easier to consume for participants, and we do expect to see significant growth once that technology is released. In addition to that, we also released the new FX Vol Converter tool. This takes all of our listed FX options and it converts it to OTC equivalents so that all OTC participants can see our FX options on futures the same way they look at the OTC markets. 
We think that, that's a part of what drove that record block trade in December and the record block trade in January. Last thing I'll mention is our FX Market Profile tool. This for the first time, synchronizes the data between EBS spot foreign exchange and our foreign exchange futures. It shows the relative liquidity that did offer spread, the top of book, so the size available to hit or list, in each of the 2 markets simultaneously, and it quantitatively shows participants the benefits. The benefits of using both marketplaces. So we're very excited about these new tools. We are distributing them out to the very large tail of clients who use EBS, especially regional banks across Europe and Asia. And most exciting is, I mentioned earlier, the excitement I have over the migration of BrokerTec over Globex and how that's going to allow us to offer new products and services with that greater technology. 
Similarly, on the EBS side, we'll be migrating EBS over the Globex later this year, which will allow us to offer many new products and services across that platform, number one. Number two, it will also make it much simpler once we move it over for participants to trade on EBS. So we should be able to attract new participants. Last thing I'll mention is we've been investing in direct streaming technology. And we do expect to roll that out likewise later this year. We expect to have the State-of-the-Art direct streaming platform available for participants in foreign exchange later this year. Once we do that foreign exchange, we will actually also roll that out in U.S. treasuries."

So we're really excited about creating more and more of these efficiencies. It's been a pretty much one of the things that we've been focused on over the last several years is to bring client efficiencies, which we think will bring greater growth to our businesses. And this asset class is right for that. So we're looking forward to getting that agreement done with DTCC and the SEC. And then going forward with the growth that Sean has already pointed out in these rates businesses that would have a big part of. So thank you for your question, Simon."

And I think what you're seeing right now, and you're absolutely right, there is an absence of mandates globally right now there. The existing markets, again, emissions tend to be very, very regional in nature. And why we're excited about working with CBL exchange on this, which is our partner developing this contract, is that this represents a significant change in that. These carbon offset futures represent a contract that is an offset versus whatever it is, in fact, underlying product or EMIR might be involved in, not limited just to the energy markets. Imagine a farmer that wants to manage this carbon footprint. Imagine an aluminum company that wants to adhere to either voluntary standards or regional standards and emissions credit. So this is a product that very capably is able to extend outside of just the traditional space in energy and have an application across a full range of our commodities participants even noncommodities participants. 
The feedback that we've gotten both in the validation stage is going out to the market and assessing an interest in this. And actually, since we've announced has been bigger and actually more overwhelming than we had anticipated. So to remind everybody, this is a voluntary emission offset. It's based on standards that the market participants are agreeing to and the competitive space is one that is open right now. When you look at the position that we're in, in our commodities markets, we are the largest metals market. We are the largest energy market. We're the largest agricultural products market. So the application of these offset products extend well beyond just the energy space. So we think this is going to be a process of not just dealing with fossil fuels market in transition, you look at most company charters right now.
Everybody is trying to adhere to ESG standards that apply to what they feel the carbon footprint needs are. So this is broadly applicable to a lot of different market participants. The feedback we're getting validates that. We're excited to get this out. We've got a whole host of market makers and market takers lined up on this. So we're excited about what this could mean. And this is a slightly different product than what you're seeing in the existing product site that we have and others have that are really regionally focused. So we think this is early days in this. We think this is extensible out to the range of benchmark markets that we run and where we run the majority of liquidity in. And so we think this will be a great service to customers looking to extend their ESG credentials and manage their carbon footprint in really new and unique and market-oriented ways."

I don't -- there hasn't been any change in terms of our M&A strategy.

So that's our primary focus. I wouldn't say that we necessarily are looking specifically for a type of revenue whether it's transactional or subscription, I would say we're more focused on optimizing the revenue and based on the industry that asset is in. 
We are very focused on completing the next -- the next integration. As we mentioned previously, we're targeting $200 million in run rate synergies by the end of this year. We're well on track.

The implied that we have on RV are unmatched by any other technology in the marketplace. And so we are very excited about that as a unique value proposition.

So in addition to the $100 billion plus of cash treasuries that we trade on BrokerTec every day. Recall, we do $400 billion-ish a day in our treasury futures. So we got unique data sets with unique efficiencies that provide market participants and unique analytics in order to improve their execution.

And like if there's an offset that, that's clearly, like what is the regulatory hang up or process here, if there was -- if you own the cash and you have an offset from a future, why -- been a long process, but what's making it more difficult, I guess is the question."

We currently have cross-margining agreement and there are participants who are taking advantage of the offsets between cash and treasury futures. So it is an existing program. We started this in 2003, and we continue to provide that service. What we're doing right now is enhancing that. So we are actively working with DTCC. Now given that it is 2 clearinghouses, 2 separate clearinghouses and the fact that we are regulated by -- one is by the CFTC and the other is by the SEC, we just have to work through the process to get any enhancements improved. So that does take time. But we are very confident that we'll get through that process. It's just that it's very hard for us to give you a time frame when it comes to regulatory approvals, so that's what we're saying. So operationally, we continue to work actively in improving the margin efficiencies between our 2 clearing firms. I hope that helps."

And I think what you heard from Sean earlier, and I'm sure he'll -- references himself, but I didn't want to be remiss if I didn't say it again. When we're looking at the growth of the back 32 of the Eurodollar contract like we're seeing today, we're looking at the growth of the SOFR futures contract, like we're seeing today of roughly 94%, 96% of the open interest being held here at CME. We are the beneficiaries of both products growing. And that is something we said is a strong possibility, and we're starting to see that mature in our favor, and we're very encouraged by that. 
So Sean can talk about the timing or the transition from LIBOR to SOFR and I guess, Sean, it could be a bit speculative, but there are some hard dates that people are talking about and fallbacks associated with it. But I would be remiss if I didn't remind folks that it is important that we have a really strong rate franchise with efficiencies that are almost unmatched anywhere in the world, and we are very excited that we can participate both in SOFR and in Eurodollars.

So thanks so much, Terry, for that, and thanks for the question. There are several points in there. So again, if you at the back 32 between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter 2020, ADV grew. So it's in the Eurodollar futures, they grew",572,"Yes. So thanks so much, Terry, for that, and thanks for the question. There are several points in there. So again, if you at the back 32 between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter 2020, ADV grew. So it's in the Eurodollar futures, they grew by 36%. So a very positive result. As I said earlier, we've seen very good growth in January in the greens and the blues of the 2023 and 2024 contracts. So for that curve, Eurodollar futures growing very strongly. At the same time, we've recently seen a number of records in our SOFR futures. 2020 was a record year for volume, SOFR futures of 51,000 contracts. And so far this year, we're doing more than 100,000 contracts a day. In January, we also saw an open interest record of 727,000 SOFR futures contracts. 
We also saw a record number of large open interest holders in our SOFR futures of 175 large open interest holders. And we have more than 500 participants trading in the SOFR futures. Last thing I'll mention maybe in terms of SOFR is that if you look at the global SOFR marketplace in terms of futures, we have about 80% of the average daily volume so far this year, and we are running 92%, 93% of the global open interest. So we see recently, good growth in the back end of the Eurodollar futures, also extremely good growth in our SOFR features. They absolutely had somewhat different takes on the interest rate market and both very useful from a participant standpoint. We have seen from IBA and the FCA. They recently did launch a survey, I guess, of where they are potentially looking at whether or not LIBOR should continue to be published post-June of 2023. So that's a long time away. There's a lot of uncertainty. 
In the meantime, our SOFR futures are growing strongly. The back end of the Eurodollar futures are growing strongly. And I think we're exactly where we wanted to be. As Terry mentioned, in terms of efficiencies, with the huge open interest in the Eurodollar futures, the bulk of the open interest in SOFR futures. Obviously, from an execution clearing standpoint, both, right? The big commodity spreads on the execution side as well as then margin offsets between the 2 futures contracts, no one else can compete with those sets of efficiencies. In addition to that, we've got SOFR interest rate swaps as well as obviously all of our LIBOR-based interest rate swaps. And the potential for portfolio margining offsets then between all of those futures and all those swaps left. In terms of the portfolio margin, I think I talked about this on the last earnings call, but we did offer starting December of last year. Portfolio margining between Eurodollar options and interest rate swaps. 
We've got more than a handful of participants taking advantage of that and already getting well over $100 million a day worth of margin efficiency. So we continue to enhance the efficiencies. Last thing -- I will mention one last thing. Don't forget, we have the single largest U.S. treasury repo platform on the planet. That is where SOFR is created every day to a large extent. So we also are providing that -- the actual transactions that go to making up SOFR every day in addition to our SOFR futures and SOFR swaps, and I will end there."

2020 was a challenge with low volatility in several asset classes, including the front end of the rate curve and in our WTI contract for much of the year. We did see some very encouraging signs with some of our higher-rate-per-contract products. Also, during 2020, metals had its fifth consecutive year of record annual volume and is off to a strong start in 2021. We saw very strong activity in our agricultural commodities in the fourth quarter, and they continued to rise in the first month of this year, up 36% versus last year. 
Soybean Futures had its second-highest quarterly ADV, including record volume out of both Europe and Asia. After the extreme volatility of the first quarter of 2020 as the pandemic began, the volume -- the total volume came in at 15.6 million contracts per day in the third quarter and jumped to 16.2 million contracts per day in Q4. During this entire time, we have remained heavily engaged with our global customers. During 2020, our volume from clients outside the United States grew by 7%, reflecting the global relevance of our markets. I am encouraged by the January 2021 volume, which came in at more than 19 million contracts per day. We are very pleased with the progress we've made integrating the NEX business during 2020, including back-office migrations, to support finance and HR systems and the building of an integrated global sales team. 
Last week, we announced that BrokerTec has migrated to U.S. Treasury benchmark trading in EU government bond and repo markets onto Globex. With BrokerTec's dealer-to-dealer platform now a fully integrated part of CME Globex, clients have an enhanced suite of government bond trading offerings across listed derivatives, cash and repo markets on a common platform, allowing greater operational and technological efficiencies when managing a risk across cash and futures. We remain excited about the mitigation -- or I should say, migration, excuse me, of EBS onto Globex by year-end and the ability to provide further efficiencies to our global customers in the FX market. During 2020 and the first quarter of this year, we have continued to innovate with several new products and will begin trading global emission offset contracts referred to as GEO futures on March 1. And we just launched our new Ether futures earlier this week. We continue to work closely with our global customer base on solutions to help them manage their risks.
 
These new products build on globally relevant products we have delivered recently, including SOFR futures, E-mini S&P ESG futures, the South American Soybean contract, Cobalt futures, Options on our popular Bitcoin futures and the popular micro products across several of our asset classes. With that, let me turn it over to John, who will discuss the financial results. John?"

Throughout 2020, we navigated the difficult operating environment, executed on the integration with NEX, launched new and innovative products and actively managed our expenses. For the year, we delivered $4.9 billion in revenue, up slightly from the prior year, and with a strong focus on expenses, we achieved $6.72 in adjusted diluted EPS. During the year, we announced our annual variable dividend of $2.50 per share, and we recently announced a regular dividend of $0.90 per share for the first quarter of 2021, a 6% increase compared to the first quarter last year. In terms of fourth quarter revenue, our average rate per contract across the product areas were fairly stable with our micro contracts continuing to perform well across several asset classes. Market data revenue was very strong, with an all-time quarterly high of $140 million and was up over 7% compared to Q4 last year.
We were intensely focused on expense management throughout the year. At the beginning of 2020, we provided guidance for adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees of between $1.64 billion and $1.65 billion. For the year, we came in approximately $90 million below the midpoint of that range and $80 million below 2019 levels at $1.557 billion. In terms of synergies, we had initially targeted $110 million in run rate synergies by the end of 2020 related to the next acquisition. By year-end, we had exceeded that target and achieved a total of $140 million in synergies. This is net of the additional costs that we are carrying to run parallel infrastructures as we continue to work on the migrations to Globex. We remain committed to our target of $200 million of annual run rate synergies by the end of 2021. 
Turning to guidance. For 2021, we currently expect full year adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, to increase slightly from the already low 2020 levels to $1.575 billion. For capital expenditures, excluding onetime integration costs and net of leasehold improvement allowances, we expect to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million. In addition, we expect our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate to be between 23.2% and 24.2%. Finally, we are very excited about the recently announced joint venture with IHS Markit and the opportunities that it will provide our clients and our shareholders. The JV will be a leader in trade processing and risk mitigation services that offers the combined clients complementary services across the global OTC marketplace in interest rate, FX, equity and credit asset classes. We don't anticipate any material change to earnings as a result of the JV. We will provide more information when the transaction closes. 
With that short summary, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Based on the number of analysts covering us, please limit yourself to one question, and then feel free to jump back into the queue. Thank you."

So if you look at it on a year-by-year basis, we overachieved by -- in terms of run rate synergies, by $14 million last year in 2000 -- by the end of 2019, and again, overachieved by approximately the same amount this year. We overachieved by about $16 million this year, in terms of run rate synergies. 
In terms of P&L, we anticipate our synergies being realized in our income statement in 2021 of $35 million. And so that is what we expect to have in our P&L. This is being offset by additional costs that we anticipate having in terms of increased depreciation related to our migrations onto Globex, so the way that works is that we do some programming that goes into work in process and that goes from work in process into production and when it goes into production then that's amortized over several years. We also are building out our data center and disaster recovery center on the East Coast. That's partially being offset by the synergy capture. And lastly, in terms of our impacts, we do anticipate having some improved environment in terms of operating environment towards the back half of this year, and we anticipate having about $20 million in additional costs that we didn't have this year that we are building into the back half of 2021 related primarily to travel, marketing and events. So that's the story for 2021."

Two, we are going to reduce the minimum price increments in the spreads relative to the outrights.

And in terms of pricing, I guess, I'm most focused on making sure that the platform is more valuable to our clients, and that we get more volume over our platform, and that's really our focus. And Terry, I don't know if you want to jump in?"

Yes, we did have a record year as data services. Our revenue being up 5% year-on-year. Yes, I think that work from home environment kind of further highlighted that need for real-time data access really across our global client base, as well as the need for historical data, right, as we evaluated really the impacts of the volatile market conditions that we saw in Q2. We also made some investments in our business last year. And so bringing that data business closer to our commercial capabilities, we established a data sales team, and we also supported a number of new products and services. And so that's where we really feel kind of that continued investment is certainly helping to grow the data business and positioning us well as we head into 2021. Those solid trends, we continue to see in the professional subscriber device count was strong throughout the quarter. And in Q4, revenue was up 7% compared to where we were in Q4 2019. And so I think it's a strong -- definitely global demand as well as things on the drive data front that are really kind of propelling the business. 
And this is just that longer-term trend that we've talked about on other calls of customers' use of technology and their trading strategies is increasing the need for our data through a number of these nondisplay use cases. So we did have some minor fee adjustments that are being made in 2021. To really reflect how our customers are utilizing our data now and also just the value of the data that we offer and the services that we have and how our market data customers are really receiving and expecting to receive that data. So there was a $5 increase to our real-time data from $105 to $110 per DCM per month. That goes into effect in April. And then we also had some pricing changes on the nondisplay and historical redistribution side. And those will kind of trickle in throughout the year since there's certainly some licensing and implementation that will need to be done between ourselves and our customers. But we feel well that we're in a good position as we onboard those customers and that we're really going to be in a good position to continue to grow the business going forward."

And a lot of questions in there, so I will start and then hand things back to Terry. So I really think -- and you mentioned it, a couple of our broker partners in your question, and it's really because of that strong broker distribution network, the vast educational programs and really the content that we support, the diverse product mix that we were in a really good position to be able to take advantage of the increase in overall retail trading in 2020. We saw record levels of participation in revenue globally. And the number of retail traders that were active at CME Group last year increased over 50%. And so the biggest gains were definitely on the equity index product side, where the volatility there really led to a lot of increased trading opportunities. And we also saw great year-on-year gains in metals that were up over 20%, FX as well as ag. And that really speaks to, again, the diverse product mix and the fact that people are looking for different opportunities. 
We have been investing quite a bit in our sales and marketing staff overseas, both in APAC and EMEA. And those are playing also a large role as we've grown the business globally on the retail side. So we saw both APAC and EMEA retail business was up double digits. Countries of strong growth continue to be: Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, and then Germany, and Switzerland and Europe. So I think that -- the work-from-home environment has allowed, I think, the potential, right, for even more retail customers become active. And our digital outreach, I think, was also just a real positive trend last year because we're able to just reach more retail and active traders than ever before and so the efforts through our education helped us reach over 2.5 million new active individual traders throughout the broker partner digital events that we have that were focused specifically on CME Group products. 
 The largest growth in Asia, we had events that -- the number of events increased over 65% over 2019, so well over 400 events, and by going digital, we reach 15x more active traders than we have in the past when more of those events were in person, and also we're seeing somewhat strong trends in North America where the firms there were growing their webinar output by 225%. So we feel that this continued investment is leading us to have well-educated retail traders, and that really kind of helps position us for continued success. And with that, I'll maybe turn it over to Terry."

You answered a lot of the questions, but let me just add a little bit, and I'm going to ask John to comment a little bit on the cost of some of these products, too. 
It's really hard for us to predict, Brian, what we think 2021 future volumes are for any particular constituent or market participant going forward. But it doesn't take the last several weeks for us to think about the growth of retail trading. So I don't -- that's not the reason why we talk about retail trading. As you know, we've been building on this business for a number of years. But it's become more and more clear that, in my opinion, that retail traders want to have a -- participate in all different forms of markets. We are looking at all different ways to allow them to come into our markets. 
As Julie referenced, education is key though. We talked a little bit about the micros and the growth of them. We are looking at other ways to continually work with our partners to bring in more and more retail participants. It's just one of those things that's not going away. I don't believe it's going away. And I don't say that because of what happened with the run-up in some of the recent equities or even in what they perceive as running up in the silver. You can talk about fundamental stories that are in silver versus not fundamental stories of some of the other products that had runs on them. But there's no question about it that the proliferation of social media, the proliferation of access to marketplaces is allowing people to participate more and more, and they want to do that. And I think it's extremely encouraging for more and more young people to have interest in financial services and financial markets. So we want to take advantage of that with them and bring them along in a very thoughtful, smart way, as Julie outlined. 
So it's not only micro products that we have working on retails, we're looking at new and innovative ways to continue to move forward with this growing constituency of clients. So very excited by the growth of that but at the same time, I don't want you to think that we're just -- putting all of our -- everything into one basket, such as retail because we're not -- I mean, the institutional clients of this company are critically important. The commercials are critically important. So all the different parts that go into making a trade work are very important as we continue to move forward and grow this business. But -- and we do not want to deny the access to the retail participant in a good, thoughtful, smart way. And I would like to talk a little bit about a couple of some of the fee changes associated with some of these micro products. And maybe I can ask John to do that."

This year, we're taking a very targeted approach to pricing, and we're really -- we're focused on changes to the nonmember fees in our micro products with increases in micro equities of $0.05 per side, micro gold of $0.20 per side and micro silver of $0.40 per side, and those are for nonmember fees. So I think we're continuing to add value in that product, whether it's increasing liquidity, working with our intermediary partners through education and also launching new products with the options on our equity products for the micros.

We're extremely excited about the joint venture with IHS Markit for the customers and our shareholders. It will be a leader in the trade processing and post-trade services and will benefit customers by providing more efficient access to services, and we think it will be a great platform to launch new solutions across a broad set of asset classes, including interest rates, FX, equity and credit. This will allow us to innovate and bring to market analytics, workflow tools and solutions that allow clients to manage their risk and process more efficiently. So when you look at the client base, there is a substantial overlap in terms of the large global banks, utilizing the services both of market serve and our optimization businesses, but they're all across complementary asset classes. So the strengths of markets serve are very complementary to the strengths of our optimization businesses. 
So what does that mean for clients? That means a much more efficient way for them to access those services because a lot of the information going to those platforms are very similar and by providing one kind of point-of-access for that information, will provide a lot of efficiencies for the clients and also reduce the amount of errors that could potentially occur as processes could potentially break down as you're accessing multiple platforms across multiple businesses. So very, very excited about that. So like I said, the added value, I think, that we're going to be able to provide, which I think will be very compelling for the clients is around additional analytics, additional workflow tools and additional solutions that we're going to be able to offer clients because we're going to be in a place where we're going to be able to provide our clients a window into a lot of their trade processing and post-trade services across all those asset classes. 
So we think it's going to be pretty exciting. Just a couple of quick points on it. It is -- it's going to be a 50-50 joint venture so we will be using the equity method of accounting, and it will not be consolidated at CME Group. So it will be -- so you'll see a shift in the geography of our income statement, the revenue and expenses will be netted in the equity and unconsolidated subsidiary line of our income statement, similar to our indexing joint venture with S&P Global. And as I mentioned, we don't anticipate any material changes to our earnings. 
One other point, just from a financial perspective is between now and close, we'll be categorizing the optimization businesses as a held-for-sale asset in our 2021 financial statements. So this will mainly impact balance sheet presentation, and there will be minimal impact on our pro forma operating results. So some change in geography, but most importantly, a very positive change for the business. And I think a real positive for our clients."

If you look at the run-up of the activity over the last 6 weeks, you've seen crude recover. You've seen WTI and Brent actually move up and lock that. There are a number of fundamental drivers as to what's going on. The market is generally responding to the increased expectation for economic activity with the vaccines rolling out. You've got significant reduced stocks in Cushing. If you actually look at the drop in barrels, we've seen about a 14% reduction in the existing stock in Cushing.
This reduction is about 14%. When you look at the -- what's actually driving the uncertainty around U.S. energy policy and the Biden administration and the increased flow of exports from the U.S., they're actually seeing the energy curve in WTI right now in what's called backwardation, where the front end of the curve is more expensive than the back end of the curve. And why is that important? That's hugely important because that actually feeds into the narrative that we're seeing more broadly play out in both metals and particularly in ags, with an overall price rising cycle. What that means is you've got folks piling in on the increase and expectations for growth in pricing, what impact has that had in the business? We actually saw one of our biggest days in WTI yesterday. We traded about $1.3 million contracts. If you look at our February ADV, it's about $1.1 million. That's up from $784,000 in Q4 of last year. The reason that's important is that, that's actually driven us back to open interest levels, that we haven't seen for over 2.5 years. We're about 2.45 million contracts open interest versus where Brent is at about -- right about 2.6 million.
So as you've heard us talk about, Mike, as increasing economic activity takes place, that's representing itself in the form of use of our crew benchmark globally. OI on the rise. Institutional investments flowing in and there's broader talk of the overall commodity cycle resuming. You've got soybeans at $13.5. You've got corn at $5, and you've got oil at highs in over 1.5 years now. So if the market is paying for economic recovery, you're seeing that reflect in both -- just below record levels of WTI, OI and record amounts of ag and metals product going through the franchise as well. So I think that's -- this is the place people are playing that global reflation trade, and that's where you're looking at roll yields in WTI at 8%. So institutional investors are looking for yield. This is the place to get it in this market right now."

So there's no question we're seeing a much better market environment in the last couple of months across the rates businesses, a very exciting development and one that we've expected. And we are especially seeing that further out the curve. Some examples in terms of the market itself. If you look at the 2-year versus 30-year spread, that has widened out to 1.81% or 181 basis points. We haven't seen an environment like that since February of 2017. So the market is expecting very strong growth, and that's a very good indicator of strong growth on a go-forward basis. 
Also, just very briefly, in terms of the treasury inflation protected securities or TIPS. If you look at the 10-year TIPS, they're now implying an inflation rate, a consumer inflation rate over the next decade of 2.21%. That's the highest level we've seen in implied inflation since 2014.  If you look at the 5-year TIPS, it's even more impressive at 2.31% implied by the market for inflation over the next 5 years. We haven't seen anything like that since 2013. 
How is that impacting our markets? It's been a very big positive impact, especially on the long end. We've seen several new records this year in terms of open interest in terms of our Ultra 10-year futures, in particular. We've also seen very good growth overall in the long end of the treasury curve. So if you look through January, the Ultra 10-year ADV was up 44% year-over-year. The bond future is up 13%, the Ultra bonds up 7%. And if you look further out the curve, if you look at -- in particular, I guess, if you look at the back 32, the back 32 contracts in our Eurodollar futures. We've seen significant growth there in the fourth quarter, which was a very positive results. And further, I guess, I looked in detail at the greens and the blues. So what are the greens? The greens are the 2023 Eurodollar futures and the blues are the 2024 Eurodollar futures. So 2023, Eurodollar futures are running at an ADV up of more than 100% this year versus total year last year, and the blue Eurodollar features likewise up more than 100% this year versus last year. 
The last thing I'll mention maybe on the market side that's directly impacting us. If you go back to the third quarter of last year, the first implied tightening by the marketplace was in December of 2024. If you look at today's marketplace, they're implying a tightening in the summer of 2023. So you see the much-improved market outlook, the impact on market pricing and significant impact on our volumes. Actually, I will mention, I apologize, one last thing, large open interest holders have also seen a very nice balance. Actually, since December 1, our rates -- large open interest holders has increased by 9% and has recovered half of the losses basically that we saw during the recent crisis, rolling 9% below the all-time highs in our rates -- large open interest holders. The first time we reached that peak where we are -- sorry, last time -- we reached for the first time, I should say, we reached the current levels of LOIH rates was 2018. So we're seeing a big recovery there as well. Sorry, Terry."

So one of the things that we've been doing over time is making adjustments in the -- in some of the incentive plans for micros. And also, as I just outlined, we made some fee adjustments so a couple of things to think about. Number one, the micros have been hugely successful. And I think when you look at the changes that we're making, I think from an overall company perspective, they're relatively modest. But when you look at the micros, I think, though, you'll see a more meaningful impact in terms of the revenue. And we don't think this is going to be impacting volume necessarily. We're providing a lot of value for the clients in a product that's highly liquid so we think -- so we think it will be, from a volume perspective, not as impactful.
When you look at the capture rate, generally speaking, it's roughly an 80-20 rule. 80% of the volume coming from members, I'm sorry, and then 20% coming from nonmembers. So when you think about the capture rate that's something to think about. So about 20% of the volume roughly will be impacted by the fee increase on the equity side. In metals, it's a little bit different. It's a little bit heavier on the nonmember side. It's a little bit higher than the 80-20 in terms of the nonmembers."

We need to make sure that we're comfortable going forward. We've always said we're going to walk before we run when it comes to cryptos. I think, with the launch of our new Ether contract and people having the ability to trade one against another, we want to see how that starts to pan out for the pair trading or spread trading or other terms. And I think that's important before we decide we're going to move forward with a smaller version of a crypto contract. 
So again, I think this contract is not that old. It's relatively new. The options were just listed on it, I believe, in the last several months. I'm a big believer, do you have to get a liquid options market along with your futures contracts, so you can continue to bring it to a broader audience? And that broader audience might be with the people that we referenced in the earlier part of this call, which is more on the retail side. And they will obviously not -- it's hard for them to participate in such a high-value contract. So smaller versions are something.

You get that with all different participants. And that is one thing that I've said forever, which is a benefit to this organization, that we are a highly regulated entity, and I believe regulation lends the credibility of any business and allows us to grow globally, and that's exactly what we've been able to do because of good smart regulation. Now the question might be that do we invite different types of regulation because of the retail client entering into the marketplace? I don't believe so only because we've got a growth of retail over the years regardless. And I think when people have access to marketplaces, it's not like the SEC, where the SEC's main mission is to protect the public from manipulation and fraud and other things. 
We have a global regulator that obviously is looking into those things as well. But I am very convinced that the retail participants will continue to grow, and it doesn't mean you have to have additional burdens from regulation against them or against the entity that wants to house them as long as your practices are in good housekeeping for lack of a better term from your margin requirements to the money that you have on deposit for -- at your FCM. So the whole host of things that the smaller clients need to make sure that they have to understand that they still need to have those requirements. I'll ask Julie to make some comments on the retail globally and other places as well. Julie, do you want to comment a little bit about that? But I think on the regulation side, Chris, I don't believe, because the growth of these particular group of people that would invite new regulation.

I think he makes a very good point about the differences in the market structure, right, between equity markets and futures. The other thing I'd just add is that this is a critical part of what our broker partners and intermediaries really do to ensure that the retail and active traders that are going to be trading futures are qualified to do so. And so we work with our partners throughout the globe to ensure that. So just because you're able to trade in the equity market that's not the same as having a futures account. And so there has to be an intentional opening of that account. Those restrictions are different varying on countries. But what we see is that typically, right, there's a graduation of retail and active traders from trading the equity markets into trading equity options and then coming into the derivatives marketplace. 
And so that lends itself to be a more sophisticated retail trader. And that's part of what we work with our broker partners on, on the education front as well. So they are well versed in what they're getting into and opening up accounts because they're ready to trade in our markets because we want to make sure they are well supported and that we have a good customer experience for them and a diverse set of products for them to access."

We're very excited actually about the developments and the success we've had recently in our FX futures marketplace. We have, over the last few years, been continuously reducing the minimum price increments. We've done it across 9 different instruments. Very excited actually. Late last year, we saw an all-time record open interest in our Euro versus USD futures, which is really main thing, given the fact that volatility has been -- has had a tremendous dampening effect on volumes. If you look at last year across each of the major currency pairs, the volatility ranking was typically the lowest decile going back the last 20 years. So in other words, 90% of the time over the last 20 years, volatility was higher in each of the major currency pairs. 
Nonetheless, even in that environment we saw a record number of record open interest in those Euro versus USD contracts. In addition to that, the changes we've been making in order to make our complex much more attractive, we've also seen recently good growth in block trading. So in the month of December, we saw our largest-ever U.S. dollar versus sterling options block trade, and that was the equivalent of $2 billion in a single trade. So market participants are migrating more of their options activity towards the listed space. That actually could accelerate through this year. Why? Something we haven't spoken about in a while because it was delayed last year relative to COVID. But we do expect there'll be 100 new participants, at least 100 new participants that are required this year globally to adhere to the uncleared margin rules back in September of this year. That should drive more products requiring greater efficiencies, and in particular, could positively impact our FX options. 
In the month of January after we saw the record block size in December in dollar versus sterling, we saw a record block size in Aussie dollars, that was AUD 4 billion. So we have seen our FX futures last year actually outperformed the spot marketplaces. And we're seeing now some uptick in the option space, particularly in blocks. 
In terms of what the team is doing in order to make the -- our platform much more attractive and to take the unique set of assets we have, right? So we now have the EBS as well as the futures data. So we are looking to use this unique set of assets in order to bring greater analytics, greater tools to the marketplace to cross-sell our products down, and particularly cross-sell the futures down the EBS distribution channel and to show participants the value of using both marketplaces. We have the analytics now that we've recently launched that show market participants that you really need to use both the futures as well as the spot liquidity pools in order to optimize your execution and reduce your execution cost. 
Some of the new tools that we've launched. So we launched the new FX Swap Rate Monitor. We did that now late summer of last year. More than 4,000 views, more than 3,000 users. This is using our FX Link product. It's the first time ever. There's a central limit order book, a standardized, clear lower total cost alternatives, FX swaps available to market participants. We're seeing some greater uptake there. We are making some enhancements to technology that will come out later this year that will make it much easier to consume for participants, and we do expect to see significant growth once that technology is released. In addition to that, we also released the new FX Vol Converter tool. This takes all of our listed FX options and it converts it to OTC equivalents so that all OTC participants can see our FX options on futures the same way they look at the OTC markets.  We think that, that's a part of what drove that record block trade in December and the record block trade in January. 
Last thing I'll mention is our FX Market Profile tool. This for the first time, synchronizes the data between EBS spot foreign exchange and our foreign exchange futures. It shows the relative liquidity that did offer spread, the top of book, so the size available to hit or list, in each of the 2 markets simultaneously, and it quantitatively shows participants the benefits, the benefits of using both marketplaces. So we're very excited about these new tools. We are distributing them out to the very large tail of clients who use EBS, especially regional banks across Europe and Asia. And most exciting is, I mentioned earlier, the excitement I have over the migration of BrokerTec over Globex and how that's going to allow us to offer new products and services with that greater technology. 
Similarly, on the EBS side, we'll be migrating EBS over to Globex later this year, which will allow us to offer many new products and services across that platform, number one. Number two, it will also make it much simpler once we move it over for participants to trade on EBS. So we should be able to attract new participants. 
Last thing I'll mention is we've been investing in direct streaming technology. And we do expect to roll that out likewise later this year. We expect to have the State-of-the-Art direct streaming platform available for participants in foreign exchange later this year. Once we do that foreign exchange, we will actually also roll that out in U.S. treasuries."

Imagine a farmer that wants to manage his carbon footprint. Imagine an aluminum company that wants to adhere to either voluntary standards or regional standards and emissions credit.

 The feedback that we've gotten both in the validation stage that's going out to the market and assessing an interest in this, and actually since we've announced, has been bigger and actually more overwhelming than we had anticipated. So to remind everybody, this is a voluntary emission offset. It's based on standards that the market participants are agreeing to and the competitive space is one that is open right now. When you look at the position that we're in, in our commodities markets, we are the largest metals market. We are the largest energy market. We're the largest agricultural products market. So the application of these offset products extend well beyond just the energy space. So we think this is going to be a process of not just dealing with fossil fuels market in transition; you look at most company charters right now, everybody is trying to adhere to ESG standards that apply to what they feel their carbon footprint needs are. So this is broadly applicable to a lot of different market participants. The feedback we're getting validates that. We're excited to get this out. We've got a whole host of market makers and market takers lined up on this. So we're excited about what this could mean. And this is a slightly different product than what you're seeing in the existing product site that we have and others have that are really regionally focused. So we think this is early days in this. We think this is extensible out to the range of benchmark markets that we run and where we run the majority of liquidity in. And so we think this will be a great service to customers looking to extend their ESG credentials and manage their carbon footprint in really new and unique and market-oriented ways."

I don't -- there hasn't been any change in terms of our M&A strategy. We are always looking for opportunities to create shareholder value and as you've heard across the board here, create efficiencies and opportunities for our clients. So the recently announced joint venture with IHS Markit is a great example of that. Where we're taking our assets, combining with assets of a partner of ours and creating value for our clients and ultimately, our shareholders by providing more efficiencies for those clients and then using that as a platform to provide other services around that. So that's our primary focus. I wouldn't say that we necessarily are looking specifically for a type of revenue whether it's transactional or subscription. I would say we're more focused on optimizing the revenue and -- based on the industry that asset is in. 
We are very focused on completing the next -- the next integration. As we mentioned previously, we're targeting $200 million in run rate synergies by the end of this year. We're well on track. We've exceeded our synergies each of the last 2 years. And we're well on track to achieve that $200 million for 2021. So that's our point of view.

So no question we embrace competition, and we're continuously looking to make our platform and our services far more attractive to participants.

That improved technology will allow us to create much more attractive products and services like RV technology. The implied that we have on RV are unmatched by any other technology in the marketplace. And so we are very excited about that as a unique value proposition. In addition to that, we've got a unique data set that nobody else in the world has, which is that the ability to synchronize our treasury futures data along with our cash treasury data. So in addition to the $100 billion plus of cash treasuries that we trade on BrokerTec every day, recall, we do $400 billion-ish a day in our treasury futures. So we got unique data sets with unique efficiencies that provide market participants and unique analytics in order to improve their execution. 
In addition to that, we are investing in, as I mentioned earlier, BrokerTec stream, so direct streaming of U.S. treasuries and on the benefit of having both the streamed platform as well as central limit order book. So we have the strongest dealer-to-dealer central limit order book in the world. We are building our direct streaming business, dealer to dealer. And we're combining that with the unique data that we have in futures to provide a unique set of analytics and efficiencies that nobody else can offer. So we embrace competition.

We are the beneficiaries of both products growing. And that is something we said is a strong possibility, and we're starting to see that mature in our favor, and we're very encouraged by that.

Last thing I'll mention maybe in terms of SOFR is that if you look at the global SOFR marketplace in terms of futures, we have about 80% of the average daily volume so far this year, and we are running 92%, 93% of the global open interest. So we see recently, good growth in the back end of the Eurodollar futures, also extremely good growth in our SOFR features. They absolutely had somewhat different takes on the interest rate market and both very useful from a participant standpoint. We have seen from IBA and the FCA, they recently did launch a survey, I guess, of where they are potentially looking at whether or not LIBOR should continue to be published post-June of 2023. So that's a long time away. There's a lot of uncertainty. 
In the meantime, our SOFR futures are growing strongly. The back end of the Eurodollar futures are growing strongly. And I think we're exactly where we wanted to be. As Terry mentioned, in terms of efficiencies, with the huge open interest in the Eurodollar futures, the bulk of the open interest in SOFR futures. Obviously, from an execution clearing standpoint, both, right? The big commodity spreads on the execution side as well as then margin offsets between the 2 futures contracts, no one else can compete with those sets of efficiencies. In addition to that, we've got SOFR interest rate swaps as well as obviously all of our LIBOR-based interest rate swaps. And the potential for portfolio margining offsets then between all of those futures and all those swaps left. In terms of the portfolio margin, I think I talked about this on the last earnings call, but we did offer starting December of last year portfolio margining between Eurodollar options and interest rate swaps. 
We've got more than a handful of participants taking advantage of that and already getting well over $100 million a day worth of margin efficiency. So we continue to enhance the efficiencies. 
Last thing -- I will mention one last thing. Don't forget, we have the single largest U.S. treasury repo platform on the planet. That is where SOFR is created every day to a large extent. So we also are providing that -- the actual transactions that go to making up SOFR every day in addition to our SOFR futures and SOFR swaps, and I will end there."

As we all continue to navigate through the pandemic, I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. We released our executive summary this morning, which provided extensive details on the first quarter of '21. As John said, I have John, Sean, Derek, Sunil and Julie Winkler with me this morning, and we look forward to addressing any questions you have. 
We saw solid volume rebound during the first quarter of this year as we averaged 22 million contracts per day. That represented our third most active quarter ever following the record activity we saw in Q1 of 2020 at the start of the pandemic when we averaged 27 million contracts per day. 
Importantly, we had a nice rebound from the back half of the year in 2020. We had a 35% sequential increase in average daily volume from Q4 '20 to Q1 '21. Also, interest rates were up 65% to more than 10 million contracts per day in Q1 relative to Q4. In addition, equities, energy and metals were all higher sequentially by approximately 20%. 
In terms of products, we had record quarters in Bitcoin futures and silver futures. Micro E-mini NASDAQ and Russell were each up more than 100%. Agricultural markets remained active, particularly in options with more than 60% growth in both corn and soybean options ADV versus Q1 of '20. 
Also, we continue to see strong non-U.S. customer volumes originating in Europe and Asia with approximately 6 million per day during Q1 2021 versus 4.7 million per day for all of 2020. We are also pleased with the transition of BrokerTec onto the Globex platform for the treasury curve trades, and we did see recent all-time record in European repo activity. 
Last quarter, I mentioned the ongoing innovation across our markets. In Q1, that continued with Japanese energy futures, global emission offset futures, Ether futures, micro Bitcoin futures, lithium futures, Mexican interest rate futures and most recently, CME term sulfur. Also, we announced the JV with IHS Markit, which we are excited about. The main point is that we are constantly finding ways to assist our clients with the world's most diverse product offering across all the critical global asset classes. 
With that, let me turn the call over to John, who will discuss the financial results. And I look forward to answering your questions."

During the first quarter, CME generated more than $1.250 billion in revenue, reflecting average daily volume of 21.8 million contracts. Expenses were very carefully managed, and on an adjusted basis, were $437 million for the quarter and $372 million, excluding license fees. CME had an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6%, which resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.79. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $27 million. During the first quarter, CME paid out more than $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the form of our annual variable dividend of $2.50 per share and our most recent regular dividend of $0.90 per share. CME's cash at the end of the first quarter was more than $1 billion. 
Our 2021 guidance remains unchanged. We expect total adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, to come in at $1.575 billion. We anticipate the spending to be weighted heavier in the second half of the year as the global economy potentially opens. We continue to expect CapEx to come in between $180 million and $190 million. 
Finally, our tax rate guidance remains between 23.2% and 24.2%. Please refer to the last page of our executive commentary for additional financial highlights and details.

Great question. So, so far, things have gone very well. If you look at our relative share of the market, which is available through certain market sources, it's been -- on the BrokerTec U.S. treasuries, it's been flat between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So we're very pleased with that result, given the challenges as you mentioned, participants adopting to the new platform. 
In addition to that, we're very excited about the new functionality that we have launched. It likewise is taking time for participants to take advantage of the new functionality. We did launch now about a month ago our new RV trading functionality, which I have described before. 
We have a handful of market makers. We have about 17 customers who are submitting orders, orders and getting executed. And we've executed more than 2 billion worth of volume. We're doing about 120 million a day. 
We are very excited, though. Why? Because it is taking time for participants to adopt to it, and we have, honestly, 3 major ISVs who have not yet fully completed their development. So we do expect them to fully complete their development over the next month or 2. And when that occurs, we expect to get a significant ramp-up in volumes and a significant ramp-up in activity. But we're very pleased with that. 
In addition to that, on May 3, we're going to be reducing the minimum price increment on 3-year notes. You will recall from previous earnings calls, when we reduced the minimum price increment in our 2-year notes, both on the BrokerTec platform as well as in the 2-year note futures on the listed platform, that increased our overall volumes in our treasury complex, in this case by about 3 percentage points. So we're excited about both of those developments and things I think are going very well. 
As Terry mentioned earlier, that migration included not just our U.S. treasuries, but also our repo business. And in particular, we're running all time records. So the first quarter is an all-time record in our European repo, doing almost 300 billion a day. We're also doing about 219 billion a day in our U.S. repo, which is -- which has also gone very well. So in general, I'd say it's all going very, very well and as expected."

If you recall, we guided $1.650 billion in expenses at the start of 2020. We came in at 15 57. We guided to 15 75 for this year. So very effective expense management over the last couple of years. 
So in terms of what we see, obviously, this is early in the year. We're hopeful that we see economies begin to open up in the back half of the year. So we did expect or build into our plans for that to occur. We anticipate an additional $20 million compared to last year in terms of spending for that hopeful eventuality. So we are -- we have that going on, which is kind of a back half expense -- expenses. 
And then we also are building out our East Coast data center, and we are working on the migration of EBS on the Globex. So those are a few items that we anticipate incurring additional costs for towards the back half of that year -- of this year. 
So from our perspective, we are very focused on managing our expenses. We're going to do everything that we can to keep our expenses down. But we want to balance it with growing the business. So that's the mindset that we have here. 
So we've got a couple of opportunities in front of us in terms of getting our sales team out there to meet with clients as the economies begin to open. And also we've got the EBS migration and our data center, which are costs -- are more back half-loaded. So those are a couple of items. 
Secondly, in terms of synergy realization, yes, we are -- we did have synergy realization in the first quarter. We anticipate our $200 million in run rate synergies by the end of this year. That's an additional $60 million in synergies, run rate synergies that we need to achieve. And we achieved about 2/3 of that run rate synergies at the end of the first quarter. So well on track to achieving our $200 million expense synergy target."

Yes, the retail volume and revenue in Q1 was certainly quite strong. The month of March, in particular, was a top 3 all-time revenue month for us in retail behind only March and April last year, which obviously was a time of very historically unprecedented volatility. 
When we compare Q1 back to Q4, we saw the business up 21% with really all of our regions showing double-digit growth, which is really, really strong. The product growth, it did still largely come from equities, but we also saw some nice pickup in FX and ags. More specifically, right, it was the Micro E-minis, emerging market FX, micro FX, corn and soybean. And it really -- that just speaks to the diversity of our product offering and how appealing that is to our active individual traders. 
During Q1, as you kind of expect with everyone still more or less at home, a lot of our outreach has been across our digital properties. And so we saw over 0.5 million retail traders visit our SME digital properties, and that's twice the amount that we had at the same time last year. 
And when we looked at the number of new traders that we were able to add, it was over 50,000 during just the first quarter. And so that was up another 24% over what we were doing in Q4, which just continues to signal the really solid momentum that we've made. 
As you pointed out, certainly, a key part of this business is just the alignment and the partnership with our global distribution partners. There -- a lot of this is around outreach and product education. The number of active traders that our partners educated on CME products just in Q1 surpassed over 1.5 million traders. A lot of that outreach certainly going on in APAC, but also in the U.S. And I think that's just continuing to add to the momentum and attracting new customers to the business. 
A lot of this is still largely virtual, although in-person events are starting as well. We had about 5 in-person events in Q1, so less than 10%, but I think that's another great step to returning to some of that prepandemic form of engagement with our clients. So I think we saw certainly a very strong quarter, and there is definitely a lot of interest about the upcoming micro Bitcoin launch that we have coming in May."

And to be honest, it also depends on when you're looking discreetly if we just have big options expiration, we're going to see some OI rollup. 
But if you look at average OI trends, sequentially, most importantly, from Q4 to Q1 on the commodity side, we're seeing a lot of really significant positive trends indicative of what we're seeing reflected the commercial customer base. So for example, in WTI, we saw a -- with the overall slowdown in the back half of last year, volumes and open interest decreased. We saw open interest in WTI down on 1.9 million contracts marked in November. We've seen that sequentially build up to close to 2.4 million contracts. 
We actually just had 2.54 million contracts just a month ago, which is close to a 3-year high for us. That's reflective of the sequential participation and increased participation from commercial customers. 
Sequentially, our WTI volumes were up from Q4 of -- Q1 '21 by 40%. Commercial customers were up 53%. So that open interest build is reflective of broader participation from the commercial customers on the energy side. 
I'd also add to that, we set record levels of open interest in both corn options and soybean options. Again, that's driven by the fastest-growing part of our ag business right now, which is commercial customers. We're up 21% with commercial customers. 
So that sequential growth of record open interest, growth at the fastest participation client group being commercial customers reflective of the increased risk and volatility in that market. And it's just reflective of the work that we do to make sure that CME Group is the primary place for price discovery and most importantly, risk management for all end-user customers across the board. So that's some flavor on the commodity side."

And I think you look at where CME is at today versus where it was at just a few years ago with the different options that we have today with the different expirations, not just on a quarterly basis, but the weeklies and things of that nature, you're going to see fluctuations in options OI, which drives those numbers quite a lot up and down. 
But the good news about that is healthy options on futures business helps protect and grow the underlying futures contract in and of itself. So I find that a very good sign, but the volatility in the OI definitely goes in association with the new expirations that we have. I'll let Sean comment as it relates to the rates."

So in terms of the rates, obviously, the open interest down a bit, but we're very excited about the huge growth in the first quarter over the fourth quarter and in particular, several different records that we had in terms of average daily volumes. 
So average daily volumes of our 3-year notes or 5-year notes or ultra 10-year and our 30-year bond. It was the best quarter ever, actually, for those particular items. In addition to that, we saw enormous growth out in our greens and our blues or our third year of Eurodollar futures and our fourth Eurodollar futures. So with the advent of rising rates, particularly on long end, our volumes are following through as expected. 
One of the things to keep in mind is it remains an extremely challenged environment. And the first quarter was, in fact, an extremely challenging environment. If you look at it from a volatility perspective and foreign exchange, the euro, yen and sterling, if you look at the foreign exchange markets, in euro yen and sterling, their ranks in terms of percentile, volatilities going back to 2007, were 14%, 5% and 13%. So essentially, 90% of the time, volatility has been higher since 2007. 
If you look likewise at our rates market that out to the eighth Eurodollar future, in the first quarter, we were still running at  still just a 5% ranking. So in other words, 95% of the time, going back to 2007, volatilities have been higher. 
If you go further out the curve, where we saw some increase in volumes that I already spoke about, our 12th Eurodollar future, for example, was at the 34th percentile ranking. And our 10-year notes were at 32%. So still very low volatility, even though we saw very good volumes, especially further out the curve. 
The other thing I might mention, you asked previously, there was a question previously about retail. And Julie did mention it, but we are excited about our micro Bitcoin launch, which will be happening next week. Bitcoin, you first talked about before, but I think I might talk about it somewhat differently this than I have in the past. 
If you look at our first quarter of this year, the revenue was higher than the entirety of last year, and it was about $4.7 million in the first quarter. So it was a positive and for the first time, much stronger than in the past. 
With the launch of the new micro Bitcoins, today, let me talk about the large Bitcoin futures that we have. It's 5 Bitcoins. And the margin requirements run typically more than $105,000 per contract. Obviously, that is extremely restrictive in terms of the number of participants and the types of participants who can be involved in that. 
With the new micro Bitcoin, it's going to be 1/50 of the size. The micro Bitcoin future will have approximately $2,000 margin. So you can see how that opens up a much wider potential customer base for that product. 
In addition to that, while the notional size of that product is 1/50, the size of the large contract, it's at 1/10 of a Bitcoin, the rack rate fees are 1/2 of our existing Bitcoin futures. So we're looking forward to that launch. In addition to that, the fees relative to other exchanges will be significantly lower even at that fee rate. So we're looking forward to that launch."

We're up 10% compared to first quarter of 2020. 
And it was a number of factors. I'd say, in addition to kind of that new fee structure that we've talked about before on nondisplay data, that was implemented this quarter. We also did some data feed pricing adjustments that were implemented in Q2 of last year. And so this was the first quarter that you would have seen those increases as part of the revenue. 
And in general, it's just increased demand across our drive data licenses and historical data as well as there were some higher audit findings in there. So I think we're continuing to see there's just consistency in our display device counts. And we believe that, that is a result of really better compliance and also reporting of usage by our client base. 
And when we kind of look not just at that quarter, but the outlook, I think what we're doing is listening to our clients. And we're delivering data in flexible ways, which is really how they want to take it in and use it on their end. So whether it's the data feed side of things, whether it's the new Google formatting that we're allowing and getting the data in the cloud, all of those adjustments are really just speaking to those broader data trends that are really kind of feeding both automated trading as well as clients' use of more sophisticated algorithms. And that really was the reason for the results. 
I'll turn it to John, but just what we have coming into effect here, April 1 is a change to the realtime pricing. And so that has not been changed since 2018, and we're taking that price per DCM from $105 per month per DCM to $110. So John?"

Those went into effect in February. So you'll see a full quarter impact of those price changes beginning in the second quarter of this year. 
As Julie mentioned, we also took our pricing on our screens in our market data business from 105 to 110. That's the majority of the revenue for market data comes through on this realtime data, which is what we adjusted. So targeted approach, we should see full quarter impacts of all of our pricing changes this year starting in the second quarter."

It will be a leader in trade processing and risk mitigation services. And it will provide our clients more efficient access to services, and it will be a great platform to launch new solutions across a broad set of asset classes, including interest rates, FX, equity and credit. So the largest markets out there, we'll be able to service from an OTC perspective with the JV. 
And what -- and what's really exciting about the JV is that it's very complementary in terms of services that the IHS Markit business provides and CME's optimization services business provides. So we're going to have this combined we -- in terms of the business, we anticipate the -- getting the approvals no sooner than mid-summer. But we are well on our way in terms of getting those approvals, and so there's no issues thus far in terms of the combination. 
In terms of what this means going forward, this will allow us to innovate and bring to market analytics, workflow tools and solutions that allow our clients to manage risk and process much more efficiently. If you think about the data that goes to CME Group and the data that goes to Market Serve, which is IHS Markit's business, very similar data. And it will allow customers to connect to one entity versus multiple entities as they have cross-asset class exposures. So very, very excited about that. 
And then in terms of financial implications, what you'll see this quarter is a change in accounting for our business. It's going to held-for-sale accounting. So you'll see on our balance sheet, it's spelled out on our balance sheet. We separate out our assets and liabilities related to the IHS -- I'm sorry, the -- our optimization business in anticipation of the combination. So you'll see that in our balance sheet. 
From a financial perspective, it's immaterial financial implications for our adjusted earnings. On a GAAP basis, you'll see a reduction in our amortization of intangibles. So our amortization of intangibles have gone down about $17 million per quarter, and that is really because we put on pause any further amortization of intangibles on these assets. So those are the financial implications so far. We'll provide more information as we get closer to the combination."

So we had our launch of CBL global emissions offset futures, which was extremely well received by our clients, a major source of engagement with them and one that really is just going to kick off a number of other new opportunities across the ESG space and the voluntary carbon markets. 
We've also been introducing some new Asia-focused products in the first quarter, adding China methylene and also Japanese electricity futures. We just recently introduced or announced the launch of the Mexican short-term interest rate futures. And just this morning talked since the release about the ESG 350 futures contract.

It's one of these things, Ari, that when we launch products, particularly in the emerging either renewable side or we're looking at ESG constraints, these are markets that are in the early stages of development. So it's not like putting a weekly Monday expiration route or a weekly Wednesday operation out or micro contract that instantly throws a bunch of volume out. 
So Julie makes the right point. We spend a lot of time working with, particularly our commercial customers, with the end users that actually have these underlying physical risks. And so I'll just give you a quick overview of some of the things that we've launched really over the last 12 months. 
Julie mentioned a couple that we've launched over the last 3 months. We already have a pretty healthy slate of bio energy products, whether it's the Chicago, New York ethanol contract that we have, Rotterdam ethanol, 2 contracts that we've launched that are going to sound really niche, but it's exactly in the kind of area that you're talking about, used cooking oil and used cooking oil methyl. These are really, really technical products that serve very specific functions inside the renewable space. 
Something that is a little more top of mind, cobalt and lithium. These are battery metals that are obviously absolutely imperative for -- as the EV market grows and electronify businesses and cars and you go into carbon neutral world, copper is a big part of that. That's a huge part of our business right now, the fastest-growing part of our metals business. But most importantly, building these markets out to provide risk management solutions for commercial customers that need to be able to price and have access to these underlying physical products that are part of the future that we're building. 
So there are a couple of examples in there that are maybe quite narrow, and you're not going to see those do 100,000 contracts anytime soon, but they're serving specific needs. That's what we do. We talk to our commercial customers. 
Our focus is on how to build products that suit their needs. We can build open interest, bring the commercial customers alongside. And there are many examples we'd go into, but appreciate the question, but I assure you we're spending a lot of time with our global commercial customers building these products. In our investor deck, and we'll make sure that when we put those out, we highlight those to show the work that we're doing in this environmental space on behalf of our customers."

Innovation is the lifeblood of this business as it is every other business in the world that you have to have it. So we are constantly looking at bringing out new products. 
The beauty of the world that we live in today, we are able to bring out new products in such an expedited fashion because of technology with everything else that's allowed us to do, whether it's regulatory approvals and things of that nature. And -- but what's important here is, and Derek referenced some products, as he referred to them as, is timing is very important. So you want to make sure that you have products in your pipeline, and then you'll decide how you want to add cost to them when it's time to promote them in a different fashion. 
So I do think it's important, and Derek is right. You can get a derivative of a derivative and call it a micro and get instant volume. But through some of these other product lines, it takes some time to nurture, to bring forward, but it's important that you continue to innovate. So that's what we do, and the cost associated with it is nowhere near what it used to be 10, 20, 30 years ago."

And then secondarily, on the risk side in terms of margining, if you could just talk about how comfortable you are with those lower-margin limits.

I think what Sean Tully was trying to communicate was the larger contract at a very large notional size, and it was a very higher entry point for smaller clients, who have smaller hedging needs. So as a result, a smaller contract. 
Again, it's a 38% margin. But in order to get the same exposure, you'll have to actually get 50 of those contracts to equate to the larger contracts. So you'll end up with the same amount of margin.

In terms of the sequential decline in other revenue, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, there were a couple of items in Q4 that would not continue.

In terms of the sequential decline in other revenue, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, there were a couple of items in Q4 that would not continue. And that is driving the majority of the sequential decline. 
We had an annual adjustment based on exchange activity paid by our partner in Brazil for software that we licensed them. There was also a termination fee related to our agreement with the Korean exchange. Both were booked in Q4, and both agreements concluded in last quarter. So those are not going forward, and I mentioned that at the last earnings call. 
So there was also lower custody fees in Q4 versus Q1. That was about $2.5 million as customers chose to put cash up at the clearinghouse rather than noncash collateral. So those are the majority drivers of the sequential decline in other revenue. 
In terms of our collateral that's put up at the clearinghouse, when you take a look at our -- the average cash balances between the fourth quarter of '20 and the first quarter of 2021, they increased from $86.1 billion in cash put up in the fourth quarter to $103.5 billion in cash collateral on average in Q1. So we saw an increase in the amount of cash put up at the clearinghouse, but we saw a decline in the return on those balances. It went from approximately 3 basis points down to about 2 basis points in terms of the return. 
So when you take a look in our other nonoperating section of our income statement, that -- those returns were about flat. So it was about $6 million in the fourth quarter of '20, and it's about $6.4 million in the first quarter of '21. So relatively flat. 
So the increase in the nonoperating section of our income statement really is a reflection of the -- our equity and unconsolidated subsidiaries, and that's primarily driven by our joint venture with S&P Global in the indexing space. So those are the main changes between other revenue and then our other nonoperating section of our income statement. Thanks, Kyle."

That took the -- increased the fee from $375 a month per DCM to $500 for realtime. And then for the delayed fees, it went from $175 a month per DCM to $250. So from that, we're seeing fees up about 36% there and it's been -- versus what they were before. And then we're also seeing good growth in drive data. So that's been up another 16%, and a lot of that is just people are continuing to want to use our data in other structured products and indices that they create.

So on really the international growth side, this was the second-best record ADV month with 6.2 million contracts trading and being up 33% versus what we saw in the fourth quarter. And this was driven just from a product side across a number of different areas. 
We saw interest rates up 70%. We saw equities up 15%, energy's asset class 20% and metals, 12%. So those are all clearly strong double-digit growth. This was the interest rates are at the strongest level that we've seen since the first quarter of last year. 
From a customer perspective, again, I think growth was generated really across all of the segments when we looked at it most in more detail. And the largest gains, though, were among our hedge fund clients and also bank trading activity. And that continues to kind of demonstrate that diversity of that client ADV contribution that we saw in Q1. 
If we just double-click a little bit on Europe, that being up 34% in Q1 to 4.3 million contracts. And there, we saw some strong growth in Eurodollar futures, treasury weeklies across really the whole treasury complex, copper and also gasoline and APAC was a pretty similar story. There, we saw ADV of 1.5 million contracts. So that was up 33%. Major growth again from a product perspective, Eurodollars, treasuries, WTI, copper and bonds. 
And when we look across all of the international countries, the top 20 -- all of the top 20 had double-digit growth, which is phenomenal. And this is where we're continuing to put our assets and our resources to kind of continue to grow that business. And in particular, again, I think for all of those regions, the hedge fund and bank clients were really the standout customer contribution side of things. And Derek can go into more detail on commodities."

I'll touch on just maybe the agricultural piece of this is that was really the standout performer that we saw in some of the trends we talked about earlier. Terry touched on some of these trends in terms of global utilization, the way we're focusing on global customer bases. Now ag showed some significant uptake just given the increased tightening stocks globally, particularly for corn and soybeans. 
Specifically in Asia Pacific, we set a quarterly volume record for agricultural asset class in Asia. Our Asian ag volume was up 57% year-on-year. That is a staggering number. 
But when you look at the continued globalization efforts that we put forward, whether it's electronic trading, whether it's the products that we're building out, whether it's the growth of our options business, we talked about the record corn options and soybean options open interest. Remember that open interest growth generally is reflective of increased participation from commercial participants. We typically see financial players then follow as they're following the open interest trend. 
So we saw record quarter. We saw a record individual month in ags in the month of January, and we continue to see going from strength to strength there. So the percent of our business taking place in commodities generally has been an area of growth for us over the last couple of years. This particular quarter, it was a highlight on ags. And that has obviously had a very significant positive impact on our rate per contract in ags that we saw a couple of cents uptick in rate per contract. Even with very, very strong volumes, both sequentially and year-on-year, we still were able to grow our rate per contract in ag. So I'll turn it over to John for some of the RPC effects."

So I don't think we really had any change of mind since the last call. It's just part of the natural business decisions that we make here going forward. 
And as it relates to the Ether contract, that's a relatively new contract trading, Julie, with a couple thousand a day maybe, 2,000 a day. And we won't say never to a micro Ether contract. But again, we're going to continue to help nourish that contract along, and we'll see how it goes. So we'll make that decision when the time is right, if, in fact, the time is right. 
But right now, it was an appropriate move for us to work on the micro contract with Bitcoin. We have listed the contract for several years.

And then last, what we saw is really a tremendous increase in the amount of WTI trading, which was up, I think, sequentially, about 37%, about 40%, I should say. And nat gas, which has a higher RPC, was relatively flat. So what that did is that had a product mix shift towards WTI.

And certainly some early positive signs around that. We do have some of our sales teams meeting with clients in outdoors and the like. But really what we're looking for is getting more customer events, more in-person events, more of our sales team meeting clients around the world. That's really what we were referring to, and that leads to additional travel, additional marketing events. Those are the items that we kind of put into our plans for the back half of this year, and we're hopeful we're going to see that."

As we all continue to navigate through the pandemic, I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. We released our executive summary this morning, which provided extensive details on the first quarter of '21. As John said, I have John, Sean, Derek, Sunil and Julie Winkler with me this morning, and we look forward to addressing any questions you have.  
We saw solid volume rebound during the first quarter of this year as we averaged 22 million contracts per day. That represented our third most active quarter ever, following the record activity we saw in Q1 of 2020 at the start of the pandemic, when we averaged 27 million contracts per day.  
Importantly, we had a nice rebound from the back half of the year in 2020. We had a 35% sequential increase in average daily volume from Q4 '20 to Q1 '21. Also, interest rates were up 65% to more than 10 million contracts per day in Q1 relative to Q4. In addition, equities, energy and metals were all higher sequentially by approximately 20%.  
In terms of products, we had record quarters in Bitcoin futures and silver futures. Micro E-mini NASDAQ and Russell were each up more than 100%. Agricultural markets remained active, particularly in options with more than 60% growth in both corn and soybean options, ADV versus Q1 of '20.  
Also, we continue to see strong non-U.S. customer volumes originating in Europe and Asia with approximately 6 million per day during Q1 2021 versus 4.7 million per day for all of 2020. We are also pleased with the transition of BrokerTec onto the Globex platform for the treasury curve trades, and we did see recent all-time record in European repo activity.  
Last quarter, I mentioned the ongoing innovation across our markets. In Q1, that continued with Japanese energy futures, global emission offset futures, Ether futures, micro Bitcoin futures, lithium futures, Mexican interest rate futures and most recently, CME-term sulfur. Also, we announced the JV with IHS Markit, which we are excited about. The main point is that we are constantly finding ways to assist our clients with the world's most diverse product offering across all the critical global asset classes.  
With that, let me turn the call over to John, who will discuss the financial results. And I look forward to answering your questions."

During the first quarter, CME generated more than $1.250 billion in revenue, reflecting average daily volume of 21.8 million contracts. Expenses were very carefully managed, and on an adjusted basis, were $437 million for the quarter and $372 million, excluding license fees. CME had an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6%, which resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.79.  
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $27 million. During the first quarter, CME paid out more than $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the form of our annual variable dividend of $2.50 per share and our most recent regular dividend of $0.90 per share. CME's cash at the end of the first quarter was more than $1 billion.  
Our 2021 guidance remains unchanged. We expect total adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, to come in at $1.575 billion. We anticipate the spending to be weighted heavier in the second half of the year as the global economy potentially opens. We continue to expect CapEx to come in between $180 million and $190 million. Finally, our tax rate guidance remains between 23.2% and 24.2%. Please refer to the last page of our executive commentary for additional financial highlights and details.

Great question. So, so far, things have gone very well. If you look at our relative share of the market, which is available through certain market sources, it's been -- on the BrokerTec U.S. treasuries, it's been flat between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So we're very pleased with that result, given the challenges as you mentioned, participants adopting to the new platform. In addition to that, we're very excited about the new functionality that we have launched. It, likewise, is taking time for participants to take advantage of the new functionality. We did launch now about a month ago, our new RV trading functionality, which I have described before.  
We have a handful of market makers. We have about 17 customers who are submitting orders, orders and getting executed. And we've executed more than 2 billion worth of volume. We're doing about 120 million a day. We are very excited, though. Why? Because it is taking time for participants to adopt to it, and we have, honestly, 3 major ISVs who have not yet fully completed their development. So we do expect them to fully complete their development over the next month or 2. And when that occurs, we expect to get a significant ramp-up in volumes and a significant ramp-up in activity. But we're very pleased with that.  
In addition to that, on May 3, we're going to be reducing the minimum price increment on 3-year notes. You will recall from previous earnings calls, when we reduced the minimum price increment on our 2-year notes, both on the BrokerTec platform as well as in the 2-year note futures on the listed platform, that increased our overall volumes in our treasury complex, in this case, by about 3 percentage points. So we're excited about both of those developments and things I think are going very well.  
As Terry mentioned earlier, that migration included not just our U.S. treasuries, but also our repo business. And in particular, we're running all time records. So the first quarter is an all-time record in our European repo, doing almost $300 billion a day. We're also doing about $219 billion a day in our U.S. repo, which is -- which has also gone very well. So in general, I'd say it's all going very, very well and as expected."

So very effective expense management over the last couple of years. So in terms of what we see, obviously, this is early in the year. We're hopeful that we see economies begin to open up in the back half of the year. So we did expect or build into our plans for that to occur. We anticipate an additional $20 million compared to last year in terms of spending for that hopeful eventuality. So we are -- we have that going on, which is kind of a back half expenses.  
And then we also are building out our East Coast data center, and we are working on the migration of EBS on the Globex. So those are a few items that we anticipate incurring additional costs for towards the back half of that year -- of this year. So from our perspective, we are very focused on managing our expenses. We're going to do everything that we can to keep our expenses down. But we want to balance it with growing the business. So that's the mindset that we have here.  
So we've got a couple of opportunities in front of us in terms of getting our sales team out there to meet with clients as the economies begin to open. And also, we've got the EBS migration and our data center, which are costs -- are more back half-loaded. So those are a couple of items.  
Secondly, in terms of synergy realization. Yes, we are -- we did have synergy realization in the first quarter. We anticipate our $200 million in run rate synergies by the end of this year. That's an additional $60 million in synergies -- run rate synergies, that we need to achieve. And we achieved about 2/3 of that run rate synergies at the end of the first quarter.

Yes, the retail volume and revenue in Q1 was certainly quite strong. The month of March, in particular, was a top 3 all-time revenue month for us in retail, behind only March and April last year, which obviously was a time of very historically unprecedented volatility. 
When we compare Q1 back to Q4, we saw the business up 21% with really all of our regions showing double-digit growth, which is really, really strong. The product growth, it did still largely come from equities, but we also saw some nice pickup in FX and ags. More specifically, right, it was the Micro E-minis, emerging market FX, micro FX, corn and soybean. And it really -- that just speaks to the diversity of our product offering and how appealing that is to our active individual traders. 
During Q1, as you kind of expect with everyone still more or less at home, a lot of our outreach has been across our digital properties. And so we saw over 0.5 million retail traders visit our SME digital properties, and that's twice the amount that we had at the same time last year. And when we looked at the number of new traders that we were able to add, it was over 50,000 during just the first quarter. And so that was up another 24% over what we were doing in Q4, which just continues to signal the really solid momentum that we've made. 
As you pointed out, certainly, a key part of this business is just the alignment and the partnership with our global distribution partners. There -- a lot of this is around outreach and product education. The number of active traders that our partners educated on CME products just in Q1 surpassed over 1.5 million traders. A lot of that outreach certainly going on in APAC, but also in the U.S. And I think that's just continuing to add to the momentum and attracting new customers to the business. 
A lot of this is still largely virtual, although in-person events are starting as well. We had about 5 in-person events in Q1, so less than 10%, but I think that's another great step to returning to some of that prepandemic form of engagement with our clients. So I think we saw certainly a very strong quarter, and there is definitely a lot of interest about the upcoming micro Bitcoin launch that we have coming in May."

It's going to vary a little bit by product, Mike, in terms of kind of what those trends are. And to be honest, it also depends on when you're looking discreetly if we just have big options expiration, we're going to see some OI rollup. 
But if you look at average OI trends, sequentially, most importantly, from Q4 to Q1 on the commodity side, we're seeing a lot of really significant positive trends, indicative of what we're seeing reflected the commercial customer base. So for example, in WTI, we saw a -- with the overall slowdown in the back half of last year, volumes and open interest decreased. We saw open interest in WTI down on 1.9 million contracts marked in November. We've seen that sequentially build up to close to 2.4 million contracts. 
We actually just had 2.54 million contracts just a month ago, which is close to a 3-year high for us. That's reflective of the sequential participation and increased participation from commercial customers. Sequentially, our WTI volumes were up from Q4 of -- Q1 '21 by 40%. Commercial customers were up 53%. So that open interest build is reflective of broader participation from the commercial customers on the energy side. 
I'd also add to that, we set record levels of open interest in both corn options and soybean options. Again, that's driven by the fastest-growing part of our ag business right now, which is commercial customers. We're up 21% with commercial customers. 
So that sequential growth of record open interest, growth at the fastest participation client group being commercial customers, reflective of the increased risk and volatility in that market. And it's just reflective of the work that we do to make sure that CME Group is the primary place for price discovery and most importantly, risk management for all end-user customers across the board. So that's some flavor on the commodity side."

And I think you look at where CME is at today versus where it was at just a few years ago with the different options that we have today with the different expirations, not just on a quarterly basis, but the weeklies and things of that nature. You're going to see fluctuations in options OI, which drives those numbers quite a lot up and down. 
But the good news about that is healthy options on futures business helps protect and grow the underlying futures contract in and of itself. So I find that a very good sign, but the volatility in the OI definitely goes in association with the new expirations that we have. I'll let Sean comment as it relates to the rates."

So in terms of the rates, obviously, the open interest's down a bit, but we're very excited about the huge growth in the first quarter over the fourth quarter and in particular, several different records that we had in terms of av",576,"Thanks very much, Terry. So in terms of the rates, obviously, the open interest's down a bit, but we're very excited about the huge growth in the first quarter over the fourth quarter and in particular, several different records that we had in terms of average daily volumes. 
So average daily volumes of our 3-year notes or 5-year notes or ultra 10-year and our 30-year bond. It was the best quarter ever, actually, for those particular items. In addition to that, we saw enormous growth out in our greens and our blues or our third year of Eurodollar futures and our fourth Eurodollar futures. So with the advent of rising rates, particularly on long end, our volumes are following through as expected. 
One of the things to keep in mind is it remains an extremely challenged environment. And the first quarter was, in fact, an extremely challenging environment. If you look at it from a volatility perspective and foreign exchange, the euro, yen and sterling, if you look at the foreign exchange markets, in euro, yen and sterling, their ranks in terms of percentile, volatilities going back to 2007, were 14%, 5% and 13%. So essentially, 90% of the time, volatility has been higher since 2007. 
If you look likewise at our rates market that out to the eighth Eurodollar future, in the first quarter, we were still running at  still just a 5% ranking. So in other words, 95% of the time, going back to 2007, volatilities have been higher. If you go further out the curve, where we saw some increase in volumes that I already spoke about, our 12th Eurodollar future, for example, was at the 34th percentile ranking. And our 10-year notes were at 32%. So still very low volatility, even though we saw very good volumes, especially further out the curve. 
The other thing I might mention, you asked previously, there was a question previously about retail. And Julie did mention it, but we are excited about our Micro Bitcoin launch, which will be happening next week. Bitcoin, you first talked about before, but I think I might care about it somewhat differently -- than I have in the past. If you look at our first quarter of this year, the revenue was higher than the entirety of last year, and it was about $4.7 million in the first quarter. So it was a positive and for the first time, much stronger than in the past. 
With the launch of the new Micro Bitcoins, today, let me talk about the large Bitcoin futures that we have. It's 5 Bitcoins. And the margin requirements run typically more than $105,000 per contract. Obviously, that is extremely restrictive in terms of the number of participants and the types of participants who can be involved in that. With the new Micro Bitcoin, it's going to be 1/50 of the size. The micro Bitcoin future will have approximately $2,000 margin. So you can see how that opens up a much wider potential customer base for that product. 
In addition to that, while the notional size of that product is 1/50, the size of the large contract, it's at 1/10 of a Bitcoin, the rack rate fees are 1/2 of our existing Bitcoin futures. So we're looking forward to that launch. In addition to that, the fees relative to other exchanges will be significantly lower even at that fee rate. So we're looking forward to that launch."

We're up 10% compared to first quarter of 2020. And it was a number of factors. I'd say, in addition to kind of that new fee structure that we've talked about before on nondisplay data, that was implemented this quarter. We also did some data feed pricing adjustments that were implemented in Q2 of last year. And so this was the first quarter that you would have seen those increases as part of the revenue. 
And in general, it's just increased demand across our drive data licenses and historical data as well as there were some higher audit findings in there. So I think we're continuing to see there's just consistency in our display device counts. And we believe that, that is a result of really better compliance and also reporting of usage by our client base. 
And when we kind of look not just at that quarter, but the outlook, I think what we're doing is listening to our clients. And we're delivering data in flexible ways, which is really how they want to take it in and use it on their end. So whether it's the data feed side of things, whether it's the new Google formatting that we're allowing and getting the data in the cloud, all of those adjustments are really just speaking to those broader data trends that are really kind of feeding both automated trading as well as clients' use of more sophisticated algorithms. And that really was the reason for the results. 
I'll turn it to John, but just what we have coming into effect here, April 1 is a change to the realtime pricing. And so that has not been changed since 2018, and we're taking that price per DCM from $105 per month per DCM to $110. So John?"

So the largest markets out there, we'll be able to service from an OTC perspective with the JV. 
And what -- and what's really exciting about the JV is that it's very complementary in terms of services that the IHS Markit business provides and CME's optimization services business provides. So we're going to have this combined we -- in terms of the business, we anticipate the -- getting the approvals no sooner than mid-summer. But we are well on our way in terms of getting those approvals, and so there's no issues thus far in terms of the combination. 
In terms of what this means going forward, this will allow us to innovate and bring to market analytics, workflow tools and solutions that allow our clients to manage risk and process much more efficiently. If you think about the data that goes to CME Group and the data that goes to Market Serve, which is IHS Markit's business, very similar data. And it will allow customers to connect to one entity versus multiple entities as they have cross-asset class exposures. So very, very excited about that. 
And then in terms of financial implications, what you'll see this quarter is a change in accounting for our business. It's going to held-for-sale accounting. So you'll see on our balance sheet, it's spelled out on our balance sheet. We separate out our assets and liabilities related to the IHS -- I'm sorry, the -- our optimization business in anticipation of the combination. So you'll see that in our balance sheet. 
From a financial perspective, it's immaterial financial implications for our adjusted earnings. On a GAAP basis, you'll see a reduction in our amortization of intangibles. So our amortization of intangibles have gone down about $17 million per quarter, and that is really because we put on pause any further amortization of intangibles on these assets. So those are the financial implications so far. We'll provide more information as we get closer to the combination."

So we had our launch of CBL global emissions offset futures, which was extremely well-received by our clients, a major source of engagement with them and one that really is just going to kick off a number of other new opportunities across the ESG space and the voluntary carbon markets. 
We've also been introducing some new Asia-focused products in the first quarter, adding China methylene and also Japanese electricity futures. We just recently introduced or announced the launch of the Mexican short-term interest rate futures. And just this morning, talked, sent the release out about the ESG 350 futures contract.

It's one of these things, Ari, that when we launch products, particularly in the emerging either renewable side or we're looking at ESG constraints. These are markets that are in the early stages of development. So it's not like putting a weekly Monday expiration route or a weekly Wednesday operation out or micro contract that instantly throws a bunch of volume out. 
So Julie makes the right point. We spend a lot of time working with, particularly our commercial customers, with the end users that actually have these underlying physical risks. And so I'll just give you a quick overview of some of the things that we've launched really over the last 12 months. 
Julie mentioned a couple that we've launched over the last 3 months. We already have a pretty healthy slate of bio energy products, whether it's the Chicago, New York ethanol contract that we have. Rotterdam ethanol, 2 contracts that we've launched that are going to sound really niche, but it's exactly in the kind of area that you're talking about, used cooking oil and used cooking oil methyl ester. These are really, really technical products that serve very specific functions inside the renewable space. 
Something that is a little more top of mind, cobalt and lithium. These are battery metals that are, obviously, absolutely imperative for -- as the EV market grows and electronify businesses and cars and you go into carbon neutral world, copper is a big part of that. That's a huge part of our business right now, the fastest-growing part of our metals business. But most importantly, building these markets out to provide risk management solutions for commercial customers that need to be able to price and have access to these underlying physical products that are part of the future that we're building. 
So there are a couple of examples in there that are maybe quite narrow, and you're not going to see those do 100,000 contracts anytime soon, but they're serving specific needs. That's what we do. We talk to our commercial customers. 
Our focus is on how to build products that suit their needs. We can build open interest, bring the commercial customers alongside. And there are many examples we'd go into, but appreciate the question, but I assure you we're spending a lot of time with our global commercial customers building these products. They're in our investor deck, and we'll make sure that when we put those out, we highlight those to show the work that we're doing in this environmental space on behalf of our customers."

Innovation is the lifeblood of this business as it is every other business in the world that you have to have it. So we are constantly looking at bringing out new products. 
The beauty of the world that we live in today, we are able to bring out new products in such an expedited fashion because of technology with everything else that's allowed us to do, whether it's regulatory approvals and things of that nature. And -- but what's important here is, and Derek referenced some mesotherm products, as he referred to them as, is timing is very important. So you want to make sure that you have products in your pipeline, and then you'll decide how you want to add cost to them when it's time to promote them in a different fashion. 
So I do think it's important, and Derek is right. You can get a derivative of a derivative and call it a micro and get instant volume. But through some of these other product lines, it takes some time to nurture, to bring forward, but it's important that you continue to innovate. So that's what we do, and the cost associated with it is nowhere near what it used to be 10, 20, 30 years ago."

I think what Sean Tully was trying to communicate was the larger contract at a very large notional size, and it was a very higher entry point for smaller clients, who have smaller hedging needs. So as a result, a smaller contract. 
Again, it's a 38% margin. But in order to get the same exposure, you'll have to actually get 50 of those contracts to equate to the larger contracts. So you'll end up with the same amount of margin.

In terms of the sequential decline in other revenue, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, there were a couple of items in Q4 that would not continue. And that is driving the majority of the sequential decline.",360,"Sure, Kyle. Thank you for the question. In terms of the sequential decline in other revenue, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, there were a couple of items in Q4 that would not continue. And that is driving the majority of the sequential decline. 
We had an annual adjustment based on exchange activity paid by our partner in Brazil for software that we licensed them. There was also a termination fee related to our agreement with the Korean exchange. Both were booked in Q4, and both agreements concluded in last quarter. So those are not going forward, and I mentioned that at the last earnings call. 
So there was also lower custody fees in Q4 versus Q1. That was about $2.5 million as customers chose to put cash up at the clearinghouse rather than noncash collateral. So those are the majority drivers of the sequential decline in other revenue. 
In terms of our collateral that's put up at the clearinghouse, when you take a look at our -- the average cash balances between the fourth quarter of '20 and the first quarter of 2021, they increased from $86.1 billion in cash, put up in the fourth quarter, to $103.5 billion in cash collateral on average in Q1. So we saw an increase in the amount of cash put up at the clearinghouse, but we saw a decline in the return on those balances. It went from approximately 3 basis points down to about 2 basis points in terms of the return. 
So when you take a look in our other nonoperating section of our income statement, that -- those returns were about flat. So it was about $6 million in the fourth quarter of '20, and it's about $6.4 million in the first quarter of '21. So relatively flat. So the increase in the nonoperating section of our income statement really is a reflection of the -- our equity and unconsolidated subsidiaries, and that's primarily driven by our joint venture with S&P Global in the indexing space. So those are the main changes between other revenue and then our other nonoperating section of our income statement. Thanks, Kyle."

So from that, we're seeing fees up about 36% there and it's been -- versus what they were before. And then we're also seeing good growth to drive data. So that's been up another 16%, and a lot of that is just people are continuing to want to use our data in other structured products and indices that they create.

So on really the international growth side, this was the second-best record ADV month with 6.2 million contracts trading and being up 33% versus what we saw in the fourth quarter. And this was driven just from a product side across a number of different areas. 
We saw interest rates up 70%. We saw equities up 15%, energy's asset class 20% and metals, 12%. So those are all clearly strong double-digit growth. This was -- the interest rates are at the strongest level that we've seen since the first quarter of last year. 
From a customer perspective, again, I think growth was generated really across all of the segments when we looked at it most in more detail. And the largest gains, though, were among our hedge fund clients and also bank trading activity. And that continues to kind of demonstrate that diversity of that client ADV contribution that we saw in Q1. 
If we just double-click a little bit on Europe, that being up 34% in Q1 to 4.3 million contracts. And there, we saw some strong growth in Eurodollar futures, treasury weeklies across really the whole treasury complex, copper and also gasoline. And APAC was a pretty similar story. There, we saw ADV of 1.5 million contracts so that was up 33%. Major growth again, from a product perspective, Eurodollars, treasuries, WTI, copper and bonds. 
And when we look across all of the international countries, the top 20 -- all of the top 20 had double-digit growth, which is phenomenal. And this is where we're continuing to put our assets and our resources to kind of continue to grow that business. And in particular, again, I think for all of those regions, the hedge fund and bank clients were really the standout customer contribution side of things. And Derek can go into more detail on commodities."

I'll touch on just maybe the agricultural piece of this because that was really the standout performer that we saw in some of the trends we talked about earlier. Terry touched on some of these trends in terms of global utilization, the way we're focusing on global customer bases. Now ag showed some significant uptake just given the increased tightening stocks globally, particularly for corn and soybeans. Specifically in Asia Pacific, we set a quarterly volume record for agricultural asset class in Asia. Our Asian ag volume was up 57% year-on-year. That is a staggering number. 
But when you look at the continued globalization efforts that we put forward, whether it's electronic trading, whether it's the products that we're building out, whether it's the growth of our options business, we talked about the record corn options and soybean options, open interest. Remember that open interest growth generally is reflective of increased participation from commercial participants. We typically see financial players then follow as they're following the open interest trend. 
So we saw record quarter. We saw a record individual month in ags in the month of January, and we continue to see going from strength to strength there. So the percent of our business taking place in commodity is generally has been an area of growth for us over the last couple of years. This particular quarter, it was a highlight on ags. And that has obviously had a very significant positive impact on our rate per contract in ags, that we saw a couple of cents uptick in rate per contract. Even with very, very strong volumes, both sequentially and year-on-year, we still were able to grow our rate per contract in ag. So I'll turn it over to John for some of the RPC effects."

So I don't think we really had any change of mind since the last call. It's just part of the natural business decisions that we make here going forward. 
And as it relates to the Ether contract, that's a relatively new contract trading, Julie, with a couple thousand a day maybe, 2,000 a day. And we won't say never to a micro Ether contract. But again, we're going to continue to help nourish that contract along, and we'll see how it goes. So we'll make that decision when the time is right, if, in fact, the time is right. 
But right now, it was an appropriate move for us to work on the micro contract with Bitcoin. We have listed the contract for several years.

And then last, what we saw is really a tremendous increase in the amount of WTI trading, which was up, I think, sequentially, about 37%, about 40%, I should say. And nat gas, which has a higher RPC, was relatively flat. So what that did is that had a product mix shift towards WTI.

I just wondered if you could talk about how -- given where we are in the first quarter and what we've seen, is that what we were talking about in terms of a more constructive revenue environment? Or are you expecting more around -- as we move through the back end of the year?"

Really, it's more around the opening of the economies around the world and getting the opportunity to get in front of our clients in person really is what we're thinking about. 
And certainly, some early positive signs around that. We do have some of our sales teams meeting with clients in outdoors and the like. But really, what we're looking for is getting more customer events, more in-person events, more of our sales team meeting clients around the world. That's really what we were referring to, and that leads to additional travel, additional marketing events. Those are the items that we've kind of put into our plans for the back half of this year, and we're hopeful we're going to see that."

We released our executive summary this morning, which provided extensive details on the second quarter of 2021. Also, as John said, I have John, Sean, Derek, Sunil, and Julie Winkler, on the call with us this morning, and we look forward to addressing any questions you have. 
We delivered solid volume during the second quarter of this year as we average more than 18 million contracts per day. We saw strength in our rates and agricultural businesses relative to Q2 last year. 
Equities and energy volumes were down with less volatility in those markets compared to the prior year. 
So far in July, we are up 29% month to date compared to July last year with particular strength in rates, which has more than doubled compared to a year ago. We have seen a rebound in energy, which is up more than 25% month to date. 
In terms of products, we had a record ADV, or average daily volume in SOFR futures. Total Bitcoin futures and options and copper options in Q2. We had a highly successful launch of our Micro WTI, which was the most successful commodity product launch in the history of CME Group. 
On August 1, we will begin trading nature-based global emission offset contracts. In addition, our new Micro Treasury yield contracts will be available for trading in August. 
In the second quarter, non-U.S. ADV was 5.2 million contracts, up 6%. We saw 9% growth in Asia Pacific, 8% in Latin America, and 6% in Europe. Across all regions, the growth came from increased rates activity, ag products, FX and metals. This was also supported in how our clients interacted with our digital properties as ags, metals, and FX saw double-digit growth in new users from all regions. 
The main point is we are constantly finding ways to assist our clients with the world's most diverse product offerings across all the critical global asset classes.

During the second quarter, CME generated almost $1.2 billion in revenue with average daily volume of more than 18 million contracts. Expenses were very carefully managed, and on an adjusted basis, were $427 million for the quarter and $373 million, excluding license fees. 
CME had an adjusted effective tax rate of 24.1%, which resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.64. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $40 million. CME paid out more than $300 million of dividends during the second quarter and cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.2 billion. 
Turning to guidance. We now expect total adjusted operating expenses for 2021, excluding license fees, to come in at approximately $1.560 billion, that is $15 million below our prior guidance and virtually flat with last year's adjusted expense levels. 
All other guidance remains unchanged. We project CapEx to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million and our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 23.2% and 24.2%. Finally, we are on track and have a very good line of sight to achieve our targeted $200 million in cumulative run rate synergies by year-end.

But in general, Rich, when we list some of these Micro contracts, we do it for fundamental reasons to address the concerns of the market participants. There's many of times, as you know, that we can look at the Micro equity component -- Micro equity contracts, and because of the valuation of the certain underlying equities, it made sense for us to go ahead and list smaller contracts, whether it was the E-mini, now down to the Micro. And so that was a driving force for that. 
And then we look at the demand for other products associated with it. 
On the crypto, you could almost say the same story with the appreciation in Bitcoin going upwards of 60,000 at one given point, it made sense to have a smaller contract to address in the audience to make sure they can mitigate and manage their risk. 
On the West Texas, was just listed. I think that was just a demand from different participants, both on the commercial side and the financial side who want to participate in that market and just a bit of a smaller contract. 
So there's a question is, are we going to invest more in that sector of the business? We will continually look at the needs of the clients and make that decision as it comes. I don't want to prejudge it and say, yes, but I wouldn't want to rule it out either. 
So I'll let some of my colleagues go ahead and jump in, maybe Mr. Pietrowicz would."

One is we really found a position in the market where these really resonate, to Terry's point, in terms of meeting clients' needs. 
One of the things we've also done is we've adjusted the pricing on the Micros, as I mentioned last quarter. So when you take a look at the Micro equity products, we saw an increase in the rate per contract from $0.154 to $0.176, up about 14%, which reflects the full quarter impact of the pricing adjustment plus the launch of our highly successful Micro Bitcoin contract that has an RPC about $1.57 to $1.59. So huge success there. 
We also saw an increase in the Micro Gold RPC, which went from $0.397 to $0.446 when you look at first quarter versus second quarter for a 12% increase. 
What's very exciting is we have built $100 million a year business so far that didn't exist just a couple of years ago with our Micro product. So it's pretty exciting in terms of addressing a client need and really having the product set, which allows us to offer a wide variety of Micro products."

What's most interesting about this, as Terry said, this is actually a new client acquisition tool for us.

And the key stat there is that we've got over 2,600 participants in our Micro contract that have never traded any other crude product with CME Group core. 
So this is functionally and practically brand new business to us in this asset class. 
We're seeing a higher participation percent of non-U.S. participants. About 26% for Micro business is trading from outside the U.S. versus the average of about 20% coming from outside the U.S. in our main contract. 
Open interest has grown. We're seeing steady liquidity participation across the global trading day. 16 liquidity providers have been in there every single day, and they got 6,200 unique users trading the contract and 75 individual unique trading firms. 
So broad participation, global participation, net new client acquisition, really strong start. And so we're excited about what this can mean for the business, and what this means for liquidity provision globally."

So yes, we are excited about the initial uptake of new products and services that we're offering across that platform that we have talked about previously. Obviously, larger picture, there is a lot of direct streaming going on in that -- in the cash markets, in general, both in the treasury markets as well as in the foreign exchange markets, and we're investing very heavily there. 
So we -- one of the big investments we're making is in what we call QDM 2.0, a quote-driven markets 2.0. We expect to be -- we are launching that now. We're in the middle of doing that on our FX business. And after we launched that in our FX business, we will be launching it in our treasuries business. And we do expect that to be a state-of-the-art in the best-in-class direct streaming platform, so that should help. 
But even before that, I talked a lot on previous calls about RV trading. RV trading is still getting uptake, and we are excited about the progress so far. So we did $280 million average daily volume in the month of June. Last week, we did $530 million average daily volume. And last Wednesday, we did $1.1 billion. So it is starting to show the results that we had hoped. 
This is in an environment where the bulk of many of our participants, actually, the BrokerTec participants, do not yet have automated APIs connecting to the functionality. So this is manual users who are taking advantage of it at this point. So we don't have the bulk of the electronic community in there yet. 
We did have a major ISV last week for the first time offer to their customers, testing in the new functionality. So we are very excited to see what that has to offer in the coming months. In addition to that, we reduced the 3-year minimum price increments -- 3-year minimum price increments that have a very significant positive impact. If you look at 3-year notes, they went from a typical average daily volume of $10 billion a day to $16 billion a day. So we saw, on a relative basis, relative to the entire platform, a 60% increase in that individual security. So very excited about that. 
There are also other moves that we are taking relative to optimizing commissions and other things that are having a positive impact. 
If you look at the overall industry, while over the previous couple of years, BrokerTec had lost significant market share in the dealer-to-dealer space. If you look at -- sorry, the fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year, and the month of June, we have flattened out that market share level. So if you look at the fourth quarter, we were at 59%; first quarter, we were at 59%; and in June, we were at 58.5%. 
So we are getting traction in the new products and services. It has stabilized the relative share of that platform. And we do expect it to grow further as there's greater uptake in the new functionality. Thanks for the question."

The entire team at CME has done an excellent job in managing our costs. With the revised guidance, we're holding expenses virtually flat with last year and just under $80 million below 2019 levels. 
When it comes to the expenses, the second half of the year is traditionally higher than the first half. Marketing and advertising spend tend to occur later in the year, and we also tend to see higher project spending in the second half as well. 
Spending this year reflects the same pattern, but we had anticipated a higher-than-normal spend in the second half of the year when we built out our spending plans. 
During the year, we also chose to delay some of the planned first half spending to the second half of the year as the environment became clearer. For example, we brought back our employees and we're seeing some of our clients also return to the office. 
In terms of the type of costs, marketing and advertising reflects just under half the increased spending between the first and second half of the year. We'll be targeting a portion of that spending on our successful Micro products. The balance reflects higher technology spending as we continue to advance the integration of EBS, which also drive higher depreciation. And finally, we anticipate contingent labor spending for accelerating some of our projects. As Sean indicated, we are investing in some of the streaming platforms in our cash markets businesses. 
So that gives you an idea of the change in first half versus second half. And then in terms of realized synergies, we realized approximately $9 million of of synergies in our P&L for 2021. 
And just to finish off on that, we've got a very strong line of sight to achieving our $200 million in run rate synergies by year-end."

We've been extremely active with them in terms of investing in the educational efforts. As one such example, we've had -- our partners alone have increased over 123%, the education of traders in the first half of this year, reaching over 1 million retail traders. 
And so, that is how we make people continue to be successful in trading in our markets. So we're going to continue to see that investment. 
As Terry pointed out earlier, a lot of this is about understanding client needs. We know that there will be a continued work as we move towards SOFR in that transition. And the last thing is just continuing about capital efficiencies. I mean, it has been a hallmark of our business for many years, and that continues to be very top of mind to clients. So continuing to work with Derek, Sean, and Sunil on how we can deliver that going forward for our clients."

Sean touched on it a little bit earlier with the BrokerTec question. We're going to continue to become more and more efficient as we get offsets against our futures products, which will, again, lend people to adding more open interest. One of your questions was around open interest. 
The EBS integration on to the Globex platform. We're talking about multiple participants who've never traded futures before FX. We believe we have a good opportunity for them to participate in the FX markets. Another additive into the open interest pool here at CME. 
So some -- a lot of the things that we've done could be very additive, and that doesn't even include the environment that we're all living in, which we know is one of the most riskiest environments this world has ever seen. So we feel confident that the open interest can continue to build with the capital efficiencies and some of the acquisitions we did with the cash products and the futures products along with people needing to manage risk in all of our asset classes."

We've also got a great relationship with S&P Global. One of our -- this will be the second joint venture with them. So we've got -- we're excited about working with them once they're merger with IHS Markit has been completed.

We do -- you will see some geography changes on our income statement, where revenues and expenses for the contributed companies will be netted into equities and unconsolidated subsidiaries, which is the same location we have the S&P Dow Jones joint venture.

On the rate side, for example, we launched the new Treasury Watch Tool. Treasury Watch tool has had now over 8,000 unique users look at it every day. It's certainly, where the marketplace goes to look at the U.S. treasury government issuance, the Federal Reserve's purchase of security and as well as the activity in our treasury futures as well as on BrokerTec. So that is a tool that has gotten significant traction and we think offers an enormous amount of value to our customers and helps to cross-sell our products from the cash markets to the futures and futures in cash. 
In addition to that, on the foreign exchange side, we launched 3 new tools last year. We launched our FX market profile tool, our FX swap rate monitor, and our FX options fall converter tool. Those tools likewise with several thousand each in terms of unique users. If you look at our FX market profile, 863 different companies represented FX swap rate monitor, 630 different companies represented. 
So you're seeing an enormous penetration of our customers and potential customers for new client acquisition and cross-selling get value out of these tools. So all those are growing very positively. 
This is just where we have been over the last 12 months, though. If you look at it on a go-forward basis, one of the great value propositions that we have is the ability with the acquisition of our cash markets and with our derivatives markets to combine this data and synchronize this data for the very first time. 
We have seen, as I said earlier, good uptake on our FX market profile tool. We are actually just in the process of launching version 2.0 of that, which shows 10 different order levels in terms of the order book. And it really shows participants how, not only they need to use both liquidity tools, both futures and spot markets -- cash spot markets in order to optimize their execution in foreign exchange but in addition to that, much greater depth than how to do that. 
We will be launching later this summer, the initial treasury market profile tool, which will likewise synchronized for the first time, our treasury futures data with our treasury cash data. 
So those are significant developments. If you look, though, at what we plan on over the next year, that will turn into full-blown TCA tool. So we already have on EBS, a EBS Quant Analytics, a TCA tool that allows you to look at 3 different ways of executing your foreign exchange. You can look at it in the central order book. You can look at it on our direct streaming platform with your existing liquidity providers or third, you can look at it on direct streaming with an alternative set of liquidity providers. What we're going to be adding to that once we move EBS over to Globex is the ability to look at it in futures equivalent terms as well. 
So we have started to take advantage of, and we have started to provide analytics to our customers that is unique relative to this unique set of assets in order to create new efficiencies, which is really behind everything that we do. But over the next year, we're going to be able to provide much, much more."

What happened in Q2 is that we had a little less in audits in Q2 over the Q1 results. And as we continue to stay on that front, we work with our customers to ensure that they have the right data, the right licenses for their business needs yet as we have audit, that is going to flow up and down depending on where we're at in the process. So it's largely driven with the audit results there. 
In terms of other areas of growth and what's really exciting us about market data, we've made some changes in our non-display policies and pricing. We've got all that cash market data that Sean referenced earlier that is now part of our product portfolio as well as a number of new benchmarks, the indices, et cetera. And so, we're seeing a lot of interest from clients of making sure they're taking advantage of all of those products and services. Our derived business is also performing quite well. 
And the other thing that we've talked about on some past calls, it still is continuing to be very interesting for clients is accessing our data through the cloud. And so, with the Google Cloud platform being launched now, we've added new users. We're now up to 21 global clients that are in production there, and we have nearly 60 more that are in that certification process. 
And so, this is how our clients -- and these are new users to CME data that they like the ability to be able to turn on and off their connectivity and take the data that is most relevant to what they're interested on. 
So we're working to expand that in data products presence really in the cloud later this year. So that is something the team is working on. 
And so, I think it's a lot of additional work being done with Sean's team on the analytics front of saying, what other tools and capabilities can we deploy. We have a lot of very, very valuable data and assets, and that's what we're working to monetize."

If you look overall, I did start talking -- I believe it was the last earnings call, I said I would start talking about crypto differently than I had in the past relative to the growth in volumes and revenues that we've achieved. If you look today, our Bitcoin RPC is $5.45 in the second quarter. We're running around 11,500 contracts ADV. 
Micro Bitcoin, John said it earlier, $1.57. $1.57, obviously, when we initially launched our product, we have significant incentives. As I said earlier, the rack rate fees are half. 
So over time, we typically reduce those incentives. And historically, if you look at whenever we launch a new product, actually, if you look at, for example, our Micro E-minis, those RPCs grow over time. And there, we're doing 23,000 year-to-date. In the second quarter, we did more 25,000 a day. 
So a very -- I think, a huge success there, honestly. Either futures $2.53 and 2,600 contracts a day. So if you look at those RPCs against those average daily volumes, you'll see that we've now grown a substantial business, and we're very pleased with it so far."

We saw the first half of the year with all the disruption in the first half of the year and then significant trade off in the back half of the year. We saw both the significant disruption demand coming from what we actually saw from the demand side of things. And it was a very, very unclear picture for certainly U.S. shale when prices were languishing back half of last year kind of around 45%, which is right at or slightly below breakeven for a lot of the U.S. shale producers. 
What we've seen over the last couple of months now that the OPEC and OPEC Plus agreements have come in, we've actually seen a stabilization of oil prices, exactly what they wanted well above those breakeven levels. 
And what you've actually seen and you've picked up on the comments before, our June WTI volumes are actually up 6% year-on-year. Our July WTI volumes are up 46%. 
What we've actually seen from a volume perspective overall, the market has picked up in the back half of the year. Our market share in volume terms RWTI contract relative to Brent is pretty much stable year-on-year. Where we've seen a real outperformance been in the open interest side of things. 
When you look back to November of last year, we saw the WTI open interest bottom out at about 1.95 million contracts or so. We have now recovered on the WTI side back up to almost 2.5 million contracts. That's sitting close to 3-year highs. We all know that you're bringing in commercial customers, they are the outsized performers on the open interest growth side of that. So we've had a significant return of the commercial participants back into our market over the last couple of months. 
That is what we focus on. 
We focus on the end-user customer needs, we focus on what they are looking to manage their business with, and they're increasingly coming to CME Group. 
What's interesting about that open interest share is typically, and you can go back and look at the numbers, the WTI open interest market share would hover between 42% and 48% when you compare the sum of WTI at CME versus ICE Brent. We're actually sitting at about 50% market share in open interest terms. So we're above almost our historical high point right now. 
So we think the strong fundamentals that we've seen, we've seen gasoline demand reached record high of 10 million barrels per day in the week ended July 2. TSA checkpoint travel numbers are recent the highest levels, red in '21. Just 2 weeks ago, traveler throughput at 2.23 million. So we're seeing the early stages of airline recovery. That has been missing during this whole demand side of the crude oil market. 
Saudi Arabia, UAE came to an agreement in OPEC Plus. So we think there's a little more stability there. That certainly, probably raising some specter, less concern about the 100 calls being in the money over the next couple of months, but it also means that there's greater stability in the shale guys and like where that's going. 
So we're leading that in the open interest participation. We're seeing the work that we're doing to bring new customers into the crude oil market with, as Terry referenced before, the WTI Micro contract, and we're unleashing those customer capital efficiencies across the full range of products. And we're also preparing for the energy transition as we're pushing out our both our global emissions offset contracts and our new nature-based global  offsets contracts as well. 
So not only are we expanding our customer base, we're preparing for energy transition as well. So we feel good about what's going on, fundamentals are strong, open interest is 3-year highs. So we like where we're at."

We released our executive summary this morning, which provided extensive details on the second quarter of 2021. Also as John said, I have John, Sean, Derek, Sunil, and Julie Winkler on the call with us this morning, and we look forward to addressing any questions you have.  
We delivered solid volume during the second quarter of this year, as we average more than 18 million contracts per day. We saw strength on our rates and agricultural businesses relative to Q2 last year. Equities and energy volumes were down, with less volatility in those markets compared to the prior year. 
So far in July, we are up 29% month to date compared to July last year, with particular strength in rates, which has more than doubled compared to a year ago. We have seen a rebound in energy, which is up more than 25% month to date.  
In terms of products, we had a record ADV, or average daily volume, in SOFR futures, total Bitcoin futures and options and copper options in Q2. We had a highly successful launch of our Micro WTI, which was the most successful commodity product launch in the history of CME Group.  
On August 1, we will begin trading nature-based global emission offset contracts. In addition, our new Micro Treasury yield contracts will be available for trading in August.
In the second quarter, non-U.S. ADV was 5.2 million contracts, up 6%. We saw 9% growth in Asia Pacific, 8% in Latin America and 6% in Europe. Across all regions, the growth came from increased rates activity, ag products, FX and metals. This was also supported in how our clients interacted with our digital properties as ags, metals, and FX saw double-digit growth in new users from all regions.  
The main point is we are constantly finding ways to assist our clients with the world's most diverse product offerings across all the critical global asset classes.  
With that short introduction, let me turn the call over to John, who will discuss some of the financial results."

During the second quarter, CME generated almost $1.2 billion in revenue, with average daily volume of more than 18 million contracts. Expenses were very carefully managed and, on an adjusted basis, were $427 million for the quarter and $373 million, excluding license fees.  
CME had an adjusted effective tax rate of 24.1%, which resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.64.  
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $40 million. CME paid out more than $300 million of dividends during the second quarter, and cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.2 billion.  
Turning to guidance. We now expect total adjusted operating expenses for 2021, excluding license fees, to come in at approximately $1.560 billion, that is $15 million below our prior guidance and virtually flat with last year's adjusted expense levels.  
All other guidance remains unchanged. We project CapEx to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million and our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 23.2% and 24.2%. 
Finally, we are on track and have a very good line of sight to achieve our targeted $200 million in cumulative run rate synergies by year-end.

But anyway, the question is how are you building -- is this a broader -- the build-out of Micro going towards retail? Or is it really institutions using the product as well? And is there going to be any other expense or investment to market if it is more oriented towards retail,  Terry?"

But in general, Rich, when we list some of these Micro contracts, we do it for fundamental reasons to address the concerns of the market participants. There's many of times, as you know, that we can look at the Micro equity contracts, and because of the valuation of the certain underlying equities, it made sense for us to go ahead and list smaller contracts, whether it was the E-mini, now down to the Micro. And so that was a driving force for that. And then we look at the demand for other products associated with it.  
On the crypto, you could almost say the same story. With the appreciation in Bitcoin going upwards of 60,000 at one given point, it made sense to have a smaller contract to address and the audience to make sure they can mitigate and manage their risk.  
On the West Texas contract that was just listed, I think that was just a demand from different participants, both on the commercial side and the financial side who want to participate in that market and just a bit of a smaller contract.  
So there's a question is, are we going to invest more in that sector of the business? We will continually look at the needs of the clients and make that decision as it comes. So I don't want to prejudge it and say, yes, but I wouldn't want to rule it out either.  
So I'll let some of my colleagues go ahead and jump in, maybe Mr. Pietrowicz would."

When you look at our Micro products, we've done a few things. One is we really found a position in the market where these really resonate, to Terry's point, in terms of meeting clients' needs.
One of the things we've also done is we've adjusted the pricing on the Micros, as I mentioned last quarter. So when you take a look at the Micro equity products, we saw an increase in the rate per contract from $0.154 to $0.176, up about 14%, which reflects the full quarter impact of the pricing adjustment, plus the launch of our highly successful Micro Bitcoin contract that has an RPC about $1.57 to $1.59. So a huge success there.  
We also saw an increase in the Micro Gold RPC, which went from $0.397 to $0.446 when you look at first quarter versus second quarter for a 12% increase.  
What's very exciting is we have built $100 million a year business so far that didn't exist just a couple of years ago with our Micro product. So it's pretty exciting in terms of addressing a client need and really having the product set, which allows us to offer a wide variety of Micro products."

What's most interesting about this, as Terry said, this is actually a new client acquisition tool for us. This is bringing in customers that would like to participate in our markets and found the institutional size contracts a little bit too big. And the key stat there is that we've got over 2,600 participants in our Micro contract that have never traded any other crude product with CME Group core. So this is functionally and practically brand new business to us in this asset class.  
We're seeing a higher participation percent of non-U.S. participants. About 26% for Micro business is trading from outside the U.S. versus the average of about 20% coming from outside the U.S. on our main contract.  
Open interest has grown. We're seeing steady liquidity participation across the global trading day. 16 liquidity providers have been in there every single day, and they got 6,200 unique users trading the contract and 75 individual unique trading firms.  
So broad participation, global participation, net new client acquisition, really strong start. And so we're excited about what this can mean for the business and what this means for liquidity provision globally."

So yes, we are excited about the initial uptake of new products and services that we're offering across that platform that we have talked about previously. Obviously, larger picture, there is a lot of direct streaming going on in that -- in the cash markets, in general, both in the treasury markets as well as in the foreign exchange markets, and we're investing very heavily there.  
So we -- one of the big investments we're making is in what we call QDM 2.0, a quote-driven markets 2.0. We expect to be -- we are launching that now. We're in the middle of doing that on our FX business. And after we launched that in our FX business, we will be launching it in our treasuries business, and we do expect that to be a state-of-the-art and the best-in-class direct streaming platform, so that should help.  
But even before that, I talked a lot on previous calls about RV trading. RV trading is still getting uptake, and we are excited about the progress so far. So we did $280 million average daily volume in the month of June. Last week, we did $530 million average daily volume. And last Wednesday, we did $1.1 billion. So it is starting to show the results that we had hoped.  
This is in an environment where the bulk of many of our participants, actually, the bulk of our participants do not yet have automated APIs connecting to the functionality. So this is manual users who are taking advantage of it at this point. So we don't have the bulk of the electronic community in there yet.  
We did have a major ISV last week for the first time offer to their customers, testing in the new functionality. So we are very excited to see what that has to offer in the coming months. 
In addition to that, we reduced the 3-year minimum price increments that have a very significant positive impact. If you look at 3-year notes, they went from a typical average daily volume of $10 billion a day to $16 billion a day. So we saw, on a relative basis, relative to the entire platform, a 60% increase in that individual security. So very excited about that.  
There are also other moves that we are taking relative to optimizing commissions and other things that are having a positive impact.  
If you look at the overall industry, while over the previous couple of years, BrokerTec had lost significant market share in the dealer-to-dealer space. If you look at Q2 -- sorry, the fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year and the month of June, we have flattened out that market share level. So if you look at the fourth quarter, we were at 59%; first quarter, we were at 59%; and in June, we were at 58.5%.  
So we are getting traction in the new products and services. It has stabilized the relative share of that platform, and we do expect it to grow further as there's greater uptake in new functionality. Thanks for the question."

The entire team at CME has done an excellent job in managing our costs. With the revised guidance, we're holding expenses virtually flat with last year and just under $80 million below 2019 levels.  
When it comes to the expenses, the second half of the year is traditionally higher than the first half. Marketing and advertising spend tend to occur later in the year, and we also tend to see higher project spending in the second half as well.  
Spending this year reflects the same pattern, but we had anticipated a higher-than-normal spend in the second half of the year when we built out our spending plans.  
During the year, we also chose to delay some of the planned first half spending to the second half of the year, as the environment became clearer. For example, we brought back our employees, and we're seeing some of our clients also return to the office.  
In terms of the type of costs, marketing and advertising reflects just under half the increased spending between the first and second half of the year. We'll be targeting a portion of that spending on our successful Micro products. The balance reflects higher technology spending as we continue to advance the integration of EBS, which also drive higher depreciation. 
And finally, we anticipate contingent labor spending for accelerating some of our projects. As Sean indicated, we are investing in some of the streaming platforms in our cash markets businesses.
So that gives you an idea of the change in first half versus second half. 
And then in terms of realized synergies, we realized approximately $9 million of synergies in our P&L for 2021. And just to finish off on that, we've got a very strong line of sight to achieving our $200 million in run rate synergies by year-end."

I think, as we continue to be in this hybrid environment, our ability to reach our clients digitally to be able to customize more of that experience has been something that we've been pretty focused on over the last 1.5 years as many businesses have.  
And so what's happened is it's far easier for us to reach those global clients than it even was before. So there will be continued investments in those digital properties, that personalization, the education that we do, and that really relates back to the work with our broker partners in the Micro space as well.  
We've been extremely active with them in terms of investing in the educational efforts. As one such example, we've had -- our partners alone have increased over 123% the education of traders in the first half of this year, reaching over 1 million retail traders. And so, that is how we make people continue to be successful in trading in our markets. So we're going to continue to see that investment.  
As Terry pointed out earlier, a lot of this is about understanding client needs. We know that there will be a continued work as we move towards SOFR in that transition.

We're constantly looking at different ways.  
Sean touched on it a little bit earlier with the BrokerTec question. We're going to continue to become more and more efficient as we get offsets against our futures products, which will, again, lend people to adding more open interest. One of your questions was around open interest.  
The EBS integration on to the Globex platform, we're talking about multiple participants who've never traded futures before in FX. We believe we have a good opportunity for them to participate in the FX markets. Another additive into the open interest pool here at CME.  
So some -- a lot of the things that we've done could be very additive, and that doesn't even include the environment that we're all living in, which we know is one of the most riskiest environments this world has ever seen. 
So we feel confident that the open interest can continue to build with the capital efficiencies and some of the acquisitions we did with the cash products and the futures products, along with people needing to manage risk in all of our asset classes."

And I think what's very exciting is we've got a great relationship with IHS Markit. We met with them just a week or so ago, and so I think everybody has a common vision for the joint venture on a strategy, which we think is going to be winning for the clients.  
We've also got a great relationship with S&P Global. One of our -- this will be the second joint venture with them. So we've got -- we're excited about working with them once their merger with IHS Markit has been completed.

We are -- we don't anticipate, from an earnings perspective, any material changes. We do -- you will see some geography changes on our income statement, where revenues and expenses for the contributed companies will be netted into equities and unconsolidated subsidiaries, which is the same location we have the S&P Dow Jones joint venture.

On the rate side, for example, we launched the new TreasuryWatch Tool. TreasuryWatch tool has had now over 8,000 unique users look at it every day. It's certainly where the marketplace goes to look at the U.S. treasury government issuance, the Federal Reserve's purchase of security and as well as the activity in our treasury futures as well as on BrokerTec. 
So that is a tool that has gotten significant traction and we think offers an enormous amount of value to our customers and helps to cross-sell our products from the cash markets to the futures and the futures into cash.  
In addition to that, on the foreign exchange side, we launched 3 new tools last year. We launched our FX Market Profile tool, our FX Swap Rate Monitor, and our FX Options Vol Converter tool. Those tools likewise with several thousand each in terms of unique users. If you look at our FX Market Profile, 863 different companies represented;  FX Swap Rate Monitor, 630 different companies represented.  
So you're seeing an enormous penetration of our customers and potential customers for new client acquisition and cross-selling get value out of these tools. So all those are growing very positively.  
This is just where we have been over the last 12 months, though. If you look at it on a go-forward basis, one of the great value propositions that we have is the ability with the acquisition of our cash markets and with our derivatives markets to combine this data and synchronize this data for the very first time.  
We have seen, as I said earlier, good uptake on our FX Market Profile tool. We are actually just in the process of launching version 2.0 of that, which shows 10 different order levels in terms of the order book. And it really shows participants how not only they need to use both liquidity tools, both futures and spot markets -- cash spot markets in order to optimize their execution in foreign exchange but, in addition to that, much greater depth in how to do that.  
We will be launching, later this summer, the initial treasury market profile tool, which will likewise synchronize, for the first time, our treasury futures data with our treasury cash data.  
So those are significant developments. If you look, though, at what we plan on over the next year, that will turn into full-blown TCA tool. So we already have on EBS Quant Analytics a TCA tool that allows you to look at 3 different ways of executing your foreign exchange. You can look at it in the central limit order book. You can look at it in -- on our direct streaming platform with your existing liquidity providers. Or third, you can look at it on direct streaming with an alternative set of liquidity providers. What we're going to be adding to that, once we move EBS over to Globex, is the ability to look at it in futures equivalent terms as well.  
So we have started to take advantage of, and we have started to provide analytics to our customers that is unique relative to this unique set of assets in order to create new efficiencies, which is really behind everything that we do. But over the next year, we're going to be able to provide much, much more."

We're on track right now to deliver the highest record revenues ever through our CME Direct front end where we embed our QuickStrike analytics. As you know, we've -- we are now publishing 40 CME volatility indices based on the benchmark liquidity in our options business. 
We found this has brought more options customers to us for customers looking to manage specific risk in each individual asset class. Those benchmarks reside at CME Group. So the work we continue to do to build out market-leading analytics in our front end is bringing us new customers, generating new options business, which generates new futures business as well.

And so one of the things that we're seeing is that stabilization across the professional subscribers that are utilizing our real-time market data. And we did capture, in its entirety, that price increase that you mentioned, the $5 per user per DCM. 
What happened in Q2 is that we had a little less in audits in Q2 over the Q1 results. And as we've continued to stay on that front, we work with our customers to ensure that they have the right data, the right licenses for their business needs. Yet as we have audit, that is going to flow up and down, depending on where we're at in the process. So it's largely driven with the audit results there. 
In terms of other areas of growth and what's really exciting us about market data, we've made some changes in our non-display policies and pricing. We've got all that cash market data that Sean referenced earlier that is now part of our product portfolio as well as a number of new benchmarks, the CVOL indices, et cetera. 
And so we're seeing a lot of interest from clients of making sure they're taking advantage of all of those products and services. Our derived business is also performing quite well. 
And the other thing that we've talked about on some past calls, it still is continuing to be very interesting for clients is accessing our data through the cloud. And so with the Google Cloud Platform being launched now, we've added new users. We're now up to 21 global clients that are in production there, and we have nearly 60 more that are in that certification process. 
And so this is how our clients -- and these are new users to CME data that they like the ability to be able to turn on and off their connectivity and take the data that is most relevant to what they're interested on. 
So we're working to expand that in data products presence really in the cloud later this year, so that is something the team is working on. 
And so I think it's a lot of additional work being done with Sean's team on the analytics front of saying, what other tools and capabilities can we deploy. We have a lot of very, very valuable data and assets, and that's what we're working to monetize."

And the reason, again, for launching our Micro Bitcoin was in order to better penetrate a small active trader community. As you'll recall, the Micro Bitcoin 1 50 of the size of the Bitcoin futures and half of the scheduled fees. So that did allow us to deeply penetrate a new community, and we're very excited about that. 
If you look overall, I did start talking -- I believe it was the last earnings call, I said I would start talking about crypto differently than I had in the past relative to the growth in volumes and revenues that we've achieved. If you look today, our Bitcoin RPC is $5.45 in the second quarter. We're running around 11,500 contracts ADV. 
Micro Bitcoin, John said it earlier, $1.57. $1.57, obviously, when we initially launched our product, we have significant incentives. As I said earlier, the rack rate fees are half. 
So over time, we typically reduce those incentives. And historically, if you look at whenever we launch a new product, actually, if you look at, for example, our Micro E-minis, those RPCs grow over time. And there, we're doing 23,000 year-to-date. In the second quarter, we did more like 25,000 a day. 
So a very -- I think, a huge success there, honestly. Either futures at $2.53 and 2,600 contracts a day. So if you look at those RPCs against those average daily volumes, you'll see that we've now grown a substantial business, and we're very pleased with it so far."

That's a good question. I mean, last year was really a tale of 2 different years. We saw the first half of the year with all the disruption in the first half of the year and then significant trail off in the back half of the year. 
We saw both the significant disruption demand coming from what we actually saw from the demand side of things. And it was a very, very unclear picture for certainly U.S. shale when prices were languishing back half of last year kind of around 45%, which is right at or slightly below breakeven for a lot of the U.S. shale producers. 
What we've seen over the last couple of months now that the OPEC and OPEC Plus agreements have come in, we've actually seen a stabilization of oil prices, exactly what they wanted well above those breakeven levels. And what you've actually seen, and you've picked up on the comments before, our June WTI volumes are actually up 6% year-on-year. Our July WTI volumes are up 46%. 
What we've actually seen from a volume perspectives overall, the market has picked up in the back half of the year. Our market share in volume terms of RWTI contract relative to Brent is pretty much stable year-on-year. Where we've seen a real outperformance has been in the open interest side of things. 
When you look back to November of last year, we saw the WTI open interest bottom out at about 1.95 million contracts or so. We have now recovered on the WTI side back up to almost 2.5 million contracts. That's sitting close to 3-year highs. 
We all know when you're bringing in commercial customers, they are the outsized performers on the open interest growth side of that. So we've had a significant return of the commercial participants back into our market over the last couple of months. 
That is what we focus on. We focus on the end-user customer needs. We focus on what they are looking to manage their business with, and they're increasingly coming to CME Group. 
What's interesting about that open interest share is, typically, and you can go back and look at the numbers, the WTI open interest market share would hover between 42% and 48% when you compare the sum of WTI at CME versus ICE Brent. We're actually sitting at about 50% market share in open interest terms. So we're above almost our historical high point right now. 
So we think the strong fundamentals that we've seen, we've seen gasoline demand reached record high of 10 million barrels per day in the week ended July 2. TSA checkpoint travel numbers are recently the highest levels, red in '21. Just 2 weeks ago, traveler throughput at 2.23 million. So we're seeing the early stages of airline recovery. That has been missing during this whole demand side of the crude oil market. 
Saudi Arabia, UAE came to an agreement in OPEC Plus, so we think there's a little more stability there. That certainly, probably, raising some specter of less concern about the 100 calls being in the money over the next couple of months, but it also means that there's greater stability in the shale guys and like where that's going. 
So we're reading that in the open interest participation. We're seeing the work that we're doing to bring new customers into the crude oil market with, as Terry referenced before, the WTI Micro contract. And we're unleashing those customer capital efficiencies across the full range of products. And we're also preparing for the energy transition, as we're pushing out our -- both our global emissions offset contracts and our new nature-based global emissions offsets contracts as well. 
So not only are we expanding our customer base, we're preparing for energy transition as well. So we feel good about what's going on. Fundamentals are strong. Open interest is at 3-year highs. So we like where we're at."

We released our executive summary this morning, which provided extensive details on the second quarter of 2021. Also as John has said, I have John, Sean, Derek, Sunil, and Julie Winkler on the call with us this morning, and we look forward to addressing any questions you have.
We delivered solid volume during the second quarter of this year, as we average more than 18 million contracts per day. We saw strength on our rates and agricultural businesses relative to Q2 last year. Equities and energy volume were down, with less volatility in those markets compared to the prior year. 
So far in July, we are up 29% month to date compared to July last year, with particular strength in rates, which has more than doubled compared to a year ago. We have seen a rebound in energy, which is up more than 25% month to date.
In terms of products, we had a record ADV, or average daily volume, in SOFR futures, total Bitcoin futures and options and copper options in Q2. We had a highly successful launch of our Micro WTI, which was the most successful commodity product launch in the history of CME Group.
On August 1, we will begin trading nature-based global emission offset contracts. In addition, our new Micro Treasury yield contracts will be available for trading in August.
In the second quarter, non-U.S. ADV was 5.2 million contracts, up 6%. We saw 9% growth in Asia Pacific, 8% in Latin America and 6% in Europe. Across all regions, the growth came from increased rates activity, ag products, FX and metals. This was also supported in how our clients interacted with our digital properties as ags, metals, and FX saw double-digit growth in new users from all regions.
The main point is we are constantly finding ways to assist our clients with the world's most diverse product offerings across all the critical global asset classes.
With that short introduction, let me turn the call over to John, who will discuss some of the financial results."

During the second quarter, CME generated almost $1.2 billion in revenue, with average daily volume of more than 18 million contracts. Expenses were very carefully managed and, on an adjusted basis, were $427 million for the quarter and $373 million, excluding license fees.
CME had an adjusted effective tax rate of 24.1%, which resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.64.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $40 million. CME paid out more than $300 million of dividends during the second quarter, and cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.2 billion.
Turning to guidance. We now expect total adjusted operating expenses for 2021, excluding license fees, to come in at approximately $1.560 billion, that is $15 million below our prior guidance and virtually flat with last year's adjusted expense levels.
All other guidance remains unchanged. We project CapEx to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million and our adjusted effective tax rate to be between 23.2% and 24.2%.
Finally, we are on track and have a very good line of sight to achieve our targeted $200 million in cumulative run rate synergies by year-end.

But anyway, the question is how are you building -- does -- is this a broader -- the build-out of Micro going towards retail? Or is it really institutions using the product as well? And is there going to be any other expense or investment to market if it is more oriented towards retail,  Terry?"

But in general, Rich, when we list some of these Micro contracts, we do it for fundamental reasons to address the concerns of the market participants. 
There's many of times, as you know, that we can look at the Micro equity contracts, and because of the valuation of the certain underlying equities, it made sense for us to go ahead and list smaller contracts, whether it was the E-mini, now down to the Micro. And so that was a driving force for that. And then we look at the demand for other products associated with it.
On the crypto, you could almost say the same story. With the appreciation in Bitcoin going upwards of $60,000 at one given point, it made sense to have a smaller contract to address the audience to make sure they can mitigate and manage their risk.
On the West Texas contract that was just listed, I think that was just a demand from different participants, both on the commercial side and the financial side, who want to participate in that market and just a bit of a smaller contract.
So the question is, are we going to invest more in that sector of the business? We will continually look at the needs of the clients and make that decision as it comes. So I don't want to prejudge it and say, yes, but I wouldn't want to rule it out either.
So I'll let some of my colleagues go ahead and jump in, maybe Mr. Pietrowicz would."

When you look at our Micro products, we've done a few things. One is we really found a position in the market where these really resonate, to Terry's point, in terms of meeting clients' needs.
One of the things we've also done is we've adjusted the pricing on the Micros, as I mentioned last quarter. So when you take a look at the Micro equity products, we saw an increase in the rate per contract from $0.154 to $0.176, up about 14%, which reflects the full quarter impact of the pricing adjustment, plus the launch of our highly successful Micro Bitcoin contract that has an RPC about $1.57 to $1.59. So a huge success there. We also saw an increase in the Micro Gold RPC, which went from $0.397 to $0.446 when you look at first quarter versus second quarter for a 12% increase. 
What's very exciting is we have built a $100 million a year business so far that didn't exist just a couple of years ago with our Micro product. So it's pretty exciting in terms of addressing a client need and really having the product set, which allows us to offer a wide variety of Micro products."

What's most interesting about this, as Terry said, this is actually a new client acquisition tool for us. This is bringing in customers that would like to participate in our markets and found the institutional size contracts a little bit too big. And the key stat there is that we've got over 2,600 participants in our Micro contract that have never traded any other crude product with CME Group before. 
So this is functionally and practically brand new business to us in this asset class. We're seeing a higher participation percent of non-U.S. participants. About 26% for Micro business is trading from outside the U.S. versus the average of about 20% coming from outside the U.S. on our main contract.  Open interest has grown. We're seeing steady liquidity participation across the global trading day, 16 liquidity providers have been in there every single day, and they got 6,200 unique users trading the contract and 75 individual unique trading firms.
So broad participation, global participation, net new client acquisition, really strong start. And so we're excited about what this can mean for the business and what this means for liquidity provision globally."

What I'm particularly interested in, now that it's been a few months is, like, any tangible evidence that this has been driving some new revenue opportunities for you?
I think BrokerTec revenues year-over-year were basically flat. Futures revenues and interest rates, obviously up a lot. So question is, is that being driven by anything that you've done for clients? Or is it too early to point to anything?"

So yes, we are excited about the initial uptake of new products and services that we're offering across that platform that we have talked about previously. Obviously, larger picture, there is a lot of direct streaming going on in that -- in the cash markets, in general, both in the treasury markets as well as in the foreign exchange markets, and we're investing very heavily there.
So we -- one of the big investments we're making is in what we call QDM 2.0, or Quote-Driven Markets 2.0. We expect to be -- we are launching that now. We're in the middle of doing that on our FX business. And after we launched that in our FX business, we will be launching it in our treasuries business, and we do expect that to be a state-of-the-art and the best-in-class direct streaming platform, so that should help.
But even before that, I talked a lot on previous calls about RV trading. RV trading is still getting uptake, and we are excited about the progress so far. So it did 280 million average daily volume in the month of June. Last week, we did 530 million average daily volume. And last Wednesday, we did 1.1 billion. So it is starting to show the results that we had hoped.
This is in an environment where the bulk of many of our participants, actually, the bulk of our participants do not yet have automated APIs connecting to the functionality. So this is manual users who are taking advantage of it at this point. So we don't have the bulk of the electronic community in there yet. We did have a major ISV last week for the first time offer to their customers, testing in the new functionality. So we are very excited to see what that has to offer in the coming months.
In addition to that, we reduced the 3-year minimum price increments -- 3-year note minimum price increments that have a very significant positive impact. If you look at 3-year notes, they went from a typical average daily volume of 10 billion a day to 16 billion a day. So we saw, on a relative basis, relative to the entire platform, a 60% increase in that individual security. So very excited about that. 
There are also other moves that we are taking relative to optimizing commissions and other things that are having a positive impact. If you look at the overall industry, while over the previous couple of years, BrokerTec had lost significant market share in the dealer-to-dealer space. If you look at Q2 -- sorry, the fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year and the month of June, we have flattened out that market share level. So if you look at the fourth quarter, we were at 59%; first quarter, we were at 59%; and in June, we were at 58.5%.
So we are getting traction in the new products and services. It has stabilized the relative share of that platform, and we do expect it to grow further as there's greater uptake in new functionality. Thanks for the question."

The entire team at CME has done an excellent job in managing our costs. With the revised guidance, we're holding expenses virtually flat with last year and just under $80 million below 2019 levels.
When it comes to the expenses, the second half of the year is traditionally higher than the first half. Marketing and advertising spend tend to occur later in the year, and we also tend to see higher project spending in the second half as well. Spending this year reflects the same pattern, but we had anticipated a higher-than-normal spend in the second half of the year when we built out our spending plans. During the year, we also chose to delay some of the planned first half spending to the second half of the year, as the environment became clearer. For example, we brought back our employees, and we're seeing some of our clients also return to the office.
In terms of the type of costs, marketing and advertising reflects just under half the increased spending between the first and second half of the year. We'll be targeting a portion of that spending on our successful Micro products. The balance reflects higher technology spending as we continue to advance the integration of EBS, which also drive higher depreciation. 
And finally, we anticipate contingent labor spending for accelerating some of our projects. As Sean indicated, we are investing in some of the streaming platforms in our cash markets businesses. So that gives you an idea of the change in first half versus second half. 
And then in terms of realized synergies, we realized approximately $9 million of synergies in our P&L for 2021. And just to finish off on that, we've got a very strong line of sight to achieving our $200 million in run rate synergies by year-end."

I think, as we continue to be in this hybrid environment, our ability to reach our clients digitally to be able to customize more of that experience has been something that we've been pretty focused on over the last 1.5 years as many businesses have.
And so what's happened is, it's far easier for us to reach those global clients than it even was before. So there will be continued investments in those digital properties, that personalization, the education that we do, and that really relates back to the work with our broker partners in the Micro space as well.
We've been extremely active with them in terms of investing in the educational efforts. As one such example, we've had -- our partners alone have increased over 123% the education of traders in the first half of this year, reaching over 1 million retail traders. And so, that is how we make people continue to be successful in trading in our markets. So we're going to continue to see that investment.

Sean touched on it a little bit earlier with the BrokerTec question. We're going to continue to become more and more efficient as we get offsets against our futures products, which will, again, lend people to adding more open interest. One of your questions was around open interest.  
The EBS integration on to the Globex platform, we're talking about multiple participants who've never traded futures before in FX. We believe we have a good opportunity for them to participate in the FX markets, another additive into the open interest pool here at CME. So some -- a lot of the things that we've done could be very additive, and that doesn't even include the environment that we're all living in, which we know is one of the most riskiest environments this world has ever seen.
So we feel confident that the open interest can continue to build with the capital efficiencies and some of the acquisitions we did with the cash products and the futures products, along with people needing to manage risk in all of our asset classes."

We're making excellent progress on the formation of the joint venture.

In terms of the approvals, we continue to move through the regulatory approval process. We've received all antitrust approvals, and we are waiting on one financial regulatory approval. So we are really poised to launch this joint venture. And I think what's very exciting is we've got a great relationship with IHS Markit. We met with them just a week or so ago, and so I think everybody has a common vision for the joint venture on a strategy, which we think should be winning for the clients.
We've also got a great relationship with S&P Global. One of our -- this will be the second joint venture with them. So we've got -- we're excited about working with them once their merger with IHS Markit has been completed.
In terms of the financial implications, we'll provide an update in terms of the financial implications, once the joint venture gets launched. We are -- we don't anticipate, from an earnings perspective, any material changes. We do -- you will see some geography changes on our income statement, where revenues and expenses for the contributed companies will be netted into equities and unconsolidated subsidiaries, which is the same location we have the S&P Dow Jones joint venture.
So really excited about the joint venture, what it could mean for the marketplace. We'll be the leading provider of risk mitigation and post-trade services. And very -- I think we're going to be very well positioned to accelerate the earnings on that business."

We are very excited about the new analytical tools that we have launched, in particular over the last year or so. On the rate side, for example, we launched the new TreasuryWatch Tool. TreasuryWatch tool has had now over 8,000",585,"Sure. This is Sean talking. We are very excited about the new analytical tools that we have launched, in particular over the last year or so. On the rate side, for example, we launched the new TreasuryWatch Tool. TreasuryWatch tool has had now over 8,000 unique users look at it every day. It's certainly where the marketplace goes to look at the U.S. treasury government issuance, the Federal Reserve's purchase of security and as well as the activity in our treasury futures as well as on BrokerTec. So that is a tool that has gotten significant traction and we think offers an enormous amount of value to our customers and helps to cross-sell our products from the cash markets to the futures and the futures into cash.  
In addition to that, on the foreign exchange side, we launched 3 new tools last year. We launched our FX Market Profile tool, our FX Swap Rate Monitor, and our FX Options Vol Converter tool. Those tools likewise with several thousand each in terms of unique users. If you look at our FX Market Profile, 863 different companies represented;  FX Swap Rate Monitor, 630 different companies represented. So you're seeing an enormous penetration of our customers and potential customers for new client acquisition and cross-selling get value out of these tools. So all those are growing very positively.  
This is just where we have been over the last 12 months, though. If you look at it on a go-forward basis, one of the great value propositions that we have is the ability with the acquisition of our cash markets and with our derivatives markets to combine this data and synchronize this data for the very first time.
We have seen, as I said earlier, good uptake on our FX Market Profile tool. We are actually just in the process of launching version 2.0 of that, which shows 10 different order levels in terms of the order book. And it really shows participants how, not only they need to use both liquidity tools, both futures and spot markets -- cash spot markets in order to optimize their execution in foreign exchange, but in addition to that, much greater depth in how to do that. We will be launching, later this summer, the initial treasury market profile tool, which will likewise synchronize, for the first time, our treasury futures data with our treasury cash data.  
So those are significant developments. If you look, though, at what we plan on over the next year, that will turn into full-blown TCA tool. So we already have on EBS, a -- the EBS Quant Analytics, a TCA tool that allows you to look at 3 different ways of executing your foreign exchange. You can look at it in the central limit order book. You can look at it in -- on our direct streaming platform with your existing liquidity providers. Or third, you can look at it on direct streaming with an alternative set of liquidity providers. What we're going to be adding to that, once we move EBS over to Globex, is the ability to look at it in futures equivalent terms as well.  
So we have started to take advantage of, and we have started to provide analytics to our customers that is unique -- relative to this unique set of assets in order to create new efficiencies, which is really behind everything that we do. But over the next year, we're going to be able to provide much, much more."

As you know, we've -- we are now publishing 40 CME volatility indices based on the benchmark liquidity in our options business. We found this has brought more options customers to us for customers looking to manage specific risk in each individual asset class. Those benchmarks reside at CME Group. So the work we continue to do to build out market-leading analytics in our front end is bringing us new customers, generating new options business, which generates new futures business as well.

And so one of the things that we're seeing is that stabilization across the professional subscribers that are utilizing our real-time market data. And we did capture, in its entirety, that price increase that you mentioned, the $5 per user per DCM. 
What happened in Q2 is that we had a little less in audits in Q2 over the Q1 results. And as we've continued to stay on that front, we work with our customers to ensure that they have the right data, the right licenses for their business needs. Yet as we have audit, that is going to flow up and down, depending on where we're at in the process. So it's largely driven with the audit results there. 
In terms of other areas of growth and what's really exciting us about market data, we've made some changes in our non-display policies and pricing. We've got all that cash market data that Sean referenced earlier that is now part of our product portfolio as well as a number of new benchmarks, the CVOL indices, et cetera. And so we're seeing a lot of interest from clients of making sure they're taking advantage of all of those products and services. Our derived business is also performing quite well. 
And the other thing that we've talked about on some past calls, it still is continuing to be very interesting for clients is accessing our data through the cloud. And so with the Google Cloud Platform being launched now, we've added new users. We're now up to 21 global clients that are in production there, and we have nearly 60 more that are in that certification process. And so this is how our clients -- and these are new users to CME data, that they like the ability to be able to turn on and off their connectivity and take the data that is most relevant to what they're interested on. 
So we're working to expand that and data products presence really in the cloud later this year, so that is something the team is working on. And so I think it's a lot of additional work being done with Sean's team on the analytics front of saying, what other tools and capabilities can we deploy. We have a lot of very, very valuable data and assets, and that's what we're working to monetize."

As you'll recall, the Micro Bitcoin, 1/50 of the size of the Bitcoin futures and half of the scheduled fees. So that did allow us to deeply penetrate a new community, and we're very excited about that. 
If you look overall, I did start talking -- I believe it was the last earnings call, I said I would start talking about crypto differently than I had in the past, relative to the growth in volumes and revenues that we've achieved. If you look today, our Bitcoin RPC is $5.45 in the second quarter. We're running around 11,500 contracts ADV. Micro Bitcoin, John said it earlier, $1.57. $1.57, obviously, when we initially launched our product, we have significant incentives. As I said earlier, the rack rate fees are half.
So over time, we typically reduce those incentives. And historically, if you look at whenever we launch a new product -- actually, if you look at, for example, our Micro E-minis, those RPCs grow over time. And there, we're doing 23,000 year-to-date. In the second quarter, we did more like 25,000 a day. So a very -- I think, a huge success there, honestly. Either futures at $2.53 and 2,600 contracts a day. So if you look at those RPCs against those average daily volumes, you'll see that we've now grown a substantial business, and we're very pleased with it so far."

That's a good question. I mean, last year was really a tale of 2 different years. We saw the first half of the year with all the disruption in the first half of the year and then significant trail off in the back half of the year. We saw both the significant disruption demand coming from what we actually saw from the demand side of things. And it was a very, very unclear picture for certainly, U.S. shale when prices were languishing back half of last year kind of around 45%, which is right at or slightly below breakeven for a lot of the U.S. shale producers. 
What we've seen over the last couple of months now that the OPEC and OPEC+ agreements have come in, we've actually seen a stabilization of oil prices, exactly what they wanted, well above those breakeven levels. And what you've actually seen, and you've picked up on the comments before, our June WTI volumes are actually up 6% year-on-year. Our July WTI volumes are up 46%. 
What we've actually seen from a volume perspectives overall, the market has picked up in the back half of the year. Our market share in volume terms of our WTI contract relative to Brent is pretty much stable year-on-year. Where we've seen a real outperformance has been in the open interest side of things. When you look back to November of last year, we saw the WTI open interest bottom out at about 1.95 million contracts or so. We have now recovered on the WTI side back up to almost 2.5 million contracts. That's sitting close to 3-year highs. 
We all know when you're bringing in commercial customers, they are the outsized performers on the open interest growth side of that. So we've had a significant return of the commercial participants back into our market over the last couple of months. That is what we focus on. We focus on the end-user customer needs. We focus on what they are looking to manage their business with, and they're increasingly coming to CME Group. 
What's interesting about that open interest share is, typically, and you can go back and look at the numbers, the WTI open interest market share would hover between 42% and 48% when you compare the sum of WTI at CME versus ICE Brent. We're actually sitting at about 50% market share in open interest terms. So we're above almost our historical high point right now. 
So we think the strong fundamentals that we've seen, we've seen gasoline demand reached record high of 10 million barrels per day in the week ended July 2; TSA checkpoint travel numbers are reaching the highest levels read in '21. Just 2 weeks ago, traveler throughput at 2.23 million. So we're seeing the early stages of airline recovery. That has been missing during this whole demand side of the crude oil market. 
Saudi Arabia, UAE came to an agreement in OPEC+, so we think there's a little more stability there. That certainly, probably, raising some specter of less concern about the 100 calls being in the money over the next couple of months, but it also means that there's greater stability in the shale gas and like where that's going. 
So we're reading that in the open interest participation. We're seeing the work that we're doing to bring new customers into the crude oil market with, as Terry referenced before, the WTI Micro contract. And we're unleashing those customer capital efficiencies across the full range of products. And we're also preparing for the energy transition, as we're pushing out our -- both our global emissions offset contracts and our new nature-based global emissions offsets contracts as well. 
So not only are we expanding our customer base, we're preparing for energy transition as well. So we feel good about what's going on. Fundamentals are strong. Open interest is at 3-year highs. So we like where we're at."

We released our executive summary, as John said, which provided extensive details on the third quarter of 2021. I have John, Sean, Derek Sunil, Julie Winkler on the call this morning, and we all look forward to addressing any questions you have. 
Before I begin, in addition to John, who will discuss the financial results, I'm going to have Sean and Derek to make some comments. With all the recent news associated with interest rates and energy, I thought it was important that they present this morning. 
With that, we delivered solid volume during the third quarter of this year as we averaged 17.8 million contracts per day, which was up 14% versus third quarter last year. We saw year-over-year strength in our interest rates and energy businesses and saw significant options growth of 45% during Q3. Rates average daily volume rose 53%, including 78% growth in Eurodollars and 41% growth in treasuries, as the expectations of future rate hikes has increased. 
We continue to launch innovative new products, tools and services to support customer needs, including additions to our suite of micro-sized contracts that allow market users to customize their trading and hedging as well as ESG-focused futures contracts that help manage climate-related risk. 
In terms of specific products and services, we had 2 consecutive quarterly ADV records and so for futures in Q2 and Q3 as the market continues to manage their interest rate risk ahead of key transition deadlines. Bitcoin futures, ADV increased 170% compared with the third quarter last year. Ether futures are also off to a good start since their launch in the first quarter this year. In September, we launched the derivatives industry's first-ever sustainable clearing service to help market participants track and report on how their hedging activities are advancing their sustainable goals. 
Finally, Micro WTI and Micro Treasury yield contracts began trading in July and August, respectively. The Micro WTI contract represents the most successful commodity product launch in our history with over 1 million contracts traded within the first 20 days and a total of 4.3 million contracts traded since July 12 launch. Most importantly, this innovative new contract is attracting new customers to our energy market as evidenced by the fact that almost 10,000 Micro WTI market participants have not traded any other CME Group crude oil product in 2021. You'll hear more about this in a moment from both Derek and Sean, respectively. 
In the third quarter, non-U.S. ADV was up 13% to 5 million contracts per day. We saw 15% growth in Europe, 8% growth in Asia, 32% growth in Latin America and 10% growth in the U.S. Also during the quarter, we completed our joint venture with IHS Markit and, together, launched, OSTTRA, a leading provider of progressive post-trade solutions for the global OTC market across interest rates, equities, FX and credit asset classes. 
Turning to Q4. We have had a strong start so far in October, averaging more than 20 million contracts, which is an increase of 35% month-to-date compared to the same point in October last year. Interest rates in energy are up double digits with rates up 90%. With that, let me turn it over to Sean to give you more flavor as it relates to interest rates."
2004577,1680818015,2413941,"CME Group Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Terry.

As Terry said, the financials unit saw a number of significant developments in the third quarter, particularly regarding SOFR, the overall rates market and our crypto business. Our silver futures saw average daily volume grow to 124,000 contracts per day in the third quarter up over 180% year-over-year, and our open interest grew to over 1 million contracts, up 140% year-over-year. Additionally, in the month of October, we're seeing average daily volume of 227,000 SOFR futures contracts and open interest of 1.2 million contracts. Over the last 60 days, our SOFR futures ADV made up over 78% of the global SOFR futures volumes and our open interest represents approximately 95%. 
Further, on July 29, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee of the Federal Reserve endorsed CME's 1-month, 3-month and 6-month term SOFR rates. And on September 19, CME began publishing a 12-month term SOFR rate as well. Demand for access to our term SOFR rate is very high, as we have already executed more than 100 term SOFR licenses to market participants, and we are currently working with an additional 300 firms who are also interested in licensing. 
Our fallbacks for Eurodollar futures and options have also been a very strong success since we finalized our rule book back on March 29. SOFR-linked open interest includes SOFR futures as well as Eurodollar futures and options that reference a LIBOR rate which will be set after June 30, 2023. Those contracts have grown from 11.8 million open interest on March 29, to 16.3 million open interest as of October 25, up 38%. Further, the average daily volume of our SOFR-linked futures and options in Q3 was 1.6 million contract, representing 52% of CME's total short-term interest rate ADV. 
In addition, our long-held view regarding the rates market environment continues to gain [ veracity ]. Using CME's FedWatch tool, we can see the market is now pricing in a 60% chance of tightening by June 2022, up from just 17% just 1 month ago. Our FedWatch tool also now indicates an 87% chance of at least 2 Fed tightenings by the December 2022 [ FMC ] meeting. 
In Q3, the improving rates environment, as Terry said, led to a 53% growth in our interest rates ADV versus third quarter of 2020. Nonetheless, rate volatility, while higher in the third quarter of 2021 than it was in recent quarters, remained historically quite low. For example, in the eighth quarterly Eurodollar futures, it achieved just the 37th percentile of volatility versus a history going back to 2007. And our 10-year note futures achieved only a 25th percentile volatility rank showing the current volatility even in Q3 was very low. 
Regarding CME Group's crypto offering, first, let me say, the recent approval of ETFs based on CME Bitcoin futures is not only an important milestone for our future contracts but also a positive development for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. This is a direct reflection of the strong growth and client demand for exposure to Bitcoin via CME's transparent, deeply liquid and regulated cryptocurrency futures contracts. The launch of ETFs based on CME's Bitcoin futures is validation from the industry of what we've known for some time, that CME Bitcoin futures are the leading source of Bitcoin price discovery in the industry. 
Two new Bitcoin ETFs were launched just last week and another this morning, both of which are based -- or all 3 of which are based on CME's Bitcoin futures. On the back of those launches, our Bitcoin futures, October ADV has risen to over 12,000 contracts or over 60,000 equivalent Bitcoin worth a record $3.5 billion per day, up 57% over September. Additionally, average open interest in our Bitcoin futures has grown to a record 17,433 contracts, up 70% versus September. Our Micro Bitcoin futures volume is also up 33% month-over-month, and our average open interest is up 97% month-over-month. With that, I'll turn it over to Derek."

As Terry mentioned at the top of the call, we have seen a strong return of activity in our global energy business in the second half of this year with both crude oil and natural gas prices hitting multiyear highs. Overall, this has helped our global energy business to deliver average daily volume growth of 18% in the third quarter, led by energy options up 26% year-on-year. WTI futures reached the $84 a barrel mark earlier this month for the first time since 2014, as OPEC maintained caution on production increases and as U.S. shale steadily recovers from the 2020 decline. Prices were further boosted from returning global demand as economies reopen. 
In the U.S., gasoline consumption reached 10 million barrels a day in July, marking an all-time monthly high. Activity in WTI crude oil futures saw a 26% jump in average daily volume in the third quarter to 990,000 contracts; the WTI options average daily volume jumping 45%, 129,000 contracts. This helped us to deliver strong daily volume growth in our refined products portfolio as well with a gasoline product volume of 20% to 196,000 contracts and our heating oil products daily trading volume up 10% to 154,000 contracts. 
This has helped set the stage for the significant success that we've delivered with our Micro WTI futures contract. Launched on July 12 of this year, as Terry mentioned, we surpassed 1 million contracts traded in the first 20 trading days, and we've already traded more than 4.3 million contracts since launch. Most importantly, this innovative new contract is attracting brand-new global customers to our energy market as evidenced by the fact that almost 10,000 Micro WTI customers have not traded any other CME Group crude oil product in 2021. These new customers come from 118 different countries and represent over 50% of our Micro WTI customer base. So this has been a significant source of new client acquisition for us. 
At the same time, we have also seen the natural gas market experience the highest price level in over 13 years with U.S. Henry Hub futures hitting a high price of $6.45 earlier this month, more than tripling in price from the COVID-driven March 2020 lows. The resulting increase in volatility has boosted our Henry Hub futures business with September average daily volume of 496,000 contracts, up 11% year-on-year. Henry Hub options were particularly strong in the third quarter with average daily volume up 18% to 124,000 contracts, achieving our best months of August and September ever. 
Participation has been strong from our commercial customers, and we've seen our natural gas futures and options open interest jump to 6.2 million contracts in September, which is the highest level we've seen since January [ 2018 ]. 
So overall, we're seeing that the investments we're making in our product portfolio, our global client development and our technology pay strong dividends as market volatility returns as our customer base manages their energy risk and CME Group's global benchmark products. With that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the financial results."

During the third quarter, CME generated more than $1.1 billion in revenue with average daily volume up 14% compared to the same period last year. Expenses were very carefully managed and, on an adjusted basis, were $412 million for the quarter and $355 million, excluding license fees. CME had an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.3%, which resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, up 16% from the third quarter last year. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $33 million. CME paid out more than $300 million of dividends during the third quarter and cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion. At the start of September, CME and IHS Markit launched OSTTRA, our post-trade services joint venture. As a result, CME will no longer be recording revenue and expenses associated with our post-trade businesses but will be recording our share of the joint venture earnings in the equity and net earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries line out of our income statement. 
For the month of September, CME would have recorded approximately $22 million in revenue and $11 million in expenses but instead recorded approximately $8 million in our share of the adjusted earnings of the joint venture. When you take into consideration tax implications and providing support services for the joint venture, there was essentially no impact to our overall earnings. 
Turning to guidance. We now expect total adjusted operating expenses for 2021 excluding license fees and reflecting the impact of our joint venture to come in at approximately $1.5 billion, down about $30 million from our guidance at the start of the year. All other guidance remains unchanged. 
Finally, we are very pleased to say we achieved our planned $200 million in cumulative run rate expense synergies related to the NEX acquisition this quarter. Please refer to the last page of our executive commentary for additional financial highlights and details.

But the ETF, as Sean stated in his comments, I think are very exciting for -- to be based off of CME futures. I think that in and of itself lends to the credibility of our product as a listed futures exchange and the regulation thereof. 
To get more directly to your question around position limits associated with it, they are an important component to any market when you have a highly regulated entity like CME. So the existing position limits in our Bitcoin futures today, as you may or may not know, is 2,000 for spot. And then we have accountability levels going back into deferred months that are much larger than that. But the spot month will go to 4,000 in November, and we feel very confident from a risk perspective that we are not being reckless in any which way, shape or form that this has been vetted to our entire team here and with the agency. 
So we've filed for those changes. We're confident that the product is mature enough now to increase the size of the limit. So again, we'll be careful here, Rich. This product, we launched in 2017, not 1917. So this is a newer product, a newer asset class, and we will be very, very cautious here. But again, we're excited by the uptake and the credibility associated with power shares and some of the other ETFs that decided to benchmark against our futures contract."

So in terms of our expense guidance, we did reduce our expense guidance after you adjust for the  OSTTRA joint venture by an additional $15 million. So we're about $30 million down from our original guidance at t",659,"Yes. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate the question. So in terms of our expense guidance, we did reduce our expense guidance after you adjust for the  OSTTRA joint venture by an additional $15 million. So we're about $30 million down from our original guidance at the start of the year. 
When you think about what we've done on the expense side, this entire CME team has done an excellent job managing our costs. We continue to have that as a strong focus. And to put kind of our expense management into perspective, after adjusting for the creation of OSTTRA, we're about $12 million down from last year's adjusted expenses and almost $100 million down below 2019 levels. 
When you look at our reduction of the $15 million, about half of that reduction reflects lower expected travel and in-person events. As you recall, at the beginning of the year, we had about $20 million we put in the back half of the year, assuming that we would be able to have additional travel. But as you can see, there's still limitations on travel, especially international travel. We have been seeing additional pickup in meetings, especially in Europe and London, in particular, but still international travel is still a little bit tough. And the balance is really -- of our reduction in terms of our guidance is just excellent continued expense controls by the entire team, including careful hiring and careful use of contingent labor. 
When you take a look at 2020's fourth quarter and 2021's fourth quarter, we do see a pickup in costs. The fourth quarter is traditionally our highest expense quarter. Historically, marketing and advertising spend tend to be highest in the fourth quarter along with higher project spending as we wind up the current year and prepare for the next year. The spending this year reflects that same pattern, and we anticipated a higher-than-normal proportion of spend when we built out our spending plans at the start of the year. 
We expect higher levels of spend in marketing and advertising, including targeting a portion of that spend on our successful micro products and in anticipation of a more open operating environment in 2022. We're also investing in system projects, including the migration of EBS and streaming services, which would lead to more technology-related costs. 
Also, our incentive compensation is anticipated to be higher in the fourth quarter of this year than the fourth quarter of last year. So those are some of the items which are are causing the fourth quarter this year to be higher than the fourth quarter last year. But overall, for the entire year, some really impressive expense controls by the entire organization. 
So in terms of thinking about modeling for next year, we're going through the budgeting process now. So it's really too early to provide guidance. We are hopeful for a more normalized environment, which would be positive for our business. 
When looking at 2022, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. We did postpone salary increases in 2021 and for our staff, and we don't anticipate doing the same this year for 2021 -- I mean, sorry, for 2022. Also in an open business environment, which is obviously extremely fluid, we would anticipate increased travel, both regionally and globally, and more in-person events, which we would view as positive from a business perspective. But again, in November, it's a little tough to see that in 2022 yet. So we'll provide some additional guidance when we do our earnings in February. We are starting to see some of that open up, like I mentioned before, in Europe. 
We'll continue to invest in our systems and technology capabilities with an eye towards accelerating growth globally. It is our intention that we will continue our excellent expense management as we build out our plans for next year. So that should give you a little bit of a flavor in terms of 2022."

And the price increase that we saw $5 per user has been realized.

So Sean had mentioned, too, at the beginning of the call, right, a lot of the focus for the team. Particularly, the data sales team has been on the term SOFR rate.

We're going through a massive transition, as Sean pointed out earlier, from LIBOR to something else we suspect as SOFR, and people are trying to adjust associated with that. We're also seeing the low vol still that's -- even though we've seen an uptick in some of the things that you're referencing, the volatility is still significantly lower not only in interest rates but FX. I'm talking from a historical standpoint. 
That is changing. You're correct in your comments. The question is when does it reflect an open interest. We believe there is open -- the participants are in there, participating. But you got to remember, our open interest today is a little bit different than it was just a couple of years ago. We didn't have weekly options on a lot of these products. We didn't have some of the expirations constantly coming on and off. So people are taking exposures for projected periods of time. Might be days versus quarters like that it was historically. So we're seeing people manage their risk in a little bit different way, and I think that's reflective of the open interest as well. 
So I think those are all a lot of factors going into it, fundamental being the main one, but a lot of it is some of the products, the way we offer people to manage risk right now, which I don't see that as a bad problem. I see that as a good problem because open interest, we don't get paid for. We get paid for transactions. And the way we're structuring it now, I think that's a much more powerful offering. 
But the open interest is a reflection of future trade. We've always said that the people, and we still believe in that. But at the same time, we're seeing people participate in the market because of what I just outlined a moment ago with options and other products to transition from 1 rate to another, the fundamentals and foreign exchange being extremely quiet. And we're also seeing massive directional changes in energy. As Derek pointed out earlier, we went from just 1.5 years ago to minus $37.50 to $84 a barrel. So you think about the massive directional participation in the marketplace has been truly one way, and a lot of people just don't believe that you can go from minus $37 a barrel to $84 a barrel in 1.5 years. 
So I think it's just an adjustment to the world that we live in today and people will, again, participate and holding more and more open into. But right now, I don't see it as a bad problem because of what we -- what I just outlined. And I'll ask Sean to comment more."

In addition to that, another number we track very closely is the number of large open interest holders as reported by the CFTC. If you look at the second quarter of this year, and if you look across the financials products, rates, equities and foreign exchange, the average large open interest holder number across the second quarter was an all-time record high for the combined 3 asset costs. 
If you look at the third quarter, we beat the second quarter. So I've had 2 back-to-back all-time record numbers of large open interest holders on average. If you look at our interest rates business, the most recent numbers from the CFTC indicate the rates business is just 1% below its all-time high and large open interest holders, and the foreign exchange business similarly is just a couple of percentage points below its all-time high.

So in terms of revenue, legacy [Audio Gap] back for the month of -- for September. Now looking at the expense level, the expense levels have been very constant in the $11 million range. So there's very little in the way of volatility over the last several quarters. So $11 million per month is a good run rate. 
And then when you look at the revenue, it -- if you looked at it for a full quarter, if you took the $22 million multiply it by 3 to give yourself a quarterly -- quarterly amount of $66 million. If you look over the last several quarters, the revenue has been in the $64 million to $66 million range per quarter.

And as Sean touched on, what I think is really important to highlight, is derivatory aspect of CME's business, especially its crypto offering. You can imagine there's many people that are now more and more every day looking for some form of exposure as cryptos are becoming more and more acceptable. The -- maybe the problem with that would be also the appreciation of the price of the product. People are maybe a little bit more concerned about where they go to get that risk, and they want to make sure they're at a regulated platform.

Right now with huge growth in our SOFR futures and, as I said, we're also seeing enormous growth in our Eurodollar futures and option, so we're seeing both marketplaces grow in parallel side by side. So that's actually a very exciting development. As you go into the next couple of years, that will also increase, and we expect to see an increase in the spread trading between the Eurodollars and the SOFR futures. 
In addition to that, you may recall we launched BSBY future, not too long ago, where we're also doing about 70,000 contracts a day depending upon the time frame. So the transition of the short-term interest rate business to a new rate, whether it is the BSBY or the term SOFR or SOFR is actually a very positive thing in regards to the intercommodity trading between -- or the spread trading between the different instruments. So that's actually a very positive development. I also remarked earlier that we've seen enormous growth in the SOFR-linked products, again, with an ADV of more than 1.6 million contracts a day in the third quarter. So that's growing very strongly. 
In terms of incentives, yes, we have had incentives, as anyone who follows us closely knows, whenever we start a market. And so we have had significant incentives in our SOFR futures over the recent quarters. The good news there is that means that that's already priced into our revenues to a large extent. So we will expect to continue those incentives for a period of time. But as you can imagine, as we have with all of our products, you know the history, I'm sure, of our Bitcoin futures and how we've reduced incentives there, our Micro E-minis and how we reduced incentives there and how those RPCs grew pretty dramatically once those marketplaces got up and running. 
So we would expect that as we get greater adoption of SOFR relative to Eurodollars, that the incentives in SOFR would decline on a relative basis. So again, we're already spending a lot of money on incentives. That's already baked in, in the last 12 months. And yes, we will continue to have some incentive spend, but I don't expect any kind of a significant increase."

In terms of fees, Sean's right, we do have some market maker programs in place. It's embedded in the revenue that we've got right now. Over time, we would view SOFR being treated just like the rest of our short-term interest rate products. So I don't see there being any unusual headwinds because of SOFR versus any of our other short-term incentive products.

We're talking about just a couple of years we're going to convert trillions of dollars of assets benchmarked to LIBOR into something else, which we believe we're in the strongest position of anybody to capture that risk offset. And that is with the products that Sean outlined. 
Now that will not be just a measure of open interest. It will be a measure of many things as we go through this transition. To me, this might be the most exciting time in the history of interest rate trading that I've ever seen in my 41 years here at the CME. So to me, I'm very optimistic about it, but I will not judge it on open interest alone. I won't judge it on one particular issue alone. There's many factors that are going to go into this. And Sean outlined some of the things that we have right now, not only on incentives, but with the BSBY product with Bloomberg, with the short-term SOFR rate and with the SOFR futures and options, we think we're in a really strong position.

So still a very -- we're on path for a very strong year in retail. It's looking to be the second highest revenue year on record for us.

And performance was a bit subdued through some of the quarter until volatility started to pick up a little bit in kind of mid-September. And since then, we've definitely seen further uptick in the business. 
But it kind of also speaks to just the diversity of our suite, right? So the retail adoption of things like our agricultural products has never been stronger than what we've seen this year. So ag revenue for retail in APAC was up 86%, North American, up 30%. So overall participation to this is very, very strong. We're on pace to about 375,000 traders in our markets this year, likely only surpassed by where we ended last year, which was a record year.

We've brought on 134,000 new retail traders and really looking -- specifically, when we looked at June, July and August, in 2021, we outpaced those levels that we saw in 2020 during those exact same months. How we're doing that continues to be the same thing that we've talked about before. It's really about driving that retail traffic to our digital properties there. We saw that activity more than double from where we were last year. And also just the interest in our educational materials, we've had about 1 million retail traders visit those properties through Q3, which is great. 
And our partnership, those global broker partners that we have the educational, the outreach efforts that they make a huge part of this. In Asia alone, our broker partners have reached about 1.7 million active traders year-to-date. And we've seen our digital educational events activities up over 178%.

So I think probably the easiest way to start in our material that we precirculated on Slide 4, you'll notice some very detailed comments about some of the products that we've launched and what those mean to our fr",506,"Yes. So appreciate the question, Michael. So I think probably the easiest way to start in our material that we precirculated on Slide 4, you'll notice some very detailed comments about some of the products that we've launched and what those mean to our franchise, specifically on the environmental product side. As you know, we've launched in August, our nature-based GEO contracts, the GEOs, the global emissions offset contracts, that complements the GEO contracts we launched earlier this year. And we continue to see significant traction there, not just in terms of the traded volumes but, more importantly, the open interest that we're accruing and then the deliveries that we're seeing of these contracts as well. 
So since launch, we've actually now seen a peak -- we hit a peak open interest record of just over 10,000 contracts on December 21. We hit a new record just on Friday. And what's important about that is while these contracts are now seen record open interest terms, we're also seeing record amounts of physical deliveries of these offset certificates as well. So we now facilitated the physical delivery of 146,000 offset credits across 4 separate delivery cycles. And just to put that into context for what that means for customers that are taking delivery of these certificates, that's the equivalent of 146 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. So this is a market that started really about 2 years ago. We partnered exclusively, as we shared with you on previous calls, with CBL expanse of the largest spot platform in the voluntary offset market in the carbon markets. And we now are delivering record amounts of volume through the platform and delivery of these certificates through for delivery cycles. We'll have another 1 this week. 
So this is a new market. We just launched our nature-based contracts in August of this year. So that's pretty significant traction early on. There is a lot that's expected out of this conference in Glasgow, COP26. And as we continue to work with the markets and connect where we are now on the global basis of where these kind of go, it's a complement to the work that we've already done and continue to do on the equity side where we host the world's largest ESG contract by nominal value, our S&P 500 ESG Index futures, which has seen open interest above $4 billion notional value which is pretty significant. 
So when you look at the space, whether it's on the environmental product side, the traction that we're seeing in a market that we are at the cutting edge of developing on the voluntary carbon market side or how we're servicing the needs of customers that are looking for ESG-compliant investment vehicles, we're leaders in both of those spaces. So we're happy with our positioning. We feel like we've chosen good partners. And I think the market, as it adapts to a new world of carbon neutrality, we feel like we're in a strong position there with the success we've already had."

We released our executive summary, as John said, which provided extensive details on the third quarter of 2021. I have John, Sean, Derek Sunil, Julie Winkler on the call this morning, and we all look forward to addressing any questions you have. 
Before I begin, in addition to John, who will discuss the financial results, I'm going to have Sean and Derek to make some comments. With all the recent news associated with interest rates and energy, I thought it was important that they present this morning. 
With that, we delivered solid volume during the third quarter of this year as we averaged 17.8 million contracts per day, which was up 14% versus third quarter last year. We saw year-over-year strength in our interest rates and energy businesses and saw significant options growth of 45% during Q3. Rates average daily volume rose 53%, including 78% growth in Eurodollars and 41% growth in treasuries, as the expectations of future rate hikes has increased. 
We continue to launch innovative new products, tools and services to support customer needs, including additions to our suite of micro-sized contracts that allow market users to customize their trading and hedging as well as ESG-focused futures contracts that help manage climate-related risk. 
In terms of specific products and services, we had 2 consecutive quarterly ADV records and so for futures in Q2 and Q3 as the market continues to manage their interest rate risk ahead of key transition deadlines. Bitcoin futures, ADV increased 170% compared with the third quarter last year. Ether futures are also off to a good start since their launch in the first quarter this year. In September, we launched the derivatives industry's first-ever sustainable clearing service to help market participants track and report on how their hedging activities are advancing their sustainable goals. 
Finally, Micro WTI and Micro Treasury yield contracts began trading in July and August, respectively. The Micro WTI contract represents the most successful commodity product launch in our history with over 1 million contracts traded within the first 20 days and a total of 4.3 million contracts traded since July 12 launch. Most importantly, this innovative new contract is attracting new customers to our energy market as evidenced by the fact that almost 10,000 Micro WTI market participants have not traded any other CME Group crude oil product in 2021. You'll hear more about this in a moment from both Derek and Sean, respectively. 
In the third quarter, non-U.S. ADV was up 13% to 5 million contracts per day. We saw 15% growth in Europe, 8% growth in Asia, 32% growth in Latin America and 10% growth in the U.S. Also during the quarter, we completed our joint venture with IHS Markit and, together, launched, OSTTRA, a leading provider of progressive post-trade solutions for the global OTC market across interest rates, equities, FX and credit asset classes. 
Turning to Q4. We have had a strong start so far in October, averaging more than 20 million contracts, which is an increase of 35% month-to-date compared to the same point in October last year. Interest rates in energy are up double digits with rates up 90%. With that, let me turn it over to Sean to give you more flavor as it relates to interest rates."
2004577,1680818015,2414016,"CME Group Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Terry.

As Terry said, the financials unit saw a number of significant developments in the third quarter, particularly regarding SOFR, the overall rates market and our crypto business. Our silver futures saw average daily volume grow to 124,000 contracts per day in the third quarter up over 180% year-over-year, and our open interest grew to over 1 million contracts, up 140% year-over-year. Additionally, in the month of October, we're seeing average daily volume of 227,000 SOFR futures contracts and open interest of 1.2 million contracts. Over the last 60 days, our SOFR futures ADV made up over 78% of the global SOFR futures volumes and our open interest represents approximately 95%. 
Further, on July 29, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee of the Federal Reserve endorsed CME's 1-month, 3-month and 6-month term SOFR rates. And on September 19, CME began publishing a 12-month term SOFR rate as well. Demand for access to our term SOFR rate is very high, as we have already executed more than 100 term SOFR licenses to market participants, and we are currently working with an additional 300 firms who are also interested in licensing. 
Our fallbacks for Eurodollar futures and options have also been a very strong success since we finalized our rule book back on March 29. SOFR-linked open interest includes SOFR futures as well as Eurodollar futures and options that reference a LIBOR rate which will be set after June 30, 2023. Those contracts have grown from 11.8 million open interest on March 29, to 16.3 million open interest as of October 25, up 38%. Further, the average daily volume of our SOFR-linked futures and options in Q3 was 1.6 million contract, representing 52% of CME's total short-term interest rate ADV. 
In addition, our long-held view regarding the rates market environment continues to gain [ veracity ]. Using CME's FedWatch tool, we can see the market is now pricing in a 60% chance of tightening by June 2022, up from just 17% just 1 month ago. Our FedWatch tool also now indicates an 87% chance of at least 2 Fed tightenings by the December 2022 [ FMC ] meeting. 
In Q3, the improving rates environment, as Terry said, led to a 53% growth in our interest rates ADV versus third quarter of 2020. Nonetheless, rate volatility, while higher in the third quarter of 2021 than it was in recent quarters, remained historically quite low. For example, in the eighth quarterly Eurodollar futures, it achieved just the 37th percentile of volatility versus a history going back to 2007. And our 10-year note futures achieved only a 25th percentile volatility rank showing the current volatility even in Q3 was very low. 
Regarding CME Group's crypto offering, first, let me say, the recent approval of ETFs based on CME Bitcoin futures is not only an important milestone for our future contracts but also a positive development for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. This is a direct reflection of the strong growth and client demand for exposure to Bitcoin via CME's transparent, deeply liquid and regulated cryptocurrency futures contracts. The launch of ETFs based on CME's Bitcoin futures is validation from the industry of what we've known for some time, that CME Bitcoin futures are the leading source of Bitcoin price discovery in the industry. 
Two new Bitcoin ETFs were launched just last week and another this morning, both of which are based -- or all 3 of which are based on CME's Bitcoin futures. On the back of those launches, our Bitcoin futures, October ADV has risen to over 12,000 contracts or over 60,000 equivalent Bitcoin worth a record $3.5 billion per day, up 57% over September. Additionally, average open interest in our Bitcoin futures has grown to a record 17,433 contracts, up 70% versus September. Our Micro Bitcoin futures volume is also up 33% month-over-month, and our average open interest is up 97% month-over-month. With that, I'll turn it over to Derek."

As Terry mentioned at the top of the call, we have seen a strong return of activity in our global energy business in the second half of this year with both crude oil and natural gas prices hitting multiyear highs. Overall, this has helped our global energy business to deliver average daily volume growth of 18% in the third quarter, led by energy options up 26% year-on-year. WTI futures reached the $84 a barrel mark earlier this month for the first time since 2014, as OPEC maintained caution on production increases and as U.S. shale steadily recovers from the 2020 decline. Prices were further boosted from returning global demand as economies reopen. 
In the U.S., gasoline consumption reached 10 million barrels a day in July, marking an all-time monthly high. Activity in WTI crude oil futures saw a 26% jump in average daily volume in the third quarter to 990,000 contracts; the WTI options average daily volume jumping 45%, 129,000 contracts. This helped us to deliver strong daily volume growth in our refined products portfolio as well with a gasoline product volume of 20% to 196,000 contracts and our heating oil products daily trading volume up 10% to 154,000 contracts. 
This has helped set the stage for the significant success that we've delivered with our Micro WTI futures contract. Launched on July 12 of this year, as Terry mentioned, we surpassed 1 million contracts traded in the first 20 trading days, and we've already traded more than 4.3 million contracts since launch. Most importantly, this innovative new contract is attracting brand-new global customers to our energy market as evidenced by the fact that almost 10,000 Micro WTI customers have not traded any other CME Group crude oil product in 2021. These new customers come from 118 different countries and represent over 50% of our Micro WTI customer base. So this has been a significant source of new client acquisition for us. 
At the same time, we have also seen the natural gas market experience the highest price level in over 13 years with U.S. Henry Hub futures hitting a high price of $6.45 earlier this month, more than tripling in price from the COVID-driven March 2020 lows. The resulting increase in volatility has boosted our Henry Hub futures business with September average daily volume of 496,000 contracts, up 11% year-on-year. Henry Hub options were particularly strong in the third quarter with average daily volume up 18% to 124,000 contracts, achieving our best months of August and September ever. 
Participation has been strong from our commercial customers, and we've seen our natural gas futures and options open interest jump to 6.2 million contracts in September, which is the highest level we've seen since January [ 2018 ]. 
So overall, we're seeing that the investments we're making in our product portfolio, our global client development and our technology pay strong dividends as market volatility returns as our customer base manages their energy risk and CME Group's global benchmark products. With that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the financial results."

During the third quarter, CME generated more than $1.1 billion in revenue with average daily volume up 14% compared to the same period last year. Expenses were very carefully managed and, on an adjusted basis, were $412 million for the quarter and $355 million, excluding license fees. CME had an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.3%, which resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, up 16% from the third quarter last year. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $33 million. CME paid out more than $300 million of dividends during the third quarter and cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion. At the start of September, CME and IHS Markit launched OSTTRA, our post-trade services joint venture. As a result, CME will no longer be recording revenue and expenses associated with our post-trade businesses but will be recording our share of the joint venture earnings in the equity and net earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries line out of our income statement. 
For the month of September, CME would have recorded approximately $22 million in revenue and $11 million in expenses but instead recorded approximately $8 million in our share of the adjusted earnings of the joint venture. When you take into consideration tax implications and providing support services for the joint venture, there was essentially no impact to our overall earnings. 
Turning to guidance. We now expect total adjusted operating expenses for 2021 excluding license fees and reflecting the impact of our joint venture to come in at approximately $1.5 billion, down about $30 million from our guidance at the start of the year. All other guidance remains unchanged. 
Finally, we are very pleased to say we achieved our planned $200 million in cumulative run rate expense synergies related to the NEX acquisition this quarter. Please refer to the last page of our executive commentary for additional financial highlights and details.

I think that in and of itself lends to the credibility of our product as a listed futures exchange and the regulation thereof. 
To get more directly to your question around position limits associated with it, they are an important component to any market when you have a highly regulated entity like CME. So the existing position limits in our Bitcoin futures today, as you may or may not know, is 2,000 for spot. And then we have accountability levels going back into deferred months that are much larger than that. But the spot month will go to 4,000 in November, and we feel very confident from a risk perspective that we are not being reckless in any which way, shape or form that this has been vetted to our entire team here and with the agency. 
So we've filed for those changes. We're confident that the product is mature enough now to increase the size of the limit. So again, we'll be careful here, Rich. This product, we launched in 2017, not 1917. So this is a newer product, a newer asset class, and we will be very, very cautious here. But again, we're excited by the uptake and the credibility associated with power shares and some of the other ETFs that decided to benchmark against our futures contract."

So in terms of our expense guidance, we did reduce our expense guidance after you adjust for the  OSTTRA joint venture by an additional $15 million. So we're about $30 million down from our original guidance at t",659,"Yes. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate the question. So in terms of our expense guidance, we did reduce our expense guidance after you adjust for the  OSTTRA joint venture by an additional $15 million. So we're about $30 million down from our original guidance at the start of the year. 
When you think about what we've done on the expense side, this entire CME team has done an excellent job managing our costs. We continue to have that as a strong focus. And to put kind of our expense management into perspective, after adjusting for the creation of OSTTRA, we're about $12 million down from last year's adjusted expenses and almost $100 million down below 2019 levels. 
When you look at our reduction of the $15 million, about half of that reduction reflects lower expected travel and in-person events. As you recall, at the beginning of the year, we had about $20 million we put in the back half of the year, assuming that we would be able to have additional travel. But as you can see, there's still limitations on travel, especially international travel. We have been seeing additional pickup in meetings, especially in Europe and London, in particular, but still international travel is still a little bit tough. And the balance is really -- of our reduction in terms of our guidance is just excellent continued expense controls by the entire team, including careful hiring and careful use of contingent labor. 
When you take a look at 2020's fourth quarter and 2021's fourth quarter, we do see a pickup in costs. The fourth quarter is traditionally our highest expense quarter. Historically, marketing and advertising spend tend to be highest in the fourth quarter along with higher project spending as we wind up the current year and prepare for the next year. The spending this year reflects that same pattern, and we anticipated a higher-than-normal proportion of spend when we built out our spending plans at the start of the year. 
We expect higher levels of spend in marketing and advertising, including targeting a portion of that spend on our successful micro products and in anticipation of a more open operating environment in 2022. We're also investing in system projects, including the migration of EBS and streaming services, which would lead to more technology-related costs. 
Also, our incentive compensation is anticipated to be higher in the fourth quarter of this year than the fourth quarter of last year. So those are some of the items which are are causing the fourth quarter this year to be higher than the fourth quarter last year. But overall, for the entire year, some really impressive expense controls by the entire organization. 
So in terms of thinking about modeling for next year, we're going through the budgeting process now. So it's really too early to provide guidance. We are hopeful for a more normalized environment, which would be positive for our business. 
When looking at 2022, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. We did postpone salary increases in 2021 and for our staff, and we don't anticipate doing the same this year for 2021 -- I mean, sorry, for 2022. Also in an open business environment, which is obviously extremely fluid, we would anticipate increased travel, both regionally and globally, and more in-person events, which we would view as positive from a business perspective. But again, in November, it's a little tough to see that in 2022 yet. So we'll provide some additional guidance when we do our earnings in February. We are starting to see some of that open up, like I mentioned before, in Europe. 
We'll continue to invest in our systems and technology capabilities with an eye towards accelerating growth globally. It is our intention that we will continue our excellent expense management as we build out our plans for next year. So that should give you a little bit of a flavor in terms of 2022."

So the number of professional subscribers that we're seeing for our real-time business, which is the bulk of the revenue, has been steady. And the price increase that we saw $5 per user has been realized. The big difference that we saw between Q2 and Q3 results were really audit findings, were down about $2 million, which, again, is quite difficult to forecast and ones that is really just the timing of audits that we have underway with our clients. 
So Sean had mentioned, too, at the beginning of the call, right, a lot of the focus for the team. Particularly, the data sales team has been on the term SOFR rate. We've got a tremendous amount of client engagement going on there with 100 licenses already done within the last quarter and 300 more in the Q. We are also continuing to see great uptake of those nondisplay policies and pricing that we introduced at the beginning of the year as well as our derived business performing very strongly and lastly, just continue to see adoption of our cloud offering with Google on SmartStream. So I think the growth is still there. It's just -- again, the real difference in Q3 was based on the audit."

I'm going to let Sean comment, maybe Sunil, as well, but let me give you a broad comment here. The open interest of 100 million to 109 million contracts open, which I think is what you're referring to, the trend over the last several -- probably a year or so since we came off of the high of 150. A lot of it is reflected in the interest rate business. We're going through a massive transition, as Sean pointed out earlier, from LIBOR to something else we suspect as SOFR, and people are trying to adjust associated with that. We're also seeing the low vol still that's -- even though we've seen an uptick in some of the things that you're referencing, the volatility is still significantly lower not only in interest rates but FX. I'm talking from a historical standpoint. 
That is changing. You're correct in your comments. The question is when does it reflect an open interest. We believe there is open -- the participants are in there, participating. But you got to remember, our open interest today is a little bit different than it was just a couple of years ago. We didn't have weekly options on a lot of these products. We didn't have some of the expirations constantly coming on and off. So people are taking exposures for projected periods of time. Might be days versus quarters like that it was historically. So we're seeing people manage their risk in a little bit different way, and I think that's reflective of the open interest as well. 
So I think those are all a lot of factors going into it, fundamental being the main one, but a lot of it is some of the products, the way we offer people to manage risk right now, which I don't see that as a bad problem. I see that as a good problem because open interest, we don't get paid for. We get paid for transactions. And the way we're structuring it now, I think that's a much more powerful offering. 
But the open interest is a reflection of future trade. We've always said that the people, and we still believe in that. But at the same time, we're seeing people participate in the market because of what I just outlined a moment ago with options and other products to transition from 1 rate to another, the fundamentals and foreign exchange being extremely quiet. And we're also seeing massive directional changes in energy. As Derek pointed out earlier, we went from just 1.5 years ago to minus $37.50 to $84 a barrel. So you think about the massive directional participation in the marketplace has been truly one way, and a lot of people just don't believe that you can go from minus $37 a barrel to $84 a barrel in 1.5 years. 
So I think it's just an adjustment to the world that we live in today and people will, again, participate and holding more and more open into. But right now, I don't see it as a bad problem because of what we -- what I just outlined. And I'll ask Sean to comment more."

In addition to that, another number we track very closely is the number of large open interest holders as reported by the CFTC. If you look at the second quarter of this year, and if you look across the financials products, rates, equities and foreign exchange, the average large open interest holder number across the second quarter was an all-time record high for the combined 3 asset costs. 
If you look at the third quarter, we beat the second quarter. So I've had 2 back-to-back all-time record numbers of large open interest holders on average. If you look at our interest rates business, the most recent numbers from the CFTC indicate the rates business is just 1% below its all-time high and large open interest holders, and the foreign exchange business similarly is just a couple of percentage points below its all-time high.

It'll -- we'll be able to offer them new and innovative products, improved workflow and analytics. And also, we're going to be well positioned to really support the global banks, in particular. 
So very excited about OSTTRA. We've, like I said, launched it in early September. We've got an integration plan that is being executed right now. And so far, we've been very pleased with the leadership there and working with our partners at IHS Markit. So in terms of -- I'm going to break down in more detail the impacts for the month of September and -- which will be helpful. And then we could talk a little bit about what it looks like kind of going forward. 
So in terms of revenue, like I said in my prepared remarks, there was about $22 million in revenue. For the month of September, we would have booked had we not launched OSTTRA. Of that $7 million is in transaction fees and $15 million is in the other revenue line. From an expense perspective, it was about $11 million for the month of September. About $7 million of that was in compensation, and the rest was split between technology, other and pro fees. 
In the equity and earnings section, equity and net earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries was $8 million in that line. Now that $8 million is net of tax. And then we had $1 million in the other line in that section of our income statement. Obviously, when we had the company before the formation of OSTTRA, you'd have the tax effect, the $11 million in operating income. So when you net all that out, it's really no impact for the month of -- for September.
Now looking at the expense level, the expense levels have been very constant in the $11 million range. So there's very little in the way of volatility over the last several quarters. So $11 million per month is a good run rate. 
And then when you look at the revenue, it -- if you looked at it for a full quarter, if you took the $22 million multiply it by 3 to give yourself a quarterly -- quarterly amount of $66 million. If you look over the last several quarters, the revenue has been in the $64 million to $66 million range per quarter. So those are -- those would be the numbers that I would work with in terms of run rates."

And as Sean touched on, what I think is really important to highlight, is derivatory aspect of CME's business, especially its crypto offering. You can imagine there's many people that are now more and more every day looking for some form of exposure as cryptos are becoming more and more acceptable. The -- maybe the problem with that would be also the appreciation of the price of the product. People are maybe a little bit more concerned about where they go to get that risk, and they want to make sure they're at a regulated platform.

So that's actually a very exciting development. As you go into the next couple of years, that will also increase, and we expect to see an increase in the spread trading between the Eurodollars and the SOFR futures. 
In addition to that, you may recall we launched BSBY future, not too long ago, where we're also doing about 70,000 contracts a day depending upon the time frame. So the transition of the short-term interest rate business to a new rate, whether it is the BSBY or the term SOFR or SOFR is actually a very positive thing in regards to the intercommodity trading between -- or the spread trading between the different instruments. So that's actually a very positive development. I also remarked earlier that we've seen enormous growth in the SOFR-linked products, again, with an ADV of more than 1.6 million contracts a day in the third quarter. So that's growing very strongly. 
In terms of incentives, yes, we have had incentives, as anyone who follows us closely knows, whenever we start a market. And so we have had significant incentives in our SOFR futures over the recent quarters. The good news there is that means that that's already priced into our revenues to a large extent. So we will expect to continue those incentives for a period of time. But as you can imagine, as we have with all of our products, you know the history, I'm sure, of our Bitcoin futures and how we've reduced incentives there, our Micro E-minis and how we reduced incentives there and how those RPCs grew pretty dramatically once those marketplaces got up and running. 
So we would expect that as we get greater adoption of SOFR relative to Eurodollars, that the incentives in SOFR would decline on a relative basis. So again, we're already spending a lot of money on incentives. That's already baked in, in the last 12 months. And yes, we will continue to have some incentive spend, but I don't expect any kind of a significant increase."

Over time, we would view SOFR being treated just like the rest of our short-term interest rate products. So I don't see there being any unusual headwinds because of SOFR versus any of our other short-term incentive products. And this is something that we, as a team, Julie, Sean, myself and Derek and others, we look at our pricing all the time to ensure that we are pricing our products appropriately to maximize our top line and to  create as much liquidity as we can across our platform 24 hours a day."

We're going to convert that, but we're talking about a 30-year conversion possibly. We're talking about just a couple of years we're going to convert trillions of dollars of assets benchmarked to LIBOR into something else, which we believe we're in the strongest position of anybody to capture that risk offset. And that is with the products that Sean outlined. 
Now that will not be just a measure of open interest. It will be a measure of many things as we go through this transition. To me, this might be the most exciting time in the history of interest rate trading that I've ever seen in my 41 years here at the CME. So to me, I'm very optimistic about it, but I will not judge it on open interest alone. I won't judge it on one particular issue alone. There's many factors that are going to go into this. And Sean outlined some of the things that we have right now, not only on incentives, but with the BSBY product with Bloomberg, with the short-term SOFR rate and with the SOFR futures and options, we think we're in a really strong position. And one of the benchmarks is open interest, and just Sean gave it to you, we are the leader in that one by a long shot. So I'm very pleased with this transition."

So still a very -- we're on path for a very strong year in retail. It's looking to be the second highest revenue year on record for us. I think the participation there is definitely strongest in the equity suite of those micro products. And performance was a bit subdued through some of the quarter until volatility started to pick up a little bit in kind of mid-September. And since then, we've definitely seen further uptick in the business. 
But it kind of also speaks to just the diversity of our suite, right? So the retail adoption of things like our agricultural products has never been stronger than what we've seen this year. So ag revenue for retail in APAC was up 86%, North American, up 30%. So overall participation to this is very, very strong. We're on pace to about 375,000 traders in our markets this year, likely only surpassed by where we ended last year, which was a record year. 
And we talked quite a bit as well about the new client acquisition in the space. That has been strong as well. We've brought on 134,000 new retail traders and really looking -- specifically, when we looked at June, July and August, in 2021, we outpaced those levels that we saw in 2020 during those exact same months. How we're doing that continues to be the same thing that we've talked about before. It's really about driving that retail traffic to our digital properties there. We saw that activity more than double from where we were last year. And also just the interest in our educational materials, we've had about 1 million retail traders visit those properties through Q3, which is great. 
And our partnership, those global broker partners that we have the educational, the outreach efforts that they make a huge part of this. In Asia alone, our broker partners have reached about 1.7 million active traders year-to-date. And we've seen our digital educational events activities up over 178%. So I think it's that continued focus on really that retail go-to-market that has kept the activity very strong. Do you want to add anything?"

So appreciate the question, Michael. So I think probably the easiest way to start in our material that we precirculated on Slide 4, you'll notice some very detailed comments about some of the products that we've launched and what those mean to our franchise, specifically on the environmental product side. As you know, we've launched in August, our nature-based GEO contracts, the GEOs, the global emissions offset contracts, that complements the GEO contracts we launched earlier this year. And we continue to see significant traction there, not just in terms of the traded volumes but, more importantly, the open interest that we're accruing and then the deliveries that we're seeing of these contracts as well. 
So since launch, we've actually now seen a peak -- we hit a peak open interest record of just over 10,000 contracts on December 21. We hit a new record just on Friday. And what's important about that is while these contracts are now seen record open interest terms, we're also seeing record amounts of physical deliveries of these offset certificates as well. So we now facilitated the physical delivery of 146,000 offset credits across 4 separate delivery cycles. And just to put that into context for what that means for customers that are taking delivery of these certificates, that's the equivalent of 146 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. So this is a market that started really about 2 years ago. We partnered exclusively, as we shared with you on previous calls, with CBL expanse of the largest spot platform in the voluntary offset market in the carbon markets. And we now are delivering record amounts of volume through the platform and delivery of these certificates through for delivery cycles. We'll have another 1 this week. 
So this is a new market. We just launched our nature-based contracts in August of this year. So that's pretty significant traction early on. There is a lot that's expected out of this conference in Glasgow, COP26. And as we continue to work with the markets and connect where we are now on the global basis of where these kind of go, it's a complement to the work that we've already done and continue to do on the equity side where we host the world's largest ESG contract by nominal value, our S&P 500 ESG Index futures, which has seen open interest above $4 billion notional value which is pretty significant. 
So when you look at the space, whether it's on the environmental product side, the traction that we're seeing in a market that we are at the cutting edge of developing on the voluntary carbon market side or how we're servicing the needs of customers that are looking for ESG-compliant investment vehicles, we're leaders in both of those spaces. So we're happy with our positioning. We feel like we've chosen good partners. And I think the market, as it adapts to a new world of carbon neutrality, we feel like we're in a strong position there with the success we've already had."

Before I begin, in addition to John, who will discuss the financial results, I'm going to have Sean and Derek to make some comments. With all the recent news associated with interest rates and energy, I thought it was important that they present this morning.  
With that, we delivered solid volume during the third quarter of this year as we averaged 17.8 million contracts per day, which was up 14% versus third quarter last year. We saw year-over-year strength in our interest rates and energy businesses and saw significant options growth of 45% during Q3. Rates average daily volume rose 53%, including 78% growth in Eurodollars and 41% growth in treasuries, as the expectations of future rate hikes has increased.  
We continue to launch innovative new products, tools and services to support customer needs, including additions to our suite of micro-sized contracts that allow market users to customize their trading and hedging as well as ESG-focused futures contracts that help manage climate-related risk.  
In terms of specific products and services, we had 2 consecutive quarterly ADV records and SOFR futures in Q2 and Q3 as the market continues to manage their interest rate risk ahead of key transition deadlines. Bitcoin futures, ADV increased 170% compared with the third quarter last year. Ether futures are also off to a good start since their launch in the first quarter this year. In September, we launched the derivatives industry's first-ever sustainable clearing service to help market participants track and report on how their hedging activities are advancing their sustainable goals.  
Finally, Micro WTI and Micro Treasury yield contracts began trading in July and August, respectively. The Micro WTI contract represents the most successful commodity product launch in our history with over 1 million contracts traded within the first 20 days and a total of 4.3 million contracts traded since July 12 launch. Most importantly, this innovative new contract is attracting new customers to our energy market as evidenced by the fact that almost 10,000 Micro WTI market participants have not traded any other CME Group crude oil product in 2021. You'll hear more about this in a moment from both Derek and Sean, respectively.  
In the third quarter, non-U.S. ADV was up 13% to 5 million contracts per day. We saw 15% growth in Europe, 8% growth in Asia, 32% growth in Latin America and 10% growth in the U.S. 
Also during the quarter, we completed our joint venture with IHS Markit and, together, launched, OSTTRA, a leading provider of progressive post-trade solutions for the global OTC market across interest rates, equities, FX and credit asset classes.  
Turning to Q4. We have had a strong start so far in October, averaging more than 20 million contracts, which is an increase of 35% month-to-date compared to the same point in October last year. Interest rates in energy are up double digits with rates up 90%. 
With that, let me turn it over to Sean to give you more flavor as it relates to interest rates."
2004577,1680818015,2414108,"CME Group Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Terry.

As Terry said, the financials unit saw a number of significant developments in the third quarter, particularly regarding SOFR, the overall rates market and our crypto business. Our silver futures saw average daily volume grow to 124,000 contracts per day in the third quarter up over 180% year-over-year, and our open interest grew to over 1 million contracts, up 140% year-over-year. 
Additionally, in the month of October, we're seeing average daily volume of 227,000 SOFR futures contracts and open interest of 1.2 million contracts. Over the last 60 days, our SOFR futures ADV made up over 78% of the global SOFR futures volumes and our open interest represents approximately 95%.  
Further, on July 29, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee of the Federal Reserve endorsed CME's 1-month, 3-month and 6-month term SOFR rates. And on September 19, CME began publishing a 12-month term SOFR rate as well. Demand for access to our term SOFR rate is very high, as we have already executed more than 100 term SOFR licenses to market participants, and we are currently working with an additional 300 firms who are also interested in licensing.  
Our fallbacks for Eurodollar futures and options have also been a very strong success since we finalized our rule book back on March 29. SOFR-linked open interest includes SOFR futures as well as Eurodollar futures and options that reference a LIBOR rate which will be set after June 30, 2023. Those contracts have grown from 11.8 million open interest on March 29, to 16.3 million open interest as of October 25, up 38%. Further, the average daily volume of our SOFR-linked futures and options in Q3 was 1.6 million contracts, representing 52% of CME's total short-term interest rate ADV.  
In addition, our long-held view regarding the rates market environment continues to gain veracity. Using CME's FedWatch tool, we can see the market is now pricing in a 60% chance of tightening by June 2022, up from just 17% just 1 month ago. Our FedWatch tool also now indicates an 87% chance of at least 2 Fed tightenings by the December 2022 FOMC meeting.  
In Q3, the improving rates environment, as Terry said, led to a 53% growth in our interest rates ADV versus third quarter of 2020. Nonetheless, rate volatility, while higher in the third quarter of 2021 than it was in recent quarters, remained historically quite low. For example, in the eighth quarterly Eurodollar futures, it achieved just the 37th percentile of volatility versus a history going back to 2007. And our 10-year note futures achieved only a 25th percentile volatility rank, showing the current volatility even in Q3 was very low.  
Regarding CME Group's crypto offering, first, let me say, the recent approval of ETFs based on CME Bitcoin futures is not only an important milestone for our future contracts but also a positive development for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. This is a direct reflection of the strong growth and client demand for exposure to Bitcoin via CME's transparent, deeply liquid and regulated cryptocurrency futures contracts. The launch of ETFs based on CME's Bitcoin futures is validation from the industry of what we've known for some time, that CME Bitcoin futures are the leading source of bitcoin price discovery in the industry.  
Two new Bitcoin ETFs were launched just last week and another this morning, both of which are based -- or all 3 of which are based on CME's Bitcoin futures. On the back of those launches, our Bitcoin futures, October ADV has risen to over 12,000 contracts or over 60,000 equivalent Bitcoin worth a record $3.5 billion per day, up 57% over September. Additionally, average open interest in our Bitcoin futures has grown to a record 17,433 contracts, up 70% versus September. Our Micro Bitcoin futures volume is also up 33% month-over-month, and our average open interest is up 97% month-over-month. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Derek."

As Terry mentioned at the top of the call, we have seen a strong return of activity in our global energy business in the second half of this year with both crude oil and natural gas prices hitting multiyear highs. Overall, this has helped our global energy business to deliver average daily volume growth of 18% in the third quarter, led by energy options up 26% year-on-year. WTI futures reached the $84 a barrel mark earlier this month for the first time since 2014, as OPEC maintained caution on production increases and as U.S. shale steadily recovers from the 2020 decline. Prices were further boosted from returning global demand as economies reopen.  
In the U.S., gasoline consumption reached 10 million barrels a day in July, marking an all-time monthly high. Activity in WTI crude oil futures saw a 26% jump in average daily volume in the third quarter to 990,000 contracts; the WTI options average daily volume jumping 45%, 129,000 contracts. This helped us to deliver strong daily volume growth in our refined products portfolio as well with our gasoline product volume of 20% to 196,000 contracts and our heating oil products daily trading volume up 10% to 154,000 contracts.  
This has helped set the stage for the significant success that we've delivered with our Micro WTI futures contract. Launched on July 12 of this year, as Terry mentioned, we surpassed 1 million contracts traded in the first 20 trading days, and we've already traded more than 4.3 million contracts since launch. Most importantly, this innovative new contract is attracting brand-new global customers to our energy market as evidenced by the fact that almost 10,000 Micro WTI customers have not traded any other CME Group crude oil product in 2021. These new customers come from 118 different countries and represent over 50% of our Micro WTI customer base. So this has been a significant source of new client acquisition for us.  
At the same time, we have also seen the natural gas market experience the highest price level in over 13 years with U.S. Henry Hub futures hitting a high price of $6.45 earlier this month, more than tripling in price from the COVID-driven March 2020 lows. The resulting increase in volatility has boosted our Henry Hub futures business with September average daily volume of 496,000 contracts, up 11% year-on-year. Henry Hub options were particularly strong in the third quarter with average daily volume up 18% to 124,000 contracts, achieving our best months of August and September ever.  
Participation has been strong from our commercial customers, and we've seen our natural gas futures and options open interest jump to 6.2 million contracts in September, which is the highest level we've seen since January [ 2018 ]. 
So overall, we're seeing that the investments we're making in our product portfolio, our global client development and our technology pay strong dividends as market volatility returns, as our customer base manages their energy risk and CME Group's global benchmark products. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the financial results."

During the third quarter, CME generated more than $1.1 billion in revenue with average daily volume up 14% compared to the same period last year. Expenses were very carefully managed and, on an adjusted basis, were $412 million for the quarter and $355 million, excluding license fees. CME had an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.3%, which resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, up 16% from the third quarter last year.  
Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $33 million. CME paid out more than $300 million of dividends during the third quarter, and cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion. 
At the start of September, CME and IHS Markit launched OSTTRA, our post trade services joint venture. As a result, CME will no longer be recording revenue and expenses associated with our post-trade businesses but will be recording our share of the joint venture earnings in the equity and net earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries line out of our income statement.  
For the month of September, CME would have recorded approximately $22 million in revenue and $11 million in expenses but instead recorded approximately $8 million in our share of the adjusted earnings of the joint venture. When you take into consideration tax implications and providing support services for the joint venture, there was essentially no impact to our overall earnings.  
Turning to guidance. We now expect total adjusted operating expenses for 2021 excluding license fees and reflecting the impact of our joint venture to come in at approximately $1.5 billion, down about $30 million from our guidance at the start of the year. All other guidance remains unchanged.  
Finally, we are very pleased to say we achieved our planned $200 million in cumulative run rate expense synergies related to the NEX acquisition this quarter. Please refer to the last page of our executive commentary for additional financial highlights and details.  
We would like to now open the up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

But the ETFs, as Sean stated in his comments, I think are very exciting for -- to be based off of CME futures. I think that in and of itself lends to the credibility of our product as a listed futures exchange and the regulation thereof.  
To get more directly to your question around position limits associated with it, they are an important component to any market when you have a highly regulated entity like CME. So the existing position limits in our Bitcoin futures today, as you may or may not know, is 2,000 for spot. And then we have accountability levels going back in the deferred months that are much larger than that. But the spot month will go to 4,000 in November, and we feel very confident from a risk perspective that we are not being reckless in any which way, shape or form, that this has been vetted to our entire team here and with the agency.  
So we've filed for those changes. We're confident that the product is mature enough now to increase the size of the limit. So again, we'll be careful here, Rich. This product, we launched in 2017, not 1917. So this is a newer product, a newer asset class, and we will be very, very cautious here. But again, we're excited by the uptake and the credibility associated with power shares and some of the other ETFs that decided to benchmark against our futures contract."

So in terms of our expense guidance, we did reduce our expense guidance after you adjust for the OSTTRA joint venture by an additional $15 million. So we're about $30 million down from our original guidance at th",658,"Yes. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate the question. So in terms of our expense guidance, we did reduce our expense guidance after you adjust for the OSTTRA joint venture by an additional $15 million. So we're about $30 million down from our original guidance at the start of the year.  
When you think about what we've done on the expense side, this entire CME team has done an excellent job managing our costs. We continue to have that as a strong focus. And to put kind of our expense management into perspective, after adjusting for the creation of OSTTRA, we're about $12 million down from last year's adjusted expenses and almost $100 million down below 2019 levels.  
When you look at our reduction of the $15 million, about half of that reduction reflects lower expected travel and in-person events. As you recall, at the beginning of the year, we had about $20 million we put in the back half of the year, assuming that we would be able to have additional travel. But as you can see, there's still limitations on travel, especially international travel. We have been seeing additional pickup in meetings, especially in Europe and London, in particular, but still, international travel is still a little bit tough.  
And the balance is really -- of our reduction in terms of our guidance is just excellent continued expense controls by the entire team, including careful hiring and careful use of contingent labor. 
When you take a look at 2020's fourth quarter and 2021's fourth quarter, yes, we do see a pickup in costs. The fourth quarter is traditionally our highest expense quarter. Historically, marketing and advertising spend tend to be highest in the fourth quarter along with higher project spending as we wind up the current year and prepare for the next year. The spending this year reflects that same pattern, and we anticipated a higher-than-normal proportion of spend when we built out our spending plans at the start of the year.  
We expect higher levels of spend in marketing and advertising, including targeting a portion of that spend on our successful micro products and in anticipation of a more open operating environment in 2022. We're also investing in system projects, including the migration of EBS and streaming services, which would lead to more technology-related costs.  
Also, our incentive compensation is anticipated to be higher in the fourth quarter of this year than the fourth quarter of last year. So those are some of the items which are causing the fourth quarter this year to be higher than the fourth quarter last year. But overall, for the entire year, some really impressive expense controls by the entire organization.  
So in terms of thinking about modeling for next year, we're going through the budgeting process now. So it's really too early to provide guidance. We are hopeful for a more normalized environment, which would be positive for our business. 
When looking at 2022, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. We did postpone salary increases in 2021 for our staff, and we don't anticipate doing the same this year for 2021 -- I mean, sorry, for 2022. Also in an open business environment, which is obviously extremely fluid, we would anticipate increased travel, both regionally and globally, and more in-person events, which we would view as positive from a business perspective. But again, in November, it's a little tough to see that in 2022 yet. So we'll provide some additional guidance when we do our earnings in February.  
We are starting to see some of that open up, like I mentioned before, in Europe. We'll continue to invest in our systems and technology capabilities with an eye towards accelerating growth globally. It is our intention that we will continue our excellent expense management as we build out our plans for next year. So that should give you a little bit of a flavor in terms of 2022."

And the price increase that we saw, $5 per user, has been realized.

Ken, it's Terry Duffy. I'm going to let Sean comment, maybe Sunil, as well, but let me give you a broad comment here. The open interest of 100 million to 109 million contracts open, which I think is what you'r",541,"Alex, it's Terry -- or it's Ken, I'm sorry. Ken, it's Terry Duffy. I'm going to let Sean comment, maybe Sunil, as well, but let me give you a broad comment here. 
The open interest of 100 million to 109 million contracts open, which I think is what you're referring to, the trend over the last several -- probably a year or so since we came off of the high of 150 million, a lot of it is reflected in the interest rate business. We're going through a massive transition, as Sean pointed out earlier, from LIBOR to something else we suspect as SOFR, and people are trying to adjust associated with that. We're also seeing the low vol still that's -- even though we've seen an uptick in some of the things that you're referencing, the volatility is still significantly lower not only in interest rates but FX. I'm talking from a historical standpoint.  
That is changing. You're correct in your comments. The question is when does it reflect in open interest. We believe there is open -- the participants are in there, participating. But you got to remember, our open interest today is a little bit different than it was just a couple of years ago. We didn't have weekly options on a lot of these products. We didn't have some of the expirations constantly coming on and off. So people are taking exposures for projected periods of time, might be days versus quarters like it was historically. So we're seeing people manage their risk in a little bit different way, and I think that's reflective of the open interest as well.  
So I think those are all a lot of factors going into it, fundamental being the main one, but a lot of it is some of the products, the way we offer people to manage risk right now, which I don't see that as a bad problem. I see that as a good problem because open interest, we don't get paid for. We get paid for transactions. And the way we're structuring it now, I think that's a much more powerful offering.  
But the open interest is a reflection of future trade. We've always said it to people, and we still believe in that. But at the same time, we're seeing people participate in the market because of what I just outlined a moment ago with options and other products to transition from 1 rate to another, the fundamentals and foreign exchange being extremely quiet. And we're also seeing massive directional changes in energy. As Derek pointed out earlier, we went from just 1.5 years ago to minus $37.50 to $84 a barrel. So you think about the massive directional participation in the marketplace has been truly one way, and a lot of people just don't believe that you can go from minus $37 a barrel to $84 a barrel in 1.5 years.  
So I think it's just an adjustment to the world that we live in today and people will, again, participate in holding more and more open interest. But right now, I don't see it as a bad problem because of what we -- what I just outlined. And I'll ask Sean to comment more."

In addition to that, another number we track very closely is the number of large open interest holders as reported by the CFTC. If you look at the second quarter of this year, and if you look across the financials products, rates, equities and foreign exchange, the average large open interest holder number across the second quarter was an all-time record high for the combined 3 asset classes.  
If you look at the third quarter, we beat the second quarter. So I've had 2 back-to-back all-time record numbers of large open interest holders on average. If you look at our interest rates business, the most recent numbers from the CFTC indicate the rates business is just 1% below its all-time high in large open interest holders, and the foreign exchange business similarly is just a couple of percentage points below its all-time high.

It'll -- we'll be able to offer them new and innovative products, improved workflow and analytics. And also, we're going to be well positioned to really support the global banks, in particular. 
So very excited about OSTTRA. We've, like I said, launched it in early September. We've got an integration plan that is being executed right now. And so far, we've been very pleased with the leadership there and working with our partners at IHS Markit. 
So in terms of -- I'm going to break down in more detail the impacts for the month of September and -- which will be helpful. And then we could talk a little bit about what it looks like kind of going forward. 
So in terms of revenue, like I said in my prepared remarks, it was about $22 million in revenue for the month of September we would have booked had we not launched OSTTRA. 
Of that $7 million is in transaction fees and $15 million is in the other revenue line. From an expense perspective, it was about $11 million for the month of September. About $7 million of that was in compensation, and the rest was split between technology, other and pro fees. 
In the equity and earnings section, equity and net earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries was $8 million in that line. Now that $8 million is net of tax. And then we had $1 million in the other line in that section of our income statement. Obviously, when we had the company before the formation of OSTTRA, you'd have the tax effect, the $11 million in operating income. So when you net all that out, it's really no impact for the month of -- for September. 
Now looking at the expense level, the expense levels have been very constant in the $11 million range. So there's very little in the way of volatility over the last several quarters. So $11 million per month is a good run rate. 
And then when you look at the revenue, it -- if you looked at it for a full quarter, if you took the $22 million, multiply it by 3 to give yourself a quarterly -- quarterly amount of $66 million.

So those are -- those would be the numbers that I would work with in terms of run rates."

You may recall, it was back in 2017 that CME Group devised its new Bitcoin reference rate, which has become an essential reference rate for the industry. We also created a reference rate for Ether. So these reference rates are highly used by the world now, and again, were created by CME in conjunction with partners. So that's one of the unique value propositions. 
In addition to that, we offer, as you know, asset classes across the spectrum, across the entire commodities spectrum, across the entire financial spectrum, across equities, rates and foreign exchange. So I think the combination of all of the products that we offer is enormous. In addition to that, we are highly regulated. We are highly transparent and we have an enormous distribution out to our partners. 
CME Group, you, I'm sure, know, has a 170-year history of being the most reliable exchange in the United States to offer partners. So I hope that, that helps to understand some of the value propositions."

And as Sean touched on, what I think is really important to highlight, is derivatory aspect of CME's business, especially its crypto offering. You can imagine there's many people that are now more and more every day looking for some form of exposure as cryptos are becoming more and more acceptable. The -- maybe the problem with that would be also the appreciation of the price of the product. People are maybe a little bit more concerned about where they go to get that risk, and they want to make sure they're at a regulated platform. Another reason the credibility of having a highly regulated platform is a benefit not only to our crypto franchise but the entire CME Group. Sunil?"

Right now with huge growth in our SOFR futures and, as I said, we're also seeing enormous growth in our Eurodollar futures and option, so we're seeing both marketplaces grow in parallel side by side. So that's actually a very exciting development. As you go into the next couple of years, that will also increase, and we expect to see an increase in the spread trading between the Eurodollars and the SOFR futures. 
In addition to that, you may recall we launched BSBY futures, not too long ago, where we're also doing about 7,000 to 8,000 contracts a day depending upon the time frame. So the transition of the short-term interest rate business to a new rate, whether it is the BSBY or the term SOFR or SOFR, is actually a very positive thing in regards to the intercommodities trading between -- or the spread trading between the different instruments. So that's actually a very positive development. I also remarked earlier that we've seen enormous growth in the SOFR-linked products, again, with an ADV of more than 1.6 million contracts a day in the third quarter. So that's growing very strongly. 
In terms of incentives, yes, we have had incentives, as anyone who follows us closely knows, whenever we start a market. And so we have had significant incentives in our SOFR futures over the recent quarters. The good news there is that means that that's already priced into our revenues to a large extent. So we will expect to continue those incentives for a period of time. But as you can imagine, as we have with all of our products, you know the history, I'm sure, of our Bitcoin futures and how we've reduced incentives there, our Micro E-minis and how we reduced incentives there and how those RPCs grew pretty dramatically once those marketplaces got up and running. 
So we would expect that as we get greater adoption of SOFR relative to Eurodollars, that the incentives in SOFR would decline on a relative basis. So again, we're already spending a lot of money on incentives. That's already baked in, in the last 12 months. And yes, we will continue to have some incentive spend, but I don't expect any kind of a significant increase."

In terms of fees, Sean's right, we do have some market maker programs in place. It's embedded in the revenue that we've got right now. Over time, we would view SOFR being treated just like the rest of our short-term interest rate products. So I don't see there being any unusual headwinds because of SOFR versus any of our other short-term incentive products. And this is something that we, as a team, Julie, Sean, myself and Derek and others, we look at our pricing all the time to ensure that we are pricing our products appropriately to maximize our top line and to create as much liquidity as we can across our platform 24 hours a day."

We're going to convert that, but we're talking about a 30-year conversion possibly. We're talking about -- in just a couple of years, we're going to convert trillions of dollars of assets benchmarked to LIBOR into something else, which we believe we're in the strongest position of anybody to capture that risk offset. And that is with the products that Sean outlined. 
Now that will not be just a measure of open interest. It will be a measure of many things as we go through this transition. To me, this might be the most exciting time in the history of interest rate trading that I've ever seen in my 41 years here at the CME. So to me, I'm very optimistic about it, but I will not judge it on open interest alone. I won't judge it on one particular issue alone. There's many factors that are going to go into this. And Sean outlined some of the things that we have right now, not only on incentives, but with the BSBY product, with Bloomberg, with the short-term SOFR rate and with the SOFR futures and options, we think we're in a really strong position. And one of the benchmarks is open interest, and just Sean gave it to you, we are the leader in that one by a long shot. So I'm very pleased with this transition."

So still a very -- we're on path for a very strong year in retail. It's looking to be the second highest revenue year on record for us. I think the participation there is definitely strongest in the equity suite of those micro products. And performance was a bit subdued through some of the quarter until volatility started to pick up a little bit in kind of mid-September. And since then, we've definitely seen further uptick in the business. 
But it kind of also speaks to just the diversity of our suite, right? So the retail adoption of things like our agricultural products has never been stronger than what we've seen this year. So ag revenue for retail in APAC was up 86%; North American, up 30%. So overall participation to this is very, very strong. We're on pace to about 375,000 traders in our markets this year, likely only surpassed by where we ended last year, which was a record year. 
And we talked quite a bit as well about the new client acquisition in the space. That has been strong as well. We've brought on 134,000 new retail traders and really looking -- specifically, when we looked at June, July and August, in 2021, we outpaced those levels that we saw in 2020 during those exact same months. How we're doing that continues to be the same thing that we've talked about before. It's really about driving that retail traffic to our digital properties there. We saw that activity more than double from where we were last year. And also just the interest in our educational materials, we've had about 1 million retail traders visit those properties through Q3, which is great. 
And our partnership, those global broker partners that we have, the educational, the outreach efforts that they make a huge part of this. In Asia alone, our broker partners have reached about 1.7 million active traders year-to-date. And we've seen our digital educational events activities up over 178%.

So appreciate the question, Michael. So I think probably the easiest way to start in our material that we precirculated on Slide 4, you'll notice some very detailed comments about some of the products that we've launched and what those mean to our franchise, specifically on the environmental product side. As you know, we've launched in August, our nature-based GEO contracts. GEO is the global emissions offset contracts, that complements the GEO contracts we launched earlier this year. And we continue to see significant traction there, not just in terms of the traded volumes but, more importantly, the open interest that we're accruing and then the deliveries that we're seeing of these contracts as well. 
So since launch, we've actually now seen a peak -- we hit a peak open interest record of just over 10,000 contracts on December 21. We hit a new record just on Friday. And what's important about that is while these contracts are now seen record open interest terms, we're also seeing record amounts of physical deliveries of these offset certificates as well. So we've now facilitated the physical delivery of 146,000 offset credits across 4 separate delivery cycles. 
And just to put that into context for what that means for customers that are taking delivery of these certificates, that's the equivalent of 146 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. So this is a market that started really about 2 years ago. We partnered exclusively, as we shared with you on previous calls, with CBL expanse of the largest spot platform in the voluntary offset market in the carbon markets. And we now are delivering record amounts of volume through the platform and delivery of these certificates through 4 delivery cycles. We'll have another one this week. 
So this is a new market. We just launched our nature-based contracts in August of this year. So that's pretty significant traction early on. There is a lot that's expected out of this conference in Glasgow, COP26. And as we continue to work with the markets and connect where we are now on the global basis of where these kind of go, it's a complement to the work that we've already done and continue to do on the equity side where we host the world's largest ESG contract by nominal value, our S&P 500 ESG Index futures, which has seen open interest above $4 billion notional value, which is pretty significant. 
So when you look at the space, whether it's on the environmental product side, the traction that we're seeing in a market that we are at the cutting edge of developing on the voluntary carbon market side or how we're servicing the needs of customers that are looking for ESG-compliant investment vehicles, we're leaders in both of those spaces. So we're happy with our positioning. We feel like we've chosen good partners. And I think the market, as it adapts to a new world of carbon neutrality, we feel like we're in a strong position there with the success we've already had."

We released our executive summary, as John said, which provided extensive details on the third quarter of 2021. I have John, Sean, Derek, Sunil, Julie Winkler on the call this morning, and we all look forward to addressing any questions you have.
Before I begin, in addition to John, who will discuss the financial results, I'm going to have Sean and Derek to make some comments. With all the recent news associated with interest rates and energy, I thought it was important that they present this morning.
With that, we delivered solid volume during the third quarter of this year as we averaged 17.8 million contracts per day, which was up 14% versus third quarter last year. We saw year-over-year strength in our interest rates and energy businesses and saw significant options growth of 45% during Q3. Rates average daily volume rose 53%, including 78% growth in Eurodollars and 41% growth in treasuries, as the expectations of future rate hikes has increased.
We continued to launch innovative new products, tools and services to support customer needs, including additions to our suite of micro-sized contracts that allow market users to customize their trading and hedging as well as ESG-focused futures contracts that help manage climate-related risk.
In terms of specific products and services, we had 2 consecutive quarterly ADV records in SOFR futures in Q2 and Q3 as the market continues to manage their interest rate risk ahead of key transition deadlines. Bitcoin futures ADV increased 170% compared with the third quarter last year. Ether futures are also off to a good start since their launch in the first quarter this year. In September, we launched the derivatives industry's first-ever Sustainable Clearing service to help market participants track and report on how their hedging activities are advancing their sustainable goals.
Finally, Micro WTI and Micro Treasury Yield contracts began trading in July and August, respectively. The Micro WTI contract represents the most successful commodity product launch in our history with over 1 million contracts traded within the first 20 days and a total of 4.3 million contracts traded since July 12 launch. Most importantly, this innovative new contract is attracting new customers to our energy market as evidenced by the fact that almost 10,000 Micro WTI market participants have not traded any other CME Group crude oil product in 2021. You'll hear more about this in a moment from both Derek and Sean, respectively.
In the third quarter, non-U.S. ADV was up 13% to 5 million contracts per day. We saw 15% growth in Europe, 8% growth in Asia, 32% growth in Latin America and 10% growth in the U.S. Also during the quarter, we completed our joint venture with IHS Markit and together launched OSTTRA, a leading provider of progressive post-trade solutions for the global OTC market across interest rates, equities, FX and credit asset classes.
Turning to Q4, we have had a strong start so far in October, averaging more than 20 million contracts, which is an increase of 35% month-to-date compared to the same point in October last year. Interest rates in energy are up double digits with rates up 90%.
With that, let me turn it over to Sean to give you more flavor as it relates to interest rates."
2004577,1680818015,2441379,"CME Group Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Terry. As Terry said, the financials unit saw a number of significant developments in the third quarter, particularly regarding SOFR, the overall rates market and our crypto business. Our SOFR futures saw average daily volume grow to",655,"Thank you very much, Terry. As Terry said, the financials unit saw a number of significant developments in the third quarter, particularly regarding SOFR, the overall rates market and our crypto business. Our SOFR futures saw average daily volume grow to 124,000 contracts per day in the third quarter, up over 180% year-over-year; and our open interest grew to over 1 million contracts, up 140% year-over-year.
Additionally, in the month of October, we're seeing average daily volume of 227,000 SOFR futures contracts and open interest of 1.2 million contracts. Over the last 60 days, our SOFR futures ADV made up over 78% of the global SOFR futures volumes and our open interest represents approximately 95%.
Further, on July 29, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve endorsed CME's 1-month, 3-month and 6-month term SOFR rates. And on September 19, CME began publishing a 12-month term SOFR rate as well. Demand for access to our term SOFR rate is very high, as we have already executed more than 100 term SOFR licenses to market participants, and we are currently working with an additional 300 firms who are also interested in licensing.
Our fallbacks for Eurodollar futures and options have also been a very strong success since we finalized our rule book back on March 29. SOFR-linked open interest includes SOFR futures as well as Eurodollar futures and options that reference a LIBOR rate which will be set after June 30, 2023. Those contracts have grown from 11.8 million open interest on March 29 to 16.3 million open interest as of October 25, up 38%. Further, the average daily volume of our SOFR-linked futures and options in Q3 was 1.6 million contracts, representing 52% of CME's total short-term interest rate ADV.
In addition, our long-held view regarding the rates market environment continues to gain veracity. Using CME's FedWatch tool, we can see the market is now pricing in a 60% chance of tightening by June 2022, up from just 17% just 1 month ago. Our FedWatch tool also now indicates an 87% chance of at least 2 Fed tightenings by the December 2022 FOMC meeting.
In Q3, the improving rates environment, as Terry said, led to a 53% growth in our interest rates ADV versus third quarter of 2020. Nonetheless, rate volatility, while higher in the third quarter of 2021 than it was in recent quarters, remained historically quite low. For example, in the eighth quarterly Eurodollar futures, it achieved just the 37th percentile of volatility versus a history going back to 2007. And our 10-year note futures achieved only a 25th percentile volatility ranking, showing the current volatility even in Q3 was very low.
Regarding CME Group's crypto offering, first, let me say, the recent approval of ETFs based on CME Bitcoin futures is not only an important milestone for our future contracts but also a positive development for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. This is a direct reflection of the strong growth and client demand for exposure to Bitcoin via CME's transparent, deeply liquid and regulated cryptocurrency futures contracts. The launch of ETFs based on CME's Bitcoin futures is validation from the industry of what we've known for some time, that CME Bitcoin futures are the leading source of bitcoin price discovery for the industry.
2 new Bitcoin ETFs were launched just last week and another this morning, both of which are based -- or all 3 of which are based on CME's Bitcoin futures. On the back of those launches, our Bitcoin futures October ADV has risen to over 12,000 contracts or over 60,000 equivalent bitcoin worth a record $3.5 billion per day, up 57% over September. Additionally, average open interest in our Bitcoin futures has grown to a record 17,433 contracts, up 70% versus September. Our Micro Bitcoin futures volume is also up 33% month-over-month, and our average open interest is up 97% month-over-month.
With that, I'll turn it over to Derek."

As Terry mentioned at the top of the call, we have seen a strong return of activity in our global energy business in the second half of this year with both crude oil and natural gas prices hitting multiyear highs. Overall, this has helped our global energy business to deliver average daily volume growth of 18% in the third quarter, led by energy options up 26% year-on-year.
WTI futures reached the $84 a barrel mark earlier this month for the first time since 2014, as OPEC maintained caution on production increases and as U.S. shale steadily recovers from the 2020 decline. Prices were further boosted from returning global demand as economies reopen.
In the U.S., gasoline consumption reached 10 million barrels a day in July, marking an all-time monthly high. Activity in WTI crude oil futures saw a 26% jump in average daily volume in the third quarter to 990,000 contracts; the WTI options average daily volume jumping 45%, 129,000 contracts. This helped us to deliver strong daily volume growth in our refined products portfolio as well with our gasoline product volume up 20% to 196,000 contracts and our heating oil products daily trading volume up 10% to 154,000 contracts.
This has helped set the stage for the significant success that we've delivered with our Micro WTI futures contract. Launched on July 12 of this year, as Terry mentioned, we surpassed 1 million contracts traded in the first 20 trading days, and we've already traded more than 4.3 million contracts since launch. Most importantly, this innovative new contract is attracting brand-new global customers to our energy market as evidenced by the fact that almost 10,000 Micro WTI customers have not traded any other CME Group crude oil product in 2021. These new customers come from 118 different countries and represent over 50% of our Micro WTI customer base. So this has been a significant source of new client acquisition for us.
At the same time, we have also seen the natural gas market experience the highest price level in over 13 years with U.S. Henry Hub futures hitting a high price of $6.45 earlier this month, more than tripling in price from the COVID-driven March 2020 lows. The resulting increase in volatility has boosted our Henry Hub futures business with September average daily volume of 496,000 contracts, up 11% year-on-year. Henry Hub options were particularly strong in the third quarter with average daily volume up 18% to 124,000 contracts, achieving our best months of August and September ever.  
Participation has been strong from our commercial customers, and we've seen our natural gas futures and options open interest jump to 6.2 million contracts in September, which is the highest level we've seen since January 2018.
So overall, we're seeing that the investments we're making in our product portfolio, our global client development and our technology pay strong dividends as market volatility returns, as our customer base manages their energy risk and CME Group's global benchmark products.
With that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the financial results."

During the third quarter, CME generated more than $1.1 billion in revenue with average daily volume up 14% compared to the same period last year. Expenses were very carefully managed and on an adjusted basis were $412 million for the quarter and $355 million, excluding license fees. CME had an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.3%, which resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, up 16% from the third quarter last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $33 million. CME paid out more than $300 million of dividends during the third quarter, and cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion. 
At the start of September, CME and IHS Markit launched OSTTRA, our post-trade services joint venture. As a result, CME will no longer be recording revenue and expenses associated with our post-trade businesses but will be recording our share of the joint venture earnings in the equity and net earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries line out of our income statement. 
For the month of September, CME would have recorded approximately $22 million in revenue and $11 million in expenses but instead recorded approximately $8 million in our share of the adjusted earnings of the joint venture. When you take into consideration tax implications and providing support services for the joint venture, there was essentially no impact to our overall earnings.
Turning to guidance, we now expect total adjusted operating expenses for 2021 excluding license fees and reflecting the impact of our joint venture to come in at approximately $1.5 billion, down about $30 million from our guidance at the start of the year. All other guidance remains unchanged.  
Finally, we are very pleased to say we achieved our planned $200 million in cumulative run rate expense synergies related to the NEX acquisition this quarter. Please refer to the last page of our executive commentary for additional financial highlights and details.

But the ETFs, as Sean stated in his comments, I think are very exciting for -- to be based off of CME futures. I think that in and of itself lends to the credibility of our product as a listed futures exchange and the regulation thereof.
To get more directly to your question around position limits associated with it, they are an important component to any market when you have a highly regulated entity like CME. So the existing position limits in our Bitcoin futures today, as you may or may not know, is 2,000 for spot. And then we have accountability levels going back in the deferred months that are much larger than that. But the spot month will go to 4,000 in November, and we feel very confident from a risk perspective that we are not being reckless in any which way, shape or form, that this has been vetted to our entire team here and with the agency.
So we've filed for those changes. We're confident that the product is mature enough now to increase the size of the limit. So again, we'll be careful here, Rich. This product, we launched in 2017, not 1917. So this is a newer product, a newer asset class, and we will be very, very cautious here. But again, we're excited by the uptake and the credibility associated with power shares and some of the other ETFs that decided to benchmark against our futures contract."

So in terms of our expense guidance, we did reduce our expense guidance after you adjust for the OSTTRA joint venture by an additional $15 million. So we're about $30 million down from our original guidance at th",658,"Yes. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate the question. So in terms of our expense guidance, we did reduce our expense guidance after you adjust for the OSTTRA joint venture by an additional $15 million. So we're about $30 million down from our original guidance at the start of the year.
When you think about what we've done on the expense side, this entire CME team has done an excellent job managing our costs. We continue to have that as a strong focus. And to put kind of our expense management into perspective, after adjusting for the creation of OSTTRA, we're about $12 million down from last year's adjusted expenses and almost $100 million down below 2019 levels.
When you look at our reduction of the $15 million, about half of that reduction reflects lower expected travel and in-person events. As you recall, at the beginning of the year, we had about $20 million we put in the back half of the year, assuming that we would be able to have additional travel. But as you can see, there's still limitations on travel, especially international travel. We have been seeing additional pickup in meetings, especially in Europe and London, in particular, but still, international travel is still a little bit tough.
And the balance is really -- of our reduction in terms of our guidance is just excellent, continued expense controls by the entire team, including careful hiring and careful use of contingent labor.
When you take a look at 2020's fourth quarter and 2021's fourth quarter, yes, we do see a pickup in costs. The fourth quarter is traditionally our highest expense quarter. Historically, marketing and advertising spend tend to be highest in the fourth quarter along with higher project spending as we wind up the current year and prepare for the next year. The spending this year reflects that same pattern, and we anticipated a higher-than-normal proportion of spend when we built out our spending plans at the start of the year.
We expect higher levels of spend in marketing and advertising, including targeting a portion of that spend on our successful micro products and in anticipation of a more open operating environment in 2022. We're also investing in system projects, including the migration of EBS and streaming services, which would lead to more technology-related costs.  
Also, our incentive compensation is anticipated to be higher in the fourth quarter of this year than the fourth quarter of last year. So those are some of the items which are causing the fourth quarter this year to be higher than the fourth quarter last year. But overall, for the entire year, some really impressive expense controls by the entire organization.
So in terms of thinking about modeling for next year, we're going through the budgeting process now. So it's really too early to provide guidance. We are hopeful for a more normalized environment, which would be positive for our business.
When looking at 2022, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. We did postpone salary increases in 2021 for our staff, and we don't anticipate doing the same this year for 2021 -- I mean sorry, for 2022. Also in an open business environment, which is obviously extremely fluid, we would anticipate increased travel, both regionally and globally, and more in-person events, which we would view as positive from a business perspective. But again, in November, it's a little tough to see that in 2022 yet. So we'll provide some additional guidance when we do our earnings in February.
We are starting to see some of that open up, like I mentioned before, in Europe. We'll continue to invest in our systems and technology capabilities with an eye towards accelerating growth globally. It is our intention that we will continue our excellent expense management as we build out our plans for next year. So that should give you a little bit of a flavor in terms of 2022."

And CME has been highlighting all these great things that have been happening. We've got a ton of innovation, OI building SOFR, the build-out of the micro products, the strength in energy. And in the macro, you've seen some rate movements at the 10-year in anticipation of higher rates at the short end of the curve and the commodity super cycle and the huge debt issuance you guys have highlighted. When do you think CME will start to see all these good things start to flow into the open interest growth? What's the outlook? When does the good translate into OI?"

I'm going to let Sean comment, maybe Sunil, as well, but let me give you a broad comment here. 
The open interest of 100 million to 109 million contracts open, which I think is what you're referring to, the trend over the last several -- probably a year or so since we came off of the high of 150 million, a lot of it is reflected in the interest rate business. We're going through a massive transition, as Sean pointed out earlier, from LIBOR to something else we suspect as SOFR, and people are trying to adjust associated with that. We're also seeing the low vol still that's -- even though we've seen an uptick in some of the things that you're referencing, the volatility is still significantly lower not only in interest rates but FX. I'm talking from a historical standpoint.
That is changing. You're correct in your comments. The question is when does it reflect in open interest? We believe there is open -- the participants are in there, participating. But you got to remember, our open interest today is a little bit different than it was just a couple of years ago. We didn't have weekly options on a lot of these products. We didn't have some of the expirations constantly coming on and off. So people are taking exposures for projected periods of time, might be days versus quarters like it was historically. So we're seeing people manage their risk in a little bit different way, and I think that's reflective of the open interest as well.
So I think those are all a lot of factors going into it, fundamental being the main one, but a lot of it is some of the products, the way we offer people to manage risk right now, which I don't see that as a bad problem. I see that as a good problem because open interest, we don't get paid for. We get paid for transactions. And the way we're structuring it now, I think that's a much more powerful offering.  
But the open interest is a reflection of future trade. We've always said it to people, and we still believe in that. But at the same time, we're seeing people participate in the market because of what I just outlined a moment ago with options and other products to transition from 1 rate to another, the fundamentals and foreign exchange being extremely quiet. And we're also seeing massive directional changes in energy. As Derek pointed out earlier, we went from just 1.5 years ago to minus $37.50 to $84 a barrel. So you think about the massive directional participation in the marketplace has been truly one way, and a lot of people just don't believe that you can go from minus $37 a barrel to $84 a barrel in 1.5 years.  
So I think it's just an adjustment to the world that we live in today and people will, again, participate in holding more and more open interest. But right now, I don't see it as a bad problem because of what we -- what I just outlined. And I'll ask Sean to comment more."

In addition to that, another number we track very closely is the number of large open interest holders as reported by the CFTC. If you look at the second quarter of this year, and if you look across the financials products, rates, equities and foreign exchange, the average large open interest holder number across the second quarter was an all-time record high for the combined 3 asset classes.
If you look at the third quarter, we beat the second quarter. So I've had 2 back-to-back all-time record numbers of large open interest holders on average. If you look at our interest rates business, the most recent numbers from the CFTC indicate the rates business is just 1% below its all-time high in large open interest holders, and the foreign exchange business similarly is just a couple of percentage points below its all-time high.

It'll -- we'll be able to offer them new and innovative products, improved workflow and analytics. And also, we're going to be well positioned to really support the global banks, in particular.
So very excited about OSTTRA. We've, like I said, launched it in early September. We've got an integration plan that is being executed right now. And so far, we've been very pleased with the leadership there and working with our partners at IHS Markit.
So in terms of -- I'm going to break down in more detail the impacts for the month of September and -- which will be helpful. And then we could talk a little bit about what it looks like kind of going forward.
So in terms of revenue, like I said in my prepared remarks, it was about $22 million in revenue for the month of September we would have booked had we not launched OSTTRA.
Of that $7 million is in transaction fees and $15 million is in the other revenue line. From an expense perspective, it was about $11 million for the month of September. About $7 million of that was in compensation, and the rest was split between technology, other and pro fees.
In the equity and earnings section, equity and net earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries was $8 million in that line. Now that $8 million is net of tax. And then we had $1 million in the other line in that section of our income statement. Obviously, when we had the company before the formation of OSTTRA, you'd have the tax effect, the $11 million in operating income. So when you net all that out, it's really no impact for the month of -- for September.
Now looking at the expense level, the expense levels have been very constant in the $11 million range. So there's very little in the way of volatility over the last several quarters. So $11 million per month is a good run rate.
And then when you look at the revenue, it -- if you looked at it for a full quarter, if you took the $22 million, multiply it by 3 to give yourself a quarterly amount of $66 million. If you look over the last several quarters, the revenue has been in the $64 million to $66 million range per quarter.
So those are -- those would be the numbers that I would work with in terms of run rates."

And as Sean touched on, what I think is really important to highlight, is the regulatory aspect of CME's business, especially its crypto offering. You can imagine there's many people that are now more and more every day looking for some form of exposure as cryptos are becoming more and more acceptable. The -- maybe the problem with that would be also the appreciation of the price of the product. People are maybe a little bit more concerned about where they go to get that risk, and they want to make sure they're at a regulated platform.

So that's actually a very exciting development. As you go into the next couple of years, that will also increase, and we expect to see an increase in the spread trading between the Eurodollars and the SOFR futures.
In addition to that, you may recall we launched BSBY futures, not too long ago, where we're also doing about 7,000, 8,000 contracts a day depending upon the time frame. So the transition of the short-term interest rate business to a new rate, whether it is the BSBY or the term SOFR, or SOFR, is actually a very positive thing in regards to the intercommodities trading between -- or the spread trading between the different instruments. So that's actually a very positive development. I also remarked earlier that we've seen enormous growth in the SOFR-linked products, again, with an ADV of more than 1.6 million contracts a day in the third quarter. So that's growing very strongly.
In terms of incentives, yes, we have had incentives, as anyone who follows us closely knows, whenever we start a market. And so we have had significant incentives in our SOFR futures over the recent quarters. The good news there is that means that that's already priced into our revenues to a large extent. So we will expect to continue those incentives for a period of time. But as you can imagine, as we have with all of our products, you know the history, I'm sure, of our Bitcoin futures and how we've reduced incentives there, our Micro E-minis and how we reduced incentives there and how those RPCs grew pretty dramatically once those marketplaces got up and running.
So we would expect that as we get greater adoption of SOFR relative to Eurodollars, that the incentives in SOFR would decline on a relative basis. So again, we're already spending a lot of money on incentives. That's already baked in, in the last 12 months. And yes, we will continue to have some incentive spend, but I don't expect any kind of a significant increase."

In terms of fees, Sean's right, we do have some market maker programs in place. It's embedded in the revenue that we've got right now. Over time, we would view SOFR being treated just like the rest of our short-term interest rate products. So I don't see there being any unusual headwinds because of SOFR versus any of our other short-term incentive products.

And that is with the products that Sean outlined.
Now that will not be just a measure of open interest. It will be a measure of many things as we go through this transition. To me, this might be the most exciting time in the history of interest rate trading that I've ever seen in my 41 years here at the CME. So to me, I'm very optimistic about it, but I will not judge it on open interest alone. I won't judge it on one particular issue alone. There's many factors that are going to go into this. And Sean outlined some of the things that we have right now, not only on incentives, but with the BSBY product, with Bloomberg, with the short-term SOFR rate and with the SOFR futures and options, we think we're in a really strong position. And one of the benchmarks is open interest. Sean gave it to you. We are the leader in that one by a long shot. So I'm very pleased with this transition."

So still a very -- we're on path for a very strong year in retail. It's looking to be the second highest revenue year on record for us.

And performance was a bit subdued through some of the quarter until volatility started to pick up a little bit in kind of mid-September. And since then, we've definitely seen further uptick in the business.
But it kind of also speaks to just the diversity of our suite, right? So the retail adoption of things like our agricultural products has never been stronger than what we've seen this year. So ag revenue for retail in APAC was up 86%; North American, up 30%. So overall participation is very, very strong. We're on pace to about 375,000 traders in our markets this year, likely only surpassed by where we ended last year, which was a record year.
And we talked quite a bit as well about the new client acquisition in the space. That has been strong as well. We've brought on 134,000 new retail traders and really looking -- specifically, when we looked at June, July and August, in 2021, we outpaced those levels that we saw in 2020 during those exact same months. How we're doing that continues to be the same thing that we've talked about before. It's really about driving that retail traffic to our digital properties there. We saw that activity more than double from where we were last year. And also just the interest in our educational materials, we've had about 1 million retail traders visit those properties through Q3, which is great. 
And our partnership, those global broker partners that we have, the educational, the outreach efforts that they make a huge part of this. In Asia alone, our broker partners have reached about 1.7 million active traders year-to-date. And we've seen our digital educational events activities up over 178%.

You're correct. They are institutionally driven products, the ETFs.

So I think probably the easiest way to start in our material that we precirculated on Slide 4, you'll notice some very detailed comments about some of the products that we've launched and what those mean to our fr",505,"Yes. So appreciate the question, Michael. So I think probably the easiest way to start in our material that we precirculated on Slide 4, you'll notice some very detailed comments about some of the products that we've launched and what those mean to our franchise, specifically on the environmental product side. As you know, we've launched in August, our nature-based GEO contracts. GEO is the global emissions offset contracts, that complements the GEO contracts we launched earlier this year. And we continue to see significant traction there, not just in terms of the traded volumes but, more importantly, the open interest that we're accruing and then the deliveries that we're seeing of these contracts as well.
So since launch, we've actually now seen a peak. We hit a peak open interest record of just over 10,000 contracts on December 21. We hit a new record just on Friday. And what's important about that is while these contracts are now seen record open interest terms, we're also seeing record amounts of physical deliveries of these offset certificates as well. So we've now facilitated the physical delivery of 146,000 offset credits across 4 separate delivery cycles.
And just to put that into context for what that means for customers that are taking delivery of these certificates, that's the equivalent of 146 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. So this is a market that started really about 2 years ago. We partnered exclusively, as we shared with you on previous calls, with CBL expanse of the largest spot platform in the voluntary offset market in the carbon markets. And we now are delivering record amounts of volume through the platform and delivery of these certificates through 4 delivery cycles. We'll have another one this week. 
So this is a new market. We just launched our nature-based contracts in August of this year. So that's pretty significant traction early on. There is a lot that's expected out of this conference in Glasgow, COP26. And as we continue to work with the markets and connect where we are now on the global basis of where these kind of go, it's a complement to the work that we've already done and continue to do on the equity side where we host the world's largest ESG contract by nominal value, our S&P 500 ESG Index futures, which has seen open interest above $4 billion notional value, which is pretty significant.
So when you look at the space, whether it's on the environmental product side, the traction that we're seeing in a market that we are at the cutting edge of developing on the voluntary carbon market side or how we're servicing the needs of customers that are looking for ESG-compliant investment vehicles, we're leaders in both of those spaces. So we're happy with our positioning. We feel like we've chosen good partners. And I think the market, as it adapts to a new world of carbon neutrality, we feel like we're in a strong position there with the success we've already had."
