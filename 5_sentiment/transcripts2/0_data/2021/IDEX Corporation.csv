Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX fourth quarter and full year 20",271,"Thank you. You may begin. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial highlights. 
Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months and the year ending December 31, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com. 
Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows. We will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's businesses, including a recap of our recent performance and how we are viewing 2021. Eric will then provide an update on a few initiatives that we believe are key to IDEX's culture before moving into a review of our order performance and providing our 2021 outlook for our end markets. Bill will then discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. And we'll conclude with an outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021. 
Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO. Eric?"

I'd like to start by thanking our people all around the world who have risen to the occasion during such a challenging year. It's been a year full of challenge and change with the numerous safety protocols and disruptions in the marketpla",1780,"Thank you, Mike. I'd like to start by thanking our people all around the world who have risen to the occasion during such a challenging year. It's been a year full of challenge and change with the numerous safety protocols and disruptions in the marketplace. In that environment, our people continue to shine. So to all the IDEX team members listening in on this call, thank you. 
Because of the protocols we have in place, the disruptions in our operations have been limited. The COVID trends across Europe, North America and India have been troubling, and we continue to follow those developments closely and remain steadfast in providing a safe place for our employees to work. We continue to deliver solutions for our customers during a challenging year, focusing on the critical innovation we need to support our long-term strategy as well as producing new products to help the fight against the pandemic. 
Bill will walk through the details shortly, with customer focus, strong execution and our ability to react quickly to unpredictable events helped us deliver relatively strong performance in 2020, a true testament to our resiliency. Liquidity was a primary focus of our management strategy as the pandemic hit, and I'm happy to say that we were able to drive record free cash flow this year. 
As we address the challenges in front of us, we see a path to bullishness for 2021. We have seen a steady recovery in our end markets, which we will detail in a few slides. The diversity and quality of our businesses continues to serve us well, ensuring that we can weather any storm and quickly capitalize when market conditions improve. 
While the pandemic still presents many challenges to solve, we are starting to see a focus pivot back to core commercial endeavors as we and our customers prepare for a world healed from the ravages of COVID-19. Our businesses remain focused on operating safely, and we are prepared to leverage our supply chains and react to increased demand. 
A year like 2020 truly test the culture of a company. Are you rooted in strong values that people really live and believe? If so, you'll be better prepared to survive and even thrive. IDEX is that kind of company, and it served us well in a year none of us could have ever predicted. I'm proud of the culture we have built at IDEX. It is admired by many, but we can strengthen it still. We leverage our culture and mission to bind together a uniquely decentralized and diverse company, and our commitment to work even harder to support diversity, equity and inclusion is tied directly to this important aspect of IDEX differentiation. 
Our resiliency, agility and fundamental ability to execute have IDEX exceptionally well positioned to play off as aggressively as we move forward. We are actively investing to support our best organic growth bets, and we have ramped up our capital spending to support very exciting initiatives. The M&A markets are moving again, and we are expanding our capabilities to execute on strategic acquisitions. 
In January, we announced an agreement to acquire ABL Pumps and expect that deal to close in the first quarter. We actively seek to deploy additional capital to acquire IDEX-like businesses as well as make some calculated bets in new technologies to bolster our growth potential to further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our return to shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 7. As I just mentioned, the strength of IDEX comes from the IDEX difference, a teachable methodology were great teams working together in a superior culture, focused on the critical things that matter with a natural orientation towards the most important needs of their customers. Our culture is a significant focus and one of my key leadership priorities. To that end, we are making ongoing improvements based on feedback we received from our employees every day. 
Last month, the IDEX Foundation, which was created to positively impact the communities in which we live and work, took a significant step forward as part of these efforts. IDEX committed $6 million to boost sponsored activities across the company. The foundation formerly added equity and opportunity as a lasting and fully funded part of its mission, creating opportunities for underserved, disadvantaged people of color in our communities. This donation allows the foundation to more than double its annual giving. In addition to initiatives focused on equity and opportunity, we will continue the great work our people have been doing in our communities like building homes for the homeless, renovating community centers and supporting schools and learning opportunities for young people. 
This month, we will host more than a dozen facilitated employee focus groups around the world. The feedback from our employees will help shape our path forward in diversity equity inclusion. Developing a formal framework and goals for our DD&I program is something we have all deployed at the senior leadership level making it a top priority. As part of that commitment, I intend to have a Senior DD&I leader in place reporting directly to me later this year. We will continue to grow and advance our culture as a key element of differentiation. You have my commitment on that. 
Turning now to our commercial results on Slide 8. The broad rebound in order rates we discussed in the third quarter continued as our fourth quarter organic orders were up 7% compared to the prior year. We entered the quarter with optimism based on the strength of the third quarter improvement, and that continued into the fourth quarter. Excluding timing on large OEM blanket orders year-over-year, our monthly order rates improved throughout the quarter. 
FMT organic orders for the fourth quarter were up 3%, driven by project orders in our water businesses, continued strength in agriculture and recovery in industrial day rate businesses. HST organic orders were up 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by new product initiatives in life sciences and the recovery in auto and semicon continuing to boost our Sealing Solutions businesses. Finally, Fire & Safety/Diversified organic orders were up 15% in the quarter. Dispensing saw significant improvement as retailers began to release pent-up demand for equipment refreshes, and after a strong bounce back in the third quarter, continued to improve based on auto market strength. And Fire & Safety saw growth in several product lines. 
A year ago, as we entered 2020, we talked about the general industrial slowdown that we were seeing and what a flat to down 2% to 5% world looked like for IDEX. We have proactively taken strategic actions to address these factors. We then faced the onset of the pandemic, and we responded to it with purpose. As we close out 2020 and look forward, we are optimistic that our units and markets are quickly on a path to pre-COVID levels. The actions that we took in 2019 and 2020 have left us well positioned as we move into 2021. 
Turning to Slide 9. We provide our current outlook for primary end markets. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to tick up in the fourth quarter, further solidifying the optimism that we discussed last quarter. We see this increase driven largely by OpEx needs of our customers. We continue to see large capital projects remain on hold. We anticipate that broader signs of economic stability and higher degrees of certainty on COVID recovery timing is required before capital projects begin to move again. But the investment discussions are happening. Our Water business has continued to show resiliency, and we are closely monitoring the total that 2020 will take on municipal budgets in 2021 and beyond. The strength in agriculture that we've called out for the previous 2 quarters has continued, and we expect it to grow in 2021. Energy markets continue to remain challenged with markets still down compared to 2019 levels. Stabilization of these businesses is largely dependent on increases in fuel prices, driving new capital investments in oil and gas. 
Turning to the Health and Science Technologies segment. As we discussed last quarter, we have identified opportunities and applications to help fight COVID across each of our segments, but particularly in HST. We were able to drive approximately $30 million of revenue in 2020 and expect to generate about the same amount in 2021 related to these initiatives. While some of this revenue is onetime in nature, we believe the technologies and applications we have developed here will generate recurring opportunities in 2022 and beyond. So relative to our $25 million to $100 million of opportunities we highlighted, we'll achieve about $60 million. 
AI improved during the fourth quarter and looks to be on the rebound in 2021. In life sciences, we saw an offset by continued weakness in IVD Bio as lab capacity is still largely focused on COVID response, putting on hold other projects and initiatives. The strength in semicon that we mentioned last quarter has continued. In addition, our ceilings business has benefited from a rebound in automotive. We see continued recovery in 2021 for the auto market, particularly driven by strength in European car sales in China and India. Food and pharma has also remained a bright spot as our businesses continue to benefit from growth in MPT projects and Microfluidics business. 
Moving to the Fire, Safety and Diversified segment. We saw continued improvement in most of our markets. The largest driver was the significant improvement in the dispensing market as large retailers increase demand for equipment refreshes, combined with order strength in the Asia dispensing markets. As mentioned previously, the pace of the auto recovery continues to exceed expectations, springing on our BAND-IT business. Fire & Rescue businesses continue to see strong order performance and we believe that we are seeing a recovery in the OEM businesses driving through some of the delays in backlog concerns we referenced last quarter. 
As with all our municipal businesses, we continue to closely monitor the impact on budgets to see if there are any lagging effects from COVID response spending. As I highlighted in my previous remarks, we are optimistic about the market recovery we are seeing across most of our markets. And we need to be prepared for potential interruptions, particularly in the first half of 2021. Our teams have shown the ability to address these short-term shocks proactively. And the strategic actions we have taken across our businesses has us well positioned to be able to ride the positive momentum we're seeing as we exit the issue of the pandemic. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year."

I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q4 orders of $679 million were up 10% overall and up 7% organically. Organic orders increased across each of our segments with drivers highlighted by Eric in his previous commen",1226,"Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q4 orders of $679 million were up 10% overall and up 7% organically. Organic orders increased across each of our segments with drivers highlighted by Eric in his previous comments. For the year, orders were down 3% overall and down 4% organically, with strong organic order recovery in the fourth quarter partially offsetting the 18% organic order decline we saw in the second quarter at the height of the pandemic. 
Fourth quarter sales of $615 million were up 2% overall, but down 1% organically. Our industrial and energy markets led to decline, but did have positive organic growth of around 60% of our reporting units, led by strong performance in our ceilings, MPT and dispensing businesses. Full year sales of $2.4 billion were down 6% overall and down 9% organically, driven by the impact of COVID, industrial market softness and challenges in oil and gas. 
Q4 gross margins contracted 20 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a decline in volume and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by price capture. For the full year, gross margins contracted 140 basis points. Excluding the impact of the FMD inventory step-up, adjusted gross margins contracted 130 basis points to 43.9%, driven by volume declines in sales mix, offset by our continued ability to capture price and drive operational productivity. 
Fourth quarter operating margin was 22.6%, up 50 basis points compared to prior year. Full year operating margin was 22.1%, down 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.4% for the fourth quarter, up 10 basis points compared to prior year and 22.8% for the year, down 140 basis points compared to 2019. I'll discuss the drivers of operating income on the following slide. 
Our Q4 effective tax rate was 22.2%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20.6%, due to the revaluation of foreign deferred income tax balances driven by changes in foreign tax rates. Fourth quarter adjusted net income was $105 million, resulting in an EPS of $1.37, up $0.04 or 3% over prior year adjusted EPS. Full year adjusted net income was $397 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $5.19, down $0.61 or 11% compared to prior year. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $149 million, up 9% compared to prior year and was 142% of adjusted net income. For the year, free cash flow was $518 million, a record for IDEX, up 9% versus last year and 131% of adjusted net income, driven by strong working capital performance. 
Moving on to Slide 12. We're going to review our full year adjusted operating income. As Eric mentioned, we faced unprecedented challenges in 2020, but the structural and discretionary actions we took were critical to lessen the volume impact on our income and margins. Using a similar framework as we have for the previous 2 quarters, we wanted to walk through the components of our full year adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income declined $66 million for the year. With organic sales down around $247 million, we would have expected a negative impact in operating income of $148 million at roughly 60% contribution margin rate. 
The $148 million was offset by $58 million of executed operational actions, $23 million from the impact of restructuring actions combined with $35 million of discretionary cost control items and $10 million of price, net productivity and negative business mix. Finally, we had $7 million of reduced variable compensation for the year. This yielded a better-than-expected flow-through of 34%. Again, organic flow-through is based on taking reported sales and op income, less the impact of FX and acquisitions, which was roughly $77 million on the top line and $7 million of profit. Overall, our team is focused on quickly managing the crisis at hand and effectively managing costs to mitigate revenue declines and has IDEX well positioned to leverage the recovery we expect in 2021. 
Moving on to guidance. I'm on Slide 13. Based on current order rates and expected market recoveries, we see an accelerating 2021 and expect organic revenue for the year to be up 6% to 8%. This translates to an EPS impact of roughly $0.75 to $0.95 depending on our top line results. We expect our productivity initiatives to more than offset inflation, providing $0.04 of benefits. The structural cost actions we have taken are expected to provide $0.12 of EPS benefit in the year. As we move past the pandemic, we will aggressively invest in both organic and inorganic opportunities. As business recovers, we will loosen discretionary cost controls as appropriate. As mentioned previously, we expect approximately 2/3 of the discretionary cost to return over time. Additionally, we'll be making investments to enhance our ability to execute and integrate M&A opportunities as we view this as a critical time to enhance our capabilities as well as continue to fund our targeted organic growth initiatives. These discretionary add-backs and strategic investments will provide approximately $0.19 to $0.26 of pressure in our 2021 guidance. Next, we anticipate $0.08 to $0.11 headwind from variable compensation as we reset our incentive comp for the year. Finally, FMD has 1/4 of inorganic results, which we expect to provide $3 million of revenue but provide $0.03 of EPS pressure. The structural actions we have made to improve FMD's profit profile based on the situation in the energy market will get FMD back to positive op profit in the second quarter. 
Now let's take a look at a couple of nonoperational items. First, we expect an $0.18 headwind from tax, primarily related to discrete benefits we realized in 2020 associated with equity vesting and option exercising. Second, we expect a 2% tailwind from FX, providing $0.13 of EPS benefit. So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year, and EPS expectations are in the range of $5.65 to $5.95, a 9% to 15% increase over 2020. 
Moving to Slide 14. Let me provide some additional details regarding our 2021 guidance for both the first quarter and full year. In Q1, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.38 to $1.42 with organic revenue growth of 2% to 4% and operating margins of approximately 23.5%. The Q1 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect a 3% top line benefit from the impact of FX, and corporate costs in the first quarter are expected to be around $18 million. 
Turning to some additional details for the full year guidance. Again, we're projecting full year EPS in the range of $5.65 to $5.95, with full year organic revenue to be up 6% to 8%, with operating margins between 23.5% to 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. And free cash flow is expected to be between 115% to 120% of net income. Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $70 million for the year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any associated cost or earnings with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. ABO Pump is not included in these estimates, and we will revise guidance once that deal is closed. 
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

So look, we talked a little bit here before about, obviously, we think that the technology cycle is compressed a lot. And no doubt, it was already kind of flying in a dynamic way. So as we're think",338,"Yes. Well, it's great to talk to you, Allison. Thank you. So look, we talked a little bit here before about, obviously, we think that the technology cycle is compressed a lot. And no doubt, it was already kind of flying in a dynamic way. So as we're thinking about that at IDEX, we're thinking about organic bets and development that we're going to do internally, but no doubt, we're going to have to appropriate some of this from the outside world. 
And I think that -- you can think of that as a range of technologies. I mean for a lot of our component products, it's probably going to come down to things like sensors and data readouts. From other businesses that we have, it might be more analytical in nature. So it's going to take some of the inputs that we're able to provide in a severe duty space and come up to some determinant outcome and present that to our customers. 
So I think it would run the gamut from everything from embedded sensors and control elements up to, frankly, some software pieces that might be out there that would stick and sit very nice comfortably next to some pieces of our business. And I just think, ultimately, the call on that is going to be speed, speed and the ability to impact a solution in a way that we think will give us some differentiated edge. 
No doubt, when you're looking at assets, especially on the inorganic side, the economics can often work in different ways. And so we challenge our teams to think about value creation in a different way as well in terms of how it might extend our solution, bring us closer to customers, lead to other open doors. So we're spending an awful lot of time on that as a team. Bill and I and the rest of the senior team and really putting our heads together and what that will look like for IDEX, but we're excited about it."

Then I think partially -- thinking back a bit to the comments around Allison's question, the technologies and how that's go into layer across the solution sets that we have at IDEX, recognizing we've got a lot of different states of evolution, depending on the company, that's a place where I'm spending an awful lot of time to make sure that we're thoughtful and not, in some ways, kind of overdoing it with a center-led answer because that's not really the appropriate response. And then I would end with certainly capital allocation and a lot of focus on how we can, frankly, put in some more of it to work in the environment that's tough. But we're doing some things around the focused resources, focused pieces of the company and a lot just very iterative thinking as a team of how we can tackle that and, frankly, capitalize on the engine that we've really built over the last 2 years.

I mean no doubt, that's definitely an area that we're watching with a lot of focus. As you know, I mean these markets tend to lag an awful lot. And so if something bad happens in the world, it takes a while for it to read through. And then, of course, as you think of kind of our exposure layered on top of it, particularly the 2 areas that you mentioned, we're doing very important work that many times is buffered against some of it. So on the water side, we're heavily tilted towards the analytical side, analytical services and support. So even if the system has to make do with infrastructure, might have to delay and some kind of lay out a heavy infrastructure, they often turn our kind of work to make sure that they're leveraging the system that they do have. Frankly, also on the water side, I mean, if we go to an area where the environmental compliance has stepped up a bit, that's another dynamic that helps us there. So that's against that sort of other trend that we are watching around budget support and budget assurance. So the 2 things are kind of working there together, but we see that same resiliency. 
Fire & Rescue, again, this is one of the most global space we have. And so no doubt, in the more mature spaces, CapEx purchases, considering where the source of that funding is going to come from, it's always something that we're thinking about and tracking. But we are -- we course corrected it here. And so it's a different story in some of the emerging markets where we've got great presence and, frankly, a lot of technology and people on the ground. So I think that global breadth helps us on that side as well. But no doubt, we're watching the same dynamics that you all are as we go forward. We're looking to see if there's backstopping and support or not all over the world. And we think we're well positioned."

I think it's kind of consistent sequential improvement as we progress through the year. If you look at the 6% to 8% and where we are in the first quarter, there is kind of a gradual improvement that we need to achieve each quarter that's reasonable. When you think about the 6% to 8%, between the segments, HST a little bit on the high end, FMT in the middle and FSD on the lower side. So generally, balanced with small sequential improvements as we progress. And obviously, we have some targeted growth things that will phase out through the year that could inflect that, plus or minus.

And so I think relative to a lot of people, we probably don't experience at the same levels. Our teams now, for quite a while, frankly, even going back to the times where we were talking a lot more about tariffs and things like that have been thinking about where we have key sources of supply, how we can make that, frankly, more flexible.

It was -- obviously, it faced some headwinds last year, like a lot of life sciences did related to sort of up and down the street, medical things and analytical services. We did see a nice bounce back there in the fourth quarter for AI. I think it kind of returns to its sort of historical rates as we go forward. The IVD Bio side, which is also pretty mature, that's the one that's still got the most pressure on it. It's much more dependent on people going and visiting labs and then has a consumable stream that tends to be out ahead of capital purchases, and that's kind of where we come in. So consider that a bit of an offset to the AI story. 
And then pretty quickly, we get into the more dynamic pieces of this related to the works that we do in genomics. And obviously, the rapid test is the most dynamic of them all. So we put all that together. I think we tried to lay that out here. But I would say say in general, look, this is a robust sector. It's obviously doing work that the world needs right now.

This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial highlights.  
Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months and the year ending December 31, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com.  
Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows: we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's businesses, including a recap of our recent performance and how we are viewing 2021. Eric will then provide an update on a few initiatives that we believe are key to IDEX's culture before moving into a review of our order performance and providing our 2021 outlook for our end markets. Bill will then discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. And we'll conclude with an outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021.  
Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

I'd like to start by thanking our people all around the world who have risen to the occasion during such a challenging year.

I'd like to start by thanking our people all around the world who have risen to the occasion during such a challenging year. It's been a year full of challenge and change with the numerous safety protocols and disruptions in the marketplace. In that environment, our people continue to shine. So to all the IDEX team members listening in on this call, thank you.  
Because of the protocols we have in place, the disruptions in our operations have been limited. The COVID trends across Europe, North America and India have been troubling, and we continue to follow those developments closely and remain steadfast in providing a safe place for our employees to work. We continue to deliver solutions for our customers during a challenging year, focusing on the critical innovation we need to support our long-term strategy as well as producing new products to help the fight against the pandemic.  
Bill will walk through the details shortly, with customer focus, strong execution and our ability to react quickly to unpredictable events helped us deliver a relatively strong performance in 2020, a true testament to our resiliency. Liquidity was a primary focus of our management strategy as the pandemic hit, and I'm happy to say that we were able to drive record free cash flow this year.  
As we address the challenges in front of us, we see a path to bullishness for 2021. We have seen a steady recovery in our end markets, which we will detail in a few slides. The diversity and quality of our businesses continues to serve us well, ensuring that we can weather any storm and quickly capitalize when market conditions improve.  
While the pandemic still presents many challenges to solve, we are starting to see a focus pivot back to core commercial endeavors as we and our customers prepare for a world healed from the ravages of COVID-19. Our businesses remain focused on operating safely, and we are prepared to leverage our supply chains and react to increased demands.  
A year like 2020 truly test the culture of a company. Are you rooted in strong values that people really live and believe? If so, you'll be better prepared to survive and even thrive. IDEX is that kind of company, and it served us well in a year none of us could have ever predicted. I'm proud of the culture we have built at IDEX. It is admired by many, but we can strengthen it still. We leverage our culture and mission to bind together a uniquely decentralized and diverse company, and our commitment to work even harder to support diversity, equity and inclusion is tied directly to this important aspect of IDEX differentiation.  
Our resiliency, agility and fundamental ability to execute have IDEX exceptionally well positioned to play off as aggressively as we move forward. We are actively investing to support our best organic growth bets, and we have ramped up our capital spending to support very exciting initiatives. The M&A markets are moving again, and we are expanding our capabilities to execute on strategic acquisitions.  
In January, we announced an agreement to acquire Abel Pumps and expect that deal to close in the first quarter. We actively seek to deploy additional capital to acquire IDEX-like businesses as well as make some calculated bets in new technologies to bolster our growth potential to further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our return to shareholders.  
Moving to Slide 7. As I just mentioned, the strength of IDEX comes from the IDEX difference, a teachable methodology where great teams working together in a superior culture, focused on the critical things that matter with a natural orientation towards the most important needs of their customers. Our culture is a significant focus and one of my key leadership priorities. To that end, we are making ongoing improvements based on feedback we received from our employees every day.  
Last month, the IDEX Foundation, which was created to positively impact the communities in which we live and work, took a significant step forward as part of these efforts. IDEX committed $6 million to boost sponsored activities across the company. The foundation formerly added equity and opportunity as a lasting and fully funded part of its mission, creating opportunities for underserved, disadvantaged people of color in our communities. This donation allows the foundation to more than double its annual giving. In addition to initiatives focused on equity and opportunity, we will continue the great work our people have been doing in our communities like building homes for the homeless, renovating community centers and supporting schools and learning opportunities for young people.  
This month, we will host more than a dozen facilitative employee focus groups around the world. The feedback from our employees will help shape our path forward in diversity equity inclusion. Developing a formal framework and goals for our DE&I program is something we have all deployed at the senior leadership level making it a top priority. As part of that commitment, I intend to have a Senior DE&I leader in place reporting directly to me later this year. We will continue to grow and advance our culture as a key element of differentiation. You have my commitment on that.  
Turning now to our commercial results on Slide 8. Broad rebound in order rates we discussed in the third quarter continued as our fourth quarter organic orders were up 7% compared to the prior year. We entered the quarter with optimism based on the strength of the third quarter improvement, and that continued into the fourth quarter. Excluding timing on large OEM blanket orders year-over-year, our monthly order rates improved throughout the quarter.  
FMT organic orders for the fourth quarter were up 3%, driven by project orders in our water businesses, continued strength in agriculture and recovery in industrial day rate businesses. HST organic orders were up 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by new product initiatives in life sciences and the recovery in auto and semicon continuing to boost our Sealing Solutions businesses. 
Finally, Fire & Safety/Diversified organic orders were up 15% in the quarter. Dispensing saw significant improvement as retailers began to release pent-up demand for equipment refreshes [ banded ], after a strong bounce back in the third quarter, continued to improve based on auto market strength. And Fire & Safety saw growth in several product lines.  
A year ago, as we entered 2020, we talked about the general industrial slowdown that we were seeing and what a flat to down 2% to 5% world looked like for IDEX. We have proactively taken strategic actions to address these factors. We then faced the onset of the pandemic, and we responded to it with purpose. As we close out 2020 and look forward, we are optimistic that our units and markets are quickly on a path to pre-COVID levels. The actions that we took in 2019 and 2020 have left us well positioned as we move into 2021.  
Turning to Slide 9. We provide our current outlook for primary end markets. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to tick up in the fourth quarter, further solidifying the optimism that we discussed last quarter. We see this increase driven largely by OpEx needs of our customers. We continue to see large capital projects remain on hold. We anticipate that broader signs of economic stability and higher degrees of certainty on COVID recovery timing is required before capital projects begin to move again. But the investment discussions are happening. 
Our Water business has continued to show resiliency, and we are closely monitoring the toll that 2020 will take on municipal budgets in 2021 and beyond. The strength in agriculture that we've called out for the previous 2 quarters has continued, and we expect it to grow in 2021. Energy markets continue to remain challenged with markets still down compared to 2019 levels. Stabilization of these businesses is largely dependent on increases in fuel prices, driving new capital investments in oil and gas.  
Turning to the Health and Science Technologies segment. As we discussed last quarter, we have identified opportunities and applications to help fight COVID across each of our segments, but particularly in HST. We were able to drive approximately $30 million of revenue in 2020 and expect to generate about the same amount in 2021 related to these initiatives. While some of this revenue is onetime in nature, we believe the technologies and applications we have developed here will generate recurring opportunities in 2022 and beyond. So relative to our $25 million to $100 million of opportunities we highlighted, we'll achieve about $60 million.  
AI improved during the fourth quarter and looks to be on the rebound in 2021. In life sciences, we saw an offset by continued weakness in IVD/BIO as lab capacity is still largely focused on COVID response, putting on hold other projects and initiatives. The strength in semicon that we mentioned last quarter has continued. In addition, our ceilings business has benefited from a rebound in automotive. We see continued recovery in 2021 for the auto market, particularly driven by strength in European car sales in China and India. Food and pharma has also remained a bright spot as our businesses continue to benefit from growth in MPT projects and Microfluidics business.  
Moving to the Fire & Safety/Diversified segment. We saw continued improvement in most of our markets. The largest driver was the significant improvement in the dispensing market as large retailers increase demand for equipment refreshes, combined with order strength in the Asia dispensing markets. 
As mentioned previously, the pace of the auto recovery continues to exceed expectations, springing on our BAND-IT business. Fire & Rescue businesses continued to see strong order performance and we believe that we are seeing a recovery in the OEM businesses, driving through some of the delays in backlog concerns we referenced last quarter.  As with all our municipal businesses, we continue to closely monitor the impact on budgets to see if there are any lagging effects from COVID response spending. 
As I highlighted in my previous remarks, we are optimistic about the market recovery we are seeing across most of our markets. And we need to be prepared for potential interruptions, particularly in the first half of 2021. Our teams have shown the ability to address these short-term shocks proactively. And the strategic actions we have taken across our businesses has us well positioned to be able to ride the positive momentum we're seeing as we exit the issue of the pandemic.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year."

I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q4 orders of $679 million were up 10% overall and up 7% organically.

Q4 orders of $679 million were up 10% overall and up 7% organically. Organic orders increased across each of our segments with drivers highlighted by Eric in his previous comments. For the year, orders were down 3% overall and down 4% organically, with strong organic order recovery in the fourth quarter partially offsetting the 18% organic order decline we saw in the second quarter at the height of the pandemic.  
Fourth quarter sales of $615 million were up 2% overall, but down 1% organically. Our industrial and energy markets led the decline, but did have positive organic growth of around 60% of our reporting units, led by strong performance in our ceilings, MPT and dispensing businesses. Full year sales of $2.4 billion were down 6% overall and down 9% organically, driven by the impact of COVID, industrial market softness and challenges in oil and gas.  
Q4 gross margins contracted 20 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a decline in volume and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by price capture. For the full year, gross margins contracted 140 basis points. Excluding the impact of the FMD inventory step-up, adjusted gross margins contracted 130 basis points to 43.9%, driven by volume declines in sales mix, offset by our continued ability to capture price and drive operational productivity.  
Fourth quarter operating margin was 22.6%, up 50 basis points compared to prior year. Full year operating margin was 22.1%, down 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.4% for the fourth quarter, up 10 basis points compared to prior year and 22.8% for the year, down 140 basis points compared to 2019. I'll discuss the drivers of operating income on the following slide.  
Our Q4 effective tax rate was 22.2%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20.6% due to the revaluation of foreign deferred income tax balances driven by changes in foreign tax rates. Fourth quarter adjusted net income was $105 million, resulting in an EPS of $1.37, up $0.04 or 3% over prior year adjusted EPS. Full year adjusted net income was $397 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $5.19, down $0.61 or 11% compared to prior year.  
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $149 million, up 9% compared to prior year and was 142% of adjusted net income. For the year, free cash flow was $518 million, a record for IDEX, up 9% versus last year and 131% of adjusted net income, driven by strong working capital performance.  
Moving on to Slide 12. We're going to review our full year adjusted operating income. As Eric mentioned, we faced unprecedented challenges in 2020, but the structural and discretionary actions we took were critical to lessen the volume impact on our income and margins. Using a similar framework as we have for the previous 2 quarters, we wanted to walk through the components of our full year adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income declined $66 million for the year. With organic sales down around $247 million, we would have expected a negative impact in operating income of $148 million at roughly 60% contribution margin rate.  
The $148 million was offset by $58 million of executed operational actions, $23 million from the impact of restructuring actions combined with $35 million of discretionary cost control items and $10 million of price, net productivity and negative business mix. Finally, we had $7 million of reduced variable compensation for the year. This yielded a better-than-expected flow-through of 34%. Again, organic flow-through is based on taking reported sales and op income, less the impact of FX and acquisitions, which was roughly $77 million on the top line and $7 million of profit.  
Overall, our team's focused on quickly managing the crisis at hand and effectively managing costs to mitigate revenue declines and has IDEX well positioned to leverage the recovery we expect in 2021.  
Moving on to guidance. I'm on Slide 13. Based on current order rates and expected market recoveries, we see an accelerating 2021 and expect organic revenue for the year to be up 6% to 8%. This translates to an EPS impact of roughly $0.75 to $0.95, depending on our top line results.  We expect our productivity initiatives to more than offset inflation, providing $0.04 of benefits. The structural cost actions we have taken are expected to provide $0.12 of EPS benefit in the year. 
As we move past the pandemic, we will aggressively invest in both organic and inorganic opportunities. As business recovers, we will loosen discretionary cost controls as appropriate. As mentioned previously, we expect approximately 2/3 of the discretionary cost to return over time.
Additionally, we will be making investments to enhance our ability to execute and integrate M&A opportunities as we view this as a critical time to enhance our capabilities as well as continue to fund our targeted organic growth initiatives. These discretionary add-backs and strategic investments will provide approximately $0.19 to $0.26 of pressure in our 2021 guidance. 
Next, we anticipate $0.08 to $0.11 headwind from variable compensation as we reset our incentive comp for the year. Finally, FMD has 1/4 of inorganic results, which we expect to provide $3 million of revenue but provide $0.03 of EPS pressure. The structural actions we have made to improve FMD's profit profile based on the situation in the energy market will get FMD back to positive op profit in the second quarter.  
Now let's take a look at a couple of nonoperational items. First, we expect an $0.18 headwind from tax, primarily related to discrete benefits we realized in 2020, associated with equity vesting and option exercising. Second, we expect a 2% tailwind from FX, providing $0.13 of EPS benefit. So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year, and EPS expectations are in the range of $5.65 to $5.95, a 9% to 15% increase over 2020.  
Moving to Slide 14. Let me provide some additional details regarding our 2021 guidance for both the first quarter and full year. In Q1, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.38 to $1.42 with organic revenue growth of 2% to 4% and operating margins of approximately 23.5%. The Q1 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect a 3% top line benefit from the impact of FX, and corporate costs in the first quarter are expected to be around $18 million.  
Turning to some additional details for the full year guidance. Again, we're projecting full year EPS in the range of $5.65 to $5.95 with full year organic revenue to be up 6% to 8%, with operating margins between 23.5% to 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. And free cash flow is expected to be between 115% to 120% of net income. Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $70 million for the year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any associated cost or earnings with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. Abel Pump is not included in these estimates, and we will revise guidance once that deal is closed.  
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

And no doubt, it was already kind of flying in a dynamic way. So as we're thinking about that at IDEX, we're thinking about organic bets and development that we're going to do internally, but no doubt, we're going to have to appropriate some of this from the outside world.  
And I think that -- you can think of that as a range of technologies. I mean for a lot of our component products, it's probably going to come down to things like sensors and data readouts. From other businesses that we have, it might be more analytical in nature. So it's going to take some of the inputs that we're able to provide in a severe duty space and come up to some determinant outcome and present that to our customers.  
So I think it would run the gamut from -- everything from embedded sensors and control elements up to, frankly, some software pieces that might be out there that would stick and sit very nice, comfortably next to some pieces of our business. And I just think, ultimately, the call on that is going to be speed, speed and the ability to impact a solution in a way that we think will give us some differentiated edge.  
No doubt, when you're looking at assets, especially on the inorganic side, the economics can often work in different ways. And so we challenge our teams to think about value creation in a different way as well in terms of how it might extend our solution, bring us closer to customers, lead to other open doors. So we're spending an awful lot of time on that as a team; Bill and I and the rest of the senior team and really putting our heads together and what that will look like for IDEX, but we're excited about it."

So in an environment that probably has even more of that, going to the next level there is hugely important. 
Then I think, partially, thinking back a bit to the comments around Allison's question, technology and how that's going to layer across the solution sets that we have at IDEX, recognizing we've got a lot of different states of evolution depending on the companies, that's a place, where I'm spending an awful lot of time to make sure that we're thoughtful and not, in some ways, kind of overdoing it with a center-led answer, because that's not really the appropriate response.
And then I would end with, certainly, capital allocation and a lot of focus on how we can frankly put some more of it to work. The environment's tough, but we're doing some things around focused resources, focused pieces of the company and a lot of just very iterative thinking as a team of how we can tackle that and, frankly, capitalize on the engine that we really built over the last 2 years.

And I think you've given some good insight into how you're thinking about the end markets that Page 9 was especially helpful as was the bridge that Bill walked us through. 
So if I could just take a moment and ask for more specifics on your muni outlook, because that came up a couple of different times where you talked about the toll that COVID is taking.  But there's like 2 pieces to muni. One is water, which tends to be more resilient in Fire & Rescue, a little more CapEx. But what are your assumptions on muni budgets and spending here on those 2 areas?"

As you know, I mean, those markets tend to lag an awful lot. And so something bad happens in the world, and it takes a while for it to read through. 
And then, of course, if you think of kind of our exposure layered on top of it, particularly the 2 areas that you mentioned, we're doing very important work that that many times is buffered against some of it. So on the water side, we're heavily tilted towards the analytical side, analytical services and support. And so even if a system has to make do with infrastructure, might have to delay some kind of -- lay out a heavy infrastructure, they often turn to our kind of work to make sure that they're leveraging the system that they do have. 
Frankly, also on the water side, I mean, if we go into an era where the environmental compliance has stepped up a bit, that's another dynamic that helps us there. So that's against that sort of other trend that we are watching around budget support and budget assurance. So the 2 things are kind of working there together, but we see that same resiliency. Fire & Rescue, again, this is one of the most global stories that we have. And so no doubt, in the more mature spaces, CapEx purchases, considering where the source of that funding is going to come from is always something that we're thinking about and tracking. But we are -- we course correct a bit here. And so it's a different story in some of the emerging markets where we've got great presence and, frankly, a lot of technology and people on the ground.  So I think that global breadth helps us on that side as well. 
But no doubt, we're watching the same dynamics that you all are. As we go forward. We're looking to see if there's backstopping and support or not all over the world and -- but we think we're well positioned."

When you think about the 6% to 8% between the segments, HST, a little bit on the high end, FMT and the middle and FSD on the lower side.

It was -- obviously, it faced some headwinds last year, like a lot of life sciences did related to sort of up and down the street, medical things and analytical services. We did see a nice bounce back there in the fourth quarter for AI. I think it kind of returns to its sort of historical rates as we go forward. 
The IVD/BIO side, which is also pretty mature, that's the one that's still got the most pressure on it. It's much more dependent on people going and visiting labs and then has a consumable stream that tends to be out ahead of capital purchases, and that's kind of where we come in. So consider that a bit of an offset to the AI story. 
And then pretty quickly, we get into the more dynamic pieces of this related to the works that we do in genomics. And obviously, the rapid test is the most dynamic of them all.

Once again, our teams across IDEX should be extremely proud of the results we've achieved together. I don't think any of us would have imagined being at this point when viewing the state of the world a year ago. Our diverse array of high-performing businesses continues to serve us well. We're seeing most of our end markets either largely recovered or steadily improving at this point. We continue to build on the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 to be stronger than our expectations 90 days ago.
Although tremendous progress has been made in our recovery, there are still some areas we're keeping a close eye on. Our day rates have accelerated, but we have yet to see larger projects in our industrial sector moving forward. Customers are more confident in their outlook, but are now trying to balance the surge in demand with capacity to make larger investments.
As for COVID, the conditions vary widely around the world. In the U.K. and the United States, the vaccination rate has been remarkable of late. In China, much of life has been continuing as normal for many months now. The situation in Europe and India, where lockdowns and virus variants are still a serious issue, reminds us that we are not fully past the societal and economic impact that the pandemic has had in our businesses.
The quarter was not without challenges from safety protocols and lockdowns to sporadic shortages of parts and materials to rapidly changing logistics hurdles in a variety of staffing challenges, this was far from smooth sailing. Recognizing all of that, I want to thank every IDEX employee on this call for their efforts in the past quarter. I'm proud that our team successfully navigated many tough hurdles to achieve these results. The operational excellence of our teams continues to pay off.
Pivoting a moment to capital deployment. With the closure of the Abel Pumps transaction this quarter and the announcement of the Airtech acquisition last night covered in more detail in a moment, we have started off 2021 on a strong note. And we'll build on this momentum as we further invest in M&A capabilities. We recently allocated some of our most talented resources towards focused strategy and business development roles, and we engaged external expertise to expand our ability to identify, assess, win and successfully integrate new companies into IDEX.
Our deal funnel is expanding as we look for more opportunities to acquire organizations that fit the IDEX style of competition. We seek to both widen and deepen the moats around our best businesses as well as established positions within new market niches where the capabilities of our teams will drive the most value for customers and shareholders. We are fortunate to have significant financial resources to deploy towards these efforts.
Moving on to Slide 7. Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire Airtech Vacuum Group from Eagle Tree Capital for $470 million. Airtech engineers and manufactures high-performance regenerative blowers, pneumatic valves, air compressors and vacuum pumps. Airtech had revenue of $85 million with EBITDA margin in the mid-30s range in 2020. It is a 16x trailing deal and a 15x deal including acquired tax benefits.
Within the IDEX family of businesses, they complement and expand upon the solutions provided by gas manufacturing, which produces fractional horsepower air moving products and systems that include air compressors, vacuum pumps, air motors and tank systems. While there are some overlaps in the solutions they provide, much of Airtech's product lines will be complementary. They will remain separate businesses within IDEX, but we anticipate collaboration and synergies from each company with shared expertise leading to further innovation. This deal, which we expect to close in the second quarter, will then create a $200 million pneumatics platform within our Health & Science Technology segment.
Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. The positive momentum in order trends continued in the first quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially, allowing us to build $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Most of our business units are at or approaching pre-pandemic levels. I'll go into more details in a minute. Organic orders in the quarter exceeded the first quarter of 2020 and were an all-time high for us. Q1 orders were also up 4% organically versus Q1 of 2019.
As we look across our segments, Health & Science Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified products delivered strong organic order growth, with Fluid & Metering Technology slightly lagging. As growth rates in HST and FSDP begin to naturally level off, we expect FMT will drive additional growth due to the return of project-based businesses in the energy and industrial markets in the second half of the year. These commercial results and the strength of our rebound highlight the resilience of our businesses and the critical importance of the solutions we provide to our customers.
On Slide 9, we provide a deeper outlook for our primary end markets. To level set, we entered the year cautiously bullish about the state of our underlying markets and the velocity of the pandemic recovery. Our day rate businesses began to accelerate coming into the year, and we continue to leverage our diversified portfolio to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive organic growth coming out of the pandemic. We are now measuring our markets against their pre-pandemic levels. Many of our markets have fully recovered, and the majority of our markets are on track to have fully recovered by the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we're not out of the woods yet, but even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we are optimistic about the outlook of our end markets.
In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, industrial day rates continued to increase throughout the quarter. As I've mentioned, we will not be at full recovery until we see large CapEx projects resume, but the underlying industrial markets are in a state of recovery trending back towards 2019 levels. Agriculture continues to drive outsized growth as crop prices and customer sentiment remains strong. Our water business is stable. We continue to assess any subsequent impact from the pandemic on municipal funding as well as tailwinds that might come out of an infrastructure bill. Energy markets continue to lag 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in this sector.
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We experienced solid growth across almost all of our markets. Semicon and food and pharma continued to outperform, driven by a strong market and winning share with our differentiated technology offerings. The overall automotive market faces many challenges, but we have won several new platforms driving our performance. Our AI and life science markets are on the rebound as the impact of the pandemic in the United States has improved. The industrial businesses within the segment are seeing a similar result to FMT. Day rates are improving, but projects are lacking.
One last item for HST. We do see risk with the COVID opportunities we have been taking -- talking about in this segment, specifically around testing. The end product application is yet to receive FDA approval which will impact volumes for this year. We do believe that the strength in the rest of the segment will be able to offset most of that risk.
Finally, in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment, dispensing continues its rebound as large retailers free up capital and work through pent-up demand for equipment. Much like our automotive exposure in HST, the auto recovery in FSD at BAND-IT is driven by new platform wins, coupled with an improved market. In Fire & Rescue, we continue to assess municipal budget headwinds and especially in Europe and India as budgets have not been released delaying tenders. The U.S. market has been better, and we are optimistic about the impact of our businesses from increased infrastructure spending.
The other ligand category in FSD is primarily BAND-IT's energy and aerospace exposure along with some industrial applications in Fire & Rescue. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and are focused on ensuring the stability of our supply chain. This persistence in global supply chain issues threatened to create choppiness in the back half of the year. Despite these factors, we are confident enough in our outlook to raise our organic growth expectations for the year.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year."

I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q1 orders of $711 million were up 10% overall and up 6% organically as we built $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide.
First quarter sales of $652 million were up 10% overall and 6% organically. We experienced growth across all our segments, with over 75% of our business units increasing year-over-year. Strength in semicon, food and pharma and dispensing were the notable highlights in the quarter.
Q1 gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 44.9%, but was up 110 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, inventory step-up associated with Abel, mix and onetime inventory reserves. The inventory reserves were associated with our pandemic-related electrostatic sprayer businesses not materializing at the rate we expected. Excluding acquisitions and the inventory reserves, gross margin would have been flat to prior year.
First quarter operating margin was 23.9%, up 40 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the increased volume and the impact of cost actions taken last year, offset by the gross margin pressure I just mentioned. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the following slide.
Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.6%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20% due to a decrease in the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. This drove a $0.05 headwind on EPS for the quarter. First quarter adjusted net income was $115 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.51, up $0.18 or 14% over prior year. Excluding the $0.05 tax headwind, adjusted EPS would have been up $0.23 or 17%.
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $95 million, up 32% compared to prior year and was 82% of adjusted net income. The strong performance was driven by higher earnings and the continued impact of our working capital initiatives.
Moving on to Slide 12. As Eric mentioned, we entered the quarter cautiously optimistic about the pace of growth coming into 2021. We knew that we were structurally well positioned to take advantage of improving market conditions from the cost actions and discretionary controls we put in place last year. Adjusted operating income increased $18 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 6% organic growth contributed approximately $13 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. The impact of previous discretionary cost controls contributed $5 million, and we were able to net $4 million from price productivity, partially offset by inflation.
After accounting for $2 million of negative mix, our organic flow-through was extremely strong at 58%. Flow-through was then negatively impacted by the $3 million charge related to the inventory reserve I discussed on the last slide and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting to a reported flow-through of 32%. As we highlighted in prior calls, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We have already started those investments and expect the associated costs from these initiatives will reduce our organic flow-through in subsequent quarters.
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. I'm on Slide 13. For the second quarter, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.63, with organic revenue growth of 18% to 20% and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The second quarter effective tax rate is expected to be about 23%, and we expect a 2% top line benefit from the impact of FX. Corporate costs in the second quarter are expected to be around $21 million, with the increase primarily driven by the M&A investments we discussed earlier.
Turning to the full year outlook. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance from $5.65 to $5.95, up to $6.05 to $6.20. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 6% to 8%, up to 9% to 10%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 1% benefit to top line results. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. Free cash flow is now expected to be 115% to 120% of net income. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $74 million for the full year.
Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs or earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. Abel Pump is now included in these estimates, with the deal closed in the first quarter. Airtech is not included in these estimates. We will update our guidance accordingly once the deal closes.
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

I'm on the final slide, Slide 14. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to share an update on our ESG journey and the evolution of our company culture. We recently published our second corporate social responsibility report. This report is our first to adopt the sustainable accounting standards board sector standards, also known as SASB. We have increased our disclosures in key areas, including health and safety, diversity and environmental impact. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Denise Cade, our General Counsel and her cross-functional team for their outstanding efforts to bring our hard work and commitments to light.
Diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be a point of emphasis in our evolving company culture. Since we last met, an outside facilitator conducted anonymous focus groups with employees from around the world, from which we learned and were able to begin developing more targeted goals for the company. We are currently planning training sessions for all leaders to help them understand and become comfortable fostering dialogue on these important issues. We are addressing our talent management processes, including our assessment of existing talent and our consideration of new talent through recruiting to help ensure our processes are free from unconscious bias, and we are assessing our purchasing practice to expand our use of diverse suppliers.
IDEX is a decentralized company with a diverse collection of businesses. Our superior economic model depends upon problem-solving and decision-making at the point of impact, closest to our customers. Our collective work within this important area as outlined in this report is an essential component of our next phase of business growth.

And then that lays over the IDEX story, which always kind of had our second quarter as a high point for us. And so we see that momentum lining up nicely on our typically seasonally adjusted second quarter.
And in the back half, I think that's going to be a story. We've got some projects and things that we know about on the inside that we feel good about. We think the momentum certainly will continue, but we would suspect we're still going to have a lot of these challenges out there that we'll have to navigate around. And of course, then, I think the typical seasonal patterns that we see around summer shutdowns and things in Europe are embedded on top of that.

Well, look, we -- this is where our model and our talent really helps us. I mean we've got a lot of local sourcing very close to where we produce, very close to where we sell, so we have kind of an inherent advantage there. And we got really, really talented teams that used, frankly, a lot of the lessons of the year's worth of severe acute phase of the pandemic to make some smart moves around supply chain to prepare us for this.
That being said, I would say on the inflationary front, it's kind of spotty for us. I mean, remember, we're a little further down the food chain. We don't buy a lot of giant quantities of base material, we buy things that have been converted. So it does have a little bit of a lag for us. And so we see the same things others are seeing where we buy lots of metals. There's some inflationary pressure, electronics, a few other places, but we're navigating around those. On the freight side, that's certainly a challenge, both on the price, frankly, more on the availability side. We're no different than anybody else trying to find sea containers, trucking, trains, port facilities that have to unclog, all of those things. Our model helps us, our folks help us.
I think as we go further out, the inflationary pressure, I actually think that's going to ramp up a bit for everybody. One of the things that you can still appreciate, I see it in our own businesses is, today, we still have a little bit of a benefit of people are good scavengers. They'll go around and they'll find some things over here, find some places over there, take advantage of some inventory shelf stock. Eventually, you kind of get back where you're right at the end of the factory, and then you're kind of dealing with what everybody else is.
So we're planning for that. We're making all the moves that we need to. And certainly, of course, all of this for us, you can ever tell the story without talking about price capture. And so we've got these things aligned. And as you suspect, we're always trying to manage that spread and taking advantage of the price capture side as we sell and then executing the heck out of a difficult environment on the back end to maintain that spread as we go and doing it all with our customers' top of mind and considering and remembering the lead time requirements that we have, kind of where we sit, the criticality of what we do, that's what drives all of it."

I mean we originally talked about that range pretty quickly that moved to about $60 million. That was split pretty evenly between 2020 and '21. So now we're kind of talking about a $30 million bucket for this year. And the 2 biggest components in there were the electrostatic sprayer application, which we talked about and you saw in the margin walk, I'll come back to that in a second, and then the COVID testing, the diagnostic application which was always a little bit more back-end loaded. And as you noted and we noted in our remarks, we've got some pressure points around both of those related, frankly, to the improving situation that we see across the globe in terms of vaccination rates and some other things.
On the sprayer front, that's literally as binary as some -- a change in thought, a change in thought that was part of the CDC guidelines around the need for standardization, not being as high as previously thought at a time pretty coincident with some of our launch planning. So as you suspect, we've taken a slightly different view of that business. I think it's a good product line. There are still plenty of places, a lot of it involved in transportation where that's still going to be an essential piece of it, but it's no doubt going to run out slower.
I do want to pause just for a second though and point out the positive aspect of that. That was one of our hardest hit businesses in terms of their core markets that rallied massively quickly, put together a business and put together all this product and got it ready to live our mission and try to make the world a better place. So we celebrate that one, and we're going to leverage that capability going forward.
On the other side, on the testing front, it's a little bit more complex. We've got some issues on FDA approvals with our partners, and we have this backdrop of vaccinations and things rolling out across the world. But I must tell you, so I think we're viewing that a little less favorably as we go forward, again, with an eye towards what happens in the back half. Though the world still is not at the recommended level of surveillance testing, we're underneath it by more than half. And we still think this has a role to play, but we want to at least point out that there's an impact of an improving world to a couple of these applications. But overall, couldn't be happier with how our teams responded and put together the solutions here."

The daily order rates, of course, we pointed to that momentum, and that's a great sign. That's a great sign that the system is working and that the momentum is there. The project side, I think, has shifted from one of confidence in a lack of belief in, let's say, an improving outlook in the world and all of those things. That's actually quite favorable now.
I think now it's actually caught up in a state a zone of people just trying to execute it. And I look at my own businesses and see some of that same thing where some things -- larger projects we've been thinking about, a lot of people that would have been moving those along are trying really, really hard to ship product, get things going, understanding bets on inventory, all of that. So as we engage with customers, particularly right down that fairway of industrials within SMT, this is the difference in tone. You see a lot of optimism, but you also see a lot of very, very busy people. And that's especially true of the nature of the kind of projects we have. These are kind of those medium-term expansions of facilities and things like that.
So we're pretty confident, very confident that those are going to come back. In some ways, we just maybe get a little bit more space to work on them, continue to see the momentum that's already out there and then the lines cross, and we think that's an important part of our story going forward."

And just capacity, in general, as you've seen in the comments for a couple of quarters here, we've been building that all along. A lot of the optimization we've done with IDEX over the last 5 years gave us the muscle that we're now leaning on as we think about looking for acquiring and integrating companies. So that's something just at the foundational level.
Relative to the 2 transactions that we have here, they're both very good standalone businesses that while they're going to require some integrative activity, these are well positioned, in good shape and, let's say, a lighter touch in terms of demand from IDEX talent across the board. And so bottom line is, I feel confident that we could continue to work the funnel that we have, with the intent that we're driving. If we were to kind of lap this experience again in the back half, I wouldn't see that as a problem in terms of our teams being able to go out and work on acquisitions.
I will tell you, as you suspect, we always filter these. There are some properties that if we said yes and we were successful, they take a lot more work than others. And we would factor that in, and we're always pretty aware of that. But right now, in very good shape with an intentional build on the bottom side and on the top 2 transactions that very fortunately, are in kind of great shape out of the gate."

This is a really, really phenomenal company, and it sits very nicely next to the gas business that we illustrated there on the opening deck. In the nature that they're both involved with very, very specialized air handling applications, but they're highly complementary, so the strengths of gas in different areas of compression are then balanced very nicely with the regenerative blower side and the specialty and the valve piece of Airtech. So they fit together seamlessly.
What I really, really like about these businesses is they're both filled with incredible domain experts who have just got phenomenal abilities to innovate. Airtech has got a great growth track record. As I said in my opening comments, it's very profitable, very close to end markets that we're extremely interested in. On the gas side, we've got some of that as well. And frankly, we've got a lot of channel strength in markets that I think are going to complement that business.
And then we've got a toolkit. We've got a talent base, a cultural base and an 80/20 toolkit that we know when you apply to IDEX-like businesses, particularly ones of high quality, can drive the whole thing further.
Last piece of it is there's other things out there in this world that could be interesting that the 2 businesses together may unlock for us that are part of our -- the funnel and things that we're thinking about as we consider capital deployment in the future.

So a lot of companies have a lot more consumable exposure than we do. And so that would be -- very clearly, that's the piece that recovers first and a lot of the elements that are embedded in life sciences. Let's just take the kind of classic IVD space. As things open up and people go back in for testing, you get a lot of action on the consumable stream, but it takes a while before you're going to do a large-scale box replacement, and that's what we supply.
So we've got a mixed bag here. We've got some places like that where we're going to have to wait, and we certainly have some exciting stuff, especially on the microfluidics side and some of the stuff around AI as it involves itself in vaccine development and therapeutics because that's in a different place. But when you put it all together, we sort of use this category to say recovering, but not quite there yet, and we understand the elements that we're going to have to find their way in there for us to move it into the next space."

You've got, obviously, the municipal spend profile side. And a lot of that, we're going to have to wait and see where that goes. There are so many elements that are moving around concurrently. There's federal efforts to backstop things. And that side of it, there's some regulatory pieces, so we'll see.
And then you've got this dynamic certainly in this market where we've seen even ahead of some of the more recent supply chain stuff that we're talking about globally, a very unique to that industry challenge around trucks and chassis and things. That sort of capped off some of the potential on the sales side for end customers. So as that works itself out. That's going to be ultimately good for us. We'll see how successful people are with that. And then we'll have to see where the market itself, the municipal market, rides along underneath it. And then you always have to throw in for us. I hate to do -- add more and more variable, but this is a really massively global business, and so they don't all move in step. Things going on in China and India and emerging markets are not necessarily the same as what we would see here in the Midwest.
So there's a lot of things working together. I think it's safe to put it in the recovery. It has improved, not quite back where we would expect it to be and think it will be ultimately. And then we will, like you, wonder a lot of these things coming together here to paint a clear picture as we go."

But I would say, in general, the fact that it exists is a positive element that should help of many IDEX markets. So we view it that way. We'll continue to paying it As we get some insight into things and start to see driving trends within the business, we'll surely call it out."

Once again, our teams across IDEX should be extremely proud of the results we've achieved together. I don't think any of us would have imagined being at this point when viewing the state of the world a year ago. Our diverse array of high-performing businesses continues to serve us well. We're seeing most of our end markets either largely recovered or steadily improving at this point. We continue to build on the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 to be stronger than our expectations 90 days ago. 
Although tremendous progress has been made in our recovery, there are still some areas we're keeping a close eye on. Our day rates have accelerated, but we have yet to see larger projects in our industrial sector moving forward. Customers are more confident in their outlook but are now trying to balance the surge in demand with capacity to make larger investments. 
As for COVID, the conditions vary widely around the world. In the U.K. and the United States, the vaccination rate has been remarkable of late. In China, much of life has been continuing as normal for many months now. The situation in Europe and India, where lockdowns and virus variants are still a serious issue, reminds us that we are not fully past the societal and economic impact that the pandemic has had in our businesses. 
The quarter was not without challenges from safety protocols and lockdowns to sporadic shortages of parts and materials to rapidly changing logistics hurdles in a variety of staffing challenges, this was far from smooth sailing. Recognizing all of that, I want to thank every IDEX employee on this call for their efforts in the past quarter. I'm proud that our team successfully navigated many tough hurdles to achieve these results. The operational excellence of our teams continues to pay off. 
Pivoting a moment to capital deployment. With the closure of the ABEL Pumps transaction this quarter and the announcement of the Airtech acquisition last night, covered in more detail in a moment, we have started off 2021 on a strong note. And we'll build on this momentum as we further invest in M&A capabilities. We recently allocated some of our most talented resources towards focused strategy and business development roles, and we engaged external expertise to expand our ability to identify, assess, win and successfully integrate new companies into IDEX. 
Our deal funnel is expanding as we look for more opportunities to acquire organizations that fit the IDEX style of competition. We seek to both widen and deepen the moats around our best businesses as well as established positions within new market niches where the capabilities of our teams will drive the most value for customers and shareholders. We are fortunate to have significant financial resources to deploy towards these efforts. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire Airtech Vacuum Group from EagleTree Capital for $470 million. Airtech engineers and manufactures high-performance regenerative blowers, pneumatic valves, air compressors and vacuum pumps. Airtech had revenue of $85 million with EBITDA margin in the mid-30s range in 2020. It is a 16x trailing deal and a 15x deal including acquired tax benefits. 
Within the IDEX family of businesses, they complement and expand upon the solutions provided by Gast Manufacturing, which produces fractional horsepower, air moving products and systems that include air compressors, vacuum pumps, air motors and tank systems. While there are some overlaps in the solutions they provide, much of Airtech's product lines will be complementary. They will remain separate businesses within IDEX, but we anticipate collaboration and synergies from each company with shared expertise leading to further innovation. This deal, which we expect to close in the second quarter, will then create a $200 million pneumatics platform within our Health & Science Technology segment. 
Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. The positive momentum in order trends continued in the first quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially, allowing us to build $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Most of our business units are at or approaching pre-pandemic levels. I'll go into more details in a minute. Organic orders in the quarter exceeded the first quarter of 2020 and were an all-time high for us. Q1 orders were also up 4% organically versus Q1 of 2019. 
As we look across our segments, Health & Science Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products delivered strong organic order growth, with Fluid and Metering Technology slightly lagging. As growth rates in HST and FSDP begin to naturally level off, we expect FMT will drive additional growth due to the return of project-based businesses in the energy and industrial markets in the second half of the year. These commercial results and the strength of our rebound highlight the resilience of our businesses and the critical importance of the solutions we provide to our customers. 
On Slide 9, we provide a deeper outlook for our primary end markets. To level set, we entered the year cautiously bullish about the state of our underlying markets and the velocity of the pandemic recovery. Our day rate businesses began to accelerate coming into the year, and we continue to leverage our diversified portfolio to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive organic growth coming out of the pandemic. We are now measuring our markets against their pre-pandemic levels. Many of our markets have fully recovered, and the majority of our markets are on track to have fully recovered by the end of the year. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're not out of the woods yet, but even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we are optimistic about the outlook of our end markets. 
In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, industrial day rates continued to increase throughout the quarter. As I've mentioned, we will not be at full recovery until we see large CapEx projects resume, but the underlying industrial markets are in a state of recovery trending back towards 2019 levels. Agriculture continues to drive outsized growth as crop prices and customer sentiment remains strong. Our water business is stable. We continue to assess any subsequent impact from the pandemic on municipal funding as well as tailwinds that might come out of an infrastructure bill. Energy markets continue to lag 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in this sector. 
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We experienced solid growth across almost all of our markets, semicon and food and pharma continued to outperform, driven by a strong market and winning share with our differentiated technology offerings. The overall automotive market faces many challenges, but we have won several new platforms driving our performance. Our AI and life science markets are on the rebound as the impact of the pandemic in the United States has improved. The industrial businesses within the segment are seeing a similar result to FMT. Day rates are improving, but projects are lacking. 
One last item for HST. We do see risk with the COVID opportunities we have been taking -- talking about in this segment, specifically around testing. The end product application is yet to receive FDA approval which will impact volumes for this year. We do believe that the strength in the rest of the segment will be able to offset most of that risk. 
Finally, in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment, dispensing continues its rebound as large retailers free up capital and work through pent-up demand for equipment. Much like our automotive exposures in HST, the auto recovery in FSD at BAND-IT is driven by new platform wins, coupled with an improved market. In Fire & Rescue, we continue to assess municipal budget headwinds, especially in Europe and India as budgets have not been released, delaying tenders. The U.S. market has been better, and we are optimistic about the impact of our businesses from increased infrastructure spending. 
The other ligand category in FSD is primarily BAND-IT's energy and aerospace exposure along with some industrial applications in Fire & Rescue. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and are focused on ensuring the stability of our supply chain. This persistence in global supply chain issues threatened to create choppiness in the back half of the year. Despite these factors, we are confident enough in our outlook to raise our organic growth expectations for the year. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year."

I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q1 orders of $711 million were up 10% overall and up 6% organically as we built $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in eac",821,"Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q1 orders of $711 million were up 10% overall and up 6% organically as we built $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. 
First quarter sales of $652 million were up 10% overall and 6% organically. We experienced growth across all our segments, with over 75% of our business units increasing year-over-year. Strength in semicon, food and pharma and dispensing were the notable highlights in the quarter. 
Q1 gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 44.9% but was up 110 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, inventory step-up associated with ABEL, mix and onetime inventory reserves. The inventory reserves were associated with our pandemic-related electrostatic sprayer businesses not materializing at the rate we expected. Excluding acquisitions and the inventory reserves, gross margin would have been flat to prior year. 
First quarter operating margin was 23.9%, up 40 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the increased volume and the impact of cost actions taken last year, offset by the gross margin pressure I just mentioned. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the following slide. 
Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.6%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20% due to a decrease in the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. This drove a $0.05 headwind on EPS for the quarter. First quarter adjusted net income was $115 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.51, up $0.18 or 14% over prior year. Excluding the $0.05 tax headwind, adjusted EPS would have been up $0.23 or 17%. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $95 million, up 32% compared to prior year and was 82% of adjusted net income. The strong performance was driven by higher earnings and the continued impact of our working capital initiatives. 
Moving on to Slide 12. As Eric mentioned, we entered the quarter cautiously optimistic about the pace of growth coming into 2021. We knew that we were structurally well positioned to take advantage of improving market conditions from the cost actions and discretionary controls we put in place last year. Adjusted operating income increased $18 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 6% organic growth contributed approximately $13 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. The impact of previous discretionary cost controls contributed $5 million, and we were able to net $4 million from price productivity, partially offset by inflation. 
After accounting for $2 million of negative mix, our organic flow-through was extremely strong at 58%. Flow-through was then negatively impacted by the $3 million charge related to the inventory reserve I discussed on the last slide and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting to a reported flow-through of 32%. As we highlighted in prior calls, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We have already started those investments and expect the associated costs from these initiatives will reduce our organic flow-through in subsequent quarters. 
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. I'm on Slide 13. For the second quarter, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.63, with organic revenue growth of 18% to 20%, and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The second quarter effective tax rate is expected to be about 23%, and we expect a 2% top line benefit from the impact of FX. Corporate costs in the second quarter are expected to be around $21 million, with the increase primarily driven by the M&A investments we discussed earlier. 
Turning to the full year outlook. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance from $5.65 to $5.95, up to $6.05 to $6.20. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 6% to 8%, up to 9% to 10%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 1% benefit to top line results. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. Free cash flow is now expected to be 115% to 120% of net income. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $74 million for the full year. 
Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs or earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. ABEL Pump is now included in these estimates, with the deal closed in the first quarter. Airtech is not included in these estimates. We will update our guidance accordingly once the deal closes. With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to share an update on our ESG journey and the evolution of our company culture. We recently published our second corporate social responsibility report. This report is our first to adopt the sustainable Accounting Standards Board's sector standards, also known as SASB. We have increased our disclosures in key areas, including health and safety, diversity and environmental impact. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Denise Cade, our General Counsel and her cross-functional team for their outstanding efforts to bring our hard work and commitments to light. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be a point of emphasis in our evolving company culture. Since we last met, an outside facilitator conducted anonymous focus groups with employees from around the world, from which we learned and were able to begin developing more targeted goals for the company. We are currently planning training sessions for all leaders to help them understand and become comfortable fostering dialogue on these important issues. We are addressing our talent management processes, including our assessment of existing talent and our consideration of new talent through recruiting to help ensure our processes are free from unconscious bias, and we are assessing our purchasing practice to expand our use of diverse suppliers. 
IDEX is a decentralized company with a diverse collection of businesses. Our superior economic model depends upon problem-solving and decision-making at the point of impact, closest to our customers. Our collective work within this important area, as outlined in this report, is an essential component of our next phase of business growth. 
With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions."

And then that lays over the IDEX story, which always kind of had our second quarter as a high point for us. And so we see that momentum lining up nicely on our typically seasonally adjusted second quarter.
And in the back half, I think that's going to be a story. We've got some projects and things that we know about on the inside that we feel good about. We think the momentum certainly will continue, but we would suspect we're still going to have a lot of these challenges out there that we'll have to navigate around. And of course, then, I think the typical seasonal patterns that we see around summer shutdowns and things in Europe are embedded on top of that. So it's an interesting story with very broad-based support, early momentum, these kind of episodic challenges that we have to navigate around that we feel confident and we will."

I mean we've got a lot of local sourcing, very close to where we produce, very close to where we sell, so we have kind of an inherent advantage there. And we got really, really talented teams that used, frankly, a lot of the lessons of the year's worth of severe acute phase of the pandemic to make some smart moves around supply chain to prepare us for this.
That being said, I would say on the inflationary front, it's kind of spotty for us. I mean remember, we're a little further down the food chain. We don't buy a lot of giant quantities of base material, we buy things that have been converted. So it does have a little bit of a lag for us. And so we see the same things others are seeing, where we buy lots of metals, there's some inflationary pressure, electronics, a few other places, but we're navigating around those. On the freight side, that's certainly a challenge, both on the price, frankly, more on the availability side. We're no different than anybody else trying to find sea containers, trucking, trains, port facilities that have to unclog, all of those things. Our model helps us, our folks help us.
I think as we go further out, the inflationary pressure, I actually think that's going to ramp up a bit for everybody. One of the things that you can still appreciate, I see it in our own businesses is, today, we still have a little bit of a benefit of, our people are good scavengers. They'll go around and they'll find some things over here, find some places over there, take advantage of some inventory shelf stock. Eventually, you kind of get back where you're right at the end of the factory, and then you're kind of dealing with what everybody else is.
So we're planning for that. We're making all the moves that we need to. And certainly, of course, all of this for us, you can never tell the story without talking about price capture. And so we've got these things aligned. And as you suspect, we're always trying to manage that spread and taking advantage of the price capture side as we sell and then executing the heck out of a difficult environment on the back end to maintain that spread as we go and doing it all with our customers' top of mind and considering and remembering the lead time requirements that we have, kind of where we sit, the criticality of what we do, that's what drives all of it."

I mean we originally talked about that range pretty quickly that moved to about $60 million. That was split pretty evenly between 2020 and '21. So now we're kind of talking about a $30 million bucket for this year. And the 2 biggest components in there were the electrostatic sprayer application, which we talked about and you saw in the margin walk, I'll come back to that in a second, and then the COVID testing, the diagnostic application which was always a little bit more back-end loaded. And as you noted and we noted in our remarks, we've got some pressure points around both of those related, frankly, to the improving situation that we see across the globe in terms of vaccination rates and some other things.
On the sprayer front, that's literally as binary as some -- a change in thought, a change in thought that was part of the CDC guidelines around the need for standardization, not being as high as previously thought, at a time pretty coincident with some of our launch planning. So as you suspect, we've taken a slightly different view of that business. I think it's a good product line. There are still plenty of places, a lot of it involved in transportation where that's still going to be an essential piece of it, but it's no doubt going to run out slower.
I do want to pause just for a second though and point out the positive aspect of that. That was one of our hardest hit businesses in terms of their core markets that rallied massively quickly, put together a business and put together all this product and got it ready to, frankly, live our mission and try to make the world a better place. So we celebrate that one, and we're going to leverage that capability going forward.
On the other side, on the testing front, it's a little bit more complex. We've got some issues on FDA approvals with our partners, and we have this backdrop of vaccinations and things rolling out across the world. But I must tell you, so I think we're viewing that a little less favorably as we go forward, again, with an eye towards what happens in the back half. Though the world still is not at the recommended level of surveillance testing, we're underneath it by more than half. And we still think this has a role to play, but we want to at least point out that there's an impact of an improving world to a couple of these applications. But overall, couldn't be happier with how our teams responded and put together the solutions here."

The daily order rates, of course, we pointed to that momentum, and that's a great sign. That's a great sign that the system is working and that the momentum is there. The project side, I think, has shifted from one of confidence in a lack of belief in, let's say, an improving outlook in the world and all of those things. That's actually quite favorable now.
I think now it's actually caught up in a state, a zone of people just trying to execute it. And I look at my own businesses and see some of that same thing where some things -- larger projects we've been thinking about, a lot of people that would have been moving those along are trying really, really hard to ship product, get things going, understanding bets on inventory, all of that. So as we engage with customers, particularly right down that fairway of industrials within SMT, this is the difference in tone. You see a lot of optimism, but you also see a lot of very, very busy people. And that's especially true of the nature of the kind of projects we have. These are kind of those medium-term expansions of facilities and things like that.
So we're pretty confident, very confident that those are going to come back. In some ways, we just maybe get a little bit more space to work on them, continue to see the momentum that's already out there and then the lines cross, and we think that's an important part of our story going forward."

A lot of the optimization we've done with IDEX over the last 5 years gave us the muscle that we're now leaning on as we think about looking for acquiring and integrating companies. So that's something just at the foundational level.
Relative to the 2 transactions that we have here, they're both very good standalone businesses that -- while they're going to require some integrative activity, these are well positioned, in good shape and, let's say, a lighter touch in terms of demand from IDEX talent across the board. And so bottom line is, I feel confident that we could continue to work the funnel that we have, with the intent that we're driving. If we were to kind of lap this experience again in the back half, I wouldn't see that as a problem in terms of our teams being able to go out and work on acquisitions.
I will tell you, as you suspect, we always filter these. There are some properties that if we said yes and we were successful, they take a lot more work than others. And we would factor that in, and we're always pretty aware of that.

This is a really, really phenomenal company, and it sits very nicely next to the Gast business that we illustrated there on the opening deck. In the nature that they're both involved with very, very specialized air handling applications, but they're highly complementary, so the strengths of Gast in different areas of compression are then balanced very nicely with the regenerative blower side and the specialty in the valve piece of Airtech. So they fit together seamlessly.
What I really, really like about these businesses is they're both filled with incredible domain experts who have just got phenomenal abilities to innovate. Airtech has got a great growth track record. As I said in my opening comments, it's very profitable, very close to end markets that we're extremely interested in. On the Gast side, we've got some of that as well. And frankly, we've got a lot of channel strength in markets that I think are going to complement that business.

I honestly think it'll -- we're going to aggressively target to ratchet that up a bit, but we always do that with the indicators that we see and thinking a lot about the ultimate spread that we realize. So I don't know that we've got a number of pegs, but we have a method that we peg, that sort of is very active, follows along, takes advantage of the short lead times that we have and the way that we are able to execute price.
So I guess the shortest answer would be probably north of where we are here. A lot of it's dependent on where we see some of the underlying commodities and things heading for us, but always mindful of where that spread is. But ultimately, we want to keep that as a net positive item for the company."

So now that we've kind of passed through that, you've got kind of those 2 things coming together, and you've got economies that are opening up on a global basis. Remember, this is a really global business for us. We're doing business all over the world here.

And so that would be -- very clearly, that's the piece that recovers first and a lot of the elements that are embedded in life sciences. Let's just take the kind of classic IVD space. As things open up and people go back in for testing, you get a lot of action on the consumable stream, but it takes a while before you're going to do a large-scale box replacement, and that's what we supply.
So we've got a mixed bag here. We've got some places like that where we're going to have to wait, and we certainly have some exciting stuff, especially on the microfluidics side and some of the stuff around AI as it involves itself in vaccine development and therapeutics because that's in a different place.

You've got, obviously, the municipal spend profile side. And a lot of that, we're going to have to wait and see where that goes. There are so many elements that are moving around concurrently. There's federal efforts to backstop things. And that side of it, there's some regulatory pieces, so we'll see.
And then you've got this dynamic certainly in this market where we've seen even ahead of some of the more recent supply chain stuff that we're talking about globally, a very unique to that industry challenge around trucks and chassis and things. That sort of capped off some of the potential on the sales side for end customers. So as that works itself out, that's going to be ultimately good for us. We'll see how successful people are with that. And then we'll have to see where the market itself, the municipal market, rides along underneath it. And then you always have to throw in for us. I hate to do -- add more and more variable, but this is a really massively global business, and so they don't all move in step. Things going on in China and India and emerging markets are not necessarily the same as what we would see here in the Midwest.
So there's a lot of things working together. I think it's safe to put it in the recovery. It has improved, not quite back where we would expect it to be and think it will be ultimately.

Once again, our teams across IDEX should be extremely proud of the results we've achieved together. I don't think any of us would have imagined being at this point when viewing the state of the world a year ago. Our diverse array of high-performing businesses continues to serve us well. We're seeing most of our end markets either largely recovered or steadily improving at this point. We continue to build on the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 to be stronger than our expectations 90 days ago. 
Although tremendous progress has been made in our recovery, there are still some areas we're keeping a close eye on. Our day rates have accelerated, but we have yet to see larger projects in our industrial sector moving forward. Customers are more confident in their outlook but are now trying to balance the surge in demand with capacity to make larger investments. 
As for COVID, the conditions vary widely around the world. In the U.K. and the United States, the vaccination rate has been remarkable of late. In China, much of life has been continuing as normal for many months now. The situation in Europe and India, where lockdowns and virus variants are still a serious issue, reminds us that we are not fully past the societal and economic impact that the pandemic has had in our businesses. 
The quarter was not without challenges from safety protocols and lockdowns to sporadic shortages of parts and materials to rapidly changing logistics hurdles and a variety of staffing challenges, this was far from smooth sailing. Recognizing all of that, I want to thank every IDEX employee on this call for their efforts in the past quarter. I'm proud that our team successfully navigated many tough hurdles to achieve these results. The operational excellence of our teams continues to pay off. 
Pivoting a moment to capital deployment. With the closure of the ABEL Pumps transaction this quarter and the announcement of the Airtech acquisition last night, covered in more detail in a moment, we have started off 2021 on a strong note. And we'll build on this momentum as we further invest in M&A capabilities. We recently allocated some of our most talented resources towards focused strategy and business development roles, and we engaged external expertise to expand our ability to identify, assess, win and successfully integrate new companies into IDEX. 
Our deal funnel is expanding as we look for more opportunities to acquire organizations that fit the IDEX style of competition. We seek to both widen and deepen the moats around our best businesses as well as established positions within new market niches where the capabilities of our teams will drive the most value for customers and shareholders. We are fortunate to have significant financial resources to deploy towards these efforts. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire Airtech Vacuum Group from EagleTree Capital for $470 million. Airtech engineers and manufactures high-performance regenerative blowers, pneumatic valves, air compressors and vacuum pumps. Airtech had revenue of $85 million with EBITDA margin in the mid-30s range in 2020. It is a 16x trailing deal and a 15x deal including acquired tax benefits. 
Within the IDEX family of businesses, they complement and expand upon the solutions provided by Gast Manufacturing, which produces fractional horsepower, air moving products and systems that include air compressors, vacuum pumps, air motors and tank systems. While there are some overlaps in the solutions they provide, much of Airtech's product lines will be complementary. They will remain separate businesses within IDEX, but we anticipate collaboration and synergies from each company with shared expertise leading to further innovation. This deal, which we expect to close in the second quarter, will then create a $200 million pneumatics platform within our Health & Science Technology segment. 
Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. The positive momentum in order trends continued in the first quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially, allowing us to build $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Most of our business units are at or approaching pre-pandemic levels. I'll go into more details in a minute. Organic orders in the quarter exceeded the first quarter of 2020 and were an all-time high for us. Q1 orders were also up 4% organically versus Q1 of 2019. 
As we look across our segments, Health & Science Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products delivered strong organic order growth, with Fluid and Metering Technology slightly lagging. As growth rates in HST and FSDP begin to naturally level off, we expect FMT will drive additional growth due to the return of project-based businesses in the energy and industrial markets in the second half of the year. These commercial results and the strength of our rebound highlight the resilience of our businesses and the critical importance of the solutions we provide to our customers. 
On Slide 9, we provide a deeper outlook for our primary end markets. To level set, we entered the year cautiously bullish about the state of our underlying markets and the velocity of the pandemic recovery. Our day rate businesses began to accelerate coming into the year, and we continue to leverage our diversified portfolio to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive organic growth coming out of the pandemic. We are now measuring our markets against their pre-pandemic levels. Many of our markets have fully recovered, and the majority of our markets are on track to have fully recovered by the end of the year. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're not out of the woods yet, but even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we are optimistic about the outlook of our end markets. 
In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, industrial day rates continued to increase throughout the quarter. As I've mentioned, we will not be at full recovery until we see large CapEx projects resume, but the underlying industrial markets are in a state of recovery trending back towards 2019 levels. Agriculture continues to drive outsized growth as crop prices and customer sentiment remains strong. Our water business is stable. We continue to assess any subsequent impact from the pandemic on municipal funding as well as tailwinds that might come out of an infrastructure bill. Energy markets continue to lag 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in this sector. 
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We experienced solid growth across almost all of our markets, semicon and food and pharma continued to outperform, driven by a strong market and winning share with our differentiated technology offerings. The overall automotive market faces many challenges, but we have won several new platforms driving our performance. Our AI and life science markets are on the rebound as the impact of the pandemic in the United States has improved. The industrial businesses within the segment are seeing a similar result to FMT. Day rates are improving, but projects are lacking. 
One last item for HST. We do see risk with the COVID opportunities we have been taking -- talking about in this segment, specifically around testing. The end product application is yet to receive FDA approval which will impact volumes for this year. We do believe that the strength in the rest of the segment will be able to offset most of that risk. 
Finally, in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment, dispensing continues its rebound as large retailers free up capital and work through pent-up demand for equipment. Much like our automotive exposures in HST, the auto recovery in FSD at BAND-IT is driven by new platform wins, coupled with an improved market. In Fire & Rescue, we continue to assess municipal budget headwinds, especially in Europe and India as budgets have not been released, delaying tenders. The U.S. market has been better, and we are optimistic about the impact of our businesses from increased infrastructure spending. 
The other [ ligand ] category in FSD is primarily BAND-IT's energy and aerospace exposure along with some industrial applications in Fire & Rescue. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and are focused on ensuring the stability of our supply chain. This persistence in global supply chain issues threatened to create choppiness in the back half of the year. Despite these factors, we are confident enough in our outlook to raise our organic growth expectations for the year. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year."

I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q1 orders of $711 million were up 10% overall and up 6% organically as we built $59 million of backlog in the quarter.

Q1 orders of $711 million were up 10% overall and up 6% organically as we built $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. 
First quarter sales of $652 million were up 10% overall and 6% organically. We experienced growth across all our segments, with over 75% of our business units increasing year-over-year. Strength in semicon, food and pharma and dispensing were the notable highlights in the quarter. 
Q1 gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 44.9% but was up 110 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, inventory step-up associated with ABEL, mix and onetime inventory reserves. The inventory reserves were associated with our pandemic-related electrostatic sprayer businesses not materializing at the rate we expected. Excluding acquisitions and the inventory reserves, gross margin would have been flat to prior year. 
First quarter operating margin was 23.9%, up 40 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the increased volume and the impact of cost actions taken last year, offset by the gross margin pressure I just mentioned. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the following slide. 
Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.6%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20% due to a decrease in the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. This drove a $0.05 headwind on EPS for the quarter. First quarter adjusted net income was $115 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.51, up $0.18 or 14% over prior year. Excluding the $0.05 tax headwind, adjusted EPS would have been up $0.23 or 17%. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $95 million, up 32% compared to prior year and was 82% of adjusted net income. The strong performance was driven by higher earnings and a continued impact of our working capital initiatives. 
Moving on to Slide 12. As Eric mentioned, we entered the quarter cautiously optimistic about the pace of growth coming into 2021. We knew that we were structurally well positioned to take advantage of improving marking conditions from the cost actions and discretionary controls we put in place last year. Adjusted operating income increased $18 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 6% organic growth contributed approximately $13 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. The impact of previous discretionary cost controls contributed $5 million, and we were able to net $4 million from price productivity, partially offset by inflation. 
After accounting for $2 million of negative mix, our organic flow-through was extremely strong at 58%. Flow-through was then negatively impacted by the $3 million charge related to the inventory reserve I discussed on the last slide and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting to a reported flow-through of 32%. As we highlighted in prior calls, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We have already started those investments and expect the associated costs from these initiatives will reduce our organic flow-through in subsequent quarters. 
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. I'm on Slide 13. For the second quarter, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.63, with organic revenue growth of 18% to 20%, and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The second quarter effective tax rate is expected to be about 23%, and we expect a 2% top line benefit from the impact of FX. Corporate costs in the second quarter are expected to be around $21 million, with the increase primarily driven by the M&A investments we discussed earlier. 
Turning to the full year outlook. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance from $5.65 to $5.95, up to $6.05 to $6.20. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 6% to 8%, up to 9% to 10%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 1% benefit to top line results. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. Free cash flow is now expected to be 115% to 120% of net income. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $74 million for the full year. 
Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs or earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. ABEL Pump is now included in these estimates, with the deal closed in the first quarter. Airtech is not included in these estimates. We will update our guidance accordingly once the deal closes. With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to share an update on our ESG journey and the evolution of our company culture. We recently published our second corporate social responsibility report. This report is our first to adopt the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board's sector standards, also known as SASB. We have increased our disclosures in key areas, including health and safety, diversity and environmental impact. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Denise Cade, our General Counsel and her cross-functional team for their outstanding efforts to bring our hard work and commitments to light. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be a point of emphasis in our evolving company culture. Since we last met, an outside facilitator conducted anonymous focus groups with employees from around the world, from which we learned and were able to begin developing more targeted goals for the company. We are currently planning training sessions for all leaders to help them understand and become comfortable fostering dialogue on these important issues. We are addressing our talent management processes, including our assessment of existing talent and our consideration of new talent through recruiting to help ensure our processes are free from unconscious bias, and we are assessing our purchasing practice to expand our use of diverse suppliers. 
IDEX is a decentralized company with a diverse collection of businesses. Our superior economic model depends upon problem-solving and decision-making at the point of impact, closest to our customers. Our collective work within this important area, as outlined in this report, is an essential component of our next phase of business growth.

I mean, look, it -- I mean it's an interesting time, as I said in the opening comments there, I mean, we've got this broad-based momentum which we feel really good about. And it's got the little chapters that lie over it, whether that's shutdowns coming out of Christmas, terrible weather in Texas in February, supply chain stuff now, and I think that's going to be the story as we go. And then that lays over the IDEX story, which always kind of had our second quarter as a high point for us. And so we see that momentum lining up nicely on our typically seasonally adjusted second quarter.
And in the back half, I think that's going to be a story. We've got some projects and things that we know about on the inside that we feel good about. We think the momentum certainly will continue, but we would suspect we're still going to have a lot of these challenges out there that we'll have to navigate around. And of course, then, I think the typical seasonal patterns that we see around summer shutdowns and things in Europe are embedded on top of that. So it's an interesting story with very broad-based support, early momentum, these kind of episodic challenges that we have to navigate around that we feel confident we will."

Well, look, we -- this is where our model and our talent really helps us. I mean we've got a lot of local sourcing, very close to where we produce, very close to where we sell, so we have kind of an inherent advantage there. And we got really, really talented teams that used, frankly, a lot of the lessons of the year's worth of severe acute phases of a pandemic to make some smart moves around supply chain to prepare us for this.
That being said, I would say on the inflationary front, it's kind of spotty for us. I mean remember, we're a little further down the food chain. We don't buy a lot of giant quantities of base material, we buy things that have been converted. So it does have a little bit of a lag for us. And so we see the same things others are seeing, where we buy lots of metals, there's some inflationary pressure, electronics, a few other places, but we're navigating around those. On the freight side, that's certainly a challenge, both on the price, frankly, more on the availability side. We're no different than anybody else trying to find sea containers, trucking, trains, port facilities that have to unclog, all of those things. Our model helps us, our folks help us.
I think as we go further out, the inflationary pressure, I actually think that's going to ramp up a bit for everybody. One of the things that you can still appreciate, I see it in our own businesses is, today, we still have a little bit of a benefit of, our people are good scavengers. They'll go around and they'll find some things over here, find some places over there, take advantage of some inventory shelf stock. Eventually, you kind of get back where you're right at the end of the factory, and then you're kind of dealing with what everybody else is.
So we're planning for that. We're making all the moves that we need to. And certainly, of course, all of this for us, you can never tell the story without talking about price capture. And so we've got these things aligned. And as you suspect, we're always trying to manage that spread and taking advantage of the price capture side as we sell and then executing the heck out of a difficult environment on the back end to maintain that spread as we go and doing it all with our customers' top of mind and considering and remembering the lead time requirements that we have, kind of where we sit, the criticality of what we do, that's what drives all of it."

I mean we originally talked about that range pretty quickly that moved to about $60 million. That was split pretty evenly between 2020 and '21. So now we're kind of talking about a $30 million bucket for this year. And the 2 biggest components in there were the electrostatic sprayer application, which we talked about and you saw in the margin walk, I'll come back to that in a second, and then the COVID testing, the diagnostic application which was always a little bit more back-end loaded. And as you noted and we noted in our remarks, we've got some pressure points around both of those related, frankly, to the improving situation that we see across the globe in terms of vaccination rates and some other things.
On the sprayer front, that's literally as binary as some -- a change in thought, a change in thought that was part of the CDC guidelines around the need for standardization, not being as high as previously thought, at a time pretty coincident with some of our launch planning. So as you suspect, we've taken a slightly different view of that business. I think it's a good product line. There are still plenty of places, a lot of it involved in transportation where that's still going to be an essential piece of it, but it's no doubt going to run out slower.
I do want to pause just for a second though and point out the positive aspect of that. That was one of our hardest hit businesses in terms of their core markets that rallied massively quickly, put together a business and put together all this product and got it ready to, frankly, live our mission and try to make the world a better place. So we celebrate that one, and we're going to leverage that capability going forward.
On the other side, on the testing front, it's a little bit more complex. We've got some issues on FDA approvals with our partners, and we have this backdrop of vaccinations and things rolling out across the world. But I must tell you, so I think we're viewing that a little less favorably as we go forward, again, with an eye towards what happens in the back half. The world still is not at the recommended level of surveillance testing, we're underneath it by more than half. And we still think this has a role to play, but we wanted to at least point out that there's an impact of an improving world to a couple of these applications. But overall, couldn't be happier with how our teams responded and put together the solutions here."

Second question.

I mean it's an important piece of the business, especially as we think about the rest of the year. I think actually the situation is changed there. The daily order rates, of course, we pointed to that momentum, and that's a great sign. That's a great sign that the system is working and that the momentum is there. The project side, I think, has shifted from one of confidence and a lack of belief in, let's say, an improving outlook in the world and all of those things. That's actually quite favorable now.
I think now it's actually caught up in a state -- a zone of people just trying to execute it. And I look at my own businesses and see some of that same thing where some things -- larger projects we've been thinking about, a lot of people that would have been moving those along are trying really, really hard to ship product, get things going, understanding bets on inventory, all of that. So as we engage with customers, particularly right down that fairway of industrials within FMT, this is the difference in tone. You see a lot of optimism, but you also see a lot of very, very busy people. And that's especially true of the nature of the kind of projects we have. These are kind of those medium-term expansions of facilities and things like that.
So we're pretty confident, very confident that those are going to come back. In some ways, we just need to get a little bit more space to work on them, continue to see the momentum that's already out there and then the lines cross, and we think that's an important part of our story going forward."

And just capacity, in general, as you've seen in the comments for a couple of quarters here, we've been building that all along. A lot of the optimization we've done with IDEX over the last 5 years gave us the muscle that we're now leaning on as we think about looking for, acquiring and integrating companies. So that's something just at the foundational level.
Relative to the 2 transactions that we have here, they're both very good standalone businesses that -- while they're going to require some integrative activity, these are well positioned, in good shape and, let's say, a lighter touch in terms of demand from IDEX talent across the board. And so bottom line is, I feel confident that we could continue to work the funnel that we have, with the intent that we're driving. If we were to kind of lap this experience again in the back half, I wouldn't see that as a problem in terms of our teams being able to go out and work on acquisitions.
I will tell you, as you suspect, we always filter these. There are some properties that if we said yes and we were successful, they take a lot more work than others. And we would factor that in, and we're always pretty aware of that. But right now, in very good shape with an intentional build on the bottom side, and on the top, 2 transactions that very fortunately are in kind of great shape out of the gate."

This is a really, really phenomenal company, and it sits very nicely next to the Gast business that we illustrated there on the opening deck. In the nature that they're both involved with very, very specialized air handling applications, but they're highly complementary, so the strengths of Gast in different areas of compression are then balanced very nicely with the regenerative blower side and the specialty in the valve piece of Airtech. So they fit together seamlessly.
What I really, really like about these businesses is they're both filled with incredible domain experts who have just got phenomenal abilities to innovate. Airtech has got a great growth track record. As I said in my opening comments, it's very profitable, very close to end markets that we're extremely interested in. On the Gast side, we've got some of that as well. And frankly, we've got a lot of channel strength in markets that I think are going to complement that business.
And then we've got a toolkit. We've got a talent base, a cultural base and an 80/20 toolkit that we know when you apply to IDEX-like businesses, particularly ones of high quality, can drive the whole thing further.
Last piece of it is there's other things out there in this world that could be interesting that the 2 businesses together may unlock for us that are part of our -- the funnel and things that we're thinking about as we consider capital deployment in the future.

Well, I mean, I certainly couldn't talk too much about what they said or what they may be seeing, but I will say, it's an interesting space because you have a lot of things going on here. You've got, obviously, the municipal spend profile side. And a lot of that, we're going to have to wait and see where that goes. There are so many elements that are moving around concurrently. There's federal efforts to backstop things. And that side of it, there's some regulatory pieces, so we'll see.
And then you've got this dynamic certainly in this market where we've seen even ahead of some of the more recent supply chain stuff that we're talking about globally, a very unique to that industry challenge around trucks and chassis and things. That sort of capped off some of the potential on the sales side for end customers. So as that works itself out, that's going to be ultimately good for us. We'll see how successful people are with that. And then we'll have to see where the market itself, the municipal market, rides along underneath it. And then you always have to throw in for us. I hate to do -- add more and more variable, but this is a really massively global business, and so they don't all move in step. Things going on in China and India and emerging markets are not necessarily the same as what we would see here in the Midwest.
So there's a lot of things working together. I think it's safe to put it in the recovering. It has improved, not quite back where we would expect it to be and think it will be ultimately. And then we will, like you, monitor a lot of these things coming together here to paint a clearer picture as we go."

The past 1.5 years have been my most dynamic and unpredictable ever experienced, but our IDEXX team stepped up again in Q2 and delivered during an extremely challenging environment. Thank you to t",1578,"Thank you, Mike. Beginning with our overview on Slide 6. 
The past 1.5 years have been my most dynamic and unpredictable ever experienced, but our IDEXX team stepped up again in Q2 and delivered during an extremely challenging environment. Thank you to the IDEX employees around the world, who are working so hard. 
Our commercial performance is very strong as we recorded record orders and backlog in the quarter. Order trends continue to improve sequentially, and all 3 segments are materially above pre-pandemic level. Our day rates are very strong, and our OEM order patterns are robust. Only large industrial projects, many of them in FMT, continue to lag a bit. We're beginning to see the move into planning funnels, indicating support for continued phases of organic growth in the back half of 2021 and next year. 
Our #1 operating challenge for the quarter was supply chain and logistics disruptions. IDEX is generally a short-cycle business with quick lead times. We typically operate at the component level further down our customers' bill of materials. We're also not very vertically integrated. We depend on a tight network of supplier partners, often located close by our operating units to quick turn our solutions with a minimum of visibility. For these reasons, the challenging conditions of tight material supply and bottleneck logistics tend to lag other industrial companies. 
Our agile model does support a quick calibration to today's reality, and it helps us exit quicker than many on the backside of a supply side constraint. Overall, we believe these disruptions have hit a plateau. We don't see things getting worse, and the challenges will continue to be highly variable. At the same time, we don't anticipate these disruptions getting better soon, but most likely they will not subside until the end of this year or early next year. 
We anticipated rising inflation as the global economy recovered, but like many did not imagine the sharp rate of increase. This narrowed our spread between price capture and material costs, although we remain positive overall. Our teams leveraged the systematic investments we made a few years ago in pricing management and aggressively deployed 2, sometimes 3 pricing adjustments with precision. We are on track to expand our price/cost spread to typical levels as we travel through the back half of the year. 
While we spend a lot of time talking about our business's ability to capture price, one area that I don't want to miss is our continued focus on operational productivity. Our teams continue to drive margin improvement through 80/20 simplification, lean effort and through sound CapEx deployment. Our robust project funnels continue to be another weapon to combat rising costs. The one project that exemplifies the spirit deserves mention as we discuss Q2. 
Our energy market now starting to show some signs of recovery off the bottom are still lagging the overall group. Our teams are aggressively executing a facility rationalization project to consolidate our scale and focus our human resources in close working proximity. Ultimately, this is a long-term value driver for that group. But in the quarter, the project created headwinds for us as equipment was delayed and inventory positions were less than ideal to support production transfers. We expect the project to be back on track and completed by the end of the third quarter. 
Overall, I am confident in our path through these choppy recovery recedes, we continue to apply relentless focus from outstanding teams to deliver solutions that matter from high-quality businesses that are very well positioned within their application steps. 
Moving on to Slide 7. We deployed just over $575 million in the first half of the year with our acquisitions of ABEL Pumps, Airtech and a small investment in a digitalization technology start-up within the Fire & Rescue space. We continue to build out processes and capabilities to explore additional strategic investments we want to make across IDEX. Our funnel for potential acquisitions is stronger than it has been in the past, and we are more aggressive in pursuing opportunities that enhance our business solutions fit well with our style of competition and drive IDEX-like returns. It's early days in our integration of ABEL and Airtech, but we're happy to see that each business is performing well with excellent growth prospects in the near and long term. 
While we've stepped up our M&A game, we're also investing in our existing businesses with a 45% increase in capital spending through the first half of the year. We're in the process of expanding IDEX facilities in China and India. We project significant ongoing growth opportunities across Asia, and these investments are critical to support our local-for-local approach as we move to the next level of competitive advantage. 
We're also focused on our digital strategy with our largest investments tied to our areas of higher integration and scale as we seek to drive higher impact for our customers. Lastly, as I mentioned previously, we're focused on operational productivity as market dynamics are changing as well as investing in new technology to support growth. This is on both the CapEx and OpEx side. Some of these investments are targeted at new applications in high-growth areas, like components to enable new global broadband satellite networks, building batteries for electric vehicles and providing key products to support the build-out of incremental capacity in semiconductor manufacturing. These investments are combined with targeted spend in areas to support automation and efficiencies across the shop floor. This strategic approach to both inorganic and organic investment is already paying off and sets us up for ongoing success for years to come. 
Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. As I mentioned, order strength continued in the second quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially, resulting in a backlog build of $65 million in the quarter. As we look across our segments, all rebounded well from the pandemic and delivered strong organic order growth. Sequentially, Fluid & Metering Technologies and Fire & Safety diversified products saw increased compared to the first quarter. Our Health & Science Technologies segment also saw increased sequential orders if we exclude the impact of a COVID testing application debooking that occurred in Q2. 
Order intake across all segments was also above second quarter 2019 levels. FMT lags HST and FSD due to lower levels of investment in the oil and gas market as well as its concentration in the industrial market, which saw a precoded pullback in the second half of 2019. These commercial results give us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit growth in the second half of the year and continue to highlight the resilience of our businesses and the criticality of our solutions to customers. 
On Slide 9, we provide a deeper look into our primary end markets. Our focus is shifting from recovery to growth as most of our businesses are now performing above pre-pandemic levels. Even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we're optimistic about the outlook of our end markets and our ability to execute within them. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were strong. Supply chain challenges remain, but overall, the market trajectory was at or above 2019 levels with only large projects lagging, as I mentioned earlier. 
Agriculture continued to drive strong growth, driven by aging farm equipment and record crop prices. Our water business was stable. We continue to monitor the impact of the federal infrastructure package on U.S. municipal spending. Energy and chemical markets continue to trail 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in the sector as well as a longer project close cycle. 
One item to highlight for FMT is the impact of our F&D acquisition last year. It's now in our organic figures. And with its backlog burn last year and significant pullback in customers' capital investments, it impacted FMT's organic sales by 11%. In other words, FMT's organic sales for the quarter would have been 19% instead of 8%. 
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We're seeing recovery and pivot to growth across all our end markets. [indiscernible] continued to perform well, driven by strong market demand and winning share through our targeted growth initiatives. The overall automotive market continued to face supply chain-driven challenges, but we outperformed the market due to our product concentration in higher-end European vehicles. Our AI and life science markets continue to perform well as the pandemic impact eased and investments have increased. The industrial business within the segment saw a similar result to FMT. 
Finally, in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment, dispensing rebounded as large retailers freed up capital and worked through pent-up demand for equipment. Our BAND-IT business was adversely affected by U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages in the second quarter. However, we continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to outperform the market as supply chain constraints ease. 
In Fire & Rescue, we have yet to see larger tenders come back and emerging markets remain slow. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect some choppiness in the second half of the year. That said, we're confident in the future trajectory of our end markets as well as our ability to execute on our strong backlog and have raised our organic growth expectations for the year. 
With that, I would like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results."

Q2 orders of $751 million were up 44% overall and 39% organically as we built $65 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. 
Second quarter sales of $686 million were up 22% overall and 17% organically. While we experienced a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, we were impacted by supply chain constraints and our energy site consolidation, which tempered our results. 
The FMD pressure in Fluid & Metering Eric discussed also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding FMD, organic sales would have been up 22%. 
Q2 gross margin expanded by 280 basis points to 44.6%. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of $1.8 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the ABEL acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 44.9% and was approximately flat sequentially.
Second quarter operating margin was 23.1%, up 340 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.4%, up 330 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset by a rebound in discretionary spending and investment. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. 
Our Q2 effective tax rate was 21.3%, which was lower than the prior year ETR of 22.7% due to benefits from foreign sourced income in the second quarter of 2021. This benefit also drove favorability to our guided rate for the quarter. 
Q2 adjusted net income was $123 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.61, up $0.51 or 46% over prior year adjusted EPS. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $120 million, down 25% compared to prior year and was 98% of adjusted net income. This result was impacted by a volume-driven working capital build, higher CapEx and timing of tax payments, partially offset by higher earnings. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing the significant volume changes year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 12, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $49 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 17% organic growth contributed approximately $41 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We maintained positive price material cost within the quarter and leveraged well on the volume increase. Our high contribution margins helped mitigate the private headwinds we experienced from the supply chain disruptions. 
In the second quarter of 2020, discretionary spending and investment were minimal, driven by a strict cost control environment during the pandemic. As we return to a spend level, in line with our growth and continued strategic investments, we see year-over-year pressure of about $11 million, in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. 
Even with the incremental spend, supply chain and operational issues that tempered our performance, we still achieved a robust 45% organic flow through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX getting us to our reported flow-through of 39%. 
As we highlighted, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We expect that our level of discretionary spending as well as associated costs from growth initiatives will similarly reduce organic flow through in subsequent quarters. 
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Moving on to Slide 13. For the third quarter, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.57 to $1.61. We expect organic revenue growth of 14% to 16% and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The third quarter effective tax rate is expected to be 23%, and we expect a 1% top line benefit from the impact of FX. And corporate costs in the third quarter are expected to be around $21 million. 
Turning to the full year. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance from our previous range of $6.05 to $6.20, up to $6.26 to $6.36. This range includes Airtech, which will contribute $0.06 in the second half of 2021, roughly $0.03 a quarter. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 9% to 10% up to 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, an increase of around $10 million versus our last call as we increase our investments in growth opportunities. Free cash flow is expected to be 110% to 115% of net income, lower versus our last guide, primarily due to the additional capital spending and higher working capital to support our increased volume. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $77 million for the year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. 
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share an update on our ESG journey and the evolution of our company culture. 
I pledged earlier this year that we would hire a new Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. I'm pleased to announce that I now have Troy McIntosh in my senior leadership team. He joined us just last week from U.S. Cellular, the fourth largest cellular communications carrier in the United States where he led significant improvements in their culture and levels of diversity in the workforce. At IDEX, Troy will helped build the global road map and success measures for DE&I. He will help embed DE&I deeper in our culture and build inclusive leadership confidence and capabilities and all our people through training, education and coaching. He will help us make sure our systems mitigate bias and create opportunities for everyone, no matter of their background to reach their full potential at IDEX. I look forward to great things happening with his leadership. 
I'd also like to share a nice step we're taking to improve our energy efficiencies. Work recently began on a solar array on the roof of our Lucas manufacturing facility in Germany. Once completed next month, this collection of solar panels will be about 1/3 the size of the European soccer field and provide 30% of the electricity needs for the facility. Not only will it help reduce our carbon footprint there, we estimate it will save the business more than EUR 67,000 in just the first year alone. We anticipate this project will serve as a pilot, leading the way for other solar installations on IDEX facilities around the world. 
Lastly, I want to share that the catastrophic flooding that devastated portions of Western Europe earlier this month has impacted many IDEX employees. About 1/4 of the employees at our German Fire & Safety business have either had their home severely damaged or destroyed. All of our employees are safe, living with friends and family as recovery efforts are ongoing and operations continued at our facility, which is not directly impacted by the flood. Amid all this destruction and loss, we once again saw the spirit of IDEX come through. Colleagues from other IDEX businesses in Germany came to the area to assist. With pumping equipment from our businesses, our people work tirelessly to help draw water from flooded homes to the long road of recovery. The IDEX Foundation also paid $100,000 to the German Red Cross, which Health & Science thousands of people in the region assisting those impact. While I shared this internally, I want to again express with our employees a better that we stand by you through this terrible tragedy.

I mean make no mistake, this is really, really tough right now. And so staying at a steady state of is what it is. So I don't want to mischaracterize it there. For us, a couple of things to remember. We're a little less exposed to a lot of the electronics microprocessor things that other businesses are. Our bill of material is generally a little bit more streamlined and simplified. We don't have as many aggregations of complex systems. We do a lot of great critical components. And we still -- we have a lot of suppliers that are pretty close by that honestly, we drive by on the way to work. That being said, it's still very difficult for us. The indicators we're looking at things like lead times, what are the quota lead times? And then what is the performance against them? And look, they have lengthened and extended, but they're generally kind of holding at this point, and the delivery rates against them, while not great, are at least, in our world, pretty stable at this point. So I just want to emphasize the relative nature of the comments and say for us, it's a very, very tough environment, but we see it the one we can now begin to plan around, given what we do."

So if we kind of go back to the end of 2020, we saw -- most of the acceleration that we're seeing was in that restoration of industrial day rates in our businesses. As we look at the second quarter and even into the first days of July, it's pretty stable at this point. I mean it's kind of at a healthy clip. We'll see it move on in terms of price and some things that come up, but it's  not accelerating at the same rate nor is it in our world, decelerating, Think of it as stable. 
And then there's 2 other components that we think a lot about for ton of IDEX businesses. And they're in the project category, but they're different degrees in terms of size and scope. So what we are seeing and what's contributing to growth, and I know will continue into Q3 and Q4, are what we would call that's a small project. These are discrete things where people are optimizing the system instead of asking for 1 or 2 of something, it's 10 to 20. And they're running their factory, their production lines, but they're trying to optimize it, enhance throughput, get productivity. Those are the kind of things you can do on the run. And so we're seeing that -- those have been strong contributors, and we think they'll continue. 
Right past it are the classic larger projects that we and others play with. A lot of them in kind of the chemical, oil and gas infrastructure spaces. And there's -- it's just a general story there still where those things are delayed. They were frozen in 2020. They were pushed out into 2021, not canceled. I will say what we're starting to hear now and mainly from distributors that are a little closer to the front line are that those are now starting to turn into quote activity and spec transfer and the kind of things you start to see ahead of an order and a replenishment cycle on our side. 
When does that happen? Maybe there's some of it in the back half of the year, certainly, at a minimum, we start talking about it more in planning, and I think it bodes well for the early part of 2022."

On the inside, we've been talking now for a couple of quarters about the intentionality of the resource bill and the time and effort we're taking to consider all of the areas where we'd like to do more business, some of it through inorganic efforts. Think of this as a series of concentric circles, radiating around places where we participate today and participate. And a few things we're actually thinking of some zones where we're not part, not currently part of IDEX. It could be interesting to have IDEX-like attributes. So we've got the firepower, we're doing more work. And then the funnel of things that we're looking at, it's very active, aggressive and, I think in the end, actionable. 
Now we still are going to take the same discipline that we've had to any of the things that we're looking at. It's got to meet certain requirements, got to fit into IDEX. It's got to leverage what we do best.

And so that's maybe the area of difference with slight tweaks to the model. 
With always, I mean, we've mentioned an open aperture for at least a couple of years now, at least an open mind to some things that might be very interesting that we've long considered for IDEX. I don't know if that's different. That's always been on the page, but these would be the 2 areas that there's a separate resource base thinking about a little further out from what we've done before, but still anchored to how we do it and a couple of zones that have always been interesting to us because they have IDEX-like attributes."

You're seeing some normalization in margin or at least with the pressures from a price/cost perspective can look like as you move through the year, the timing of some of these later cycle things start getting a little bit better as you move through this year. Maybe late and early next year, you can start seeing a little bit more CapEx. Just how does that all kind of come together when you're thinking about that 1- to 2-year outlook from your seat?

If you start from the highest level and think about the next couple of years, I think you start with a very positive perspective. You recognize that like we're now coming through a pretty acute recovery cycle that isn't completely played out. Then there's a replenishment cycle that not only, I think, is reflective of the time that we sort of were all locked away, but I think even ahead of that, there was a decent amount of industrial capacity that needs to be put back into the system. 
The real question, I think, as we go is, if you think of this as a series of graph lines with very sharp peaks and troughs and it is super dynamic in terms of the elements we're dealing with today as they smooth out and look a little bit more like the Appalachians, I think that that becomes a little bit more of a standard operating environment with positive momentum. And so many of the dynamics that we're talking about now in terms of when they come back or when they reoccur, I think they would be in place and they would be things that we'd be typically used to looking at. And it would feel a little bit normalized in terms of the way that we would operate with favorable winds at our back in all of the places that we play. So I think we view it that way. We're planning for it that way. It's a positive outlook, a positive framework. You just sort of have to navigate some of the puts and takes and there's a lot of dynamic variables here, none of which I think really get in the way of that positive outlook."

They had -- they were burning backlog nicely, sort of right at the point of acquisition. And of course, COVID came along and devastated a lot of the core markets there. And it's a little bit more project intensive than the average IDEX business, just by the nature of what they do. These are the large units that are going out there and custody transfer in large pipeline projects and things like that. 
So -- and then if you think of that environment, I mean, there's been a couple of very sort of public shocks in that particular area as well. We're just -- right now, the spend is very intensive towards some other things, simple maintenance in those kind of items. So I think it's going to be a little while before that breaks. That said, the international markets are a little different than what we're seeing here in North America. They're generally more favorable. That business has been pointed towards those strategically long before we bought them and continue that way. So we think that's a nice extension for it. But I think as we saw even with the events that happened here a little bit recently, it didn't take too many days for things to be off-line before our economy felt it. And this business makes them incredibly great and nice pieces of technology that are very useful in that continuum. So we like it from the long term and what it does.

And generally, as you know, we do a lot of customized products, a lot of things that are very, very hyper specific. They don't have a lot of like just high-volume stocking orders and things like parts. So we're not a great company to stock a lot of material. That being said, I probably would point to this quarter is a higher number of that. We're just because of -- I mean our own lead times are extending and that's an unusual occurrence. We're aggressively doing some things on price and everybody else. So there's -- I don't think it's a giant number for this price. It just kind of can't be. But it's in there, more than we've seen before in terms of people trying to get a place in line or potentially say, hey, can I -- I'll take a risk here and so I can avoid part of the price increase. But it's a point or 2 of the company. It's not a giant part, only applies into -- this distribution, you go to a lot of our distributors, you're not going to see a lot of product on the shelf, mainly because of just the model. It often needs to be customized at the last minute to some regard. We have quick lead times anyway. It doesn't add a lot of value to sit on a shelf somewhere and make that guess. So I guess, long story short, we have probably a higher incidence of this than we typically do. But because of the nature of IDEX, it's still a really, really low number for us."

So -- look, we don't have a lot of CapEx intensity at IDEX anyway. But it is a ramp-up from where we've typically been. A lot of it is attributed to the story around emerging markets for us, where we're taking very deliberate actions in both our areas of concentration in China and India to make long-term infrastructure bet over there to support a really, really, really good local-to-local capability set that we have. So there's a big driver there that, of course, doesn't reoccur all that often. Outside of that, it's a next level down in the category of doing it more than we used to, would be things like factory floor automation. The technology available is pretty phenomenal today and the cost points have come down to the point where even in our world, it makes sense from time to time to put a robot where somebody was standing for, particularly when we've got some labor availability issues and a lot of it is high technology based. So those are projects -- I think there's a graphic on the slide deck that I used is something that we're actually using in that area. 
That's just -- I mean, it's a great lever of operational productivity. It doesn't necessarily inflect the curve too tremendously, but it really helps us from a business perspective, concentrate our efforts on very talented people and putting them in the areas where we're growing the company and drawing from within as opposed to having to go out on the outside.

I mean, I would say, number one, the financial positions of most municipalities certainly here in the United States are probably thought to be better than they were, let's say, a year ago. It's a lot of the stimulus money and things like that comes in and tax receipts generally have been higher. So I think just overall financial condition is good. 
Your question on the infrastructure spend thing is interesting. I mean there's always a question of how long do you go from a concept to an actual project-based reality and how long that takes. Ultimately, there's different parts of IDEX where that would actually help us in a good way. I'd point to our water business is one of them. There's a lot of talk in that bill about water infrastructure and the criticality there. I mean one of our businesses does an awful lot of great work on sort of flow monitoring studies, which ultimately support CapEx projects like you have to do one to then determine what it is you're going to buy in terms of CapEx. So I think we're well positioned there, and there are some other pockets as well, but like always, it probably will take longer to play out and run through the system than we might imagine. But I would put it in the category just like in -- they're seeing, I think, from receipts and economics that it's positive and certainly in a position that's better than I might have imagined it would be as we went into a pandemic."

I mean our Fire & Rescue business is -- I mean, they're phenomenal businesses. We've added to them over the years. We've got a nice scalable concentration, and it's one of our most geographically dispersed business. You start with the premise that we've got incredible assets in that space. We've always said it was kind of a mature, steady market for us as a backdrop overall. A couple of things going on there that at least in the near term, probably put it into the red zone most for us, one is, that industry is even before the pandemic was struggling with output execution around chassis and trucks and things and in a couple of different geographies. Obviously, what's going on now isn't making that better. And so just backlogs on fire truck continues to be as long as it was a year ago, if not longer. So you have a little bit of a moderation effect there. And then on the emerging markets side, specifically China, and we definitely see -- we've seen a couple of ways now of push for localization versus, in our case, we actually do a fair amount of imported products into that zone to complement our local brand there as well. And I don't think, long term, that hasn't necessarily impacted us, but it does impact us from a timing perspective, tends to keep tenders captive until we sort of see how it runs out. And so that's maybe the new element on top of the existing element and basically as a pretty steady market anyways. I always encourage people when they think about it, this is where like what we're doing in terms of our application sets on a critical job matters. So like the discussion we had earlier about automation and the things that we're doing to change the nature of the job is the exciting element with great, well-positioned global assets on a -- you can still think of it as a mission-critical job, very steady state. Generally, it's going to be something that's supported in the long term with funding and things. But it does go through certain ebbs and flows. And right now, it's on one of the more red not green zones, but we think long term is going to be fine."

We're beginning to see the move into planning funnels, indicating support for continued phases of organic growth in the back half of 2021 and next year.  
Our #1 operating challenge for the quarter was supply chain and logistics disruptions. IDEX is generally a short-cycle business with quick lead times. We typically operate at the component level further down our customers' bill of materials. We're also not very vertically integrated. We depend on a tight network of supplier partners, often located close by our operating units to quick turn our solutions with a minimum [ visibility ]. For these reasons, the challenging conditions of tight material supply and bottleneck logistics tend to lag other industrial companies.  
Our agile model does support a quick calibration to today's reality, and it helps us exit quicker than many on the backside of the supply side constraint. Overall, we believe these disruptions have hit a plateau. We don't see things getting worse, and the challenges will continue to be highly variable. At the same time, we don't anticipate these disruptions getting better soon, but most likely they will not subside until the end of this year or early next year.  
We anticipated rising inflation as the global economy recovered, but like many did not imagine the sharp rate of increase. This narrowed our spread between price capture and material costs, although we remain positive overall. Our teams leveraged the systematic investments we made a few years ago in pricing management and aggressively deployed 2, sometimes 3 pricing adjustments with precision. We are on track to expand our price/cost spread to typical levels as we travel through the back half of the year.  
While we spend a lot of time talking about our business's ability to capture price, one area that I don't want to miss is our continued focus on operational productivity. Our teams continue to drive margin improvement through 80/20 simplification, lean effort and through sound CapEx deployment. Our robust project funnels continue to be another weapon to combat rising costs. The one project that exemplifies the spirit deserves mention as we discuss Q2.  
Our energy market now starting to show some signs of recovery off the bottom are still lagging the overall group. Our teams are aggressively executing a facility rationalization project to consolidate our scale and focus our human resources in close working proximity. Ultimately, this is a long-term value driver for that group. But in the quarter, the project created headwinds for us as equipment was delayed and inventory positions were less than ideal to support production transfers. We expect the project to be back on track and completed by the end of the third quarter.  
Overall, I am confident in our path through these choppy recovery as we continue to apply relentless focus from outstanding teams to deliver solutions that matter from high-quality businesses that are very well positioned within their application steps.  
Moving on to Slide 7. We deployed just over $575 million in the first half of the year with our acquisitions of ABEL Pumps, Airtech and a small investment in a digitalization technology start-up within the Fire & Rescue space. We continue to build out processes and capabilities to explore additional strategic investments we want to make across IDEX. Our funnel for potential acquisitions is stronger than it has been in the past, and we are more aggressive in pursuing opportunities that enhance our business solutions, fit well with our style of competition and drive IDEX-like returns.  It's early days in our integration of ABEL and Airtech, but we're happy to see that each business is performing well with excellent growth prospects in the near and long term. 
While we've stepped up our M&A game, we're also investing in our existing businesses with a 45% increase in capital spending through the first half of the year. We're in the process of expanding IDEX facilities in China and India. We project significant ongoing growth opportunities across Asia, and these investments are critical to support our local-for-local approach as we move to the next level of competitive advantage.  
We're also focused on our digital strategy with our largest investments tied to our areas of higher integration and scale as we seek to drive higher impact for our customers. Lastly, as I mentioned previously, we're focused on operational productivity as market dynamics are changing as well as investing in new technology to support growth. This is on both the CapEx and OpEx side. Some of these investments are targeted at new applications in high-growth areas, like components to enable new global broadband satellite networks, building batteries for electric vehicles and providing key products to support the build-out of incremental capacity in semiconductor manufacturing. These investments are combined with targeted spend in areas to support automation and efficiencies across the shop floor. This strategic approach to both inorganic and organic investment is already paying off and sets us up for ongoing success for years to come.  
Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. As I mentioned, order strength continued in the second quarter both compared to prior year and sequentially, resulting in a backlog build of $65 million in the quarter. As we look across our segments, all rebounded well from the pandemic and delivered strong organic order growth. Sequentially, Fluid & Metering technologies and Fire & Safety diversified products saw increased orders compared to the first quarter. Our Health & Science Technologies segment also saw increased sequential orders if we exclude the impact of a COVID testing application debooking that occurred in Q2.  
Order intake across all segments was also above second quarter 2019 levels. FMT lags HST and FSD due to lower levels of investment in the oil and gas market as well as concentration in the industrial market, which saw a pre-COVID pullback in the second half of 2019. These commercial results give us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit growth in the second half of the year and continue to highlight the resilience of our businesses and the criticality of our solutions to customers.  
On Slide 9, we provide a deeper look into our primary end markets. Our focus is shifting from recovery to growth as most of our businesses are now performing above pre-pandemic levels. Even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we're optimistic about the outlook of our end markets and our ability to execute within them. 
In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were strong. Supply chain challenges remain. But overall, the market trajectory was at or above 2019 levels with only large projects lagging, as I mentioned earlier.  
Agriculture continued to drive strong growth, driven by aging farm equipment and record crop prices. Our water business was stable. We continue to monitor the impact of the federal infrastructure package on U.S. municipal spending. Energy and chemical markets continue to trail 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in the sector as well as a longer project close cycle.  
One item to highlight for FMT is the impact of our FMD acquisition last year. It's now in our organic figures. And with its backlog burn last year and significant pullback in customers' capital investments, it impacted FMT's organic sales by 11%. In other words, FMT's organic sales for the quarter would have been 19% instead of 8%.  
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We're seeing recovery and pivot to growth across all our end markets. Semiconductor, food and pharma continued to perform well, driven by strong market demand and winning share through our targeted growth initiatives. The overall automotive market continued to face supply chain-driven challenges but we outperformed the market due to our product concentration in higher-end European vehicles.  
Our AI and life science markets continue to perform well as the pandemic impact eased and investments have increased. The industrial business within the segment saw a similar result to FMT.  
Finally, in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment, dispensing rebounded as large retailers freed up capital and worked through pent-up demand for equipment. Our BAND-IT business was adversely affected by U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages in the second quarter. However, we continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to outperform the market as supply chain constraints ease.  
In Fire & Rescue, we have yet to see larger tenders come back and emerging markets remain slow. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect some choppiness in the second half of the year. That said, we're confident in the future trajectory of our end markets as well as our ability to execute on our strong backlog and have raised our organic growth expectations for the year.  
With that, I would like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results."
29728,1672304868,2352990,"IDEX Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","IDEX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Eric.

Q2 orders of $751 million were up 44% overall and 39% organically as we built $65 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. 
Second quarter sales of $686 million were up 22% overall and 17% organically. While we experienced a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, we were impacted by supply chain constraints and our energy site consolidation, which tempered our results. The FMD pressure in Fluid & Metering Eric discussed also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding FMD, organic sales would have been up 22%. 
Q2 gross margin expanded by 280 basis points to 44.6%. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of $1.8 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the ABEL acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 44.9% and was approximately flat sequentially.
Second quarter operating margin was 23.1%, up 340 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.4%, up 330 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset by a rebound in discretionary spending and investment. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. 
Our Q2 effective tax rate was 21.3%, which was lower than the prior year ETR of 22.7% due to benefits from foreign sourced income in the second quarter of 2021. This benefit also drove favorability to our guided rate for the quarter. 
Q2 adjusted net income was $123 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.61, up $0.51 or 46% over prior year adjusted EPS. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $120 million, down 25% compared to prior year and was 98% of adjusted net income. This result was impacted by a volume-driven working capital build, higher CapEx and timing of tax payments, partially offset by higher earnings. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing the significant volume changes year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 12, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $49 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 17% organic growth contributed approximately $41 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We maintained positive price material cost within the quarter and leveraged well on the volume increase. Our high contribution margins helped mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from the supply chain disruptions. 
In the second quarter of 2020, discretionary spending and investment were minimal, driven by a strict cost control environment during the pandemic. As we return to a spend level, in line with our growth and continued strategic investments, we see year-over-year pressure of about $11 million, in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. 
Even with the incremental spend, supply chain and operational issues that tempered our performance, we still achieved a robust 45% organic flow-through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to our reported flow-through of 39%. 
As we highlighted, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We expect that our level of discretionary spending as well as associated costs from growth initiatives will similarly reduce organic flow-through in subsequent quarters. 
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Moving on to Slide 13. For the third quarter, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.57 to $1.61. We expect organic revenue growth of 14% to 16% and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The third quarter effective tax rate is expected to be 23%, and we expect a 1% top line benefit from the impact of FX. And corporate costs in the third quarter are expected to be around $21 million. 
Turning to the full year. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance from our previous range of $6.05 to $6.20, up to $6.26 to $6.36. This range includes Airtech, which will contribute $0.06 in the second half of 2021, roughly $0.03 a quarter. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 9% to 10% up to 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, an increase of around $10 million versus our last call as we increase our investments in growth opportunities. 
Free cash flow is expected to be 110% to 115% of net income, lower versus our last guide, primarily due to the additional capital spending and higher working capital to support our increased volume. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $77 million for the year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs, earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. 
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share an update on our ESG journey and the evolution of our company culture. 
I pledged earlier this year that we would hire a new Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. I'm pleased to announce that I now have Troy McIntosh in my senior leadership team. He joined us just last week from U.S. Cellular, the fourth largest cellular communications carrier in the United States where he led significant improvements in their culture and levels of diversity in the workforce. 
At IDEX, Troy will help build the global road map and success measures for DE&I. He will help embed DE&I deeper in our culture and build inclusive leadership confidence and capabilities in all our people through training, education and coaching. He will help us make sure our systems mitigate bias and create opportunities for everyone, no matter of their background to reach their full potential at IDEX. I look forward to great things happening with his leadership. 
I'd also like to share a nice step we're taking to improve our energy efficiencies. Work recently began on a solar array on the roof of our manufacturing facility in Germany. Once completed next month, this collection of solar panels will be about 1/3 the size of the European soccer field and provide 30% of the electricity needs for the facility. Not only will it help reduce our carbon footprint there, we estimate it will save the business more than EUR 67,000 in just the first year alone. We anticipate this project will serve as a pilot, leading the way for other solar installations on IDEX facilities around the world. 
Lastly, I want to share that the catastrophic flooding that devastated portions of Western Europe earlier this month has impacted many IDEX employees. About 1/4 of the employees at our German Fire & Safety business have either had their home severely damaged or destroyed. All of our employees are safe, living with friends and family as recovery efforts are ongoing. And operations continued at our facility, which is not directly impacted by the flood. 
Amid all this destruction and loss, we once again saw the spirit of IDEX come through. Colleagues from other IDEX businesses in Germany came to the area to assist. With pumping equipment from our businesses, our people work tirelessly to help draw water from flooded homes to the long road of [indiscernible] . The IDEX Foundation also paid $100,000 to the German Red Cross, which has thousands of people in the region assisting those impact. 
While I shared this internally, I want to again express with our employees better that we stand by you through this terrible tragedy. And thank you to all the dedicated and selfless IDEX colleagues who dropped everything and volunteered during this time of need. Your outstanding examples of what makes this company so special. 
With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions."

And so staying at a steady state is tough. It is what it is. So I don't want to mischaracterize it there. 
For us, a couple of things to remember. We're a little less exposed to a lot of the electronics microprocessor things that other businesses are. Our bill of material is generally a little bit more streamlined and simplified. We don't have as many aggregations of complex systems. We do a lot of great critical components. And we still -- we have a lot of suppliers that are pretty close by that honestly we drive by on the way to work. 
That being said, it's still very difficult for us. The indicators we're looking at, things like lead times, what are the quoted lead times and then what is the performance against them. And look, they have lengthened and extended, but they're generally kind of holding at this point. And the delivery rates against them, while not great, are at least, in our world, pretty stable at this point. So I just want to emphasize the relative nature of the comments and say, for us, it's a very, very tough environment, but we see it as one we can now begin to plan around given what we do."

As we look at the second quarter and even into the first days of July, it's pretty stable at this point. I mean it's kind of at a healthy clip. We'll see it move on in terms of price and some things that come up, but it's not accelerating at the same rate nor is it in our world, decelerating. Think of it as stable. 
And then there's 2 other components that we think a lot about for a ton of IDEX businesses. And they're in the project category, but they're different degrees in terms of size and scope. So what we are seeing and what's contributing to growth, and I know will continue into Q3 and Q4, are what we would call -- that's a small project. These are discrete things where people are optimizing the system. Instead of asking for 1 or 2 of something, it's 10 to 20. And they're running their factory, their production lines, but they're trying to optimize it, enhance throughput, get productivity. Those are the kind of things you can do on the run. And so we're seeing that those have been strong contributors, and we think they'll continue. 
Right past it are the classic larger projects that we and others play with, a lot of them in kind of the chemical, oil and gas infrastructure spaces. And there's just a general story there still where those things are delayed. They were frozen in 2020. They were pushed out into 2021, not canceled. I will say what we're starting to hear now and mainly from distributors that are a little closer to the frontline are that those are now starting to turn into quote activity and spec transfer and the kind of things you start to see ahead of an order and a replenishment cycle on our side. 
When does that happen? Maybe there's some of it in the back half of the year. Certainly, at a minimum, we start talking about it more in planning, and I think it bodes well for the early part of 2022."

Think of this as a series of concentric circles radiating around places where we are participating today -- and participate. And a few things we're actually thinking of some zones where we're not part -- not currently part of IDEX that could be interesting or have IDEX-like attributes. 
So we've got the firepower. We're doing more work. And then the funnel of things that we're looking at, it's very active, aggressive and, I think in the end, actionable.

With always -- I mean, we've mentioned an open aperture for at least a couple of years now, at least an open mind to some things that might be very interesting that we've long considered for IDEX. I don't know if that's different. That's always been on the page.

If you start from the highest level and think about the next couple of years, I think you start with a very positive perspective. You recognize that like we're now coming through a pretty acute recovery cycle. That isn't completely played out. Then there's a replenishment cycle that not only, I think, is reflective of the time that we sort of were all locked away, but I think even ahead of that, there was a decent amount of industrial capacity that needs to be put back into the system. 
The real question, I think, as we go is, if you think of this as a series of graph lines with very sharp peaks and troughs -- I mean, this is super dynamic in terms of the elements we're dealing with today. As they smooth out and look a little bit more like the Appalachians, I think that that becomes a little bit more of a standard operating environment with positive momentum. And so many of the dynamics that we're talking about now in terms of when they come back or when they reoccur, I think they would be in place and they would be things that we'd be typically used to looking at. And it would feel a little bit normalized in terms of the way that we would operate with favorable winds at our back in all of the places that we play. 
So I think we view it that way. We're planning for it that way. It's a positive outlook, a positive framework. You just sort of have to navigate some of the puts and takes. And there's just a lot of dynamic variables here, none of which I think really get in the way of that positive outlook."

So -- and then if you think of that environment, I mean, there's been a couple of very sort of public shocks in that particular area as well. We're just -- right now, the spend is very intensive towards some other things, simple maintenance and those kind of items. So I think it's going to be a little while before that breaks. 
That said, the international markets are a little different than what we're seeing here in North America. They're generally more favorable. That business has been pointed towards those strategically long before we bought them and continue that way. So we think that's a nice extension for it. But I think as we saw even with the events that happened here a little bit recently, it didn't take too many days for things to be offline before our economy felt it. And this business makes them incredibly great and nice pieces of technology that are very useful in that continuum.

They don't have a lot of like just high-volume stocking orders and things like -- parts. So we're not a great company to stock a lot of material. 
That being said, I probably would point to this quarter as a higher number of that. We're just because of -- I mean our own lead times are extending, and that's an unusual occurrence. We're aggressively doing some things on price, us and everybody else. So there's -- I don't think it's a giant number for this. It just kind of can't be. But it's in there, more than we've seen before in terms of people trying to get a place in line or potentially say, hey, can I -- I'll take a risk here and so I can avoid part of the price increase. But it's a point or 2 of the company. It's not a giant part, only applies in 2. 
This distribution, you go to a lot of our distributors, you're not going to see a lot of product on the shelf, mainly because of just the model. It often needs to be customized at the last minute to some regard. We have quick lead times anyway. It doesn't add a lot of value to sit on a shelf somewhere and make that guess.

So there's a big driver there that, of course, doesn't reoccur all that often. 
Outside of that, a next level down in the category of doing it more than we used to would be things like factory floor automation. The technology available is pretty phenomenal today. And the cost points have come down to the point where even in our world, it makes sense from time to time to put a robot where somebody was standing for, particularly when we've got some labor availability issues and a lot of it is high technology based. So those are projects -- I think there's a graphic on the slide deck that I used, it's something that we're actually using in that area.

I mean, I would say, number one, the financial positions of most municipalities certainly here in the United States are probably thought to be better than they were, let's say, a year ago. It's a lot of the stimulus money and things like that comes in and tax receipts generally have been higher. So I think just overall financial condition is good. 
Your question on the infrastructure spend thing is interesting. I mean there's always a question of how long do you go from a concept to an actual project-based reality and how long that takes. Ultimately, there's different parts of IDEX where that would actually help us in a good way. I'd point to our water business is one of them. There's a lot of talk in that about water infrastructure and the criticality there. I mean one of our businesses does an awful lot of great work on sort of flow monitoring studies, which ultimately support CapEx projects. Like you have to do one to then determine what it is you're going to buy in terms of CapEx. 
So I think we're well positioned there, and there are some other pockets as well. But like always, it probably will take longer to play out and run through the system than we might imagine. But I would put it in the category just like in -- they're seeing, I think, from receipts and economics that it's positive and certainly in a position that's better than I might have imagined it would be as we went into a pandemic."

I mean our Fire & Rescue business is -- I mean, they're phenomenal businesses. We've added to them over the years. We've got a nice scalable concentration, and it's one of our most geographically dispersed business. 
You start with the premise that we've got incredible assets in that space. We've always said it was kind of a mature, steady market for us as a backdrop overall. A couple of things going on there that at least in the near term probably put it into the red zone most for us. One is that industry is even before the pandemic was struggling with output execution around chassis and trucks and things and in a couple of different geographies. Obviously, what's going on now isn't making that better. And so just backlogs on fire truck continues to be as long as it was a year ago, if not longer. So you have a little bit of a moderation effect there. 
And then on the emerging markets side, specifically China, and we definitely see -- we've seen a couple of ways now of push for localization versus -- in our case, we actually do a fair amount of imported products into that zone to complement our local brand there as well. And I don't think -- long term, that hasn't necessarily impacted us, but it does impact us from a timing perspective, tends to keep tenders captive until we sort of see how it runs out. And so that's maybe the new element on top of the existing element and basically as a pretty steady market anyways. 
I always encourage people when they think about it, this is where like what we're doing in terms of our application sets on a critical job matters. So like the discussion we had earlier about automation and the things that we're doing to change the nature of the job is the exciting element with great, well-positioned global assets on a -- you can still think of it as a mission-critical job, very steady state. Generally, it's going to be something that's supported in the long term with funding and things. But it does go through certain ebbs and flows. And right now, it's on one of the more red not green zones, but we think long term is going to be fine."

I'd like to start by thanking Mike Yates, our former Chief Accounting Officer, for his 16 years of service to IDEX. Mike help lead an evolution of our finance and accounting organization and his work has had a long-lasting impact on the business. On behalf of the entire IDEX team, I wish Mike the best in his future endeavors. 
Now let's turn to our IDEX overview on Slide 6. We continue to see supply chain challenges throughout the third quarter. Our localized sourcing, production and selling model helps us a bit relative to others, but this prolonged environment of poor material, labor and logistics availability challenges us just like any other business. Despite these obstacles, our IDEX teams around the globe have risen to the occasion. They exhibited both resiliency and stamina as they overcame yet another quarter filled with day-to-day disruptions, all while providing a high level of support to our customers. I want to thank all the IDEX team members across the globe for your hard work, not just in Q3 but over the last 18 months of business within a pandemic. 
At this stage, we don't see any near-term signs of diminishing macroeconomic headwinds. Rather, we expect they'll remain at a high level and persist into 2022. We'll continue to leverage our 80/20 principles as we align around our best customers, our best prospects for growth and our critical business priorities. I spoke last quarter about our ability to capture price due to the differentiated mission-critical nature of our products. Overall, the price actions that we took over the past 6 months were increasingly realized in the third quarter, and we saw our price/cost spread increase sequentially. We will push price aggressively and appropriately as conditions continue to support our arguments. 
Despite the many challenges out there, our organic performance remains strong. we set another record in the third quarter for orders, sales and backlog. Our backlog is now $186 million higher than it was at the end of last year. Signals around the return of industrial projects have intensified and current energy prices, if sustained, have the potential to drive investments within IDEX application areas. Our Health Science and Technologies segment performed exceptionally well. Over the past 5 or so years, we have stepped up organic investments with our focus on the longer term. Within our sealing business, we built a new facility with the goal of capturing share in the expanding semiconductor market. We brought 3 optics facilities together, and our new Optics Center of Excellence to enable future wins in life sciences by integrating multiple IDEX components to create value for our customers. 
We optimized the footprint and core technology of our material processing technology platform to enable long-term repeatable growth across a series of technologies. These investments have generated tremendous returns, and we are well positioned to capture share, and capitalize on market growth going forward. 
On the inorganic side, our recent acquisitions are doing extremely well. [ Apple Pumps ] is fully integrated and performing ahead of expectations. The Airtech integration is ahead of schedule, and the team is making strong progress on their growth strategy. Both are executing well in the challenging operating environment as they come up to speed on our 80/20 playbook. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capital available to support future acquisitions and investments in the business. Our M&A funnel is healthy. Our expanded team has identified a number of interesting opportunities as we look to deploy additional capital in the near and long term. 
In the end, we are focused on delivering and growing within a very difficult near-term operating environment while spending a significant part of each day thinking about the best investments in teams, technologies and business opportunities to thrive in the years to come. I'm very confident in our team's ability to outperform in both areas. 
With that, I'll turn to our market outlook on Page 7. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were favorable versus the second quarter. Larger industrial projects still lag, but quote activity and funnel strength have both improved. Agriculture remains robust, delivering on record volumes. Our water businesses continue to perform well. Municipal spending is steady, and there is general optimism around future increased government funding. The chemical and energy markets continue to lag primarily due to limited capital investment. However, on the chemical side, smaller, fast-starting projects performed well. We are cautiously optimistic on energy as increased fuel prices and concerns over energy shortages have the potential to trigger investment. 
As we noted last quarter, our Flow MD business has experienced a significant pullback in customers' capital investments. It impacted FMT's organic sales by 8%. In other words, excluding the impact of Flow MD, FMT organic sales would have grown 15% instead of 7% as reported. 
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see strong demand across all our end markets. semiconductor, food and pharma, analytical instrumentation and life sciences all performed well. We continue to win share through our targeted growth initiatives, and our intentionality around identifying opportunities that grow faster than the broader market is paying off. The automotive market remains affected by supply chain-driven challenges, but we continue to see growth due to our concentration in higher-end European vehicles. The industrial businesses within the segment saw a trend similar to FMT. 
Finally, our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment is our most challenged segment right now. Price capture and volume offsets faced stronger headwinds within the segment due to higher direct OEM exposure and higher levels of material intensity due to vertical integration. In Fire & Safety, North America Fire OEM production continues to struggle due to supply chain challenges. Larger tender activity is slowly increasing within the global Fire Rescue markets, but we feel these market challenges will persist into 2022. U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages have tempered the performance of our banded business. We continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to supply chain constraints eventually ease. 
But in the third quarter, the impact of automotive shutdowns increased versus last quarter and moderated our performance. Finally, dispensing performed well as key customers deploy capital on strong DIY market demand, and our global product offerings capture share. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect rolling supply chain disruptions to continue throughout the balance of the year and into 2022. That said, our third quarter organic orders were flat sequentially versus second quarter, and our backlog remains at a record level. Overall, the demand environment for IDEX products is not [ weighed ] despite supply chain challenges, and we remain optimistic about the trajectory of our end markets. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results."

Q3 orders of $774 million were up 36% overall and up 28% organically. We built $62 million of backlog in the quarter, and all 3 segments had strong organic performance versus last year as well as versus the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter sales of $712 million were up 23% overall and up 15% organically. We continue to experience a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, tempered by supply chain constraints. .
The Flow MD pressure and Fluid & Metering Eric discussed also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding Flow MD, organic sales would have been up 18% overall. Q3 gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 43.8%. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of a $9.1 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Airtech acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 45%, and improved sequentially. Third quarter operating margin was 22.6%, flat compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 120 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by our gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset with some pressure from targeted reinvestments and the dilutive impact of Airtech and [ Able ] acquisitions due to their intangible amortization costs. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. 
Our Q3 effective tax rate was 23.4%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 14.4% due to the finalization of tax regulations enacted in the third quarter of 2020 as well as a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation in the current period. Third quarter net income was $116 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.51. Adjusted net income was $125 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.63, up $0.23 or 16% over prior year adjusted EPS. The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.27 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year quarter. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by $0.50 or 35% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $142 million, up 5% compared to prior year, and was 113% of adjusted net income. The result was impacted by higher earnings, partly offset by volume-driven working capital build. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing significant year-over-year volume and supply chain challenges. 
Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating income increased $39 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $29 million, flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We achieved positive price cost within the quarter, and saw our price/cost spread improved sequentially. Our teams continue to drive operational productivity as another lever to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from supply chain costs and associated inefficiencies. The positive mix is a primary result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre-pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. 
As Eric mentioned, we are actively investing in the resources we need to execute on future growth and productivity. This reinvestment back into the business, higher variable compensation and targeted increases in discretionary spending drive the year-over-year pressure of $15 million. Despite the incremental spend, inflation and supply chain-driven operational efficiencies, we still achieved a solid 37% organic flow-through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to a reported flow-through of 30%. With a significant amount of focus dedicated to navigating supply chain disruptions, we did not fully execute on the level of spend we expected in the quarter. We intend to make these investments in the fourth quarter, and they will mitigate our flow-through a bit as we close out the year. 
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. I'm on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting adjusted EPS to range from $1.55 to $1.58. We expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted operating margins between 23.5% and 24%. Q4 results are slightly lower than the third quarter, driven by organic and inorganic resource investments seasonality and the potential for year-end logistics challenges. The Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect about 0.5% of top line benefit from FX, and corporate costs in Q4 are expected to be around $19 million. 
Turning to the full year. We are narrowing our full year EPS guidance from a range of $6.26 to $6.36 to $6.30 to $6.33. We are also maintaining our full year organic growth of 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24%. We expect FX to provide 1.5% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%.  Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, in line with our previous guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be around 105% of net income, lower versus our last guide primarily due to working capital investments. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $73 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. 
Finally, beginning in 2022, IDEX will provide EPS guidance and report actual results, excluding the impacts of after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis will provide more transparency to our core operating results as well as facilitate comparisons with our peer companies as we continue on our capital deployment journey. 
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share a few updates around our great teams. First off, I'd like to extend my public congratulations to our Non-Executive Chairman, Bill Cook, on being named Public Company Director of the Year by the National Association of Corporate Directors. Bill and I both joined IDEX around the same time in 2008, and I've learned a great deal from him over the years. His insightful perspective and critical thinking skills have been tremendously helpful for the company, and I know I speak for everyone at IDEX when I say congratulations, Bill, on this well-deserved honor. 
Turning to the IDEX Foundation. Last month, the foundation entered a national partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Various U.S.-based business units have supported their local boys and girls clubs over the years, but this takes our joint work to the next level, offering a clear pathway for increased engagement. Every one of our U.S. business units is close to at least 1 boys and girls club location. This agreement aligns with the foundation's equity and opportunity charitable pillar added earlier this year, seeking to create opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color within our community. 
Finally, we attribute much of our success to our strong foundational culture. Our annual September engagement survey just came back. And even within this incredibly challenging environment, loaded with disruptions in unexpected turns, we held study and were scored in the top quartile of all manufacturing companies. Our teams around the world are beginning to develop tactical plans to address feedback provided by their local teams, part of the continuous improvement that supports everything we do at IDEX.

First question just on this discretionary reinvestment it wasn't called out on the walk in the first quarter, ramped up in second quarter and third quarter.

So I mean, we've maintained a high say-do ratio relative to our customers. We use the 80/20 lens to provide differentiated services for different levels of customers. So all of that remains constant. But in this environment, the part that I think we're all struggling with is just inherently the lead times in the queue is lengthening. So it's really that -- your question around when does it resolve. I think, as we indicated, it's further out on the horizon, quite honestly. I mean a bunch of the knobs have to turn together, material availability, labor availability across the spectrum and logistics. 
So as those start to move and start to move in, and all of us can depend on higher levels of throughput, we would be able to bring lead times back in. And ultimately, against all of that, still maintain that high [indiscernible] ratio. So it's, again, less on OTD rates and more on just lengthening lead times against expectations."

We did say at it plateaued, we said that relative to a pretty tough situation. So tough in the second quarter, tough in the third and continued tough in the fourth with, frankly, some year-end dynamics that always make that quarter a little bit tougher. And so we're thinking of those as we project forward. Your question around what are we experiencing? Well, I mean there's a lot of variety in IDEX. But one thing that makes us all about the same is we tend to buy a lot of configured materials. We're not overly vertically integrated. So material availability is the #1 challenge. .
And then it does vary. We've got some businesses -- a few that are more semiconductor and ship-intensive. And then as you suspect, those tend to be the items for those businesses. Others, it's things like motors and castings. And typically, if they're coming from further away. That's a harder challenge. Labor availability for us, we don't have labor as a high percentage of our sales, but we do have pockets and it tracks pretty uniformly where labor is scarce either in the U.S. or in other geographies. And I'd say as an overlay, I'd probably say all of IDEX to some degree, is continuing to try to track down scarce logistics resources, especially on smaller shipments or things that are going overseas. So I know that pretty much covers the spectrum of all possibilities. But if you want to just put a bow around it for us, it's material availability coming in through a supply chain of configured materials."

First, a lot of moving pieces in the environment as we sit here today. Certainly appreciate the color that you gave us, I guess, in this case, literally the green and red colors you gave us, and the various end markets and how those were performing. Maybe you can just start triangulating some thoughts on how you're thinking about those markets as we move into next year, and maybe even through the next couple of years. Your concern level with all of the supply chain challenges, degrading demand, having some sort of circular challenge versus how you think about sustainability of the recovery curve as we sit here today and just how you balance all those moving pieces out internally?"

It hasn't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters in terms of the few areas that are lagging. So I'll just -- I'll sort of leave those as those stories continue in energy and chemical, and we can go into those later if we like. But I'd say a few things that are new here would be -- the automotive side did flip over to red for us. There's just no question but more disruption, more shutdowns even on the higher end stuff where our products tend to have good presence. .
Again, a small piece of IDEX, but it is something that's changed and changed a little different. I think if you kind of come up to a segment level, I mean, as you can see from our prepared remarks, and just in our numbers, I mean, the Health Science Technology segment is doing really, really well. Very, very strong got semiconductor. That's where our exposure is. That's a strong market. Anything in analytical instrumentation, life science, the food areas. We've got some pharma in there as well. Those are just kind of universally strong and we would expect those to continue strong going forward. 
I think we talk a lot, of course, and we turn over to FMT and project business and the nature of those. And we have seen some movement there. This has been a slow march of progress through the year. But I would say in the areas of food and pharma, in particular, you are starting to see a shift towards some intentional capacity expansion, which lends itself into discussions with folks like us and others around project business. In places on a more classic FMT side of the spectrum: chemicals, energy. That's lagging on the other side, although even in chemicals, some of the faster turn projects we're seeing those come about. And then in that sort of right down the middle of the fairway industrial environment where a lot of our FMT businesses play. 
The discussions continue to move, and we are starting to see a bit of that hit-the-order board, at least indicate that it will in the first part of 2022. So I just -- I wouldn't say that the acceleration curve is different, but it continues to move more positively. 
Second part of your question was really around sort of the supply chain condition and it's run out. I think we were talking about this morning. I would be interesting is, overall, I think this is playing out indicating that there's still a lot of capacity that has to be put to work in the industrial space. You got too many places running 12 hours, 13 hours and running their equipment into the ground. Then some of the challenges with labor scarcity. I mean that lends itself towards automation and other things that are going to provide some support. So I do feel good about the longer-range winds at our backs and others in the industrial space. 
The near-term challenge, of course, is that we're sitting here, and a lot of other companies are sitting with a lot of backlog and in some ways, kind of a steady output that we wish was higher because of the supply chain challenges. Eventually, those 2 lines cross. We -- I would like to think that what would happen is the throughput would continue to increase its capacity is supplied as people come back to work and begins to catch that order rate and then it continues in a great direction. I think that's the open question for all of us is sort of how do these things resolve. Those 2 rates resolve over time in, let's say, the next 2 quarters coming into 2022. And so we're going to have to watch all of the inputs and the variables that are driving that, a pretty complex equation, of course. But I'd end with saying continued positivity, the rates of progression are -- we're seeing those feeling those, and feel good about them. It all kind of comes down to a few things that are variable in the near term."

I mean it's very IDEX-like in terms of the problems it solves, and sort of position on the bill of materials for the fossil fuels infrastructure in the country. So that is typical. But you're right, relative to the average IDEX business, the unit of measure of the sale price of the product is a lot larger. This is -- these are pretty large units. In fact, the nature of projects in terms of how those orders come to us are larger as well. It tends to be very much a capital-intensive kind of way of doing business. And so this is a business that, remember, if we just back up over the last year when we acquired it, had really, really high levels of backlog because they captured a lot of projects long ago prior to the acquisition. Then, of course, things change pretty dramatically in terms of how the major folks that are in charge of the pipelines in the U.S. We're talking about capital spend. We burned off that backlog and now find ourselves kind of in a steady state against replenishments and maintenance projects. We do a few things internationally. But the core of this business is still ultimately around the build-out or refurbishment around pipeline infrastructure in the U.S. It comes in larger project increments, and the sale price of the end product is larger. So the -- for all of those reasons, the magnitude year-over-year is a larger swing than you would typically see in IDEX. That's why we've been careful to call it out and make sure people understand it within the FMT results."

In terms of output, we could have realized with a slightly more favorable backdrop in the supply chain, probably in the range of a couple of percentage points of the organic rates that we posted. Just simply had the order, could have made it and can point to something that prevented it in one of those 3 categories that I talked to. I'll let Bill talk about the inventory. I will say we, like many businesses, on critical material if we can get it even if it doesn't make up perfectly with some other things, we're going to -- we'll take the spot and take the material. So there's a little bit of investment in working capital there. 
I think the last part of your question around, can we attack it? I think like a lot of other businesses, we're scrambling to lift our capacity and help our supply chain in any way we can on all dimensions. So some businesses are attacking the labor scarcity issue in very unique ways and very innovative, quite honestly. Others and most of it comes down to, in some places, capital spend. We're doing some things and thinking through capital that we know we have to put into the business so we kind of watch that ramp throughout the year. And that makes sense, and wherever possible. IDEX is not an easy business to automate, but we're doing it more than we have been before because it also helps solve the labor issue. 
Sometimes this comes down to design, which is something that people don't think a lot about. Sometimes you can actually alter designs, whether it's in simple circuitry or even some of the other parts that we have, and assist with fabrication. This is where our local proximity really helps us. So we can get in a car and drive over to a supplier and kind of have a collaborative discussion of, is there a different way to solve this problem and bring material in. So it's pretty much every day, if you went to one of our daily management sessions, you'd probably see that 70% of the discussion is around solving problems of this nature, both in the short term, and then wherever possible, and longer term in terms of investments or problem-solving."

And because of the differentiated nature of that technology, the high margin associated with it. We did some folks highlight. Sequentially, the margin was down in HST, but that's really due to Airtech coming into the portfolio. On a like-for-like basis, margins are still at kind of those all-time highs we saw in the second quarter, and look for that in the core to continue here as we go forward."

One is when we think about the nature of most IDEX products, it's highly configured, some ways customized for each application. And so typically, it's not a great product to overorder lots up because you're never quite sure of how it's going to run out when the customer system. I would say what is a little different as we go through the year here in terms of typical patterns, it's just lengthening of sort of order horizon. So if somebody would have before given us, let's say, 6 months' worth of requirements, they might throw another quarter in there, recognizing, hey, this is a standard product. We know we're going to use it in this particular case, and we don't want to lose a place in line. That tracks actually with our own lead times as we extended those lead times, most equations would work and say then that's how you would change your order patterns to accommodate it. So I really -- we've never seen a tremendous run-up of inventory IDEX material. Our distributors and channel within FMT doesn't really work that way. Most people still, as they think of planning for IDEX products, think of us as generally on the very agile, reactive end of the spectrum, and they haven't really changed their thinking around it as the entire world kind of goes through a relative change in shift outward."

And there's just not a giant universe of things that are in that particular bucket. And if there were, actionability is always somewhat of a question.

I remind everybody it is a smaller portion of IDEX, and we attack it in a really surgical way. So we're picking specific niches, specific applications and then mating up technologies that we have available in IDEX to go after those. That -- I mean we're picking them because we think in many times, they're somewhat immune to some of the ebbs and flows that you would see more day-to-day or quarter-to-quarter because they've got growth dynamics at their back.

It's a pleasure to have you on the team. I'd like to start by thanking Mike Yates, our former Chief Accounting Officer, for his 16 years of service to IDEX.

I'd like to start by thanking Mike Yates, our former Chief Accounting Officer, for his 16 years of service to IDEX. Mike help lead an evolution of our finance and accounting organization and his work has had a long-lasting impact on the business. On behalf of the entire IDEX team, I wish Mike the best in his future endeavors. 
Now let's turn to our IDEX overview on Slide 6. We continue to see supply chain challenges throughout the third quarter. Our localized sourcing, production and selling model helps us a bit relative to others, but this prolonged environment of poor material, labor and logistics availability challenges us just like any other business. Despite these obstacles, our IDEX teams around the globe have risen to the occasion. They exhibited both resiliency and stamina as they overcame yet another quarter filled with day-to-day disruptions, all while providing a high level of support to our customers. I want to thank all the IDEX team members across the globe for your hard work, not just in Q3 but over the last 18 months of business within a pandemic. 
At this stage, we don't see any near-term signs of diminishing macroeconomic headwinds. Rather, we expect they'll remain at a high level and persist into 2022. We'll continue to leverage our 80/20 principles as we align around our best customers, our best prospects for growth and our critical business priorities. I spoke last quarter about our ability to capture price due to the differentiated mission-critical nature of our products. Overall, the price actions that we took over the past 6 months were increasingly realized in the third quarter, and we saw our price/cost spread increase sequentially. We will push price aggressively and appropriately as conditions continue to support our arguments. 
Despite the many challenges out there, our organic performance remains strong. we set another record in the third quarter for orders, sales and backlog. Our backlog is now $186 million higher than it was at the end of last year. Signals around the return of industrial projects have intensified and current energy prices, if sustained, have the potential to drive investments within IDEX application areas. Our Health Science and Technologies segment performed exceptionally well. Over the past 5 or so years, we have stepped up organic investments with our focus on the longer term. Within our sealing business, we built a new facility with the goal of capturing share in the expanding semiconductor market. We brought 3 optics facilities together, and our new Optics Center of Excellence to enable future wins in life sciences by integrating multiple IDEX components to create value for our customers. 
We optimized the footprint and core technology of our material processing technology platform to enable long-term repeatable growth across a series of technologies. These investments have generated tremendous returns, and we are well positioned to capture share, and capitalize on market growth going forward. 
On the inorganic side, our recent acquisitions are doing extremely well. ABEL Pumps is fully integrated and performing ahead of expectations. The Airtech integration is ahead of schedule, and the team is making strong progress on their growth strategy. Both are executing well in the challenging operating environment as they come up to speed on our 80/20 playbook. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capital available to support future acquisitions and investments in the business. Our M&A funnel is healthy. Our expanded team has identified a number of interesting opportunities as we look to deploy additional capital in the near and long term. 
In the end, we are focused on delivering and growing within a very difficult near-term operating environment while spending a significant part of each day thinking about the best investments in teams, technologies and business opportunities to thrive in the years to come. I'm very confident in our team's ability to outperform in both areas. 
With that, I'll turn to our market outlook on Page 7. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were favorable versus the second quarter. Larger industrial projects still lag, but quote activity and funnel strength have both improved. Agriculture remains robust, delivering on record volumes. Our water businesses continue to perform well. Municipal spending is steady, and there is general optimism around future increased government funding. The chemical and energy markets continue to lag primarily due to limited capital investment. However, on the chemical side, smaller, fast-starting projects performed well. We are cautiously optimistic on energy as increased fuel prices and concerns over energy shortages have the potential to trigger investment. 
As we noted last quarter, our Flow MD business has experienced a significant pullback in customers' capital investments. It impacted FMT's organic sales by 8%. In other words, excluding the impact of Flow MD, FMT organic sales would have grown 15% instead of 7% as reported. 
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see strong demand across all our end markets. semiconductor, food and pharma, analytical instrumentation and life sciences all performed well. We continue to win share through our targeted growth initiatives, and our intentionality around identifying opportunities that grow faster than the broader market is paying off. The automotive market remains affected by supply chain-driven challenges, but we continue to see growth due to our concentration in higher-end European vehicles. The industrial businesses within the segment saw a trend similar to FMT. 
Finally, our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment is our most challenged segment right now. Price capture and volume offsets faced stronger headwinds within the segment due to higher direct OEM exposure and higher levels of material intensity due to vertical integration. In Fire & Safety, North America Fire OEM production continues to struggle due to supply chain challenges. Larger tender activity is slowly increasing within the global Fire Rescue markets, but we feel these market challenges will persist into 2022. U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages have tempered the performance of our banded business. We continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to supply chain constraints eventually ease. 
But in the third quarter, the impact of automotive shutdowns increased versus last quarter and moderated our performance. Finally, dispensing performed well as key customers deploy capital on strong DIY market demand, and our global product offerings capture share. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect rolling supply chain disruptions to continue throughout the balance of the year and into 2022. That said, our third quarter organic orders were flat sequentially versus second quarter, and our backlog remains at a record level. Overall, the demand environment for IDEX products is not [ weighed ] despite supply chain challenges, and we remain optimistic about the trajectory of our end markets. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results."

We built $62 million of backlog in the quarter, and all 3 segments had strong organic performance versus last year as well as versus the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter sales of $712 million were up 23% overall and up 15% organically. We continue to experience a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, tempered by supply chain constraints. .
The Flow MD pressure and Fluid & Metering Eric discussed, also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding Flow MD, organic sales would have been up 18% overall. Q3 gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 43.8%. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of a $9.1 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Airtech acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 45%, and improved sequentially. Third quarter operating margin was 22.6%, flat compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 120 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by our gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset with some pressure from targeted reinvestments and the dilutive impact of Airtech and ABEL acquisitions due to their intangible amortization costs. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. 
Our Q3 effective tax rate was 23.4%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 14.4% due to the finalization of tax regulations enacted in the third quarter of 2020 as well as a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation in the current period. Third quarter net income was $116 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.51. Adjusted net income was $125 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.63, up $0.23 or 16% over prior year adjusted EPS. The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.27 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year quarter. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by $0.50 or 35% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $142 million, up 5% compared to prior year, and was 113% of adjusted net income. The result was impacted by higher earnings, partly offset by volume-driven working capital build. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing significant year-over-year volume and supply chain challenges. 
Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating income increased $39 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $29 million, flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We achieved positive price cost within the quarter, and saw our price/cost spread improved sequentially. Our teams continue to drive operational productivity as another lever to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from supply chain costs and associated inefficiencies. The positive mix is a primary result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre-pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. 
As Eric mentioned, we are actively investing in the resources we need to execute on future growth and productivity. This reinvestment back into the business, higher variable compensation and targeted increases in discretionary spending drive the year-over-year pressure of $15 million. Despite the incremental spend, inflation and supply chain-driven operational efficiencies, we still achieved a solid 37% organic flow-through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to a reported flow-through of 30%. With a significant amount of focus dedicated to navigating supply chain disruptions, we did not fully execute on the level of spend we expected in the quarter. We intend to make these investments in the fourth quarter, and they will mitigate our flow-through a bit as we close out the year. 
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. I'm on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting adjusted EPS to range from $1.55 to $1.58. We expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted operating margins between 23.5% and 24%. Q4 results are slightly lower than the third quarter, driven by organic and inorganic resource investments seasonality and the potential for year-end logistics challenges. The Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect about 0.5% of top line benefit from FX, and corporate costs in Q4 are expected to be around $19 million. 
Turning to the full year. We are narrowing our full year EPS guidance from a range of $6.26 to $6.36 to $6.30 to $6.33. We are also maintaining our full year organic growth of 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24%. We expect FX to provide 1.5% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%.  Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, in line with our previous guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be around 105% of net income, lower versus our last guide primarily due to working capital investments. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $73 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. 
Finally, beginning in 2022, IDEX will provide EPS guidance and report actual results, excluding the impacts of after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis will provide more transparency to our core operating results as well as facilitate comparisons with our peer companies as we continue on our capital deployment journey. 
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share a few updates around our great teams. First off, I'd like to extend my public congratulations to our Non-Executive Chairman, Bill Cook, on being named Public Company Director of the Year by the National Association of Corporate Directors. Bill and I both joined IDEX around the same time in 2008, and I've learned a great deal from him over the years. His insightful perspective and critical thinking skills have been tremendously helpful for the company, and I know I speak for everyone at IDEX when I say congratulations, Bill, on this well-deserved honor. 
Turning to the IDEX Foundation. Last month, the foundation entered a national partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Various U.S.-based business units have supported their local boys and girls clubs over the years, but this takes our joint work to the next level, offering a clear pathway for increased engagement. Every one of our U.S. business units is close to at least 1 boys and girls club location. This agreement aligns with the foundation's equity and opportunity charitable pillar added earlier this year, seeking to create opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color within our community. 
Finally, we attribute much of our success to our strong foundational culture. Our annual September engagement survey just came back. And even within this incredibly challenging environment, loaded with disruptions in unexpected turns, we held study and were scored in the top quartile of all manufacturing companies. Our teams around the world are beginning to develop tactical plans to address feedback provided by their local teams, part of the continuous improvement that supports everything we do at IDEX. 
With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions."

But in this environment, the part that I think we're all struggling with is just inherently the lead times in the queue is lengthening. So it's really that -- your question around when does it resolve. I think, as we indicated, it's further out on the horizon, quite honestly. I mean a bunch of the knobs have to turn together, material availability, labor availability across the spectrum and logistics. 
So as those start to move and start to move in, and all of us can depend on higher levels of throughput, we would be able to bring lead times back in. And ultimately, against all of that, still maintain that high [indiscernible] ratio. So it's, again, less on OTD rates and more on just lengthening lead times against expectations."

We did say at it plateaued, we said that relative to a pretty tough situation. So tough in the second quarter, tough in the third and continued tough in the fourth with, frankly, some year-end dynamics that always make that quarter a little bit tougher. And so we're thinking of those as we project forward. Your question around what are we experiencing? Well, I mean there's a lot of variety in IDEX. But one thing that makes us all about the same is we tend to buy a lot of configured materials. We're not overly vertically integrated. So material availability is the #1 challenge. .
And then it does vary. We've got some businesses -- a few that are more semiconductor and ship-intensive. And then as you suspect, those tend to be the items for those businesses. Others, it's things like motors and castings. And typically, if they're coming from further away. That's a harder challenge. Labor availability for us, we don't have labor as a high percentage of our sales, but we do have pockets and it tracks pretty uniformly where labor is scarce either in the U.S. or in other geographies. And I'd say as an overlay, I'd probably say all of IDEX to some degree, is continuing to try to track down scarce logistics resources, especially on smaller shipments or things that are going overseas. So I know that pretty much covers the spectrum of all possibilities. But if you want to just put a bow around it for us, it's material availability coming in through a supply chain of configured materials."

Maybe you can just start triangulating some thoughts on how you're thinking about those markets as we move into next year, and maybe even through the next couple of years. Your concern level with all of the supply chain challenges, degrading demand, having some sort of circular challenge versus how you think about sustainability of the recovery curve as we sit here today and just how you balance all those moving pieces out internally?"

It hasn't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters in terms of the few areas that are lagging. So I'll just -- I'll sort of leave those as those stories continue in energy and chemical, and we can go into those later if we like. But I'd say a few things that are new here would be -- the automotive side did flip over to red for us. There's just no question but more disruption, more shutdowns even on the higher end stuff where our products tend to have good presence. .
Again, a small piece of IDEX, but it is something that's changed and changed a little different. I think if you kind of come up to a segment level, I mean, as you can see from our prepared remarks, and just in our numbers, I mean, the Health Science Technology segment is doing really, really well. Very, very strong got semiconductor. That's where our exposure is. That's a strong market. Anything in analytical instrumentation, life science, the food areas. We've got some pharma in there as well. Those are just kind of universally strong and we would expect those to continue strong going forward. 
I think we talk a lot, of course, and we turn over to FMT and our project business and the nature of those. And we have seen some movement there. This has been a slow march of progress through the year. But I would say in the areas of food and pharma, in particular, you are starting to see a shift towards some intentional capacity expansion, which lends itself into discussions with folks like us and others around project business. In places on a more classic FMT side of the spectrum: chemicals, energy. That's lagging on the other side, although even in chemicals, some of the faster turn projects we're seeing those come about. And then in that sort of right down the middle of the fairway industrial environment where a lot of our FMT businesses play. 
The discussions continue to move, and we are starting to see a bit of that hit-the-order board, at least indicate that it will in the first part of 2022. So I just -- I wouldn't say that the acceleration curve is different, but it continues to move more positively. 
Second part of your question was really around sort of the supply chain condition and it's run out. I think we were talking about this morning. I would be interesting is, overall, I think this is playing out indicating that there's still a lot of capacity that has to be put to work in the industrial space. You got too many places running 12 hours, 13 hours and running their equipment into the ground. Then some of the challenges with labor scarcity. I mean that lends itself towards automation and other things that are going to provide some support. So I do feel good about the longer-range winds at our backs and others in the industrial space. 
The near-term challenge, of course, is that we're sitting here, and a lot of other companies are sitting with a lot of backlog and in some ways, kind of a steady output that we wish was higher because of the supply chain challenges. Eventually, those 2 lines cross. We -- I would like to think that what would happen is the throughput would continue to increase its capacity is supplied as people come back to work and begins to catch that order rate and then it continues in a great direction. I think that's the open question for all of us is sort of how do these things resolve. Those 2 rates resolve over time in, let's say, the next 2 quarters coming into 2022. And so we're going to have to watch all of the inputs and the variables that are driving that, a pretty complex equation, of course. But I'd end with saying continued positivity, the rates of progression are -- we're seeing those feeling those, and feel good about them. It all kind of comes down to a few things that are variable in the near term."

In fact, the nature of projects in terms of how those orders come to us are larger as well. It tends to be very much a capital-intensive kind of way of doing business. And so this is a business that, remember, if we just back up over the last year when we acquired it, had really, really high levels of backlog because they captured a lot of projects long ago prior to the acquisition. Then, of course, things change pretty dramatically in terms of how the major folks that are in charge of the pipelines in the U.S. We're talking about capital spend. We burned off that backlog and now find ourselves kind of in a steady state against replenishments and maintenance projects. We do a few things internationally. But the core of this business is still ultimately around the build-out or refurbishment around pipeline infrastructure in the U.S. It comes in larger project increments, and the sale price of the end product is larger. So the -- for all of those reasons, the magnitude year-over-year is a larger swing than you would typically see in IDEX. That's why we've been careful to call it out and make sure people understand it within the FMT results."

In terms of output, we could have realized with a slightly more favorable backdrop in the supply chain, probably in the range of a couple of percentage points of the organic rates that we posted. Just simply had the order, could have made it and can point to something that prevented it in one of those 3 categories that I talked to. I'll let Bill talk about the inventory. I will say we, like many businesses, on critical material if we can get it even if it doesn't make up perfectly with some other things, we're going to -- we'll take the spot and take the material. So there's a little bit of investment in working capital there. 
I think the last part of your question around, can we attack it? I think like a lot of other businesses, we're scrambling to lift our capacity and help our supply chain in any way we can on all dimensions. So some businesses are attacking the labor scarcity issue in very unique ways and very innovative, quite honestly. Others and most of it comes down to, in some places, capital spend. We're doing some things and thinking through capital that we know we have to put into the business so we kind of watch that ramp throughout the year. And that makes sense, and wherever possible. IDEX is not an easy business to automate, but we're doing it more than we have been before because it also helps solve the labor issue. 
Sometimes this comes down to design, which is something that people don't think a lot about. Sometimes you can actually alter designs, whether it's in simple circuitry or even some of the other parts that we have, and assist with fabrication. This is where our local proximity really helps us. So we can get in a car and drive over to a supplier and kind of have a collaborative discussion of, is there a different way to solve this problem and bring material in. So it's pretty much every day, if you went to one of our daily management sessions, you'd probably see that 70% of the discussion is around solving problems of this nature, both in the short term, and then wherever possible, and longer term in terms of investments or problem-solving."

Sequentially, the margin was down in HST, but that's really due to Airtech coming into the portfolio.

One is when we think about the nature of most IDEX products, it's highly configured, some ways customized for each application. And so typically, it's not a great product to overorder lots up because you're never quite sure of how it's going to run out when the customer system. I would say what is a little different as we go through the year here in terms of typical patterns, it's just lengthening of sort of order horizon. So if somebody would have before given us, let's say, 6 months' worth of requirements, they might throw another quarter in there, recognizing, hey, this is a standard product. We know we're going to use it in this particular case, and we don't want to lose a place in line. That tracks actually with our own lead times as we extended those lead times, most equations would work and say then that's how you would change your order patterns to accommodate it. So I really -- we've never seen a tremendous run-up of inventory IDEX material. Our distributors and channel within FMT doesn't really work that way. Most people still, as they think of planning for IDEX products, think of us as generally on the very agile, reactive end of the spectrum, and they haven't really changed their thinking around it as the entire world kind of goes through a relative change in shift outward."

So -- but the arguments, the pricing argument around criticality of solution and leveraging our position, our #1 share position within those niches and our long relationship with customers, that's basically the same equation.

I remind everybody it is a smaller portion of IDEX, and we attack it in a really surgical way.

That -- I mean we're picking them because we think in many times, they're somewhat immune to some of the ebbs and flows that you would see more day-to-day or quarter-to-quarter because they've got growth dynamics at their back.

I'd like to start by thanking Mike Yates, our former Chief Accounting Officer, for his 16 years of service to IDEX. Mike helped lead an evolution of our finance and accounting organization, and his work has had a long-lasting impact on the business. On behalf of the entire IDEX team, I wish Mike the best in his future endeavors. 
Now let's turn to our IDEX overview on Slide 6. We continue to see supply chain challenges throughout the third quarter. Our localized sourcing, production and selling model helps us a bit relative to others, but this prolonged environment of poor material, labor and logistics availability challenges us just like any other business. Despite these obstacles, our IDEX teams around the globe have risen to the occasion. They exhibited both resiliency and stamina as they overcame yet another quarter filled with day-to-day disruptions, all while providing a high level of support to our customers. I want to thank all the IDEX team members across the globe for your hard work not just in Q3 but over the last 18 months of business within a pandemic. 
At this stage, we don't see any near-term signs of diminishing macroeconomic headwinds. Rather, we expect they'll remain at a high level and persist into 2022. We'll continue to leverage our 80/20 principles as we align around our best customers, our best prospects for growth and our critical business priorities. I spoke last quarter about our ability to capture price due to the differentiated mission-critical nature of our products. Overall, the price actions that we took over the past 6 months were increasingly realized in the third quarter, and we saw our price/cost spread increase sequentially. We will push price aggressively and appropriately as conditions continue to support our arguments. 
Despite the many challenges out there, our organic performance remains strong. We set another record in the third quarter for orders, sales and backlog. Our backlog is now $186 million higher than it was at the end of last year. Signals around the return of industrial projects have intensified, and current energy prices, if sustained, have the potential to drive investments within IDEX application areas. 
Our Health Science and Technologies segment performed exceptionally well. Over the past 5 or so years, we have stepped up organic investments with our focus on the longer term. Within our sealing business, we built a new facility with the goal of capturing share in the expanding semiconductor market. We brought 3 optics facilities together and our new Optics Center of Excellence to enable future wins in life sciences by integrating multiple IDEX components to create value for our customers. 
We optimized the footprint and core technology of our material processing technology platform to enable long-term repeatable growth across a series of technologies. These investments have generated tremendous returns, and we are well positioned to capture share and capitalize on market growth going forward. 
On the inorganic side, our recent acquisitions are doing extremely well. ABEL Pumps is fully integrated and performing ahead of expectations. The Airtech integration is ahead of schedule, and the team is making strong progress on their growth strategy. Both are executing well in the challenging operating environment as they come up to speed on our 80/20 playbook. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capital available to support future acquisitions and investments in the business. Our M&A funnel is healthy. Our expanded team has identified a number of interesting opportunities as we look to deploy additional capital in the near and long term. 
In the end, we are focused on delivering and growing within a very difficult near-term operating environment while spending a significant part of each day thinking about the best investments in teams, technologies and business opportunities to thrive in the years to come. I'm very confident in our team's ability to outperform in both areas. 
With that, I'll turn to our market outlook on Page 7. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were favorable versus the second quarter. Larger industrial projects still lag, but quote activity and funnel strength have both improved. Agriculture remains robust, delivering on record volumes. Our water businesses continue to perform well. Municipal spending is steady, and there is general optimism around future increased government funding. The chemical and energy markets continue to lag primarily due to limited capital investment. However, on the chemical side, smaller, fast-turning projects performed well. We are cautiously optimistic on energy as increased fuel prices and concerns over energy shortages have the potential to trigger investment. 
As we noted last quarter, our Flow MD business has experienced a significant pullback in customers' capital investments. It impacted FMT's organic sales by 8%. In other words, excluding the impact of Flow MD, FMT organic sales would have grown 15% instead of 7% as reported. 
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see strong demand across all our end markets. Semiconductor, food and pharma, analytical instrumentation and life sciences all performed well. We continue to win share through our targeted growth initiatives, and our intentionality around identifying opportunities that grow faster than the broader market is paying off. The automotive market remains affected by supply chain-driven challenges, but we continue to see growth due to our concentration in higher-end European vehicles. The industrial businesses within the segment saw a trend similar to FMT. 
Finally, our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment is our most challenged segment right now. Price capture and volume offsets faced stronger headwinds within the segment due to higher direct OEM exposure and higher levels of material intensity due to vertical integration. In Fire & Safety, North America Fire OEM production continues to struggle due to supply chain challenges. Larger tender activity is slowly increasing within the global fire/rescue markets, but we feel these market challenges will persist into 2022. U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages have tempered the performance of our BAND-IT business. We continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned as supply chain constraints eventually ease. But in the third quarter, the impact of automotive shutdowns increased versus last quarter and moderated our performance. 
Finally, dispensing performed well as key customers deploy capital on strong DIY market demand, and our global product offerings capture share. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect rolling supply chain disruptions to continue throughout the balance of the year and into 2022. That said, our third quarter organic orders were flat sequentially versus second quarter, and our backlog remains at a record level. Overall, the demand environment for IDEX products has not waned  despite supply chain challenges, and we remain optimistic about the trajectory of our end markets. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results."
29728,1683175324,2422138,"IDEX Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","IDEX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Eric.

Q3 orders of $774 million were up 36% overall and up 28% organically. We built $62 million of backlog in the quarter, and all 3 segments had strong organic performance versus last year as well as versus the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter sales of $712 million were up 23% overall and up 15% organically. We continue to experience a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, tempered by supply chain constraints.
The Flow MD pressure and Fluid & Metering Eric discussed also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding Flow MD, organic sales would have been up 18% overall. Q3 gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 43.8%. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of a $9.1 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Airtech acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 45%, and improved sequentially. Third quarter operating margin was 22.6%, flat compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 120 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by our gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset with some pressure from targeted reinvestments and the dilutive impact of Airtech and ABEL acquisitions due to their intangible amortization costs. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. 
Our Q3 effective tax rate was 23.4%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 14.4% due to the finalization of tax regulations enacted in the third quarter of 2020 as well as a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation in the current period. Third quarter net income was $116 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.51. Adjusted net income was $125 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.63, up $0.23 or 16% over prior year adjusted EPS. The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.27 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year quarter. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by $0.50 or 35% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $142 million, up 5% compared to prior year and was 113% of adjusted net income. The result was impacted by higher earnings, partly offset by volume-driven working capital build. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing significant year-over-year volume and supply chain challenges. 
Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating income increased $39 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $29 million, flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We achieved positive price cost within the quarter, and saw our price/cost spread improved sequentially. Our teams continue to drive operational productivity as another lever to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from supply chain costs and associated inefficiencies. The positive mix is a primary result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre-pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. 
As Eric mentioned, we are actively investing in the resources we need to execute on future growth and productivity. This reinvestment back into the business, higher variable compensation and targeted increases in discretionary spending drive the year-over-year pressure of $15 million. Despite the incremental spend, inflation and supply chain-driven operational inefficiencies, we still achieved a solid 37% organic flow-through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to a reported flow-through of 30%. With a significant amount of focus dedicated to navigating supply chain disruptions, we did not fully execute on the level of spend we expected in the quarter. We intend to make these investments in the fourth quarter, and they will mitigate our flow-through a bit as we close out the year. 
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. I'm on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting adjusted EPS to range from $1.55 to $1.58. We expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted operating margins between 23.5% and 24%. Q4 results are slightly lower than the third quarter, driven by organic and inorganic resource investments, seasonality and the potential for year-end logistics challenges. The Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect about 0.5% of top line benefit from FX, and corporate costs in Q4 are expected to be around $19 million. 
Turning to the full year. We are narrowing our full year EPS guidance from a range of $6.26 to $6.36 to $6.30 to $6.33. We are also maintaining our full year organic growth of 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24%. We expect FX to provide 1.5% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%.  Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, in line with our previous guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be around 105% of net income, lower versus our last guide primarily due to working capital investments. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $73 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. 
Finally, beginning in 2022, IDEX will provide EPS guidance and report actual results, excluding the impacts of after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis will provide more transparency to our core operating results as well as facilitate comparisons with our peer companies as we continue on our capital deployment journey. 
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share a few updates around our great teams. First off, I'd like to extend my public congratulations to our Non-Executive Chairman, Bill Cook, on being named Public Company Director of the Year by the National Association of Corporate Directors. Bill and I both joined IDEX around the same time in 2008, and I've learned a great deal from him over the years. His insightful perspective and critical thinking skills have been tremendously helpful for the company, and I know I speak for everyone at IDEX when I say congratulations, Bill, on this well-deserved honor. 
Turning to the IDEX Foundation. Last month, the foundation entered a national partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Various U.S.-based business units have supported their local Boys & Girls Clubs over the years, but this takes our joint work to the next level, offering a clear pathway for increased engagement. Every one of our U.S. business units is close to at least one Boys & Girls Club location. This agreement aligns with the foundation's equity and opportunity charitable pillar added earlier this year, seeking to create opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color within our community. 
Finally, we attribute much of our success to our strong foundational culture. Our annual September engagement survey just came back. And even within this incredibly challenging environment, loaded with disruptions and unexpected turns, we held steady and were scored in the top quartile of all manufacturing companies. Our teams around the world are beginning to develop tactical plans to address feedback provided by their local teams, part of the continuous improvement that supports everything we do at IDEX. 
With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions."

But in this environment, the part that I think we're all struggling with is just inherently the lead times in the queue is lengthening. So it's really that -- your question around when does it resolve. I think as we indicated, it's further out on the horizon, quite honestly. I mean a bunch of the knobs have to turn together, material availability, labor availability across the spectrum and logistics. 
So as those start to move and start to move in and all of us can depend on higher levels of throughput, we would be able to bring lead times back in. And ultimately, against all of that, still maintain that high say-do ratio. So it's, again, less on OTD rates and more on just lengthening lead times against expectations."

We didn't say it plateaued. We said they're relative to a pretty tough situation. So tough in the second quarter, tough in the third and continued tough in the fourth with, frankly, some year-end dynamics that always make that quarter a little bit tougher. And so we're thinking of those as we project forward. Your question around what are we experiencing? Well, I mean there's a lot of variety in IDEX. But one thing that makes us all about the same is we tend to buy a lot of configured materials. We're not overly vertically integrated. So material availability is the #1 challenge.
And then it does vary. We've got some businesses -- a few that are more semiconductor and ship-intensive. And then as you suspect, those tend to be the items for those businesses. Others, it's things like motors and castings. And typically, if they're coming from further away. That's a harder challenge. Labor availability for us, we don't have labor as a high percentage of our sales, but we do have pockets and it tracks pretty uniformly where labor is scarce either in the U.S. or in other geographies. And I'd say as an overlay, I'd probably say all of IDEX, to some degree, is continuing to try to track down scarce logistics resources, especially on smaller shipments or things that are going overseas. So I know that pretty much covers the spectrum of all possibilities. But if you want to just put a bow around it for us, it's material availability coming in through a supply chain of configured materials."

Yes, relative to kind of the green and red chart that we provide folks, it hasn't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters in terms of the few areas that are lagging. So I'll just -- I'll sort of leave those as those stories continue in energy and chemical, and we can go into those later if we like. But I'd say a few things that are new here would be -- the automotive side did flip over to red for us. There's just no question there have been more disruption, more shutdowns even on the higher-end stuff where our products tend to have good presence.
Again, a small piece of IDEX, but it is something that's changed and changed a little different. I think if you kind of come up to a segment level, I mean, as you can see from our prepared remarks and just in our numbers, I mean the Health & Science  Technologies segment is doing really, really well. Very, very strong. Got semiconductor, that's where our exposure is. That's a strong market. Anything in analytical instrumentation, life science, the food areas. We've got some pharma in there as well. Those are just kind of universally strong, and we would expect those to continue strong going forward. 
I think we talk a lot, of course, when we turn over to FMT around project business and the nature of those. And we have seen some movement there. This has been a slow march of progress through the year. But I would say in the areas of food and pharma, in particular, you are starting to see a shift towards some intentional capacity expansion, which lends itself into discussions with folks like us and others around project business. In places on a more classic FMT side of the spectrum, chemicals, energy, that's lagging on the other side. Although even in chemicals, some of the faster-turn projects, we're seeing those come about. And then in that sort of right down the middle of the fairway industrial environment where a lot of our FMT businesses play, the discussions continue to move, and we are starting to see a bit of that hit-the-order board or at least indicate that it will in the first part of 2022. So I just -- I wouldn't say that the acceleration curve is different, but it continues to move more positively. 
Second part of your question was really around sort of the supply chain condition and it's run out. I think we're just talking about this this morning. What would be interesting is, overall, I think this is playing out indicating that there's still a lot of capacity that has to be put to work in the industrial space. You got too many places running 12 hours, 13 hours and running their equipment into the ground. Then some of the challenges with labor scarcity, I mean that lends itself towards automation and other things that are going to provide some support. So I do feel good about the longer-range winds at our backs and others in the industrial space. 
The near-term challenge, of course, is that we're sitting here, and a lot of other companies are sitting with a lot of backlog and in some ways, kind of a steady output that we wish was higher because of the supply chain challenges. Eventually, those 2 lines cross. We -- I would like to think that what would happen is the throughput would continue to increase as capacity is supplied, as people come back to work and begins to catch that order rate and then it continues in a great direction. 
I think that's the open question for all of us is sort of how do these things resolve. Those 2 rates resolve over time in, let's say, the next 2 quarters coming into 2022. And so we're going to have to watch all of the inputs and the variables that are driving that. It's a pretty complex equation, of course. But I'd end with saying continued positivity. The rates of progression are -- we're seeing those, feeling those and feel good about them. It all kind of comes down to a few things that are variable in the near term."

I mean it's very IDEX-like in terms of the problems it solves, and it's sort of positioned on the bill of materials for the fossil fuels infrastructure in the country. So that is typical. But you're right, relative to the average IDEX business, the unit of measure of the sale price of the product is a lot larger. This is -- these are pretty large units. In fact, the nature of projects in terms of how those orders come to us are larger as well. It tends to be very much a capital-intensive kind of way of doing business. And so this is a business that, remember, if we just back up over the last year when we acquired it, had really, really high levels of backlog because they captured a lot of projects long ago prior to the acquisition. 
Then, of course, things change pretty dramatically in terms of how the major folks that are in charge of the pipelines in the U.S. were talking about capital spend. We burned off that backlog and now find ourselves kind of in a steady state against replenishments and maintenance projects. We do a few things internationally. But the core of this business is still ultimately around the build-out or refurbishment around pipeline infrastructure in the U.S. It comes in larger project increments, and the sale price of the end product is larger. So the -- for all of those reasons, the magnitude year-over-year is a larger swing than you would typically see in IDEX. That's why we've been careful to call it out and make sure people understand it within the FMT results."

In terms of output, we could have realized with a slightly more favorable backdrop in the supply chain, probably in the range of a couple of percentage points of the organic rates that we posted. Just simply had the order could have made it and can point to something that prevented it in one of those 3 categories that I talked to. I'll let Bill talk about the inventory. I will say we, like many businesses, on critical material if we can get it, even if it doesn't make up perfectly with some other things, we're going to -- we'll take the spot and take the material. So there's a little bit of investment in working capital there. 
I think the last part of your question around, can we attack it? I think like a lot of other businesses, we're scrambling to lift our capacity and help our supply chain in any way we can on all dimensions. So some businesses are attacking the labor scarcity issue in very unique ways and very innovative, quite honestly. Others and most of it comes down to, in some places, capital spend. We're doing some things and thinking through capital that we know we have to put into the business so we kind of watch that ramp throughout the year. And that makes sense, and wherever possible. IDEX is not an easy business to automate, but we're doing it more than we have been before because it also helps solve the labor issue. 
Sometimes this comes down to design, which is something that people don't think a lot about. Sometimes you can actually alter designs, whether it's in simple circuitry or even some of the other parts that we have and assist with fabrication. This is where our local proximity really helps us. So we can get in a car and drive over to a supplier and kind of have a collaborative discussion of is there a different way to solve this problem and bring material in. 
So it's pretty much every day. If you went to one of our daily management sessions, you'd probably see that 70% of the discussion is around solving problems of this nature both in the short term and then wherever possible and longer term in terms of investments or problem-solving."

One is when we think about the nature of most IDEX products, it's highly configured, in some ways customized for each application. And so typically, it's not a great product to over-order lots of because you're never quite sure of how it's going to run out in the customer system. I would say what is a little different as we go through the year here in terms of typical patterns, it's just lengthening of sort of order horizon. So if somebody would have before given us, let's say, 6 months' worth of requirements, they might throw another quarter in there, recognizing, hey, this is a standard product. We know we're going to use it in this particular case, and we don't want to lose a place in line. 
That tracks actually with our own lead times. And as we extended those lead times, most equations would work and say then that's how you would change your order patterns to accommodate it. So I really -- we've never seen a tremendous run-up of inventory at IDEX material. Our distributors and channel within FMT doesn't really work that way. Most people still, as they think of planning for IDEX products, think of us as generally on the very agile, reactive end of the spectrum. And they haven't really changed their thinking around it as the entire world kind of goes through a relative change in shift outward."

We've got a campus in India, a campus in China, and then we've got some commercial things across broader Southeast Asia. And I would say, in general, those have performed very well for us the last few years. They have performed well in 2021. I remind everybody it is a smaller portion of IDEX, and we attack it in a really surgical way. So we're picking specific niches, specific applications and then mating up technologies that we have available in IDEX to go after those. That -- I mean we're picking them because we think in many times, they're somewhat immune to some of the ebbs and flows that you would see more day-to-day or quarter-to-quarter because they've got growth dynamics at their back. 
So we're doing things in air ventilators and things for high altitude, or paint dispensing is a great market across all of that region for that specific reason. Now specifically, I would say we -- as a backdrop, I don't think we're seeing things that are different than others have talked about in terms of more moderate growth rates in China. And in a couple of instances, I'll talk to China specifically, we have some headwinds where there's -- and we mentioned this, there's a build for China belief out there around certain markets and things that they are very interested in investing in. And that provides headwinds for us, but I would say that's where innovation kicks in. What we're able to offer is quite different than the local option. Just means the sales cycle has extended a little longer, a little harder, but ultimately, we think our differentiation wins there. It's been a great performing region for us."

I'd like to start by thanking Mike Yates, our former Chief Accounting Officer, for his 16 years of service to IDEX. Mike helped lead an evolution of our finance and accounting organization, and his work has had a long-lasting impact on the business. On behalf of the entire IDEX team, I wish Mike the best in his future endeavors. 
Now let's turn to our IDEX overview on Slide 6. We continue to see supply chain challenges throughout the third quarter. Our localized sourcing, production and selling model helps us a bit relative to others, but this prolonged environment of poor material, labor and logistics availability challenges us just like any other business. Despite these obstacles, our IDEX teams around the globe have risen to the occasion. They exhibited both resiliency and stamina as they overcame yet another quarter filled with day-to-day disruptions, all while providing a high level of support to our customers. I want to thank all the IDEX team members across the globe for your hard work not just in Q3 but over the last 18 months of business within a pandemic. 
At this stage, we don't see any near-term signs of diminishing macroeconomic headwinds. Rather, we expect they'll remain at a high level and persist into 2022. We'll continue to leverage our 80/20 principles as we align around our best customers, our best prospects for growth and our critical business priorities. I spoke last quarter about our ability to capture price due to the differentiated mission-critical nature of our products. Overall, the price actions that we took over the past 6 months were increasingly realized in the third quarter, and we saw our price/cost spread increase sequentially. We will push price aggressively and appropriately as conditions continue to support our arguments. 
Despite the many challenges out there, our organic performance remains strong. We set another record in the third quarter for orders, sales and backlog. Our backlog is now $186 million higher than it was at the end of last year. Signals around the return of industrial projects have intensified, and current energy prices, if sustained, have the potential to drive investments within IDEX application areas. 
Our Health Science and Technologies segment performed exceptionally well. Over the past 5 or so years, we have stepped up organic investments with our focus on the longer term. Within our sealing business, we built a new facility with the goal of capturing share in the expanding semiconductor market. We brought 3 optics facilities together and our new Optics Center of Excellence to enable future wins in life sciences by integrating multiple IDEX components to create value for our customers. 
We optimized the footprint and core technology of our material processing technology platform to enable long-term repeatable growth across a series of technologies. These investments have generated tremendous returns, and we are well positioned to capture share and capitalize on market growth going forward. 
On the inorganic side, our recent acquisitions are doing extremely well. ABEL Pumps is fully integrated and performing ahead of expectations. The Airtech integration is ahead of schedule, and the team is making strong progress on their growth strategy. Both are executing well in the challenging operating environment as they come up to speed on our 80/20 playbook. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capital available to support future acquisitions and investments in the business. Our M&A funnel is healthy. Our expanded team has identified a number of interesting opportunities as we look to deploy additional capital in the near and long term. 
In the end, we are focused on delivering and growing within a very difficult near-term operating environment while spending a significant part of each day thinking about the best investments in teams, technologies and business opportunities to thrive in the years to come. I'm very confident in our team's ability to outperform in both areas. 
With that, I'll turn to our market outlook on Page 7. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were favorable versus the second quarter. Larger industrial projects still lag, but quote activity and funnel strength have both improved. Agriculture remains robust, delivering on record volumes. Our water businesses continue to perform well. Municipal spending is steady, and there is general optimism around future increased government funding. The chemical and energy markets continue to lag primarily due to limited capital investment. However, on the chemical side, smaller, fast-turning projects performed well. We are cautiously optimistic on energy as increased fuel prices and concerns over energy shortages have the potential to trigger investment. 
As we noted last quarter, our Flow MD business has experienced a significant pullback in customers' capital investments. It impacted FMT's organic sales by 8%. In other words, excluding the impact of Flow MD, FMT organic sales would have grown 15% instead of 7% as reported. 
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see strong demand across all our end markets. Semiconductor, food and pharma, analytical instrumentation and life sciences all performed well. We continue to win share through our targeted growth initiatives, and our intentionality around identifying opportunities that grow faster than the broader market is paying off. The automotive market remains affected by supply chain-driven challenges, but we continue to see growth due to our concentration in higher-end European vehicles. The industrial businesses within the segment saw a trend similar to FMT. 
Finally, our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment is our most challenged segment right now. Price capture and volume offsets faced stronger headwinds within the segment due to higher direct OEM exposure and higher levels of material intensity due to vertical integration. In Fire & Safety, North America Fire OEM production continues to struggle due to supply chain challenges. Larger tender activity is slowly increasing within the global fire/rescue markets, but we feel these market challenges will persist into 2022. U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages have tempered the performance of our BAND-IT business. We continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned as supply chain constraints eventually ease. But in the third quarter, the impact of automotive shutdowns increased versus last quarter and moderated our performance. 
Finally, dispensing performed well as key customers deploy capital on strong DIY market demand, and our global product offerings capture share. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect rolling supply chain disruptions to continue throughout the balance of the year and into 2022. That said, our third quarter organic orders were flat sequentially versus second quarter, and our backlog remains at a record level. Overall, the demand environment for IDEX products has not waned  despite supply chain challenges, and we remain optimistic about the trajectory of our end markets. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results."
29728,1683175324,2422140,"IDEX Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","IDEX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Eric.

Q3 orders of $774 million were up 36% overall and up 28% organically. We built $62 million of backlog in the quarter, and all 3 segments had strong organic performance versus last year as well as versus the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter sales of $712 million were up 23% overall and up 15% organically. We continue to experience a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, tempered by supply chain constraints.
The Flow MD pressure and Fluid & Metering Eric discussed also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding Flow MD, organic sales would have been up 18% overall. Q3 gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 43.8%. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of a $9.1 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Airtech acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 45%, and improved sequentially. Third quarter operating margin was 22.6%, flat compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 120 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by our gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset with some pressure from targeted reinvestments and the dilutive impact of Airtech and ABEL acquisitions due to their intangible amortization costs. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. 
Our Q3 effective tax rate was 23.4%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 14.4% due to the finalization of tax regulations enacted in the third quarter of 2020 as well as a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation in the current period. Third quarter net income was $116 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.51. Adjusted net income was $125 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.63, up $0.23 or 16% over prior year adjusted EPS. The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.27 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year quarter. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by $0.50 or 35% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $142 million, up 5% compared to prior year and was 113% of adjusted net income. The result was impacted by higher earnings, partly offset by volume-driven working capital build. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing significant year-over-year volume and supply chain challenges. 
Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating income increased $39 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $29 million, flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We achieved positive price cost within the quarter, and saw our price/cost spread improved sequentially. Our teams continue to drive operational productivity as another lever to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from supply chain costs and associated inefficiencies. The positive mix is a primary result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre-pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. 
As Eric mentioned, we are actively investing in the resources we need to execute on future growth and productivity. This reinvestment back into the business, higher variable compensation and targeted increases in discretionary spending drive the year-over-year pressure of $15 million. Despite the incremental spend, inflation and supply chain-driven operational inefficiencies, we still achieved a solid 37% organic flow-through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to a reported flow-through of 30%. With a significant amount of focus dedicated to navigating supply chain disruptions, we did not fully execute on the level of spend we expected in the quarter. We intend to make these investments in the fourth quarter, and they will mitigate our flow-through a bit as we close out the year. 
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. I'm on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting adjusted EPS to range from $1.55 to $1.58. We expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted operating margins between 23.5% and 24%. Q4 results are slightly lower than the third quarter, driven by organic and inorganic resource investments, seasonality and the potential for year-end logistics challenges. The Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect about 0.5% of top line benefit from FX, and corporate costs in Q4 are expected to be around $19 million. 
Turning to the full year. We are narrowing our full year EPS guidance from a range of $6.26 to $6.36 to $6.30 to $6.33. We are also maintaining our full year organic growth of 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24%. We expect FX to provide 1.5% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%.  Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, in line with our previous guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be around 105% of net income, lower versus our last guide primarily due to working capital investments. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $73 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. 
Finally, beginning in 2022, IDEX will provide EPS guidance and report actual results, excluding the impacts of after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis will provide more transparency to our core operating results as well as facilitate comparisons with our peer companies as we continue on our capital deployment journey. 
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share a few updates around our great teams. First off, I'd like to extend my public congratulations to our Non-Executive Chairman, Bill Cook, on being named Public Company Director of the Year by the National Association of Corporate Directors. Bill and I both joined IDEX around the same time in 2008, and I've learned a great deal from him over the years. His insightful perspective and critical thinking skills have been tremendously helpful for the company, and I know I speak for everyone at IDEX when I say congratulations, Bill, on this well-deserved honor. 
Turning to the IDEX Foundation. Last month, the foundation entered a national partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Various U.S.-based business units have supported their local Boys & Girls Clubs over the years, but this takes our joint work to the next level, offering a clear pathway for increased engagement. Every one of our U.S. business units is close to at least one Boys & Girls Club location. This agreement aligns with the foundation's equity and opportunity charitable pillar added earlier this year, seeking to create opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color within our community. 
Finally, we attribute much of our success to our strong foundational culture. Our annual September engagement survey just came back. And even within this incredibly challenging environment, loaded with disruptions and unexpected turns, we held steady and were scored in the top quartile of all manufacturing companies. Our teams around the world are beginning to develop tactical plans to address feedback provided by their local teams, part of the continuous improvement that supports everything we do at IDEX.

But in this environment, the part that I think we're all struggling with is just inherently the lead times in the queue is lengthening. So it's really that -- your question around when does it resolve. I think as we indicated, it's further out on the horizon, quite honestly. I mean a bunch of the knobs have to turn together, material availability, labor availability across the spectrum and logistics. 
So as those start to move and start to move in and all of us can depend on higher levels of throughput, we would be able to bring lead times back in. And ultimately, against all of that, still maintain that high say-do ratio. So it's, again, less on OTD rates and more on just lengthening lead times against expectations."

We didn't say it plateaued. We said they're relative to a pretty tough situation. So tough in the second quarter, tough in the third and continued tough in the fourth with, frankly, some year-end dynamics that always make that quarter a little bit tougher. And so we're thinking of those as we project forward. Your question around what are we experiencing? Well, I mean there's a lot of variety in IDEX. But one thing that makes us all about the same is we tend to buy a lot of configured materials. We're not overly vertically integrated. So material availability is the #1 challenge.
And then it does vary. We've got some businesses -- a few that are more semiconductor and ship-intensive. And then as you suspect, those tend to be the items for those businesses. Others, it's things like motors and castings. And typically, if they're coming from further away. That's a harder challenge. Labor availability for us, we don't have labor as a high percentage of our sales, but we do have pockets and it tracks pretty uniformly where labor is scarce either in the U.S. or in other geographies. And I'd say as an overlay, I'd probably say all of IDEX, to some degree, is continuing to try to track down scarce logistics resources, especially on smaller shipments or things that are going overseas. So I know that pretty much covers the spectrum of all possibilities. But if you want to just put a bow around it for us, it's material availability coming in through a supply chain of configured materials."

Maybe you can just start triangulating some thoughts on how you're thinking about those markets as we move into next year and maybe even through the next couple of years. Your concern level with all of the supply chain challenges, degrading demand, having some sort of circular challenge versus how you think about sustainability of the recovery curve as we sit here today and just how you balance all those moving pieces out internally."

Yes, relative to kind of the green and red chart that we provide folks, it hasn't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters in terms of the few areas that are lagging. So I'll just -- I'll sort of leave those as those stories continue in energy and chemical, and we can go into those later if we like. But I'd say a few things that are new here would be -- the automotive side did flip over to red for us. There's just no question there have been more disruption, more shutdowns even on the higher-end stuff where our products tend to have good presence.
Again, a small piece of IDEX, but it is something that's changed and changed a little different. I think if you kind of come up to a segment level, I mean, as you can see from our prepared remarks and just in our numbers, I mean the Health & Science  Technologies segment is doing really, really well. Very, very strong. Got semiconductor, that's where our exposure is. That's a strong market. Anything in analytical instrumentation, life science, the food areas. We've got some pharma in there as well. Those are just kind of universally strong, and we would expect those to continue strong going forward. 
I think we talk a lot, of course, when we turn over to FMT around project business and the nature of those. And we have seen some movement there. This has been a slow march of progress through the year. But I would say in the areas of food and pharma, in particular, you are starting to see a shift towards some intentional capacity expansion, which lends itself into discussions with folks like us and others around project business. In places on a more classic FMT side of the spectrum, chemicals, energy, that's lagging on the other side. Although even in chemicals, some of the faster-turn projects, we're seeing those come about. And then in that sort of right down the middle of the fairway industrial environment where a lot of our FMT businesses play, the discussions continue to move, and we are starting to see a bit of that hit-the-order board or at least indicate that it will in the first part of 2022. So I just -- I wouldn't say that the acceleration curve is different, but it continues to move more positively. 
Second part of your question was really around sort of the supply chain condition and it's run out. I think we're just talking about this this morning. What would be interesting is, overall, I think this is playing out indicating that there's still a lot of capacity that has to be put to work in the industrial space. You got too many places running 12 hours, 13 hours and running their equipment into the ground. Then some of the challenges with labor scarcity, I mean that lends itself towards automation and other things that are going to provide some support. So I do feel good about the longer-range winds at our backs and others in the industrial space. 
The near-term challenge, of course, is that we're sitting here, and a lot of other companies are sitting with a lot of backlog and in some ways, kind of a steady output that we wish was higher because of the supply chain challenges. Eventually, those 2 lines cross. We -- I would like to think that what would happen is the throughput would continue to increase as capacity is supplied, as people come back to work and begins to catch that order rate and then it continues in a great direction. 
I think that's the open question for all of us is sort of how do these things resolve. Those 2 rates resolve over time in, let's say, the next 2 quarters coming into 2022. And so we're going to have to watch all of the inputs and the variables that are driving that. It's a pretty complex equation, of course. But I'd end with saying continued positivity. The rates of progression are -- we're seeing those, feeling those and feel good about them. It all kind of comes down to a few things that are variable in the near term."

I mean it's very IDEX-like in terms of the problems it solves, and it's sort of positioned on the bill of materials for the fossil fuels infrastructure in the country. So that is typical. But you're right, relative to the average IDEX business, the unit of measure of the sale price of the product is a lot larger. This is -- these are pretty large units. In fact, the nature of projects in terms of how those orders come to us are larger as well. It tends to be very much a capital-intensive kind of way of doing business. And so this is a business that, remember, if we just back up over the last year when we acquired it, had really, really high levels of backlog because they captured a lot of projects long ago prior to the acquisition. 
Then, of course, things change pretty dramatically in terms of how the major folks that are in charge of the pipelines in the U.S. were talking about capital spend. We burned off that backlog and now find ourselves kind of in a steady state against replenishments and maintenance projects. We do a few things internationally. But the core of this business is still ultimately around the build-out or refurbishment around pipeline infrastructure in the U.S. It comes in larger project increments, and the sale price of the end product is larger. So the -- for all of those reasons, the magnitude year-over-year is a larger swing than you would typically see in IDEX. That's why we've been careful to call it out and make sure people understand it within the FMT results."

In terms of output, we could have realized with a slightly more favorable backdrop in the supply chain, probably in the range of a couple of percentage points of the organic rates that we posted. Just simply had the order could have made it and can point to something that prevented it in one of those 3 categories that I talked to. I'll let Bill talk about the inventory. I will say we, like many businesses, on critical material if we can get it, even if it doesn't make up perfectly with some other things, we're going to -- we'll take the spot and take the material. So there's a little bit of investment in working capital there. 
I think the last part of your question around, can we attack it? I think like a lot of other businesses, we're scrambling to lift our capacity and help our supply chain in any way we can on all dimensions. So some businesses are attacking the labor scarcity issue in very unique ways and very innovative, quite honestly. Others and most of it comes down to, in some places, capital spend. We're doing some things and thinking through capital that we know we have to put into the business so we kind of watch that ramp throughout the year. And that makes sense, and wherever possible. IDEX is not an easy business to automate, but we're doing it more than we have been before because it also helps solve the labor issue. 
Sometimes this comes down to design, which is something that people don't think a lot about. Sometimes you can actually alter designs, whether it's in simple circuitry or even some of the other parts that we have and assist with fabrication. This is where our local proximity really helps us. So we can get in a car and drive over to a supplier and kind of have a collaborative discussion of is there a different way to solve this problem and bring material in. 
So it's pretty much every day. If you went to one of our daily management sessions, you'd probably see that 70% of the discussion is around solving problems of this nature both in the short term and then wherever possible and longer term in terms of investments or problem-solving."

One is when we think about the nature of most IDEX products, it's highly configured, in some ways customized for each application. And so typically, it's not a great product to over-order lots of because you're never quite sure of how it's going to run out in the customer system. I would say what is a little different as we go through the year here in terms of typical patterns, it's just lengthening of sort of order horizon. So if somebody would have before given us, let's say, 6 months' worth of requirements, they might throw another quarter in there, recognizing, hey, this is a standard product. We know we're going to use it in this particular case, and we don't want to lose a place in line. 
That tracks actually with our own lead times. And as we extended those lead times, most equations would work and say then that's how you would change your order patterns to accommodate it. So I really -- we've never seen a tremendous run-up of inventory at IDEX material. Our distributors and channel within FMT doesn't really work that way. Most people still, as they think of planning for IDEX products, think of us as generally on the very agile, reactive end of the spectrum. And they haven't really changed their thinking around it as the entire world kind of goes through a relative change in shift outward."

So -- but the arguments, the pricing arguments around criticality of solution and leveraging our position -- our #1 share position within those niches and our long relationship with customers, that's basically the same equation.

And I was reflecting when we talked about all the positive aspects that are happening in HST, many of which were coming out of specific facilities that we bought for specific reasons to get it in different markets, actually went back and checked the dates, those were commissioned in 2016, '17 and '18 basically. And they're now at full fruition here, and we're very glad we made those bets. 
So we just have to be very aware of sort of longer-term trends, longer-term positioning and make sure that we're both doing 2 things simultaneously.

And I would say, in general, those have performed very well for us the last few years. They have performed well in 2021. I remind everybody it is a smaller portion of IDEX, and we attack it in a really surgical way. So we're picking specific niches, specific applications and then mating up technologies that we have available in IDEX to go after those. That -- I mean we're picking them because we think in many times, they're somewhat immune to some of the ebbs and flows that you would see more day-to-day or quarter-to-quarter because they've got growth dynamics at their back. 
So we're doing things in air ventilators and things for high altitude, or paint dispensing is a great market across all of that region for that specific reason. Now specifically, I would say we -- as a backdrop, I don't think we're seeing things that are different than others have talked about in terms of more moderate growth rates in China. And in a couple of instances, I'll talk to China specifically, we have some headwinds where there's -- and we mentioned this, there's a build for China belief out there around certain markets and things that they are very interested in investing in. And that provides headwinds for us, but I would say that's where innovation kicks in. What we're able to offer is quite different than the local option. Just means the sales cycle has extended a little longer, a little harder, but ultimately, we think our differentiation wins there. It's been a great performing region for us."

I'd like to start by thanking Mike Yates, our former Chief Accounting Officer, for his 16 years of service to IDEX. Mike helped lead an evolution of our finance and accounting organization, and his work has had a long-lasting impact on the business. On behalf of the entire IDEX team, I wish Mike the best in his future endeavors. 
Now let's turn to our IDEX overview on Slide 6. We continue to see supply chain challenges throughout the third quarter. Our localized sourcing, production and selling model helps us a bit relative to others, but this prolonged environment of poor material, labor and logistics availability challenges us just like any other business. Despite these obstacles, our IDEX teams around the globe have risen to the occasion. They exhibited both resiliency and stamina as they overcame yet another quarter filled with day-to-day disruptions, all while providing a high level of support to our customers. I want to thank all the IDEX team members across the globe for your hard work not just in Q3 but over the last 18 months of business within a pandemic. 
At this stage, we don't see any near-term signs of diminishing macroeconomic headwinds. Rather, we expect they'll remain at a high level and persist into 2022. We'll continue to leverage our 80/20 principles as we align around our best customers, our best prospects for growth and our critical business priorities. I spoke last quarter about our ability to capture price due to the differentiated mission-critical nature of our products. Overall, the price actions that we took over the past 6 months were increasingly realized in the third quarter, and we saw our price/cost spread increase sequentially. We will push price aggressively and appropriately as conditions continue to support our arguments. 
Despite the many challenges out there, our organic performance remains strong. We set another record in the third quarter for orders, sales and backlog. Our backlog is now $186 million higher than it was at the end of last year. Signals around the return of industrial projects have intensified, and current energy prices, if sustained, have the potential to drive investments within IDEX application areas. 
Our Health Science and Technologies segment performed exceptionally well. Over the past 5 or so years, we have stepped up organic investments with our focus on the longer term. Within our sealing business, we built a new facility with the goal of capturing share in the expanding semiconductor market. We brought 3 optics facilities together and our new Optics Center of Excellence to enable future wins in life sciences by integrating multiple IDEX components to create value for our customers. 
We optimized the footprint and core technology of our material processing technology platform to enable long-term repeatable growth across a series of technologies. These investments have generated tremendous returns, and we are well positioned to capture share and capitalize on market growth going forward. 
On the inorganic side, our recent acquisitions are doing extremely well. ABEL Pumps is fully integrated and performing ahead of expectations. The Airtech integration is ahead of schedule, and the team is making strong progress on their growth strategy. Both are executing well in the challenging operating environment as they come up to speed on our 80/20 playbook. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capital available to support future acquisitions and investments in the business. Our M&A funnel is healthy. Our expanded team has identified a number of interesting opportunities as we look to deploy additional capital in the near and long term. 
In the end, we are focused on delivering and growing within a very difficult near-term operating environment while spending a significant part of each day thinking about the best investments in teams, technologies and business opportunities to thrive in the years to come. I'm very confident in our team's ability to outperform in both areas. 
With that, I'll turn to our market outlook on Page 7. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were favorable versus the second quarter. Larger industrial projects still lag, but quote activity and funnel strength have both improved. Agriculture remains robust, delivering on record volumes. Our water businesses continue to perform well. Municipal spending is steady, and there is general optimism around future increased government funding. The chemical and energy markets continue to lag primarily due to limited capital investment. However, on the chemical side, smaller, fast-turning projects performed well. We are cautiously optimistic on energy as increased fuel prices and concerns over energy shortages have the potential to trigger investment. 
As we noted last quarter, our Flow MD business has experienced a significant pullback in customers' capital investments. It impacted FMT's organic sales by 8%. In other words, excluding the impact of Flow MD, FMT organic sales would have grown 15% instead of 7% as reported. 
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see strong demand across all our end markets. Semiconductor, food and pharma, analytical instrumentation and life sciences all performed well. We continue to win share through our targeted growth initiatives, and our intentionality around identifying opportunities that grow faster than the broader market is paying off. The automotive market remains affected by supply chain-driven challenges, but we continue to see growth due to our concentration in higher-end European vehicles. The industrial businesses within the segment saw a trend similar to FMT. 
Finally, our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment is our most challenged segment right now. Price capture and volume offsets faced stronger headwinds within the segment due to higher direct OEM exposure and higher levels of material intensity due to vertical integration. In Fire & Safety, North America Fire OEM production continues to struggle due to supply chain challenges. Larger tender activity is slowly increasing within the global fire/rescue markets, but we feel these market challenges will persist into 2022. U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages have tempered the performance of our BAND-IT business. We continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned as supply chain constraints eventually ease. But in the third quarter, the impact of automotive shutdowns increased versus last quarter and moderated our performance. 
Finally, dispensing performed well as key customers deploy capital on strong DIY market demand, and our global product offerings capture share. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect rolling supply chain disruptions to continue throughout the balance of the year and into 2022. That said, our third quarter organic orders were flat sequentially versus second quarter, and our backlog remains at a record level. Overall, the demand environment for IDEX products has not waned  despite supply chain challenges, and we remain optimistic about the trajectory of our end markets. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results."

Q3 orders of $774 million were up 36% overall and up 28% organically. We built $62 million of backlog in the quarter, and all 3 segments had strong organic performance versus last year as well as versus the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter sales of $712 million were up 23% overall and up 15% organically. We continue to experience a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, tempered by supply chain constraints.
The Flow MD pressure and Fluid & Metering Eric discussed also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding Flow MD, organic sales would have been up 18% overall. Q3 gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 43.8%. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of a $9.1 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Airtech acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 45%, and improved sequentially. Third quarter operating margin was 22.6%, flat compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 120 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by our gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset with some pressure from targeted reinvestments and the dilutive impact of Airtech and ABEL acquisitions due to their intangible amortization costs. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. 
Our Q3 effective tax rate was 23.4%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 14.4% due to the finalization of tax regulations enacted in the third quarter of 2020 as well as a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation in the current period. Third quarter net income was $116 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.51. Adjusted net income was $125 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.63, up $0.23 or 16% over prior year adjusted EPS. The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.27 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year quarter. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by $0.50 or 35% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $142 million, up 5% compared to prior year and was 113% of adjusted net income. The result was impacted by higher earnings, partly offset by volume-driven working capital build. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing significant year-over-year volume and supply chain challenges. 
Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating income increased $39 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $29 million, flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We achieved positive price cost within the quarter, and saw our price/cost spread improved sequentially. Our teams continue to drive operational productivity as another lever to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from supply chain costs and associated inefficiencies. The positive mix is a primary result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre-pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. 
As Eric mentioned, we are actively investing in the resources we need to execute on future growth and productivity. This reinvestment back into the business, higher variable compensation and targeted increases in discretionary spending drive the year-over-year pressure of $15 million. Despite the incremental spend, inflation and supply chain-driven operational inefficiencies, we still achieved a solid 37% organic flow-through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to a reported flow-through of 30%. With a significant amount of focus dedicated to navigating supply chain disruptions, we did not fully execute on the level of spend we expected in the quarter. We intend to make these investments in the fourth quarter, and they will mitigate our flow-through a bit as we close out the year. 
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. I'm on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting adjusted EPS to range from $1.55 to $1.58. We expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted operating margins between 23.5% and 24%. Q4 results are slightly lower than the third quarter, driven by organic and inorganic resource investments, seasonality and the potential for year-end logistics challenges. The Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect about 0.5% of top line benefit from FX, and corporate costs in Q4 are expected to be around $19 million. 
Turning to the full year. We are narrowing our full year EPS guidance from a range of $6.26 to $6.36 to $6.30 to $6.33. We are also maintaining our full year organic growth of 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24%. We expect FX to provide 1.5% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%.  Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, in line with our previous guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be around 105% of net income, lower versus our last guide primarily due to working capital investments. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $73 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. 
Finally, beginning in 2022, IDEX will provide EPS guidance and report actual results, excluding the impacts of after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis will provide more transparency to our core operating results as well as facilitate comparisons with our peer companies as we continue on our capital deployment journey. 
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share a few updates around our great teams. First off, I'd like to extend my public congratulations to our Non-Executive Chairman, Bill Cook, on being named Public Company Director of the Year by the National Association of Corporate Directors. Bill and I both joined IDEX around the same time in 2008, and I've learned a great deal from him over the years. His insightful perspective and critical thinking skills have been tremendously helpful for the company, and I know I speak for everyone at IDEX when I say congratulations, Bill, on this well-deserved honor. 
Turning to the IDEX Foundation. Last month, the foundation entered a national partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Various U.S.-based business units have supported their local Boys & Girls Clubs over the years, but this takes our joint work to the next level, offering a clear pathway for increased engagement. Every one of our U.S. business units is close to at least one Boys & Girls Club location. This agreement aligns with the foundation's equity and opportunity charitable pillar added earlier this year, seeking to create opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color within our community. 
Finally, we attribute much of our success to our strong foundational culture. Our annual September engagement survey just came back. And even within this incredibly challenging environment, loaded with disruptions and unexpected turns, we held steady and were scored in the top quartile of all manufacturing companies. Our teams around the world are beginning to develop tactical plans to address feedback provided by their local teams, part of the continuous improvement that supports everything we do at IDEX.

So I mean, we've maintained a high say-do ratio relative to our customers. We use the 80/20 lens to provide differentiated services for different levels of customers. So all of that remains constant. But in this environment, the part that I think we're all struggling with is just inherently the lead times in the queue is lengthening. So it's really that -- your question around when does it resolve. I think as we indicated, it's further out on the horizon, quite honestly. I mean a bunch of the knobs have to turn together, material availability, labor availability across the spectrum and logistics. 
So as those start to move and start to move in and all of us can depend on higher levels of throughput, we would be able to bring lead times back in. And ultimately, against all of that, still maintain that high say-do ratio. So it's, again, less on OTD rates and more on just lengthening lead times against expectations."

We didn't say it plateaued. We said they're relative to a pretty tough situation. So tough in the second quarter, tough in the third and continued tough in the fourth with, frankly, some year-end dynamics that always make that quarter a little bit tougher. And so we're thinking of those as we project forward. Your question around what are we experiencing? Well, I mean there's a lot of variety in IDEX. But one thing that makes us all about the same is we tend to buy a lot of configured materials. We're not overly vertically integrated. So material availability is the #1 challenge.
And then it does vary. We've got some businesses -- a few that are more semiconductor and ship-intensive. And then as you suspect, those tend to be the items for those businesses. Others, it's things like motors and castings. And typically, if they're coming from further away. That's a harder challenge. Labor availability for us, we don't have labor as a high percentage of our sales, but we do have pockets and it tracks pretty uniformly where labor is scarce either in the U.S. or in other geographies. And I'd say as an overlay, I'd probably say all of IDEX, to some degree, is continuing to try to track down scarce logistics resources, especially on smaller shipments or things that are going overseas. So I know that pretty much covers the spectrum of all possibilities. But if you want to just put a bow around it for us, it's material availability coming in through a supply chain of configured materials."

First, a lot of moving pieces in the environment as we sit here today. Certainly, appreciate the color that you gave us, I guess, in this case, literally the green and red colors you gave us, and the various end markets and how those were performing. Maybe you can just start triangulating some thoughts on how you're thinking about those markets as we move into next year and maybe even through the next couple of years. Your concern level with all of the supply chain challenges, degrading demand, having some sort of circular challenge versus how you think about sustainability of the recovery curve as we sit here today and just how you balance all those moving pieces out internally."

Yes, relative to kind of the green and red chart that we provide folks, it hasn't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters in terms of the few areas that are lagging. So I'll just -- I'll sort of leave thos",715,"Sure. So there's a couple of things there. Yes, relative to kind of the green and red chart that we provide folks, it hasn't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters in terms of the few areas that are lagging. So I'll just -- I'll sort of leave those as those stories continue in energy and chemical, and we can go into those later if we like. But I'd say a few things that are new here would be -- the automotive side did flip over to red for us. There's just no question there have been more disruption, more shutdowns even on the higher-end stuff where our products tend to have good presence.
Again, a small piece of IDEX, but it is something that's changed and changed a little different. I think if you kind of come up to a segment level, I mean, as you can see from our prepared remarks and just in our numbers, I mean the Health & Science  Technologies segment is doing really, really well. Very, very strong. Got semiconductor, that's where our exposure is. That's a strong market. Anything in analytical instrumentation, life science, the food areas. We've got some pharma in there as well. Those are just kind of universally strong, and we would expect those to continue strong going forward. 
I think we talk a lot, of course, when we turn over to FMT around project business and the nature of those. And we have seen some movement there. This has been a slow march of progress through the year. But I would say in the areas of food and pharma, in particular, you are starting to see a shift towards some intentional capacity expansion, which lends itself into discussions with folks like us and others around project business. In places on a more classic FMT side of the spectrum, chemicals, energy, that's lagging on the other side. Although even in chemicals, some of the faster-turn projects, we're seeing those come about. And then in that sort of right down the middle of the fairway industrial environment where a lot of our FMT businesses play, the discussions continue to move, and we are starting to see a bit of that hit-the-order board or at least indicate that it will in the first part of 2022. So I just -- I wouldn't say that the acceleration curve is different, but it continues to move more positively. 
Second part of your question was really around sort of the supply chain condition and it's run out. I think we're just talking about this this morning. What would be interesting is, overall, I think this is playing out indicating that there's still a lot of capacity that has to be put to work in the industrial space. You got too many places running 12 hours, 13 hours and running their equipment into the ground. Then some of the challenges with labor scarcity, I mean that lends itself towards automation and other things that are going to provide some support. So I do feel good about the longer-range winds at our backs and others in the industrial space. 
The near-term challenge, of course, is that we're sitting here, and a lot of other companies are sitting with a lot of backlog and in some ways, kind of a steady output that we wish was higher because of the supply chain challenges. Eventually, those 2 lines cross. We -- I would like to think that what would happen is the throughput would continue to increase as capacity is supplied, as people come back to work and begins to catch that order rate and then it continues in a great direction. 
I think that's the open question for all of us is sort of how do these things resolve. Those 2 rates resolve over time in, let's say, the next 2 quarters coming into 2022. And so we're going to have to watch all of the inputs and the variables that are driving that. It's a pretty complex equation, of course. But I'd end with saying continued positivity. The rates of progression are -- we're seeing those, feeling those and feel good about them. It all kind of comes down to a few things that are variable in the near term."

I mean it's very IDEX-like in terms of the problems it solves, and it's sort of positioned on the bill of materials for the fossil fuels infrastructure in the country. So that is typical. But you're right, relative to the average IDEX business, the unit of measure of the sale price of the product is a lot larger. This is -- these are pretty large units. In fact, the nature of projects in terms of how those orders come to us are larger as well. It tends to be very much a capital-intensive kind of way of doing business. And so this is a business that, remember, if we just back up over the last year when we acquired it, had really, really high levels of backlog because they captured a lot of projects long ago prior to the acquisition. 
Then, of course, things change pretty dramatically in terms of how the major folks that are in charge of the pipelines in the U.S. were talking about capital spend. We burned off that backlog and now find ourselves kind of in a steady state against replenishments and maintenance projects. We do a few things internationally. But the core of this business is still ultimately around the build-out or refurbishment around pipeline infrastructure in the U.S. It comes in larger project increments, and the sale price of the end product is larger. So the -- for all of those reasons, the magnitude year-over-year is a larger swing than you would typically see in IDEX. That's why we've been careful to call it out and make sure people understand it within the FMT results."

In terms of output, we could have realized with a slightly more favorable backdrop in the supply chain, probably in the range of a couple of percentage points of the organic rates that we posted. Just simply had the order could have made it and can point to something that prevented it in one of those 3 categories that I talked to. I'll let Bill talk about the inventory. I will say we, like many businesses, on critical material if we can get it, even if it doesn't make up perfectly with some other things, we're going to -- we'll take the spot and take the material. So there's a little bit of investment in working capital there. 
I think the last part of your question around, can we attack it? I think like a lot of other businesses, we're scrambling to lift our capacity and help our supply chain in any way we can on all dimensions. So some businesses are attacking the labor scarcity issue in very unique ways and very innovative, quite honestly. Others and most of it comes down to, in some places, capital spend. We're doing some things and thinking through capital that we know we have to put into the business so we kind of watch that ramp throughout the year. And that makes sense, and wherever possible. IDEX is not an easy business to automate, but we're doing it more than we have been before because it also helps solve the labor issue. 
Sometimes this comes down to design, which is something that people don't think a lot about. Sometimes you can actually alter designs, whether it's in simple circuitry or even some of the other parts that we have and assist with fabrication. This is where our local proximity really helps us. So we can get in a car and drive over to a supplier and kind of have a collaborative discussion of is there a different way to solve this problem and bring material in. 
So it's pretty much every day. If you went to one of our daily management sessions, you'd probably see that 70% of the discussion is around solving problems of this nature both in the short term and then wherever possible and longer term in terms of investments or problem-solving."

We did have -- some folks highlight -- sequentially, the margin was down in HST, but that's really due to Airtech coming into the portfolio.

One is when we think about the nature of most IDEX products, it's highly configured, in some ways customized for each application. And so typically, it's not a great product to over-order lots of because you're never quite sure of how it's going to run out in the customer system. I would say what is a little different as we go through the year here in terms of typical patterns, it's just lengthening of sort of order horizon. So if somebody would have before given us, let's say, 6 months' worth of requirements, they might throw another quarter in there, recognizing, hey, this is a standard product. We know we're going to use it in this particular case, and we don't want to lose a place in line. 
That tracks actually with our own lead times. And as we extended those lead times, most equations would work and say then that's how you would change your order patterns to accommodate it. So I really -- we've never seen a tremendous run-up of inventory at IDEX material. Our distributors and channel within FMT doesn't really work that way. Most people still, as they think of planning for IDEX products, think of us as generally on the very agile, reactive end of the spectrum. And they haven't really changed their thinking around it as the entire world kind of goes through a relative change in shift outward."

So -- but the arguments, the pricing arguments around criticality of solution and leveraging our position -- our #1 share position within those niches and our long relationship with customers, that's basically the same equation.

I remind everybody it is a smaller portion of IDEX, and we attack it in a really surgical way. So we're picking specific niches, specific applications and then mating up technologies that we have available in IDEX to go after those. That -- I mean we're picking them because we think in many times, they're somewhat immune to some of the ebbs and flows that you would see more day-to-day or quarter-to-quarter because they've got growth dynamics at their back. 
So we're doing things in air ventilators and things for high altitude, or paint dispensing is a great market across all of that region for that specific reason. Now specifically, I would say we -- as a backdrop, I don't think we're seeing things that are different than others have talked about in terms of more moderate growth rates in China. And in a couple of instances, I'll talk to China specifically, we have some headwinds where there's -- and we mentioned this, there's a build for China belief out there around certain markets and things that they are very interested in investing in. And that provides headwinds for us, but I would say that's where innovation kicks in. What we're able to offer is quite different than the local option. Just means the sales cycle has extended a little longer, a little harder, but ultimately, we think our differentiation wins there. It's been a great performing region for us."

The past 1.5 years have been one of the most dynamic and unpredictable ever experienced, but our IDEX team stepped up again in Q2 and delivered during an extremely challenging environment. Thank",1584,"Thank you, Mike. Beginning with our overview on Slide 6.  
The past 1.5 years have been one of the most dynamic and unpredictable ever experienced, but our IDEX team stepped up again in Q2 and delivered during an extremely challenging environment. Thank you to the IDEX employees around the world who are working so hard.  
Our commercial performance is very strong as we recorded record orders and backlog in the quarter. Order trends continue to improve sequentially, and all 3 segments are materially above pre-pandemic level. Our day rates are very strong, and our OEM order patterns are robust. Only large industrial projects, many of them in FMT, continue to lag a bit. We're beginning to see the move into planning funnels, indicating support for continued phases of organic growth in the back half of 2021 and next year.  
Our #1 operating challenge for the quarter was supply chain and logistics disruptions. IDEX is generally a short-cycle business with quick lead times. We typically operate at the component level further down our customers' bill of materials. We're also not very vertically integrated. We depend on a tight network of supplier partners, often located close by our operating units to quick turn our solutions with a minimum [ visibility ]. For these reasons, the challenging conditions of tight material supply and bottleneck logistics tend to lag other industrial companies.  
Our agile model does support a quick calibration to today's reality, and it helps us exit quicker than many on the backside of the supply side constraint. Overall, we believe these disruptions have hit a plateau. We don't see things getting worse, and the challenges will continue to be highly variable. At the same time, we don't anticipate these disruptions getting better soon, but most likely they will not subside until the end of this year or early next year.  
We anticipated rising inflation as the global economy recovered, but like many did not imagine the sharp rate of increase. This narrowed our spread between price capture and material costs, although we remain positive overall. Our teams leveraged the systematic investments we made a few years ago in pricing management and aggressively deployed 2, sometimes 3 pricing adjustments with precision. We are on track to expand our price/cost spread to typical levels as we travel through the back half of the year.  
While we spend a lot of time talking about our business's ability to capture price, one area that I don't want to miss is our continued focus on operational productivity. Our teams continue to drive margin improvement through 80/20 simplification, lean effort and through sound CapEx deployment. Our robust project funnels continue to be another weapon to combat rising costs. The one project that exemplifies the spirit deserves mention as we discuss Q2.  
Our energy market now starting to show some signs of recovery off the bottom are still lagging the overall group. Our teams are aggressively executing a facility rationalization project to consolidate our scale and focus our human resources in close working proximity. Ultimately, this is a long-term value driver for that group. But in the quarter, the project created headwinds for us as equipment was delayed and inventory positions were less than ideal to support production transfers. We expect the project to be back on track and completed by the end of the third quarter.  
Overall, I am confident in our path through these choppy recovery as we continue to apply relentless focus from outstanding teams to deliver solutions that matter from high-quality businesses that are very well positioned within their application steps.  
Moving on to Slide 7. We deployed just over $575 million in the first half of the year with our acquisitions of ABEL Pumps, Airtech and a small investment in a digitalization technology start-up within the Fire & Rescue space. We continue to build out processes and capabilities to explore additional strategic investments we want to make across IDEX. Our funnel for potential acquisitions is stronger than it has been in the past, and we are more aggressive in pursuing opportunities that enhance our business solutions, fit well with our style of competition and drive IDEX-like returns.  It's early days in our integration of ABEL and Airtech, but we're happy to see that each business is performing well with excellent growth prospects in the near and long term. 
While we've stepped up our M&A game, we're also investing in our existing businesses with a 45% increase in capital spending through the first half of the year. We're in the process of expanding IDEX facilities in China and India. We project significant ongoing growth opportunities across Asia, and these investments are critical to support our local-for-local approach as we move to the next level of competitive advantage.  
We're also focused on our digital strategy with our largest investments tied to our areas of higher integration and scale as we seek to drive higher impact for our customers. Lastly, as I mentioned previously, we're focused on operational productivity as market dynamics are changing as well as investing in new technology to support growth. This is on both the CapEx and OpEx side. Some of these investments are targeted at new applications in high-growth areas, like components to enable new global broadband satellite networks, building batteries for electric vehicles and providing key products to support the build-out of incremental capacity in semiconductor manufacturing. These investments are combined with targeted spend in areas to support automation and efficiencies across the shop floor. This strategic approach to both inorganic and organic investment is already paying off and sets us up for ongoing success for years to come.  
Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. As I mentioned, order strength continued in the second quarter both compared to prior year and sequentially, resulting in a backlog build of $65 million in the quarter. As we look across our segments, all rebounded well from the pandemic and delivered strong organic order growth. Sequentially, Fluid & Metering technologies and Fire & Safety diversified products saw increased orders compared to the first quarter. Our Health & Science Technologies segment also saw increased sequential orders if we exclude the impact of a COVID testing application debooking that occurred in Q2.  
Order intake across all segments was also above second quarter 2019 levels. FMT lags HST and FSD due to lower levels of investment in the oil and gas market as well as concentration in the industrial market, which saw a pre-COVID pullback in the second half of 2019. These commercial results give us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit growth in the second half of the year and continue to highlight the resilience of our businesses and the criticality of our solutions to customers.  
On Slide 9, we provide a deeper look into our primary end markets. Our focus is shifting from recovery to growth as most of our businesses are now performing above pre-pandemic levels. Even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we're optimistic about the outlook of our end markets and our ability to execute within them. 
In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were strong. Supply chain challenges remain. But overall, the market trajectory was at or above 2019 levels with only large projects lagging, as I mentioned earlier.  
Agriculture continued to drive strong growth, driven by aging farm equipment and record crop prices. Our water business was stable. We continue to monitor the impact of the federal infrastructure package on U.S. municipal spending. Energy and chemical markets continue to trail 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in the sector as well as a longer project close cycle.  
One item to highlight for FMT is the impact of our FMD acquisition last year. It's now in our organic figures. And with its backlog burn last year and significant pullback in customers' capital investments, it impacted FMT's organic sales by 11%. In other words, FMT's organic sales for the quarter would have been 19% instead of 8%.  
Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We're seeing recovery and pivot to growth across all our end markets. Semiconductor, food and pharma continued to perform well, driven by strong market demand and winning share through our targeted growth initiatives. The overall automotive market continued to face supply chain-driven challenges but we outperformed the market due to our product concentration in higher-end European vehicles.  
Our AI and life science markets continue to perform well as the pandemic impact eased and investments have increased. The industrial business within the segment saw a similar result to FMT.  
Finally, in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment, dispensing rebounded as large retailers freed up capital and worked through pent-up demand for equipment. Our BAND-IT business was adversely affected by U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages in the second quarter. However, we continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to outperform the market as supply chain constraints ease.  
In Fire & Rescue, we have yet to see larger tenders come back and emerging markets remain slow. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect some choppiness in the second half of the year. That said, we're confident in the future trajectory of our end markets as well as our ability to execute on our strong backlog and have raised our organic growth expectations for the year.  
With that, I would like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results."
29728,1672304868,3395843,"IDEX Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","IDEX Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Eric.

Q2 orders of $751 million were up 44% overall and 39% organically as we built $65 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. 
Second quarter sales of $686 million were up 22% overall and 17% organically. While we experienced a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, we were impacted by supply chain constraints and our energy site consolidation, which tempered our results. The FMD pressure in Fluid & Metering Eric discussed also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding FMD, organic sales would have been up 22%. 
Q2 gross margin expanded by 280 basis points to 44.6%. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of $1.8 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the ABEL acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 44.9% and was approximately flat sequentially.
Second quarter operating margin was 23.1%, up 340 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.4%, up 330 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset by a rebound in discretionary spending and investment. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. 
Our Q2 effective tax rate was 21.3%, which was lower than the prior year ETR of 22.7% due to benefits from foreign sourced income in the second quarter of 2021. This benefit also drove favorability to our guided rate for the quarter. 
Q2 adjusted net income was $123 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.61, up $0.51 or 46% over prior year adjusted EPS. 
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $120 million, down 25% compared to prior year and was 98% of adjusted net income. This result was impacted by a volume-driven working capital build, higher CapEx and timing of tax payments, partially offset by higher earnings. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing the significant volume changes year-over-year. 
Moving on to Slide 12, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $49 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 17% organic growth contributed approximately $41 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We maintained positive price material cost within the quarter and leveraged well on the volume increase. Our high contribution margins helped mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from the supply chain disruptions. 
In the second quarter of 2020, discretionary spending and investment were minimal, driven by a strict cost control environment during the pandemic. As we return to a spend level, in line with our growth and continued strategic investments, we see year-over-year pressure of about $11 million, in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. 
Even with the incremental spend, supply chain and operational issues that tempered our performance, we still achieved a robust 45% organic flow-through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to our reported flow-through of 39%. 
As we highlighted, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We expect that our level of discretionary spending as well as associated costs from growth initiatives will similarly reduce organic flow-through in subsequent quarters. 
With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Moving on to Slide 13. For the third quarter, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.57 to $1.61. We expect organic revenue growth of 14% to 16% and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The third quarter effective tax rate is expected to be 23%, and we expect a 1% top line benefit from the impact of FX. And corporate costs in the third quarter are expected to be around $21 million. 
Turning to the full year. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance from our previous range of $6.05 to $6.20, up to $6.26 to $6.36. This range includes Airtech, which will contribute $0.06 in the second half of 2021, roughly $0.03 a quarter. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 9% to 10% up to 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, an increase of around $10 million versus our last call as we increase our investments in growth opportunities. 
Free cash flow is expected to be 110% to 115% of net income, lower versus our last guide, primarily due to the additional capital spending and higher working capital to support our increased volume. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $77 million for the year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs, earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. 
With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts."

Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share an update on our ESG journey and the evolution of our company culture. 
I pledged earlier this year that we would hire a new Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. I'm pleased to announce that I now have Troy McIntosh in my senior leadership team. He joined us just last week from U.S. Cellular, the fourth largest cellular communications carrier in the United States where he led significant improvements in their culture and levels of diversity in the workforce. 
At IDEX, Troy will help build the global road map and success measures for DE&I. He will help embed DE&I deeper in our culture and build inclusive leadership confidence and capabilities in all our people through training, education and coaching. He will help us make sure our systems mitigate bias and create opportunities for everyone, no matter of their background to reach their full potential at IDEX. I look forward to great things happening with his leadership. 
I'd also like to share a nice step we're taking to improve our energy efficiencies. Work recently began on a solar array on the roof of our manufacturing facility in Germany. Once completed next month, this collection of solar panels will be about 1/3 the size of the European soccer field and provide 30% of the electricity needs for the facility. Not only will it help reduce our carbon footprint there, we estimate it will save the business more than EUR 67,000 in just the first year alone. We anticipate this project will serve as a pilot, leading the way for other solar installations on IDEX facilities around the world. 
Lastly, I want to share that the catastrophic flooding that devastated portions of Western Europe earlier this month has impacted many IDEX employees. About 1/4 of the employees at our German Fire & Safety business have either had their home severely damaged or destroyed. All of our employees are safe, living with friends and family as recovery efforts are ongoing. And operations continued at our facility, which is not directly impacted by the flood. 
Amid all this destruction and loss, we once again saw the spirit of IDEX come through. Colleagues from other IDEX businesses in Germany came to the area to assist. With pumping equipment from our businesses, our people work tirelessly to help draw water from flooded homes to the long road of [indiscernible] . The IDEX Foundation also paid $100,000 to the German Red Cross, which has thousands of people in the region assisting those impact. 
While I shared this internally, I want to again express with our employees better that we stand by you through this terrible tragedy. And thank you to all the dedicated and selfless IDEX colleagues who dropped everything and volunteered during this time of need. Your outstanding examples of what makes this company so special. 
With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions."

And so staying at a steady state is tough. It is what it is. So I don't want to mischaracterize it there. 
For us, a couple of things to remember. We're a little less exposed to a lot of the electronics microprocessor things that other businesses are. Our bill of material is generally a little bit more streamlined and simplified. We don't have as many aggregations of complex systems. We do a lot of great critical components. And we still -- we have a lot of suppliers that are pretty close by that honestly we drive by on the way to work. 
That being said, it's still very difficult for us. The indicators we're looking at, things like lead times, what are the quoted lead times and then what is the performance against them. And look, they have lengthened and extended, but they're generally kind of holding at this point. And the delivery rates against them, while not great, are at least, in our world, pretty stable at this point. So I just want to emphasize the relative nature of the comments and say, for us, it's a very, very tough environment, but we see it as one we can now begin to plan around given what we do."

So if we kind of go back to the end of 2020, we saw -- most of the acceleration that we're seeing was in that restoration of industrial day rates in our businesses. As we look at the second quarter and even into the first days of July, it's pretty stable at this point. I mean it's kind of at a healthy clip. We'll see it move on in terms of price and some things that come up, but it's not accelerating at the same rate nor is it in our world, decelerating. Think of it as stable. 
And then there's 2 other components that we think a lot about for a ton of IDEX businesses. And they're in the project category, but they're different degrees in terms of size and scope. So what we are seeing and what's contributing to growth, and I know will continue into Q3 and Q4, are what we would call -- that's a small project. These are discrete things where people are optimizing the system. Instead of asking for 1 or 2 of something, it's 10 to 20. And they're running their factory, their production lines, but they're trying to optimize it, enhance throughput, get productivity. Those are the kind of things you can do on the run. And so we're seeing that those have been strong contributors, and we think they'll continue. 
Right past it are the classic larger projects that we and others play with, a lot of them in kind of the chemical, oil and gas infrastructure spaces. And there's just a general story there still where those things are delayed. They were frozen in 2020. They were pushed out into 2021, not canceled. I will say what we're starting to hear now and mainly from distributors that are a little closer to the frontline are that those are now starting to turn into quote activity and spec transfer and the kind of things you start to see ahead of an order and a replenishment cycle on our side. 
When does that happen? Maybe there's some of it in the back half of the year. Certainly, at a minimum, we start talking about it more in planning, and I think it bodes well for the early part of 2022."

I mean we could go through the specific numbers, but we've got plenty of availability and firepower to spend. 
On the inside, we've been talking now for a couple of quarters about the intentionality of the resource build and the time and effort we're taking to consider all of the areas where we'd like to do more business, some of it through inorganic efforts. Think of this as a series of concentric circles radiating around places where we are participating today -- and participate. And a few things we're actually thinking of some zones where we're not part -- not currently part of IDEX that could be interesting or have IDEX-like attributes. 
So we've got the firepower. We're doing more work. And then the funnel of things that we're looking at, it's very active, aggressive and, I think in the end, actionable. 
Now we still are going to take the same discipline that we've had to any of the things that we're looking at. It's got to meet certain requirements, got to fit into IDEX.

And so that's maybe the area of difference with slight tweaks to the model. 
With always -- I mean, we've mentioned an open aperture for at least a couple of years now, at least an open mind to some things that might be very interesting that we've long considered for IDEX. I don't know if that's different. That's always been on the page.

If you start from the highest level and think about the next couple of years, I think you start with a very positive perspective. You recognize that like we're now coming through a pretty acute recovery cycle. That isn't completely played out. Then there's a replenishment cycle that not only, I think, is reflective of the time that we sort of were all locked away, but I think even ahead of that, there was a decent amount of industrial capacity that needs to be put back into the system. 
The real question, I think, as we go is, if you think of this as a series of graph lines with very sharp peaks and troughs -- I mean, this is super dynamic in terms of the elements we're dealing with today. As they smooth out and look a little bit more like the Appalachians, I think that becomes a little bit more of a standard operating environment with positive momentum. And so many of the dynamics that we're talking about now in terms of when they come back or when they reoccur, I think they would be in place and they would be things that we'd be typically used to looking at. And it would feel a little bit normalized in terms of the way that we would operate with favorable winds at our back in all of the places that we play. 
So I think we view it that way. We're planning for it that way. It's a positive outlook, a positive framework. You just sort of have to navigate some of the puts and takes. And there's just a lot of dynamic variables here, none of which I think really get in the way of that positive outlook."

They had -- they were burning backlog nicely, sort of right at the point of acquisition. And of course, COVID came along and devastated a lot of the core markets there. And it's a little bit more project intensive than the average IDEX business, just by the nature of what they do. These are the large units that are going out there and custody transfer in large pipeline projects and things like that. 
So -- and then if you think of that environment, I mean, there's been a couple of very sort of public shocks in that particular area as well. We're just -- right now, the spend is very intensive towards some other things, simple maintenance and those kind of items. So I think it's going to be a little while before that breaks. 
That said, the international markets are a little different than what we're seeing here in North America. They're generally more favorable. That business has been pointed towards those strategically long before we bought them and continue that way. So we think that's a nice extension for it. But I think as we saw even with the events that happened here a little bit recently, it didn't take too many days for things to be offline before our economy felt it. And this business makes them incredibly great and nice pieces of technology that are very useful in that continuum. 
So we like it from the long term and what it does. We think the prospects long term are positive in nature. But I think it's going to take a while for the spend here because of the nature of it and where it's happening to break free."

And generally, as you know, we do a lot of customized products, a lot of things that are very, very hyper specific. They don't have a lot of like just high-volume stocking orders and things like -- parts. So we're not a great company to stock a lot of material. 
That being said, I probably would point to this quarter as a higher number of that. We're just because of -- I mean our own lead times are extending, and that's an unusual occurrence. We're aggressively doing some things on price, us and everybody else. So there's -- I don't think it's a giant number for this. It just kind of can't be. But it's in there, more than we've seen before in terms of people trying to get a place in line or potentially say, hey, can I -- I'll take a risk here and so I can avoid part of the price increase. But it's a point or 2 of the company. It's not a giant part, only applies in 2. 
This distribution, you go to a lot of our distributors, you're not going to see a lot of product on the shelf, mainly because of just the model. It often needs to be customized at the last minute to some regard. We have quick lead times anyway. It doesn't add a lot of value to sit on a shelf somewhere and make that guess. 
So I guess long story short, we have probably a higher incidence of this than we typically do. But because of the nature of IDEX, it's still a really, really low number for us."

So look, we don't have a lot of CapEx intensity at IDEX, anyway. But it is a ramp-up from where we've typically been. A lot of it is attributed to the story around emerging markets for us, where we're taking very deliberate actions in both our areas of concentration in China and India to make long-term infrastructure bet over there to support a really, really, really good local-to-local capability set that we have. So there's a big driver there that, of course, doesn't reoccur all that often. 
Outside of that, a next level down in the category of doing it more than we used to would be things like factory floor automation. The technology available is pretty phenomenal today. And the cost points have come down to the point where even in our world, it makes sense from time to time to put a robot where somebody was standing for, particularly when we've got some labor availability issues and a lot of it is high technology based. So those are projects -- I think there's a graphic on the slide deck that I used, it's something that we're actually using in that area. 
That's just -- I mean, it's a great lever of operational productivity. It doesn't necessarily inflect the curve too tremendously.

It's a lot of the stimulus money and things like that comes in and tax receipts generally have been higher. So I think just overall financial condition is good. 
Your question on the infrastructure spend thing is interesting. I mean there's always a question of how long do you go from a concept to an actual project-based reality and how long that takes. Ultimately, there's different parts of IDEX where that would actually help us in a good way. I'd point to our water business is one of them. There's a lot of talk in that about water infrastructure and the criticality there. I mean one of our businesses does an awful lot of great work on sort of flow monitoring studies, which ultimately support CapEx projects. Like you have to do one to then determine what it is you're going to buy in terms of CapEx. 
So I think we're well positioned there, and there are some other pockets as well. But like always, it probably will take longer to play out and run through the system than we might imagine.

I mean our Fire & Rescue business is -- I mean, they're phenomenal businesses. We've added to them over the years. We've got a nice scalable concentration, and it's one of our most geographically dispersed business. 
You start with the premise that we've got incredible assets in that space. We've always said it was kind of a mature, steady market for us as a backdrop overall. A couple of things going on there that at least in the near term probably put it into the red zone most for us. One is that industry is even before the pandemic was struggling with output execution around chassis and trucks and things and in a couple of different geographies. Obviously, what's going on now isn't making that better. And so just backlogs on fire truck continues to be as long as it was a year ago, if not longer. So you have a little bit of a moderation effect there. 
And then on the emerging markets side, specifically China, and we definitely see -- we've seen a couple of ways now of push for localization versus -- in our case, we actually do a fair amount of imported products into that zone to complement our local brand there as well. And I don't think -- long term, that hasn't necessarily impacted us, but it does impact us from a timing perspective, tends to keep tenders captive until we sort of see how it runs out. And so that's maybe the new element on top of the existing element and basically as a pretty steady market anyways. 
I always encourage people when they think about it, this is where like what we're doing in terms of our application sets on a critical job matters. So like the discussion we had earlier about automation and the things that we're doing to change the nature of the job is the exciting element with great, well-positioned global assets on a -- you can still think of it as a mission-critical job, very steady state. Generally, it's going to be something that's supported in the long term with funding and things. But it does go through certain ebbs and flows. And right now, it's on one of the more red not green zones, but we think long term is going to be fine."

That brings together a lot of important data points, some of which are related to our hardware, some are related to others that are in that mobile platform. And you can think of it in the simplest way as this technology allows it to come off the truck. It's a way to make that happen, to make it more mobile and less truck-based."

Certainly, in terms of ours, if we just listed up the things that are on there and added up to tens of transaction prices, it's larger. It's larger, I think, largely because of the work that we're putting in as we consider things and where we could go and how we could resource it with both people internal in the company and consider the firepower that we have to deploy. So yes, I think it's safe to say there's a larger funnel by potential transaction size."

Well, I'd like to thank you all for joining and spending some time with us here today. As we said in the prepared remarks in the beginning, I mean, really, really dynamic time with a lot of variables kind of swirling around. What we talk about in our business is we get all of that, we deal with that on a day-to-day basis. But at the end, we ask people to take a deep breath, kind of come back and recognize that when a world kind of goes through what it's going through, it has a lot of problems that need to be solved. And the IDEX technologies that we have and the people that we have that drive them, they made up well with these kind of demands. 
So we've got well-positioned businesses. We've got incredible teams and talent. We're really, really focused. We're now to a phase of 80-20, where it's very, very intuitive. And we're putting that to work in what's, no doubt, a dynamic and variable environment. At the end, I think the trade winds here are very favorable. We believe very strongly in our near-term and our medium-term and ultimately the long-term prospects of the company, but recognize we kind of have to live moment to moment as we're going through this with an eye on the horizon. And I assure you that's the one that we're thinking about the most. Thanks again for joining us."
