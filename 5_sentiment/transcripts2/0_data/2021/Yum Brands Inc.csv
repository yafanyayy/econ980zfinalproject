We entered 2021 a stronger company, primed to grow, made better and more resilient by the challenges of 2020. We I'm incredibly proud of our people and the way our global system came together to navigate these challenges and offer new ways to safely and affordably serve customers. We galvanized our global systems commitment to our growth and good strategy, underpinned by a culture of collaboration across our brands, people and franchisees that we believe is unmatched and has put us on solid footing to move forward. 
In fact, to ensure this momentum on collaboration and execution continues, we recently elevated our Chief Transformation and People Officer, Tracy Skeans, to Yum! Chief Operating Officer. This promotion formalizes the role she has already been playing to drive cross-brand collaboration on people capability and customer experience imperatives that fuel same-store sales and net new unit growth. 
This underlying alignment of vision and action is an often underappreciated competitive advantage for us, and it's fundamentally central to our current and future growth. 
Across Yum!, we intensified our focus on leveraging our scale. As you're well aware, having more restaurants than any other company enhances our opportunity to create sustainable competitive advantages to fuel growth for our franchisees. This includes accelerating our deployment of digital and technology initiatives to enhance the customer experience, off-premise capabilities and unit economics across the globe. We now have over 35,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, in part driven by expanded aggregator partnerships. 
We ended 2020 on a digital sales high note, hitting a record of $17 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year. 
As I enter my second year leading Yum!, I'm more confident than ever that our customer-focused, digitally enabled brands will grow same-store sales, unit economics will support profitable development, and Yum! is well positioned to maximize value creation for years to come. 
Our recipe for growth using our 4 key growth drivers continues to guide our long-term strategy. So I'll start with an overall review of 2020 results and use a few examples to demonstrate our relevant, easy and distinctive brands, or RED for short, unmatched operating capability, and unrivaled culture and talent growth drivers. Then Chris will share more details of our Q4 results, our bold restaurant development growth driver, and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
First, 2020 results. Overall Yum! system sales declined 4%, including a 1% headwind of the lap of the 53rd week in 2019, with slightly positive net units year-over-year and a 6% same-store sales decline. COVID continued to impact the business through the end of the year, both in terms of temporary closures of restaurants and limitations on the use of dining rooms, upon which some of our markets heavily rely. This adversely impacted our core operating profit, which declined 8%, including a 1% headwind from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019. 
Now I'd like to provide some details regarding COVID-related temporary closures and the progress that we've seen. 
As of the end of the third quarter, we had about 1,100 temporarily closed units. This improved to about 1,000 as of the third quarter earnings conference call we hosted on October 29. We continued to see reopenings through the balance of the fourth quarter. But due to second wave COVID impacts, including increased government restrictions, temporary closures climbed back to about 1,000 in January, which is where we remain today. This means roughly 98% of our system is currently open in a full or limited capacity. Not surprisingly, the geographies experiencing temporary closures have evolved. And we are now seeing more closures in Europe, Canada and the Middle East, offset by some reopenings in Latin America and India. By asset format, restaurants located in malls, transportation centers, airports and the like continue to be pressured, making up many of the temporary closures. All in, the situation remains dynamic and largely dependent on local government responses to COVID. 
We've also continued to have a significant number of our open restaurants subject to dining room closures or other limitations on access. Pre-COVID-19, about 1/3 of our system sales came from the dining room. Despite the drag from these limitations, our off-premise channels, aided by digital, offset most of those lost sales and enabled our open store base to deliver same-store sales that were about flat for the fourth quarter in aggregate. 
Now let's talk about our 4 R.E.D. brands. 
Starting with the KFC division, which now accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit. Q4 system sales declined 1%, driven by a 2 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019 and a 2% same-store sales decline, partially offset by 4% net new unit growth. KFC continued to reopen temporarily closed stores, though different geographies suffered from the second wave impacts of COVID and ended Q4 with about 98% open in a full or limited capacity. 
At KFC International, same-store sales declined 4% during the quarter, an improvement from Q3. the U.K., PAC and Canada continued to show strong customer resonance and operational execution, leveraging drive through and other off-premise channels to grow sales. Importantly, the most impacted geographies from Q3, such as India, Latin America, and the Caribbean and the Middle East, started to show recovery. Across the globe, KFC continues to invest in innovation by filling gaps on their core menus or through rebundling, repackaging and reconceptualizing the core menu items. 
KFC U.S. continued to see positive same-store sales growth, delivering 8% growth in Q4, owing to continued strength in group occasions and digital. To kick off our launch with DoorDash, we had a free tenders promotion, which performed particularly well and helped digital grow to a high single-digit sales mix for the quarter. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which now accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit. The division reported a Q4 system sales decline of 6%, driven by a 3 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019, a 6% net new unit decline and a 1% same-store sales decline. During the quarter, Pizza Hut continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q4 with about 98% at least partially open in a full or limited capacity. Express units continued to be pressured, making up many of the remaining closures. 
Pizza Hut International same-store sales declined 7%. Our off-premise focused markets continued to excel, while our dine-in footprint continued to be a headwind. Our off-premise channel generated a positive 9% same-store sales growth. And we are continuing to emphasize and support the shift to off premise, both through our operations and brand strategies. Further, markets that offered abundant value to the customers helped drive strong performance in markets such as Canada and Asia. 
Pizza Hut U.S. had another stellar quarter, delivering 18% same-store sales growth in the off-premise channel, with 8% overall same-store sales growth. Our $10 tastemaker value offer continued to perform well, mixing over 20%. Just in time for the holidays, we introduced our Triple Tree Fox, a premium product with abundant value. We also partnered with Beyond to be the first major pizza chain to successfully introduce a plant-based alternative product to the market. 
A few weeks ago, Flynn Restaurant Group announced its intention to acquire NPC's approximately 950 Pizza Hut U.S. restaurants. Flynn is an existing young brands franchisee for Taco Bell that is well capitalized and brings a strong track record of operational excellence. We expect Flynn's ownership of these restaurants will make the entire Pizza Hut U.S. system stronger, and welcome Greg Flynn and his team to the Pizza Hut family. The near-term plans include modernization of a significant portion of the restaurants acquired while improving operations. 
As for Taco Bell, which now accounts for approximately 36% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales declined 3%, driven by a 5 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week. This was partially offset by 1% same-store sales growth and 1% net new unit growth. Taco Bell continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q4 with less than 50 temporary closures. 
Before delving into results, I'd like to congratulate the entire Taco Bell system for ranking #1 in the Franchise 500, beating our peers as well as impressive concepts in other industries. In the words of Entrepreneur Magazine, which produces this list, Taco Bell was recognized for a well-seasoned blend of innovative products at value prices, customers who are willing to follow the brand on wild marketing adventures and some of the most satisfied franchisees in the business. 
During the quarter, Taco Bell U.S. stayed focused on simultaneously building the brand over time and building sales overnight. First, we improved ease by expanding to additional aggregator marketplaces. Bolstered by dedicated media, these marketplaces help delivery grow to a high single-digit sales mix for the quarter. Second, we launched a loyalty program with promotions geared towards customer acquisition and adoption. All-in digital sales mix reached 12% for the quarter and about $1 billion for the full year 2020. We are very pleased with this progress on such essential components of building the brand over time. Third, we offered compelling and craveable products to drive sales overnight. The quarter began with the return of a fan favorite, the $5 Grande Stacker Box, which had a strong performance mixing at 9%. Next, we brought back the toasted Cheddar Chalupa and saw a sales mix of 10%. we then rounded out the year with the Grilled Cheese Burrito and Nachos Party pack, both having a positive sales impact. 
Now on to the Habit. Despite ending Q4 with 7% of Habit restaurants temporarily closed as well as COVID-related on-premise restrictions in California, same-store sales declined only 5%, a slight step back from the pace in late Q3. I'm pleased to say that we were able to fill much of this void through our digital ordering platform, which continued to perform well, constituting over 40% sales mix. 2 permanent new menu items were added during the quarter to keep customer engagement high, including the Habit's own Amazing Crispy Chicken Sandwich as well as Chicken Bites. 
Now on to our unmatched operating capability. 
First, at KFC U.S., with most of the sales occurring in the drive-thru, our teams have successfully adapted to better support the drive-through lanes. As a result, transaction times during the quarter improved 16 seconds from Q4 2019. 
At Pizza Hut International, we're modernizing the team member experience through the launch of Phase 1 of our in-house intelligent coaching app called Hotbot to improve shift level store performance. After launching Hotbot and other process improvements in the U.K., delivery times improved over 6 minutes and drove a 20-point improvement in customer satisfaction scores. There's lots of franchise excitement around Hotbot and 9 other markets have already rolled out the store management and coaching aid. 
Similar to KFC, Taco Bell U.S. saw a record-breaking drive through performance and with consumer demand in our drive through at an all-time high, achieved its goal of completing a full year with transaction times below 4 minutes, with the fastest quarterly average achieved in Q4. 
Next, our newest brand, the Habit Burger Grill, aggressively rolled out off-premise solutions this year, such as pop up drive-thrus and curbside pickup. Curbside in particular has continued to be well received by customers, accounting for over 10% of the total sales and about 50% of mobile orders. 
Now to our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver. With the restaurant team member in mind, we held our first ever virtual Global Ops Summit. What stood out the most to me was how the summit integrated key talent from our digital and technology teams directly into the unmatched ops agenda more than ever before. Our young digital and technology team is not solely focused on the customer experience, but the team member experience as well through a focus on building systems at scale, harmonizing platforms and leveraging an agile mindset. The goal is to unlock our pace of innovation and adoption for front and back of house platforms, which will be launched in a major market first, iterated until mature and then scaled globally. There's a lot of excitement across the globe for our newly developed technology solutions, and Chris will provide a few examples of specific platforms launching in the U.S. 
With that, Chris, over to you."

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results, our progress on our digital and tech journey, our bold restaurant development growth driver, and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, l",1377,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 
Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results, our progress on our digital and tech journey, our bold restaurant development growth driver, and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
To begin, let's discuss Q4. 
Overall Yum! system sales declined 2%, including a 3% headwind of lapping the 53rd week in 2019. This was driven by slightly positive net units year-over-year, partly offset by a 1% same-store sales decline. Core operating profit declined 9% in the quarter or a decline of 5% when excluding the lap of the 53rd week in 2019. EPS, excluding special items, was $1.15. This represented a 15% increase compared to ex special EPS of $1 in Q4 2019. 
I'll now provide some additional color on several items. 
General and administrative expenses, excluding the impact of special items, were $306 million for the fourth quarter 2020, roughly consistent with the estimate I shared on our third quarter conference call. For the full year 2020, G&A, excluding the impact of special items, represented 1.9% of consolidated system sales. We saw an opportunity to enhance our systems competitive advantage by accelerating digital and technology spending during a period when many others could not. We offset this through proactive austerity measures. However, because of 2020 sales pressures, we were temporarily above our historical framework for G&A spend as a percentage of system sales. 2020 was not representative of a fundamental change and approach or in our commitment to be an efficient growth model that leverages fixed costs. Our business model is positioned for rapid recovery once we emerge from the pandemic. And we expect our G&A ratio to move back toward our historical target as sustained growth resumes. 
In the fourth quarter, interest expense was approximately $132 million, flat compared to Q4 2019, driven by higher outstanding borrowings, offset by a decrease in rate on our floating rate debt. Our fourth quarter and 2020 ex special effective tax rates were lower than the prior year, primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance against net operating losses we now expect to utilize in a foreign jurisdiction. We are currently evaluating potential changes in taxes under the new administration in the U.S., though it's too early to provide an assessment. At this time, we believe the 21% to 23% range we provided last year remains appropriate for an effective tax rate for 2021, excluding any potential impact of special items. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds of $19 million, were $141 million for the full year 2020, including $16 million at the Habit. 
While our 2021 capital spending plans remain fluid given the macro environment, I'd like to discuss our general approach. We believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business as well as occasional opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We also anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. For 2021, we may be slightly higher than the gross CapEx amount I just mentioned. This upside relates to catch-up spend on repair, maintenance and remodels delayed owing to COVID, as well as select strategic development in the U.S., primarily for the Habit, for which refranchising proceeds may not be fully realized this year. 
As you're all aware, the global macro environment remains quite fluid owing to the impact of COVID-19, governmental actions, including stimulus packages and more. We have the utmost confidence in our teams and their ability to pivot to whatever challenges and opportunities arise. However, the environment is still unpredictable, and therefore, we will not guide to specific financial results. 
Before moving on to Bold Restaurant Development, I wanted to share some of the work we've been doing around restaurant technology to transform the customer and team member experience. 
As David mentioned, we are launching our new solutions in major markets before we scale globally. First, KFC U.S. began the national rollout of our new e-commerce platform in early 2021. This will allow KFC to take orders from our own digital platform for both pickup and third-party delivery. Second, Pizza Hut U.S. launched our omnichannel menu management system where there is one source for menu customization and pricing that can be synced across multiple digital channels. This is particularly important as we grow our delivery capability across multiple aggregator partners. And lastly, Taco Bell U.S. is the first to test a new advanced point-of-sale system, a modern tablet-based application that is completely customizable. This technology should increase accuracy, speed and reliability, as well as allow for a more intuitive team member experience optimized for each brand's specific needs. 
Moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the fourth quarter, we opened 1,024 restaurants and closed 797, including 540 closures at Pizza Hut, which placed our year-end unit count slightly ahead of the estimate I shared on our third quarter conference call. For the full year 2020, we delivered slightly positive unit growth. This includes the addition of 276 Habit restaurants in Q1 of this year, offset by COVID-related dislocations and Pizza Hut closures. I am pleased to say that despite COVID headwinds, 3 of our 4 brands achieved positive net unit growth for the year, an encouraging sign for the future. Most notably, KFC delivered 4% net unit growth, with strength in China, Russia, and Central and Eastern Europe and Thailand. Importantly, 10 out of 13 KFC markets were net unit positive in 2020, ending the year with 25,000 restaurants, an incredibly impressive milestone. This momentum gives us confidence that there is capital available when we provide strong economic models. 
In regards to Pizza Hut, units declined 6% for the year, as we continued the previously announced transition of the asset base to a healthier and more modern estate. Closures that occurred this year were largely underperforming units or units with lower AUVs. COVID has hastened the transition and the closure of casual dining based restaurants. We have more work to do, and we expect this to weigh on unit growth into this year. 
As it relates to franchisee health and appetite for development, as David alluded to earlier, we are entering 2021 from a position of strength. Unit economics are improving in many markets and many franchisees are primed to grow. During the quarter, we saw recoveries of amounts past due at KFC International, Pizza Hut U.S. and Taco Bell. These recoveries resulted in an $8 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, an improvement of $14 million compared to $6 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2019. Importantly, deferred royalties outstanding from grace periods provided during the year were less than $1 million as of the end of 2020, down from $60 million as of June 30, 2020. And our allowance for doubtful accounts is below where it was in Q4 2019 before the pandemic. 
Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. 
First, we ended Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $730 million, excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 5.2x, which is marginally above our historical target of approximately 5x. 
Second, we resumed share repurchases and repurchased 2.4 million shares totaling $250 million at an average price per share of $103. 
Third, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business; maintain a healthy balance sheet; pay a competitive dividend; and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. To that end, we are pleased to have recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by over 6% to $0.50 per share. 
After maintaining our dividend in 2020 despite the impact of COVID-19, we believe this increase conveys our confidence in the cash flow generation and growth potential of Yum!'s business model. With iconic category-leading brands and a uniquely diversified global business of over 50,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and drive healthy franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and by expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2021. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

But I guess everything has happened in the last 12 months, so why not that? 
As far as unit development, I know that's on everybody's mind, so just a couple of thoughts there. To the question of, can we regain that 4% pace? And is that in our crosshairs and our goal certainly to get to 4% and beyond? And the answer is certainly yes. There's a lot of reasons why we're confident that we will get there over time. Our business model really has gotten stronger over the last 12 months. The shift to off-premise suits us well and improves our franchisees' economics. And obviously, in our open stores, we're seeing that show up as sales. Most of our franchisees are in good shape. They're coming out of this situation with -- in good financial shape, and they're ready to grow. Certainly, it's a more favorable real estate climate. And I will point out that, in 2020, we actually opened over 2,400 growth units, so it's not as if the development pace at Yum! just disappeared. The challenge obviously was a lot of the closures, which we had for good reasons, things we've talked about over the years, wanting to close, particularly Pizza Hut restaurants, to strengthen our asset base. So we've got a lot of that behind us in 2020. And then certainly, 3 out of our 4 brands grew last year, and we had 3% growth in the global business when you exclude the Pizza Hut business. So all of those good proof points for why we can get back to 4%. 
And as far as the timing though, I know the question is when, and there's still some uncertainty on that, which is why we're not providing guidance on that number. We certainly can't be certain of the pandemic course. Since our last call, we've obviously seen flare-ups, and that have impacted our business. I'm trying to talk about that as well last night. It's a challenging environment just to build stores. And there are markets that we want to get stores open, and we're having trouble getting permits and getting the right people to construct the stores. And certainly, as we've changed our asset models, that has got our franchisees looking at making changes to the kinds of sites they pursue in some cases, the type of stores they build on those locations, all of that leads to some delays. And then certainly, we all know in the development game in retail, it takes time to build the pipeline. And the fact that our pipeline was disrupted last year, we have to rebuild it. So confident that we can get back to 4% and beyond. Still not at a point where we're going to commit to a certain time frame on that. But the mood is definitely one of confidence."

Underneath of that, can you just talk about at the enterprise level, what you're doing to support franchisees? Specifically, I guess I mean, is there a common platform by brand, for example, now globally that allows all franchisees to access that and integrating mobile, order pay, integrating delivery, integrating loyalty? Or is it even bigger than that, like across the enterprise, you've got one? Just maybe just understanding where you are and where your investments in digital specifically are going to be in '21."

Digital has been such an important part of our resilience during the pandemic. We're proud to say that we had the $17 billion in digital sales for the year, a very significant increase over the previous year. And we're just very pleased with how digital is supporting the business. And we are, as we said, investing ahead in digital. We're finding other places to manage costs to help us to continue to fund those investments. 
And to your point, what we really care about in the long-term is that we earn a return on those investments. And so that gets at how we're thinking about the digital strategy. We want to continue to have the consumer-facing and team member facing technologies be curated by the brands and be right for each individual market. The needs of a customer and the expectations for e-commerce in one market may be very different from another. So those front ends are tailored. But to your point, we are building common platforms underneath that. We don't need to replicate those common platforms multiple times. And so we gave a couple of examples earlier around how we're doing that. We mentioned that in KFC U.S., we've now introduced an internally built e-commerce platform. We'll test that in a major market like KFC U.S., and then we will take it to other brands and other markets over time. Similarly, the POS example that we used on Taco Bell. Taco Bell is the first place where we'll implement that. And then we will customize and tailor that as a platform for other markets. Both of those allow the front ends to be customized. So it's a blend of customer focus and platform underneath."

I think Yum! China talked about it yesterday on their call that they've seen sequential improvement in their dine-in business. And while it hasn't gotten back to where it was, that they've done some innovation around technology to help in dine-in and have been able to regain some of it. 
So we have 300 different combinations of brands and countries. Every one of them is a different story. As we've gone through this, what you're seeing is the markets that have a more -- that were built for off-premise are the ones that are doing better. And the ones that had more of a dine-in SKU are developing better off-premise solutions and improving their situation. But we are preparing for people reengaging with dine-in, and we have the assets that can serve it. And we still think it will be part of the business, but lesser going forward than it has been."

Obviously, the U.S. was a bright spot for us in Q4 and during the course of the year, collectively positive in both despite all of the impact from closures on same-store sales growth. So I think in each case, we're really excited about where the brands are. Pizza Hut is the one that we've talked about a lot because of the remaking their asset base and moving to more off-premise, the progress they've made on digital. One of the things that we mentioned in our comments but bears repeating is 20% of the Pizza Hut stores were in the hands of a poorly capitalized operator previously. Now with Greg Flynn entering the system, a proven commodity in the Taco Bell world, we know that that's going to provide a boost to Pizza Hut. So there's lots of reasons to be enthusiastic about Pizza Hut with their off-premise SKU and the move they've made. The numbers are pretty staggering. When you exclude the Express units, it's a 21% increase in Pizza Hut's off-premise consumption for the quarter in the U.S. So lots of excitement there. 
Taco Bell, again, getting through this with less of a family meal SKU, they had to pivot more and embrace the new needs of the consumer, and I think they've done an amazing job of that. They just put up a decent quarter. And on top of that, spent a lot of time in the quarter building up their loyalty base through programs to acquire new loyalty customers. So we think that bodes really well for the future as they -- as we -- in our language, we talk about, they really focused on building the brand over time and entering 2021 with a lot of reasons to be excited about the loyalty program, some of the product launches that we've had. You've heard the news bel bringing back potatoes, but there's a lot more to come in the world of Taco Bell. 
And then KFC, one of the exciting things about KFC in this environment is obviously, it's built for this environment. Off-premise has been good to them. We've seen a massive increase in their bucket sales in the quarter. And as we go into the year, we've talked about their new chicken sandwich coming and the rollout of that, in 20% of the stores now, but we're pleased with how that increases our mix of sandwiches and how that will play out as we get it in all of our stores. 
So across every brand, there is a reason to be excited about the future. But there's also a very uncertain environment in the U.S., as we all know, and we're remaining cautious as we move forward. 
Chris, you have a couple of things to add?"

We've been pleased with how the brands have started the year given all of the elements that David mentioned. But I will try to provide a little more context for trends that we've seen. 
So first, if we take the U.S. specifically. In the first few weeks of the quarter, across all 4 brands, our same-store sales growth in aggregate was in the mid-teens. Of course, that strength was partly bolstered by the U.S. stimulus, which appears to be waning. Internationally, the sales trends have been softer. We've seen a slight deceleration from Q4 trends, owing to the impact of regional COVID resurgences, plus the temporary closures due to COVID and local restrictions, plus restrictions on operating hours in some of the restaurants. 
If you step back and you think about this quarter in total, there's a fair bit of uncertainty that makes it a bit unpredictable. We've got many different labs, the Lunar New Year moving, plus all of the COVID impacts in various markets around the globe. But hopefully, that gives you a little more context for how the quarter has started."

So first, on gross CapEx, yes. Prior to the pandemic, we had gross CapEx around $225 million in a normal year. And so yes, with the $250 million, there is a tick-up there. It's really driven by 2 factors. One, we've now got the Habit as a part of the business, and we still have a large equity store base there. And so we will be investing in development in the Habit. And second, smaller piece is driven by the digital investments. And of course, as we mentioned, we want to have at least $50 million in refranchising proceeds, could be north of that. We obviously have more stores in the portfolio now with the acquisition of Habit. So hopefully, that explains that slight tick-up in the gross number. 
Second, in terms of payback on technology investments. Yes, our focus is earning a return on those investments over time. However, the primary way in which we earn those returns is by those investments leading to higher sales growth and higher strength in the business, which also aids net new unit growth. And that supports our franchisees. It supports us. That's the primary way in which we earn a return on those investments. 
And then your third question, around drive-through. Obviously, off-premise has been such an important shift as we've gone through the pandemic. And yes, we continue to invest in the right drive-through technology and experience in each of our markets. In some cases, that does include digital menu boards. In other markets, we might say that's not the needed investment. But in virtually all cases, we want it to be an easy, fast experience for our customers. And we continue to focus on each brand on making sure that experience is terrific and enabling it through the right technologies for the particular market."

As far as Pizza Hut type goes, David, the -- you broke out -- broke up a couple of times. I think I got the gist of your question. On the U.S. business and the brand, we're really pleased with the progress that Kevin under his leadership, but also the team that we brought in from a brand and a marketing standpoint. David Grades and George Felix have done an amazing job of reinvigorating the innovation pipeline and bringing the brand forward to consumers in a way that's really resonating. And that's why you're seeing the great results there. 
We do think, as you've seen with the launch with the Detroit style pizza more recently, we do think that there's an important role for innovation to play in that brand. And I think those guys are spot on in the way they're bringing it to life. So we're confident in the brand coming to life. As we've always talked about, the challenges are more around the asset base than it is about consumers' love for the brands or the products that we serve. 
On the international side, it's obviously a different story. The assets are in better shape, but they skew more towards dine-in. And you're seeing that shift in the asset base to off premise. Even the dine-in stores themselves are now, in many cases, offering delivery, coming up with innovative solutions to leverage technology on the dine-in experience. So I think that will continue. And yes, we will be helped on the international side when we get past the pandemic and people return to the stores. But the base model that we have at Pizza Hut, both internationally and domestically, of building a delivery carryout unit is a low-cost asset to build that usually gets very high returns, is attractive to our franchisees, and that base model and the unit economics of it bodes very well for the future of the brand internationally and domestically."

Obviously, in summary, 2020 was a challenging year across almost 3 dimension, but we feel really good about the massive progress we've made in so many ways, products we wouldn't have made without the challenges of 2020. 
I'll just end on a high note. If you didn't pick it up in the release, we opened our [ 25th 1,000th ] KFC in Q4, ended the year with 25,000 restaurants. If you look back just 5 years ago, at the end of 2015, we had less than 20,000 restaurants. KFC in 2020 opened -- had 4% net new unit growth. Even in the toughest of times, this brand is growing. It's our biggest brand. And that kind of 5,000 unit growth over a 5-year period bodes well for the future. We still only scratched the surface of penetrating the world with KFC. Probably most importantly though, 2020 was a year in which our culture and talent was a differentiating factor in getting through it as successfully as we have. And I was so proud of the way our franchisees and our employees and -- took care of our customers and our communities, partnered together to pivot the business. And we clearly have emerged stronger.

In fact, to ensure this momentum on collaboration and execution continues, we recently elevated our Chief Transformation and People Officer, Tracy Skeans, to Yum! Chief Operating Officer. This promotion formalizes the role she has already been playing to drive cross-brand collaboration on people capability and customer experience imperatives that fuel same-store sales and net new unit growth. This underlying alignment of vision and action is an often underappreciated competitive advantage for us, and it's fundamentally central to our current and future growth.  
Across Yum!, we intensified our focus on leveraging our scale. As you're well aware, having more restaurants than any other company enhances our opportunity to create sustainable competitive advantages to fuel growth for our franchisees. This includes accelerating our deployment of digital and technology initiatives to enhance the customer experience, off-premise capabilities and unit economics across the globe. 
We now have over 35,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, in part driven by expanded aggregator partnerships. We ended 2020 on a digital sales high note, hitting a record of $17 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year. As I enter my second year leading Yum!, I'm more confident than ever that our customer-focused, digitally enabled brands will grow same-store sales, unit economics will support profitable development and Yum! is well positioned to maximize value creation for years to come.  
Our Recipe for Growth using our 4 key growth drivers continues to guide our long-term strategy. So I'll start with an overall review of 2020 results and use a few examples to demonstrate our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or R.E.D. for short; Unmatched Operating Capability; and Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth drivers. Then Chris will share more details of our Q4 results, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position.  
First, 2020 results. Overall Yum! system sales declined 4%, including a 1% headwind of the lap of the 53rd week in 2019, with slightly positive net units year-over-year and a 6% same-store sales decline. COVID continued to impact the business through the end of the year both in terms of temporary closures of restaurants and limitations on the use of dining rooms, upon which some of our markets heavily rely. This adversely impacted our core operating profit, which declined 8%, including a 1% headwind from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019.  
Now I'd like to provide some details regarding COVID-related temporary closures and the progress that we've seen. As of the end of the third quarter, we had about 1,100 temporarily closed units. This improved to about 1,000 as of the third quarter earnings conference call we hosted on October 29. 
We continued to see reopenings through the balance of the fourth quarter, but due to second wave COVID impacts, including increased government restrictions, temporary closures climbed back to about 1,000 in January, which is where we remain today. This means roughly 98% of our system is currently open in a full or limited capacity. Not surprisingly, the geographies experiencing temporary closures have evolved, and we are now seeing more closures in Europe, Canada and the Middle East, offset by some reopenings in Latin America and India. By asset format, restaurants located in malls, transportation centers, airports and the like continue to be pressured, making up many of the temporary closures. All in, the situation remains dynamic and largely dependent on local government responses to COVID.  
We've also continued to have a significant number of our open restaurants subject to dining room closures or other limitations on access. Pre COVID-19, about 1/3 of our system sales came from the dining room. Despite the drag from these limitations, our off-premise channels, aided by digital, offset most of those lost sales and enabled our open store base to deliver same-store sales that were about flat for the fourth quarter in aggregate.  
Now let's talk about our 4 R.E.D. brands. Starting with the KFC division, which now accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit. Q4 system sales declined 1%, driven by a 2 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019 and a 2% same-store sales decline, partially offset by 4% net new unit growth. KFC continued to reopen temporarily closed stores, though different geographies suffered from the second wave impacts of COVID and ended Q4 with about 98% open in a full or limited capacity.  
At KFC International, same-store sales declined 4% during the quarter, an improvement from Q3. The U.K., SOPAC and Canada continued to show strong customer resonance and operational execution, leveraging drive-thru and other off-premise channels to grow sales. Importantly, the most impacted geographies from Q3, such as India, Latin America, and the Caribbean and the Middle East, started to show recovery. Across the globe, KFC continues to invest in innovation by filling gaps on their core menus or through rebundling, repackaging and reconceptualizing the core menu items.  
KFC U.S. continued to see positive same-store sales growth, delivering 8% growth in Q4, owing to continued strength in group occasions and digital. To kick off our launch with DoorDash, we had a free tenders promotion, which performed particularly well and helped digital grow to a high single-digit sales mix for the quarter.  
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which now accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit. The division reported a Q4 system sales decline of 6%, driven by a 3 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019, a 6% net new unit decline and a 1% same-store sales decline. During the quarter, Pizza Hut continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q4 with about 98% at least partially open in a full or limited capacity. Express units continued to be pressured, making up many of the remaining closures.  
Pizza Hut International same-store sales declined 7%. Our off-premise-focused markets continued to excel while our dine-in footprint continued to be a headwind. Our off-premise channel generated a positive 9% same-store sales growth, and we are continuing to emphasize and support the shift to off premise, both through our operations and brand strategies. Further, markets that offered abundant value to customers helped drive strong performance in markets such as Canada and Asia.  
Pizza Hut U.S. had another stellar quarter, delivering 18% same-store sales growth in the off-premise channel, with 8% overall same-store sales growth. Our $10 Tastemaker value offer continued to perform well, mixing over 20%. Just in time for the holidays, we introduced our Triple Treat Box, a premium product with abundant value. We also partnered with Beyond to be the first major pizza chain to successfully introduce a plant-based alternative product to the market.  
A few weeks ago, Flynn Restaurant Group announced its intention to acquire NPC's approximately 950 Pizza Hut U.S. restaurants. Flynn is an existing Yum! Brands franchisee for Taco Bell that is well capitalized and brings a strong track record of operational excellence. We expect Flynn's ownership of these restaurants will make the entire Pizza Hut U.S. system stronger and welcome Greg Flynn and his team to the Pizza Hut family. The near-term plans include modernization of a significant portion of the restaurants acquired while improving operations.  
As for Taco Bell, which now accounts for approximately 36% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales declined 3%, driven by a 5 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week. This was partially offset by 1% same-store sales growth and 1% net new unit growth. Taco Bell continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q4 with less than 50 temporary closures.  
Before delving into results, I'd like to congratulate the entire Taco Bell system for ranking #1 in the Franchise 500, beating out peers as well as impressive concepts in other industries. In the words of Entrepreneur magazine, which produces this list, Taco Bell was recognized for a well-seasoned blend of innovative products at value prices, customers who are willing to follow the brand on wild marketing adventures and some of the most satisfied franchisees in the business. 
During the quarter, Taco Bell U.S. stayed focused on simultaneously building the brand over time and building sales overnight. First, we improved ease by expanding to additional aggregator marketplaces. Bolstered by dedicated media, these marketplaces helped delivery grow to a high single-digit sales mix for the quarter. 
Second, we launched a loyalty program with promotions geared towards customer acquisition and adoption. All-in digital sales mix reached 12% for the quarter and about $1 billion for the full year 2020. We are very pleased with this progress on such essential components of building the brand over time. 
Third, we offered compelling and craveable products to drive sales overnight. The quarter began with the return of a fan favorite, the $5 Grande Stacker Box, which had a strong performance mixing at 9%. Next, we brought back the Toasted Cheddar Chalupa and saw a sales mix of 10%. We then rounded out the year with the Grilled Cheese Burrito and nachos party pack, both having a positive sales impact.  
Now on to The Habit. Despite ending Q4 with 7% of Habit restaurants temporarily closed as well as COVID-related on-premise restrictions in California, same-store sales declined only 5%, a slight step back from the pace in late Q3. I'm pleased to say that we were able to fill much of this void through our digital ordering platform, which continued to perform well, constituting over 40% sales mix. Two permanent new menu items were added during the quarter to keep customer engagement high, including The Habit's own amazing crispy chicken sandwich as well as chicken bites.  
Now on to our Unmatched Operating Capability. First, at KFC U.S., with most of the sales occurring in the drive-thru, our teams have successfully adapted to better support the drive-thru lanes. As a result, transaction times during the quarter improved 16 seconds from Q4 2019. 
At Pizza Hut International, we're modernizing the team member experience through the launch of phase 1 of our in-house intelligent coaching app called HutBot to improve shift-level store performance. After launching HutBot and other process improvements in the U.K., delivery times improved over 6 minutes and drove a 20-point improvement in customer satisfaction scores. There's lots of franchise excitement around HutBot, and 9 other markets have already rolled out this store management and coaching aid.  
Similar to KFC, Taco Bell U.S. saw a record-breaking drive-thru performance and with consumer demand in our drive-thru at an all-time high, achieved its goal of completing a full year with transaction times below 4 minutes, with the fastest quarterly average achieved in Q4. Next, our newest brand, The Habit Burger Grill, aggressively rolled out off-premise solutions this year, such as pop-up drive-thrus and curbside pickup. Curbside in particular has continued to be well received by customers, accounting for over 10% of the total sales and about 50% of mobile orders.  
Now to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. With the restaurant team member in mind, we held our first-ever virtual global ops summit. What stood out the most to me was how the summit integrated key talent from our digital and technology teams directly into the unmatched ops agenda more than ever before. 
Our Yum! digital and technology team is not solely focused on the customer experience but the team member experience as well through a focus on building systems at scale, harmonizing platforms and leveraging an agile mindset. The goal is to unlock our pace of innovation and adoption for front- and back-of-house platforms, which will be launched in a major market first, iterated until mature and then scaled globally. There's a lot of excitement across the globe for our newly developed technology solutions. And Chris will provide a few examples of specific platforms launching in the U.S.  
With that, Chris, over to you."
365997,700516432,2192079,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results, our progress on our digital and tech journey, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, let'",1373,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results, our progress on our digital and tech journey, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
To begin, let's discuss Q4. Overall Yum! system sales declined 2%, including a 3% headwind of lapping the 53rd week in 2019. This was driven by slightly positive net units year-over-year, partly offset by a 1% same-store sales decline. Core operating profit declined 9% in the quarter or a decline of 5% when excluding the lap of the 53rd week in 2019. EPS excluding special items was $1.15. This represented a 15% increase compared to ex-special EPS of $1 in Q4 2019. 
I'll now provide some additional color on several items. General and administrative expenses excluding the impact of special items were $306 million for the fourth quarter 2020, roughly consistent with the estimate I shared on our third quarter conference call. For the full year 2020, G&A excluding the impact of special items represented 1.9% of consolidated system sales. 
We saw an opportunity to enhance our system's competitive advantage by accelerating digital and technology spending during a period when many others could not. We offset this through proactive austerity measures. However, because of 2020 sales pressures, we were temporarily above our historical framework for G&A spend as a percentage of system sales. 2020 was not representative of a fundamental change in approach or in our commitment to be an efficient growth model that leverages fixed costs. Our business model is positioned for rapid recovery once we emerge from the pandemic, and we expect our G&A ratio to move back toward our historical target as sustained growth resumes. 
In the fourth quarter, interest expense was approximately $132 million, flat compared to Q4 2019, driven by higher outstanding borrowings, offset by a decrease in rate on our floating-rate debt. Our fourth quarter and 2020 ex-special effective tax rates were lower than the prior year primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance against net operating losses we now expect to utilize in a foreign jurisdiction. We are currently evaluating potential changes in taxes under the new administration in the U.S., though it's too early to provide an assessment. At this time, we believe the 21% to 23% range we provided last year remains appropriate for an effective tax rate for 2021, excluding any potential impact of special items. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds of $19 million, were $141 million for the full year 2020, including $16 million at The Habit. While our 2021 capital spending plans remain fluid given the macro environment, I'd like to discuss our general approach. We believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business as well as occasional opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We also anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. 
For 2021, we may be slightly higher than the gross CapEx amount I just mentioned. This upside relates to catch-up spend on repair, maintenance and remodels delayed, owing to COVID; as well as select strategic development in the U.S., primarily for The Habit, for which refranchising proceeds may not be fully realized this year. 
As you're all aware, the global macro environment remains quite fluid, owing to the impact of COVID-19; governmental actions, including stimulus packages; and more. We have the utmost confidence in our teams and their ability to pivot to whatever challenges and opportunities arise. However, the environment is still unpredictable, and therefore, we will not guide to specific financial results. 
Before moving on to Bold Restaurant Development, I wanted to share some of the work we've been doing around restaurant technology to transform the customer and team member experience. As David mentioned, we are launching our new solutions in major markets before we scale globally. First, KFC U.S. began the national rollout of our new e-commerce platform in early 2021. This will allow KFC to take orders from our own digital platform for both pickup and third-party delivery. 
Second, Pizza Hut U.S. launched our omnichannel menu management system where there is one source for menu customization and pricing that can be synced across multiple digital channels. This is particularly important as we grow our delivery capability across multiple aggregator partners. 
And lastly, Taco Bell U.S. is the first to test a new advanced point-of-sale system, a modern tablet-based application that is completely customizable. This technology should increase accuracy, speed and reliability as well as allow for a more intuitive team member experience optimized for each brand's specific needs. 
Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the fourth quarter, we opened 1,024 restaurants and closed 797, including 540 closures at Pizza Hut, which placed our year-end unit count slightly ahead of the estimate I shared on our third quarter conference call. For the full year 2020, we delivered slightly positive unit growth. This includes the addition of 276 Habit restaurants in Q1 of this year, offset by COVID-related dislocations and Pizza Hut closures. 
I am pleased to say that despite COVID headwinds, 3 of our 4 brands achieved positive net unit growth for the year, an encouraging sign for the future. Most notably, KFC delivered 4% net unit growth with strength in China, Russia and Central and Eastern Europe and Thailand. Importantly, 10 out of 13 KFC markets were net unit positive in 2020, ending the year with 25,000 restaurants, an incredibly impressive milestone. This momentum gives us confidence that there is capital available when we provide strong economic models. 
In regards to Pizza Hut, units declined 6% for the year as we continued the previously announced transition of the asset base to a healthier and more modern estate. Closures that occurred this year were largely underperforming units or units with lower AUVs. COVID has hastened the transition and the closure of casual-dining-based restaurants. We have more work to do, and we expect this to weigh on unit growth into this year. 
As it relates to franchisee health and appetite for development, as David alluded to earlier, we are entering 2021 from a position of strength. Unit economics are improving in many markets and many franchisees are primed to grow. During the quarter, we saw recoveries of amounts past due at KFC International, Pizza Hut U.S. and Taco Bell. These recoveries resulted in an $8 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, an improvement of $14 million compared to $6 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2019. Importantly, deferred royalties outstanding from grace periods provided during the year were less than $1 million as of the end of 2020, down from $60 million as of June 30, 2020, and our allowance for doubtful accounts is below where it was in Q4 2019 before the pandemic. 
Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $730 million, excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 5.2x, which is marginally above our historical target of approximately 5x. Second, we resumed share repurchases and repurchased 2.4 million shares totaling $250 million at an average price per share of $103. 
Third, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. To that end, we are pleased to have recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by over 6% to $0.50 per share. After maintaining our dividend in 2020 despite the impact of COVID-19, we believe this increase conveys our confidence in the cash flow generation and growth potential of Yum!'s business model. 
With iconic category-leading brands and a uniquely diversified global business of over 50,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and drive healthy franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and by expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2021. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

But I guess everything's happened in the last 12 months, so why not that? 
As far as unit development, I know that's on everybody's mind, so just a couple of thoughts there. To the question of can we regain that 4% pace and is that in our crosshairs and our goal, certainly, to get to 4% and beyond, and the answer is certainly yes. There's a lot of reasons why we're confident that we will get there over time. 
Our business model really has gotten stronger over the last 12 months. The shift to off-premise suits us well and improves our franchisees' economics. And obviously, in our open stores, we're seeing that show up as sales. 
Most of our franchisees are in good shape. They're coming out of this situation with -- in good financial shape and they're ready to grow. Certainly, it's a more favorable real estate climate. And I will point out that in 2020, we actually opened over 2,400 gross units, so it's not as if the development pace at Yum! just disappeared. 
The challenge obviously was a lot of the closures, which we had for good reasons, things we've talked about over the years, wanting to close particularly Pizza Hut restaurants to strengthen our asset base. So we've got a lot of that behind us in 2020. And then certainly, 3 out of our 4 brands grew last year, and we had 3% growth in the global business when you exclude the Pizza Hut business. So all of those, good proof points for why we can get back to 4%. 
As far as the timing though, I know the question is when, and there's still some uncertainty on that, which is why we're not providing guidance on that number. We certainly can't be certain of the pandemic course. Since our last call, we've obviously seen flare-ups, and that have impacted our business. I'm trying to talk about that as well last night. 
It's a challenging environment just to build stores. And there are markets that we want to get stores open and we're having trouble getting permits and getting the right people to construct the stores. And certainly, as we've changed our asset models, that has got our franchisees looking at making changes to the kinds of sites they pursue in some cases, the type of stores they build on those locations. All of that leads to some delays. 
And then, certainly, we all know, in the development game in retail, it takes time to build the pipeline. And the fact that our pipeline was disrupted last year, we have to rebuild it. So confident that we can get back to 4% and beyond. Still not at a point where we're going to commit to a certain time frame on that, but the mood is definitely one of confidence."

Digital has been such an important part of our resilience during the pandemic. We're proud to say that we had the $17 billion in digital sales for the year. It's a very significant increase over the previous year, and we're just very pleased with how digital is supporting the business. 
And we are, as we said, investing ahead in digital. We're finding other places to manage costs to help us to continue to fund those investments. And to your point, what we really care about in the long term is that we earn a return on those investments. And so that gets at how we're thinking about the digital strategy. 
We want to continue to have the consumer-facing and team-member-facing technologies be curated by the brands and be right for each individual market. The needs of a customer and the expectations for e-commerce in one market may be very different from another. So those front ends are tailored. 
But to your point, we are building common platforms underneath that. We don't need to replicate those common platforms multiple times. And so we gave a couple of examples earlier around how we're doing that. We mentioned that in KFC U.S., we've now introduced an internally built e-commerce platform. We'll test that in a major market like KFC U.S., and then we'll take it to other brands and other markets over time. 
Similarly, the POS example that we used on Taco Bell. Taco Bell is the first place where we'll implement that, and then we will customize and tailor that as a platform for other markets. Both of those allow the front ends to be customized. So it's a blend of customer focus and platform underneath."

So we have 300 different combinations of brands and countries. Every one of them is a different story. As we've gone through this, what you're seeing is the markets that have a more -- that were built for off-premise are the ones that are doing better and the ones that had more of a dine-in skew are developing better off-premise solutions and improving their situation. But we are preparing for people reengaging with dine-in, and we have the assets that can serve it. And we still think it will be part of the business but lesser going forward than it has been."

So it's always a blend, and we're always constantly reevaluating each of those aspects. But I gave a couple of examples a moment ago of ones where we've clearly said we need to have a differentiated proprietary platform on e-commerce and POS as a couple of examples that are so strategically important to the business."

Obviously, the U.S. was a bright spot for us in Q4 and during the course of the year, collectively positive in both, despite all of the impact from closures on same-store sales growth. So I think in each case, we're really excited about where the brands are. 
Pizza Hut is the one that we've talked about a lot because of the remaking their asset base and moving to more off-premise, the progress they've made on digital. One of the things that we mentioned in our comments but bears repeating is 20% of the Pizza Hut stores were in the hands of a poorly capitalized operator previously. Now with Greg Flynn entering the system, a proven commodity in the Taco Bell world, we know that that's going to provide a boost to Pizza Hut. 
So there's lots of reasons to be enthusiastic about Pizza Hut with their off-premise skew and the move they've made. The numbers are pretty staggering. When you exclude the Express units, it's a 21% increase in Pizza Hut's off-premise consumption for the quarter in the U.S. So lots of excitement there. 
Taco Bell, again, getting through this with less of a family meal skew, they had to pivot more and embrace the new needs of the consumer, and I think they've done an amazing job of that. They just put up a decent quarter and on top of that, spent a lot of time in the quarter building up their loyalty base through programs to acquire new loyalty customers. So we think that bodes really well for the future as they -- as we -- in our language, we talk about they really focused on building the brand over time and entering 2021 with a lot of reasons to be excited about the loyalty program, some of the product launches that we've had. You've heard the news about bringing back potatoes, but there's a lot more to come in the world of Taco Bell. 
And then KFC, one of the exciting things about KFC in this environment is, obviously, it's built for this environment. Off-premise has been good to them. We've seen a massive increase in their bucket sales in the quarter. And as we go into the year, we've talked about their new chicken sandwich coming and the rollout of that. That's in 20% of the stores now, but we're pleased with how that increases our mix of sandwiches and how that will play out as we get it in all of our stores. 
So across every brand, there is a reason to be excited about the future. But there's also a very uncertain environment in the U.S., as we all know, and we're remaining cautious as we move forward. 
Chris, a couple of things to add?"

We've been pleased with how the brands have started the year given all of the elements that David mentioned. But I will try to provide a little more context for trends that we've seen. 
So first, if we take the U.S. specifically. In the first few weeks of the quarter, across all 4 brands, our same-store sales growth in aggregate was in the mid-teens. Of course, that strength was partly bolstered by the U.S. stimulus, which appears to be waning. 
Internationally, the sales trends have been softer. We've seen a slight deceleration from Q4 trends, owing to the impact of regional COVID resurgences plus the temporary closures due to COVID and local restrictions plus restrictions on operating hours in some of the restaurants. 
If you step back and you think about this quarter in total, there's a fair bit of uncertainty that makes it a bit unpredictable. We've got many different laps, the Lunar New Year moving plus all of the COVID impacts in various markets around the globe. But hopefully, that gives you a little more context for how the quarter has started."

So first, on gross CapEx, yes, prior to the pandemic, we had gross CapEx of around $225 million in a normal year. And so yes, with the $250 million, there is a tick-up there. It's really driven by 2 factors. 
One, we've now got The Habit as a part of the business, and we still have a large equity store base there. And so we will be investing in development in The Habit. And second, a smaller piece is driven by the digital investments. And of course, as we mentioned, we want to have at least $50 million in refranchising proceeds. It could be north of that. We obviously have more stores in the portfolio now with the acquisition of Habit. So hopefully, that explains that slight tick-up in the gross number. 
Second, in terms of payback on technology investments, yes, our focus is earning a return on those investments over time. However, the primary way in which we earn those returns is by those investments leading to higher sales growth and higher strength in the business, which also aids net new unit growth. And that supports our franchisees, it supports us. That's the primary way in which we earn a return on those investments. 
And then your third question around drive-thru. Obviously, off-premise has been such an important shift as we've gone through the pandemic. And yes, we continue in -- to invest in the right drive-thru technology and experience in each of our markets. 
In some cases, that does include digital menu boards. In other markets, we might say that's not the needed investment. But in virtually all cases, we want it to be an easy, fast experience for our customers, and we continue to focus on each brand on making sure that experience is terrific and enabling it through the right technologies for the particular market."

I think I got the gist of your question. 
On the U.S. business and the brand, we're really pleased with the progress that Kevin, under his leadership but also the team that we brought in from a brand and a marketing standpoint. David Graves and George Felix have done an amazing job of reinvigorating the innovation pipeline and bringing the brand forward to consumers in a way that's really resonating. And that's why you're seeing the great results there. 
We do think, as you've seen with the launch with the Detroit-style pizza more recently, we do think that there's an important role for innovation to play in that brand. And I think those guys are spot on in the way they're bringing it to life. So we're confident in the brand coming to life. As we've always talked about, the challenges are more around the asset base than it is about consumers' love for the brands or the products that we serve. 
On the international side, it's obviously a different story. The assets are in better shape. But they skew more towards dine-in, and you're seeing that shift in the asset base to off-premise. Even the dine-in stores themselves are now, in many cases, offering delivery, coming up with innovative solutions to leverage technology on the dine-in experience. So I think that will continue. 
And yes, we will be helped on the international side when we get past the pandemic and people return to the stores. But the base model that we have at Pizza Hut, both internationally and domestically, of building a delivery/carryout unit is a low-cost asset to build that usually gets very high returns, is attractive to our franchisees. And that base model and the unit economics of it bodes very well for the future of the brand internationally and domestically."

I'll just end on a high note. If you didn't pick it up in the release, we opened our 25,000th KFC in Q4, ended the year with 25,000 restaurants. If you look back just 5 years ago, at the end of 2015, we had less than 20,000 restaurants. 
KFC in 2020 opened -- had 4% net new unit growth. Even in the toughest of times, this brand is growing. It's our biggest brand, and that kind of 5,000 unit growth over a 5-year period bodes well for the future. We still only scratched the surface of penetrating the world with KFC. 
Probably most importantly though, 2020 was a year in which our culture and talent was a differentiating factor in getting through it as successfully as we have.

We entered 2021 as stronger company, primed to grow, made better and more resilient by the challenges of 2020.

We entered 2021 as stronger company, primed to grow, made better and more resilient by the challenges of 2020. I'm incredibly proud of our people and the way our global system came together to navigate these challenges and offer new ways to safely and affordably serve customers. We galvanized our global system's commitment to our growth and good strategy, underpinned by a culture of collaboration across our brands, people and franchisees that we believe is unmatched and has put us on solid footing to move forward. 
In fact, to ensure this momentum on collaboration and execution continues, we recently elevated our Chief Transformation and People Officer, Tracy Skeans, to Yum! Chief Operating Officer. This promotion formalizes the role she has already been playing to drive cross-brand collaboration on people capability and customer experience imperatives that fuel same-store sales and net new unit growth. This underlying alignment of vision and action is an often underappreciated competitive advantage for us, and it's fundamentally central to our current and future growth. 
Across Yum!, we intensified our focus on leveraging our scale. As you're well aware, having more restaurants than any other company enhances our opportunity to create sustainable competitive advantages to fuel growth for our franchisees. This includes accelerating our deployment of digital and technology initiatives to enhance the customer experience, off-premise capabilities and unit economics across the globe. 
We now have over 35,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, in part driven by expanded aggregator partnerships. We ended 2020 on a digital sales high note, hitting a record of $17 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year. As I enter my second year leading Yum!, I'm more confident than ever that our customer-focused, digitally enabled brands will grow same-store sales, unit economics will support profitable development and Yum! is well positioned to maximize value creation for years to come. 
Our Recipe for Growth using our 4 key growth drivers continues to guide our long-term strategy. So I'll start with an overall review of 2020 results and use a few examples to demonstrate our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or R.E.D. for short; Unmatched Operating Capability; and Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth drivers. Then Chris will share more details of our Q4 results, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
First, 2020 results. Overall Yum! system sales declined 4%, including a 1% headwind of the lap of the 53rd week in 2019, with slightly positive net units year-over-year and a 6% same-store sales decline. COVID continued to impact the business through the end of the year both in terms of temporary closures of restaurants and limitations on the use of dining rooms, upon which some of our markets heavily rely. This adversely impacted our core operating profit, which declined 8%, including a 1% headwind from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019. 
Now I'd like to provide some details regarding COVID-related temporary closures and the progress that we've seen. As of the end of the third quarter, we had about 1,100 temporarily closed units. This improved to about 1,000 as of the third quarter earnings conference call we hosted on October 29. We continued to see reopenings through the balance of the fourth quarter, but due to second wave COVID impacts, including increased government restrictions, temporary closures climbed back to about 1,000 in January, which is where we remain today. This means roughly 98% of our system is currently open in a full or limited capacity. Not surprisingly, the geographies experiencing temporary closures have evolved, and we are now seeing more closures in Europe, Canada and the Middle East, offset by some reopenings in Latin America and India. 
By asset format, restaurants located in malls, transportation centers, airports and the like continue to be pressured, making up many of the temporary closures. All in, the situation remains dynamic and largely dependent on local government responses to COVID. We've also continued to have a significant number of our open restaurants subject to dining room closures or other limitations on access. Pre-COVID-19, about 1/3 of our system sales came from the dining room. Despite the drag from these limitations, our off-premise channels, aided by digital, offset most of those lost sales and enabled our open store base to deliver same-store sales that were about flat for the fourth quarter in aggregate. 
Now let's talk about our 4 R.E.D. brands. Starting with the KFC division, which now accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit. Q4 system sales declined 1%, driven by a 2 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019 and a 2% same-store sales decline, partially offset by 4% net new unit growth. KFC continued to reopen temporarily closed stores, though different geographies suffered from the second wave impacts of COVID and ended Q4 with about 98% open in a full or limited capacity. 
At KFC International, same-store sales declined 4% during the quarter, an improvement from Q3. The U.K., SOPAC and Canada continued to show strong customer resonance and operational execution, leveraging drive-thru and other off-premise channels to grow sales. Importantly, the most impacted geographies from Q3, such as India, Latin America, and the Caribbean and the Middle East, started to show recovery. Across the globe, KFC continues to invest in innovation by filling gaps on their core menus or through rebundling, repackaging and reconceptualizing the core menu items. 
KFC U.S. continued to see positive same-store sales growth, delivering 8% growth in Q4, owing to continued strength in group occasions and digital. To kick off our launch with DoorDash, we had a free tenders promotion, which performed particularly well and helped digital grow to a high single-digit sales mix for the quarter. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which now accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit. The division reported a Q4 system sales decline of 6%, driven by a 3 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019, a 6% net new unit decline and a 1% same-store sales decline. During the quarter, Pizza Hut continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q4 with about 98% at least partially open in a full or limited capacity. Express units continued to be pressured, making up many of the remaining closures. 
Pizza Hut International same-store sales declined 7%. Our off-premise-focused markets continued to excel while our dine-in footprint continued to be a headwind. Our off-premise channel generated a positive 9% same-store sales growth, and we are continuing to emphasize and support the shift to off premise, both through our operations and brand strategies. Further, markets that offered abundant value to customers helped drive strong performance in markets such as Canada and Asia. 
Pizza Hut U.S. had another stellar quarter, delivering 18% same-store sales growth in the off-premise channel, with 8% overall same-store sales growth. Our $10 Tastemaker value offer continued to perform well, mixing over 20%. Just in time for the holidays, we introduced our Triple Treat Box, a premium product with abundant value. We also partnered with Beyond to be the first major pizza chain to successfully introduce a plant-based alternative product to the market. 
A few weeks ago, Flynn Restaurant Group announced its intention to acquire NPC's approximately 950 Pizza Hut U.S. restaurants. Flynn is an existing Yum! Brands franchisee for Taco Bell that is well capitalized and brings a strong track record of operational excellence. We expect Flynn's ownership of these restaurants will make the entire Pizza Hut U.S. system stronger and welcome Greg Flynn and his team to the Pizza Hut family. The near-term plans include modernization of a significant portion of the restaurants acquired while improving operations. 
As for Taco Bell, which now accounts for approximately 36% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales declined 3%, driven by a 5 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week. This was partially offset by 1% same-store sales growth and 1% net new unit growth. Taco Bell continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q4 with less than 50 temporary closures. 
Before delving into results, I'd like to congratulate the entire Taco Bell system for ranking #1 in the Franchise 500, beating out peers as well as impressive concepts in other industries. In the words of Entrepreneur magazine, which produces this list, Taco Bell was recognized for a well-seasoned blend of innovative products at value prices, customers who are willing to follow the brand on wild marketing adventures and some of the most satisfied franchisees in the business. 
During the quarter, Taco Bell U.S. stayed focused on simultaneously building the brand over time and building sales overnight. First, we improved ease by expanding to additional aggregator marketplaces. Bolstered by dedicated media, these marketplaces helped delivery grow to a high single-digit sales mix for the quarter. 
Second, we launched a loyalty program with promotions geared towards customer acquisition and adoption. All-in digital sales mix reached 12% for the quarter and about $1 billion for the full year 2020. We are very pleased with this progress on such essential components of building the brand over time. 
Third, we offered compelling and craveable products to drive sales overnight. The quarter began with the return of a fan favorite, the $5 Grande Stacker Box, which had a strong performance mixing at 9%. Next, we brought back the Toasted Cheddar Chalupa and saw a sales mix of 10%. We then rounded out the year with the Grilled Cheese Burrito and nachos party pack, both having a positive sales impact. 
Now on to The Habit. Despite ending Q4 with 7% of Habit restaurants temporarily closed as well as COVID-related on-premise restrictions in California, same-store sales declined only 5%, a slight step back from the pace in late Q3. I'm pleased to say that we were able to fill much of this void through our digital ordering platform, which continued to perform well, constituting over 40% sales mix. Two permanent new menu items were added during the quarter to keep customer engagement high, including The Habit's own amazing crispy chicken sandwich as well as chicken bites. 
Now on to our Unmatched Operating Capability. First, at KFC U.S., with most of the sales occurring in the drive-thru, our teams have successfully adapted to better support the drive-thru lanes. As a result, transaction times during the quarter improved 16 seconds from Q4 2019. 
At Pizza Hut International, we're modernizing the team member experience through the launch of Phase 1 of our in-house intelligent coaching app called HutBot to improve shift-level store performance. After launching HutBot and other process improvements in the U.K., delivery times improved over 6 minutes and drove a 20-point improvement in customer satisfaction scores. There's lots of franchise excitement around HutBot, and 9 other markets have already rolled out this store management and coaching aid. 
Similar to KFC, Taco Bell U.S. saw a record-breaking drive-thru performance and with consumer demand in our drive-thru at an all-time high, achieved its goal of completing a full year with transaction times below 4 minutes, with the fastest quarterly average achieved in Q4. 
Next, our newest brand, The Habit Burger Grill, aggressively rolled out off-premise solutions this year, such as pop-up drive-thrus and curbside pickup. Curbside in particular has continued to be well received by customers, accounting for over 10% of the total sales and about 50% of mobile orders. 
Now to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. With the restaurant team member in mind, we held our first-ever virtual global ops summit. What stood out the most to me was how the summit integrated key talent from our digital and technology teams directly into the unmatched ops agenda more than ever before. 
Our Yum! digital and technology team is not solely focused on the customer experience but the team member experience as well through a focus on building systems at scale, harmonizing platforms and leveraging an agile mindset. The goal is to unlock our pace of innovation and adoption for front and back-of-house platforms, which will be launched in a major market first, iterated until mature and then scaled globally. There is a lot of excitement across the globe for our newly developed technology solutions, and Chris will provide a few examples of specific platforms launching in the U.S. 
With that, Chris, over to you."
365997,700516432,2192084,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results, our progress on our digital and tech journey, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, let'",1375,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results, our progress on our digital and tech journey, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
To begin, let's discuss Q4. Overall, Yum! system sales declined 2%, including a 3% headwind of lapping the 53rd week in 2019. This was driven by slightly positive net units year-over-year, partly offset by a 1% same-store sales decline. Core operating profit declined 9% in the quarter or a decline of 5% when excluding the lap of the 53rd week in 2019. EPS excluding special items was $1.15. This represented a 15% increase compared to ex special EPS of $1 in Q4 2019. 
I'll now provide some additional color on several items. General and administrative expenses excluding the impact of special items were $306 million for the fourth quarter 2020, roughly consistent with the estimate I shared on our third quarter conference call. For the full year 2020, G&A excluding the impact of special items represented 1.9% of consolidated system sales. 
We saw an opportunity to enhance our system's competitive advantage by accelerating digital and technology spending during a period when many others could not. We offset this through proactive austerity measures. However, because of 2020 sales pressures, we were temporarily above our historical framework for G&A spend as a percentage of system sales. 2020 was not representative of a fundamental change in approach or in our commitment to be an efficient growth model that leverages fixed costs. Our business model is positioned for rapid recovery once we emerge from the pandemic, and we expect our G&A ratio to move back toward our historical target as sustained growth resumes. 
In the fourth quarter, interest expense was approximately $132 million, flat compared to Q4 2019, driven by higher outstanding borrowings, offset by a decrease in rate on our floating-rate debt. Our fourth quarter and 2020 ex special effective tax rates were lower than the prior year, primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance against net operating losses we now expect to utilize in a foreign jurisdiction. We are currently evaluating potential changes in taxes under the new administration in the U.S., though it's too early to provide an assessment. At this time, we believe the 21% to 23% range we provided last year remains appropriate for an effective tax rate for 2021, excluding any potential impact of special items. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds of $19 million, were $141 million for the full year 2020, including $16 million at The Habit. While our 2021 capital spending plans remain fluid given the macro environment, I'd like to discuss our general approach. We believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business as well as occasional opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We also anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. 
For 2021, we may be slightly higher than the gross CapEx amount I just mentioned. This upside relates to catch-up spend on repair, maintenance and remodels delayed, owing to COVID as well as select strategic development in the U.S., primarily for The Habit, for which refranchising proceeds may not be fully realized this year. 
As you're all aware, the global macro environment remains quite fluid, owing to the impact of COVID-19; governmental actions, including stimulus packages; and more. We have the utmost confidence in our teams and their ability to pivot to whatever challenges and opportunities arise. However, the environment is still unpredictable, and therefore, we will not guide to specific financial results. 
Before moving on to Bold Restaurant Development, I wanted to share some of the work we've been doing around restaurant technology to transform the customer and team member experience. As David mentioned, we are launching our new solutions in major markets before we scale globally. First, KFC U.S. began the national rollout of our new e-commerce platform in early 2021. This will allow KFC to take orders from our own digital platform for both pickup and third-party delivery. 
Second, Pizza Hut U.S. launched our omnichannel menu management system where there is one source for menu customization and pricing that can be synced across multiple digital channels. This is particularly important as we grow our delivery capability across multiple aggregator partners. 
And lastly, Taco Bell U.S. is the first to test a new advanced point-of-sale system, a modern tablet-based application that is completely customizable. This technology should increase accuracy, speed and reliability as well as allow for a more intuitive team member experience optimized for each brand's specific needs. 
Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the fourth quarter, we opened 1,024 restaurants and closed 797, including 540 closures at Pizza Hut, which placed our year-end unit count slightly ahead of the estimate I shared on our third quarter conference call. For the full year 2020, we delivered slightly positive unit growth. This includes the addition of 276 Habit restaurants in Q1 of this year, offset by COVID-related dislocations and Pizza Hut closures. 
I am pleased to say that despite COVID headwinds, 3 of our 4 brands achieved positive net unit growth for the year, an encouraging sign for the future. Most notably, KFC delivered 4% net unit growth with strength in China, Russia and Central and Eastern Europe and Thailand. Importantly, 10 out of 13 KFC markets were net unit positive in 2020, ending the year with 25,000 restaurants, an incredibly impressive milestone. This momentum gives us confidence that there is capital available when we provide strong economic models. 
In regards to Pizza Hut, units declined 6% for the year as we continued the previously announced transition of the asset base to a healthier and more modern estate. Closures that occurred this year were largely underperforming units or units with lower AUVs. COVID has hastened the transition and the closure of casual-dining-based restaurants. We have more work to do, and we expect this to weigh on unit growth into this year. 
As it relates to franchisee health and appetite for development, as David alluded to earlier, we are entering 2021 from a position of strength. Unit economics are improving in many markets and many franchisees are primed to grow. During the quarter, we saw recoveries of amounts past due at KFC International, Pizza Hut U.S. and Taco Bell. These recoveries resulted in an $8 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, an improvement of $14 million compared to $6 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2019. Importantly, deferred royalties outstanding from grace periods provided during the year were less than $1 million as of the end of 2020, down from $60 million as of June 30, 2020, and our allowance for doubtful accounts is below where it was in Q4 2019 before the pandemic. 
Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $730 million, excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 5.2x, which is marginally above our historical target of approximately 5x. Second, we resumed share repurchases and repurchased 2.4 million shares totaling $250 million at an average price per share of $103. 
Third, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. To that end, we are pleased to have recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by over 6% to $0.50 per share. After maintaining our dividend in 2020, despite the impact of COVID-19, we believe this increase conveys our confidence in the cash flow generation and growth potential of Yum!'s business model. 
With iconic category-leading brands and a uniquely diversified global business of over 50,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and drive healthy franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and by expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2021. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

That's a first for us on an earnings call, but I guess everything's happened in the last 12 months, so why not that? 
As far as unit development, I know that's on everybody's mind, so just a couple of thoughts there. To the question of can we regain that 4% pace and is that in our crosshairs and our goal, certainly, to get to 4% and beyond, and the answer is certainly yes. There's a lot of reasons why we're confident that we will get there over time. Our business model really has gotten stronger over the last 12 months. The shift to off-premise suits us well and improves our franchisees' economics. And obviously, in our open stores, we're seeing that show up as sales. 
Most of our franchisees are in good shape. They're coming out of this situation with -- in good financial shape and they're ready to grow. Certainly, it's a more favorable real estate climate. And I will point out that in 2020, we actually opened over 2,400 gross units, so it's not as if the development pace at Yum! just disappeared. The challenge obviously was a lot of the closures, which we had for good reasons, things we've talked about over the years, wanting to close particularly Pizza Hut restaurants to strengthen our asset base. So we've got a lot of that behind us in 2020. And then certainly, 3 out of our 4 brands grew last year, and we had 3% growth in the global business when you exclude the Pizza Hut business. So all of those, good proof points for why we can get back to 4%. 
As far as the timing though, I know the question is when, and there's still some uncertainty on that, which is why we're not providing guidance on that number. We certainly can't be certain of the pandemic course. Since our last call, we've obviously seen flare-ups and -- that have impacted our business. Yum China talked about that as well last night. It's a challenging environment just to build stores. And there are markets that we want to get stores open and we're having trouble getting permits and getting the right people to construct the stores. 
And certainly, as we've changed our asset models, that has got our franchisees looking at making changes to the kinds of sites they pursue in some cases, the type of stores they build on those locations. All of that leads to some delays. And then, certainly, we all know, in the development game in retail, it takes time to build the pipeline. And the fact that our pipeline was disrupted last year, we have to rebuild it. So confident that we can get back to 4% and beyond. Still not at a point where we're going to commit to a certain time frame on that, but the mood is definitely one of confidence."

We're proud to say that we had the $17 billion in digital sales for the year.

We're finding other places to manage costs to help us to continue to fund those investments. And to your point, what we really care about in the long term is that we earn a return on those investments. And so that gets at how we're thinking about the digital strategy. 
We want to continue to have the consumer facing and team member facing technologies be curated by the brands and be right for each individual market. The needs of a customer and the expectations for e-commerce in one market may be very different from another. So those front ends are tailored. But to your point, we are building common platforms underneath that. We don't need to replicate those common platforms multiple times. And so we gave a couple of examples earlier around how we're doing that. We mentioned that in KFC U.S. We've now introduced an internally built e-commerce platform. We'll test that in a major market like KFC U.S., and then we'll take it to other brands and other markets over time. 
Similarly, the POS example that we used on Taco Bell. Taco Bell is the first place where we'll implement that, and then we will customize and tailor that as a platform for other markets. Both of those allow the front ends to be customized. So it's a blend of customer focus and platform underneath."

So we have 300 different combinations of brands and countries. Every one of them is a different story. As we've gone through this, what you're seeing is the markets that have a more -- that were built for off-premise are the ones that are doing better and the ones that had more of a dine-in skew are developing better off-premise solutions and improving their situation.

Obviously, the U.S. was a bright spot for us in Q4 and during the course of the year, collectively positive in both, despite all of the impact from closures on same-store sales growth. So I think in each case, we're really excited about where the brands are. Pizza Hut is the one that we've talked about a lot because of the remaking their asset base, moving to more off-premise, the progress they've made on digital. One of the things that we mentioned in our comments but bears repeating is 20% of the Pizza Hut stores were in the hands of a poorly capitalized operator previously. Now with Greg Flynn entering the system, a proven commodity in the Taco Bell world, we know that that's going to provide a boost to Pizza Hut. So there's lots of reasons to be enthusiastic about Pizza Hut with their off-premise skew and the move they've made. The numbers are pretty staggering. When you exclude the Express units, it's a 21% increase in Pizza Hut's off-premise consumption for the quarter in the U.S. So lots of excitement there. 
Taco Bell, again, getting through this with less of a family meal skew, they had to pivot more and embrace the new needs of the consumer, and I think they've done an amazing job of that. They just put up a decent quarter and on top of that, spent a lot of time in the quarter building up their loyalty base through programs to acquire new loyalty customers. So we think that bodes really well for the future as they -- as we -- in our language, we talk about they really focused on building the brand over time and entering 2021 with a lot of reasons to be excited about the loyalty program, some of the product launches that we've had. You've heard the news about bringing back potatoes, but there's a lot more to come in the world of Taco Bell. 
And then KFC, one of the exciting things about KFC in this environment is, obviously, it's built for this environment. Off-premise has been good to them. We've seen a massive increase in their bucket sales in the quarter. And as we go into the year, we've talked about their new chicken sandwich coming and the rollout of that in 20% of the stores now, but we're pleased with how that increases our mix of sandwiches and how that will play out as we get it in all of our stores. So across every brand, there is a reason to be excited about the future. But there's also a very uncertain environment in the U.S., as we all know, and we're remaining cautious as we move forward. 
Chris, a couple of things to add?"

We've been pleased with how the brands have started the year given all of the elements that David mentioned. But I will try to provide a little more context for trends that we've seen. So first, if we take the U.S. specifically. In the first few weeks of the quarter, across all 4 brands, our same-store sales growth in aggregate was in the mid-teens. Of course, that strength was partly bolstered by the U.S. stimulus, which appears to be waning. 
Internationally, the sales trends have been softer. We've seen a slight deceleration from Q4 trends, owing to the impact of regional COVID resurgences plus the temporary closures due to COVID and local restrictions plus restrictions on operating hours in some of the restaurants. If you step back and you think about this quarter in total, there's a fair bit of uncertainty that makes it a bit unpredictable. We've got many different laps, the Lunar New Year moving plus all of the COVID impacts in various markets around the globe. But hopefully, that gives you a little more context for how the quarter has started."

The way it's gotten through this environment, pivoted to off-premise, the technology that they've deployed, the quality of their operations, there's a lot of reasons why you would be excited going forward. With Habit, we've seen a lot of interest from the franchise community in becoming Habit franchisees. We're going slow in that regard to make sure we do it exactly right. But that's a brand that I think is also poised for a lot of exciting things in 2021."

So first, on gross CapEx, yes, prior to the pandemic, we had gross CapEx around $225 million in a normal year. And so yes, with the $250 million, there is a tick-up there. It's really driven by 2 factors. One, we've now got The Habit as a part of the business, and we still have a large equity store base there. And so we will be investing in development in The Habit. And second, a smaller piece is driven by the digital investments. And of course, as we mentioned, we want to have at least $50 million in refranchising proceeds. It could be north of that. We obviously have more stores in the portfolio now with the acquisition of Habit. So hopefully, that explains that slight tick-up in the gross number. 
Second, in terms of payback on technology investments, yes, our focus is earning a return on those investments over time. However, the primary way in which we earn those returns is by those investments leading to higher sales growth and higher strength in the business, which also aids net new unit growth. And that supports our franchisees, it supports us. That's the primary way in which we earn a return on those investments. 
And then your third question around drive-thru. Obviously, off-premise has been such an important shift as we've gone through the pandemic. And yes, we continue in -- to invest in the right drive-thru technology and experience in each of our markets. In some cases, that does include digital menu boards. In other markets, we might say that's not the needed investment. But in virtually all cases, we want it to be an easy, fast experience for our customers, and we continue to focus on each brand on making sure that experience is terrific and enabling it through the right technologies for the particular market."

I think I got the gist of your question. On the U.S. business and the brand, we're really pleased with the progress that Kevin, under his leadership but also the team that we brought in from a brand and a marketing standpoint. David Graves and George Felix have done an amazing job of reinvigorating the innovation pipeline and bringing the brand forward to consumers in a way that's really resonating. And that's why you're seeing the great results there. 
We do think, as you've seen with the launch with the Detroit-style pizza more recently, we do think that there's an important role for innovation to play in that brand. And I think those guys are spot on the way to bringing it to life. So we're confident in the brand coming to life. As we've always talked about, the challenges are more around the asset base than it is about consumers' loves for the brands or the products that we serve. 
On the international side, it's obviously a different story. The assets are in better shape. But they skew more towards dine-in, and you're seeing that shift in the asset base to off-premise. Even the dine-in stores themselves are now, in many cases, offering delivery, coming up with innovative solutions to leverage technology on the dine-in experience. So I think that will continue. 
And yes, we will be helped on the international side when we get past the pandemic and people return to the stores. But the base model that we have at Pizza Hut, both internationally and domestically, of building a delivery/carryout unit is a low-cost asset to build that usually gets very high returns, is attractive to our franchisees. And that base model and the unit economics of it bodes very well for the future of the brand internationally and domestically."

I'll just end on a high note. If you didn't pick it up in the release, we opened our 25,000th KFC in Q4, ended the year with 25,000 restaurants. If you look back just 5 years ago, at the end of 2015, we had less than 20,000 restaurants. 
KFC in 2020 opened -- had 4% net new unit growth. Even in the toughest of times, this brand is growing. It's our biggest brand, and that kind of 5,000 unit growth over a 5-year period bodes well for the future. We still only scratch the surface of penetrating the world with KFC. 
Probably most importantly though, 2020 was a year in which our culture and talent was a differentiating factor in getting through it as successfully as we have. And I was so proud of the way our franchisees and our employees and -- took care of our customers and our communities, partnered together to pivot the business. And we clearly have emerged stronger, and there's a lot of enthusiasm and excitement around the world about the growth ahead of us. Thank you for your time."

We entered 2021 as stronger company, primed to grow, made better and more resilient by the challenges of 2020. I'm incredibly proud of our people and the way our global system came together to navigate these challenges and offer new ways to safely and affordably serve customers. We galvanized our global system's commitment to our growth and good strategy, underpinned by a culture of collaboration across our brands, people and franchisees that we believe is unmatched and has put us on solid footing to move forward. 
In fact, to ensure this momentum on collaboration and execution continues, we recently elevated our Chief Transformation and People Officer, Tracy Skeans, to Yum! Chief Operating Officer. This promotion formalizes the role she has already been playing to drive cross-brand collaboration on people capability and customer experience imperatives that fuel same-store sales and net new unit growth. This underlying alignment of vision and action is an often underappreciated competitive advantage for us, and it's fundamentally central to our current and future growth. 
Across Yum!, we intensified our focus on leveraging our scale. As you're well aware, having more restaurants than any other company enhances our opportunity to create sustainable competitive advantages to fuel growth for our franchisees. This includes accelerating our deployment of digital and technology initiatives to enhance the customer experience, off-premise capabilities and unit economics across the globe. 
We now have over 35,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, in part driven by expanded aggregator partnerships. We ended 2020 on a digital sales high note, hitting a record of $17 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year. As I enter my second year leading Yum!, I'm more confident than ever that our customer-focused, digitally enabled brands will grow same-store sales, unit economics will support profitable development and Yum! is well positioned to maximize value creation for years to come. 
Our Recipe for Growth using our 4 key growth drivers continues to guide our long-term strategy. So I'll start with an overall review of 2020 results and use a few examples to demonstrate our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or R.E.D. for short; Unmatched Operating Capability; and Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth drivers. Then Chris will share more details of our Q4 results, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
First, 2020 results. Overall Yum! system sales declined 4%, including a 1% headwind of the lap of the 53rd week in 2019, with slightly positive net units year-over-year and a 6% same-store sales decline. COVID continued to impact the business through the end of the year both in terms of temporary closures of restaurants and limitations on the use of dining rooms, upon which some of our markets heavily rely. This adversely impacted our core operating profit, which declined 8%, including a 1% headwind from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019. 
Now I'd like to provide some details regarding COVID-related temporary closures and the progress that we've seen. As of the end of the third quarter, we had about 1,100 temporarily closed units. This improved to about 1,000 as of the third quarter earnings conference call we hosted on October 29. We continued to see reopenings through the balance of the fourth quarter, but due to second wave COVID impacts, including increased government restrictions, temporary closures climbed back to about 1,000 in January, which is where we remain today. This means roughly 98% of our system is currently open in a full or limited capacity. Not surprisingly, the geographies experiencing temporary closures have evolved, and we are now seeing more closures in Europe, Canada and the Middle East, offset by some reopenings in Latin America and India. 
By asset format, restaurants located in malls, transportation centers, airports and the like continue to be pressured, making up many of the temporary closures. All in, the situation remains dynamic and largely dependent on local government responses to COVID. We've also continued to have a significant number of our open restaurants subject to dining room closures or other limitations on access. Pre-COVID-19, about 1/3 of our system sales came from the dining room. Despite the drag from these limitations, our off-premise channels, aided by digital, offset most of those lost sales and enabled our open store base to deliver same-store sales that were about flat for the fourth quarter in aggregate. 
Now let's talk about our 4 R.E.D. brands. Starting with the KFC division, which now accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit. Q4 system sales declined 1%, driven by a 2 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019 and a 2% same-store sales decline, partially offset by 4% net new unit growth. KFC continued to reopen temporarily closed stores, though different geographies suffered from the second wave impacts of COVID and ended Q4 with about 98% open in a full or limited capacity. 
At KFC International, same-store sales declined 4% during the quarter, an improvement from Q3. The U.K., SOPAC and Canada continued to show strong customer resonance and operational execution, leveraging drive-thru and other off-premise channels to grow sales. Importantly, the most impacted geographies from Q3, such as India, Latin America, and the Caribbean and the Middle East, started to show recovery. Across the globe, KFC continues to invest in innovation by filling gaps on their core menus or through rebundling, repackaging and reconceptualizing the core menu items. 
KFC U.S. continued to see positive same-store sales growth, delivering 8% growth in Q4, owing to continued strength in group occasions and digital. To kick off our launch with DoorDash, we had a free tenders promotion, which performed particularly well and helped digital grow to a high single-digit sales mix for the quarter. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which now accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit. The division reported a Q4 system sales decline of 6%, driven by a 3 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019, a 6% net new unit decline and a 1% same-store sales decline. During the quarter, Pizza Hut continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q4 with about 98% at least partially open in a full or limited capacity. Express units continued to be pressured, making up many of the remaining closures. 
Pizza Hut International same-store sales declined 7%. Our off-premise-focused markets continued to excel while our dine-in footprint continued to be a headwind. Our off-premise channel generated a positive 9% same-store sales growth, and we are continuing to emphasize and support the shift to off premise, both through our operations and brand strategies. Further, markets that offered abundant value to customers helped drive strong performance in markets such as Canada and Asia. 
Pizza Hut U.S. had another stellar quarter, delivering 18% same-store sales growth in the off-premise channel, with 8% overall same-store sales growth. Our $10 Tastemaker value offer continued to perform well, mixing over 20%. Just in time for the holidays, we introduced our Triple Treat Box, a premium product with abundant value. We also partnered with Beyond to be the first major pizza chain to successfully introduce a plant-based alternative product to the market. 
A few weeks ago, Flynn Restaurant Group announced its intention to acquire NPC's approximately 950 Pizza Hut U.S. restaurants. Flynn is an existing Yum! Brands franchisee for Taco Bell that is well capitalized and brings a strong track record of operational excellence. We expect Flynn's ownership of these restaurants will make the entire Pizza Hut U.S. system stronger and welcome Greg Flynn and his team to the Pizza Hut family. The near-term plans include modernization of a significant portion of the restaurants acquired while improving operations. 
As for Taco Bell, which now accounts for approximately 36% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales declined 3%, driven by a 5 percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week. This was partially offset by 1% same-store sales growth and 1% net new unit growth. Taco Bell continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q4 with less than 50 temporary closures. 
Before delving into results, I'd like to congratulate the entire Taco Bell system for ranking #1 in the Franchise 500, beating out peers as well as impressive concepts in other industries. In the words of Entrepreneur magazine, which produces this list, Taco Bell was recognized for a well-seasoned blend of innovative products at value prices, customers who are willing to follow the brand on wild marketing adventures and some of the most satisfied franchisees in the business. 
During the quarter, Taco Bell U.S. stayed focused on simultaneously building the brand over time and building sales overnight. First, we improved ease by expanding to additional aggregator marketplaces. Bolstered by dedicated media, these marketplaces helped delivery grow to a high single-digit sales mix for the quarter. 
Second, we launched a loyalty program with promotions geared towards customer acquisition and adoption. All-in digital sales mix reached 12% for the quarter and about $1 billion for the full year 2020. We are very pleased with this progress on such essential components of building the brand over time. 
Third, we offered compelling and craveable products to drive sales overnight. The quarter began with the return of a fan favorite, the $5 Grande Stacker Box, which had a strong performance mixing at 9%. Next, we brought back the Toasted Cheddar Chalupa and saw a sales mix of 10%. We then rounded out the year with the Grilled Cheese Burrito and nachos party pack, both having a positive sales impact. 
Now on to The Habit. Despite ending Q4 with 7% of Habit restaurants temporarily closed as well as COVID-related on-premise restrictions in California, same-store sales declined only 5%, a slight step back from the pace in late Q3. I'm pleased to say that we were able to fill much of this void through our digital ordering platform, which continued to perform well, constituting over 40% sales mix. Two permanent new menu items were added during the quarter to keep customer engagement high, including The Habit's own amazing crispy chicken sandwich as well as chicken bites. 
Now on to our Unmatched Operating Capability. First, at KFC U.S., with most of the sales occurring in the drive-thru, our teams have successfully adapted to better support the drive-thru lanes. As a result, transaction times during the quarter improved 16 seconds from Q4 2019. 
At Pizza Hut International, we're modernizing the team member experience through the launch of Phase 1 of our in-house intelligent coaching app called HutBot to improve shift-level store performance. After launching HutBot and other process improvements in the U.K., delivery times improved over 6 minutes and drove a 20-point improvement in customer satisfaction scores. There's lots of franchise excitement around HutBot, and 9 other markets have already rolled out this store management and coaching aid. 
Similar to KFC, Taco Bell U.S. saw a record-breaking drive-thru performance and with consumer demand in our drive-thru at an all-time high, achieved its goal of completing a full year with transaction times below 4 minutes, with the fastest quarterly average achieved in Q4. 
Next, our newest brand, The Habit Burger Grill, aggressively rolled out off-premise solutions this year, such as pop-up drive-thrus and curbside pickup. Curbside in particular has continued to be well received by customers, accounting for over 10% of the total sales and about 50% of mobile orders. 
Now to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. With the restaurant team member in mind, we held our first-ever virtual global ops summit. What stood out the most to me was how the summit integrated key talent from our digital and technology teams directly into the unmatched ops agenda more than ever before. 
Our Yum! digital and technology team is not solely focused on the customer experience but the team member experience as well through a focus on building systems at scale, harmonizing platforms and leveraging an agile mindset. The goal is to unlock our pace of innovation and adoption for front and back-of-house platforms, which will be launched in a major market first, iterated until mature and then scaled globally. There is a lot of excitement across the globe for our newly developed technology solutions, and Chris will provide a few examples of specific platforms launching in the U.S. 
With that, Chris, over to you."

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results, our progress on our digital and tech journey, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, let'",1375,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results, our progress on our digital and tech journey, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
To begin, let's discuss Q4. Overall, Yum! system sales declined 2%, including a 3% headwind of lapping the 53rd week in 2019. This was driven by slightly positive net units year-over-year, partly offset by a 1% same-store sales decline. Core operating profit declined 9% in the quarter or a decline of 5% when excluding the lap of the 53rd week in 2019. EPS excluding special items was $1.15. This represented a 15% increase compared to ex special EPS of $1 in Q4 2019. 
I'll now provide some additional color on several items. General and administrative expenses excluding the impact of special items were $306 million for the fourth quarter 2020, roughly consistent with the estimate I shared on our third quarter conference call. For the full year 2020, G&A excluding the impact of special items represented 1.9% of consolidated system sales. 
We saw an opportunity to enhance our system's competitive advantage by accelerating digital and technology spending during a period when many others could not. We offset this through proactive austerity measures. However, because of 2020 sales pressures, we were temporarily above our historical framework for G&A spend as a percentage of system sales. 2020 was not representative of a fundamental change in approach or in our commitment to be an efficient growth model that leverages fixed costs. Our business model is positioned for rapid recovery once we emerge from the pandemic, and we expect our G&A ratio to move back toward our historical target as sustained growth resumes. 
In the fourth quarter, interest expense was approximately $132 million, flat compared to Q4 2019, driven by higher outstanding borrowings, offset by a decrease in rate on our floating-rate debt. Our fourth quarter and 2020 ex special effective tax rates were lower than the prior year, primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance against net operating losses we now expect to utilize in a foreign jurisdiction. We are currently evaluating potential changes in taxes under the new administration in the U.S., though it's too early to provide an assessment. At this time, we believe the 21% to 23% range we provided last year remains appropriate for an effective tax rate for 2021, excluding any potential impact of special items. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds of $19 million, were $141 million for the full year 2020, including $16 million at The Habit. While our 2021 capital spending plans remain fluid given the macro environment, I'd like to discuss our general approach. We believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business as well as occasional opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We also anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. 
For 2021, we may be slightly higher than the gross CapEx amount I just mentioned. This upside relates to catch-up spend on repair, maintenance and remodels delayed, owing to COVID as well as select strategic development in the U.S., primarily for The Habit, for which refranchising proceeds may not be fully realized this year. 
As you're all aware, the global macro environment remains quite fluid, owing to the impact of COVID-19; governmental actions, including stimulus packages; and more. We have the utmost confidence in our teams and their ability to pivot to whatever challenges and opportunities arise. However, the environment is still unpredictable, and therefore, we will not guide to specific financial results. 
Before moving on to Bold Restaurant Development, I wanted to share some of the work we've been doing around restaurant technology to transform the customer and team member experience. As David mentioned, we are launching our new solutions in major markets before we scale globally. First, KFC U.S. began the national rollout of our new e-commerce platform in early 2021. This will allow KFC to take orders from our own digital platform for both pickup and third-party delivery. 
Second, Pizza Hut U.S. launched our omnichannel menu management system where there is one source for menu customization and pricing that can be synced across multiple digital channels. This is particularly important as we grow our delivery capability across multiple aggregator partners. 
And lastly, Taco Bell U.S. is the first to test a new advanced point-of-sale system, a modern tablet-based application that is completely customizable. This technology should increase accuracy, speed and reliability as well as allow for a more intuitive team member experience optimized for each brand's specific needs. 
Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the fourth quarter, we opened 1,024 restaurants and closed 797, including 540 closures at Pizza Hut, which placed our year-end unit count slightly ahead of the estimate I shared on our third quarter conference call. For the full year 2020, we delivered slightly positive unit growth. This includes the addition of 276 Habit restaurants in Q1 of this year, offset by COVID-related dislocations and Pizza Hut closures. 
I am pleased to say that despite COVID headwinds, 3 of our 4 brands achieved positive net unit growth for the year, an encouraging sign for the future. Most notably, KFC delivered 4% net unit growth with strength in China, Russia and Central and Eastern Europe and Thailand. Importantly, 10 out of 13 KFC markets were net unit positive in 2020, ending the year with 25,000 restaurants, an incredibly impressive milestone. This momentum gives us confidence that there is capital available when we provide strong economic models. 
In regards to Pizza Hut, units declined 6% for the year as we continued the previously announced transition of the asset base to a healthier and more modern estate. Closures that occurred this year were largely underperforming units or units with lower AUVs. COVID has hastened the transition and the closure of casual-dining-based restaurants. We have more work to do, and we expect this to weigh on unit growth into this year. 
As it relates to franchisee health and appetite for development, as David alluded to earlier, we are entering 2021 from a position of strength. Unit economics are improving in many markets and many franchisees are primed to grow. During the quarter, we saw recoveries of amounts past due at KFC International, Pizza Hut U.S. and Taco Bell. These recoveries resulted in an $8 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, an improvement of $14 million compared to $6 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2019. Importantly, deferred royalties outstanding from grace periods provided during the year were less than $1 million as of the end of 2020, down from $60 million as of June 30, 2020, and our allowance for doubtful accounts is below where it was in Q4 2019 before the pandemic. 
Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $730 million, excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 5.2x, which is marginally above our historical target of approximately 5x. Second, we resumed share repurchases and repurchased 2.4 million shares totaling $250 million at an average price per share of $103. 
Third, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. To that end, we are pleased to have recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by over 6% to $0.50 per share. After maintaining our dividend in 2020, despite the impact of COVID-19, we believe this increase conveys our confidence in the cash flow generation and growth potential of Yum!'s business model. 
With iconic category-leading brands and a uniquely diversified global business of over 50,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and drive healthy franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and by expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2021. 
Now the team and I are happy to take your questions."

That's a first for us on an earnings call, but I guess everything's happened in the last 12 months, so why not that? 
As far as unit development, I know that's on everybody's mind, so just a couple of thoughts there. To the question of can we regain that 4% pace and is that in our crosshairs and our goal, certainly, to get to 4% and beyond, and the answer is certainly yes. There's a lot of reasons why we're confident that we will get there over time. Our business model really has gotten stronger over the last 12 months. The shift to off-premise suits us well and improves our franchisees' economics. And obviously, in our open stores, we're seeing that show up as sales. 
Most of our franchisees are in good shape. They're coming out of this situation with -- in good financial shape and they're ready to grow. Certainly, it's a more favorable real estate climate. And I will point out that in 2020, we actually opened over 2,400 gross units, so it's not as if the development pace at Yum! just disappeared. The challenge obviously was a lot of the closures, which we had for good reasons, things we've talked about over the years, wanting to close particularly Pizza Hut restaurants to strengthen our asset base. So we've got a lot of that behind us in 2020. And then certainly, 3 out of our 4 brands grew last year, and we had 3% growth in the global business when you exclude the Pizza Hut business. So all of those, good proof points for why we can get back to 4%. 
As far as the timing though, I know the question is when, and there's still some uncertainty on that, which is why we're not providing guidance on that number. We certainly can't be certain of the pandemic course. Since our last call, we've obviously seen flare-ups and -- that have impacted our business. Yum China talked about that as well last night. It's a challenging environment just to build stores. And there are markets that we want to get stores open and we're having trouble getting permits and getting the right people to construct the stores. 
And certainly, as we've changed our asset models, that has got our franchisees looking at making changes to the kinds of sites they pursue in some cases, the type of stores they build on those locations. All of that leads to some delays. And then, certainly, we all know, in the development game in retail, it takes time to build the pipeline. And the fact that our pipeline was disrupted last year, we have to rebuild it. So confident that we can get back to 4% and beyond. Still not at a point where we're going to commit to a certain time frame on that, but the mood is definitely one of confidence."

We're proud to say that we had the $17 billion in digital sales for the year. Very significant increase over the previous year, and we're just very pleased with how digital is supporting the business. And we are, as we said, investing ahead in digital. We're finding other places to manage costs to help us to continue to fund those investments. And to your point, what we really care about in the long term is that we earn a return on those investments. And so that gets at how we're thinking about the digital strategy. 
We want to continue to have the consumer facing and team member facing technologies be curated by the brands and be right for each individual market. The needs of a customer and the expectations for e-commerce in one market may be very different from another. So those front ends are tailored. But to your point, we are building common platforms underneath that. We don't need to replicate those common platforms multiple times. And so we gave a couple of examples earlier around how we're doing that. We mentioned that in KFC U.S. We've now introduced an internally built e-commerce platform. We'll test that in a major market like KFC U.S., and then we'll take it to other brands and other markets over time. 
Similarly, the POS example that we used on Taco Bell. Taco Bell is the first place where we'll implement that, and then we will customize and tailor that as a platform for other markets. Both of those allow the front ends to be customized. So it's a blend of customer focus and platform underneath."

So we have 300 different combinations of brands and countries. Every one of them is a different story. As we've gone through this, what you're seeing is the markets that have a more -- that were built for off-premise are the ones that are doing better and the ones that had more of a dine-in skew are developing better off-premise solutions and improving their situation.

Obviously, the U.S. was a bright spot for us in Q4 and during the course of the year, collectively positive in both, despite all of the impact from closures on same-store sales growth. So I think in each case, we're really excited about where the brands are. Pizza Hut is the one that we've talked about a lot because of the remaking their asset base, moving to more off-premise, the progress they've made on digital. One of the things that we mentioned in our comments but bears repeating is 20% of the Pizza Hut stores were in the hands of a poorly capitalized operator previously. Now with Greg Flynn entering the system, a proven commodity in the Taco Bell world, we know that that's going to provide a boost to Pizza Hut. So there's lots of reasons to be enthusiastic about Pizza Hut with their off-premise skew and the move they've made. The numbers are pretty staggering. When you exclude the Express units, it's a 21% increase in Pizza Hut's off-premise consumption for the quarter in the U.S. So lots of excitement there. 
Taco Bell, again, getting through this with less of a family meal skew, they had to pivot more and embrace the new needs of the consumer, and I think they've done an amazing job of that. They just put up a decent quarter and on top of that, spent a lot of time in the quarter building up their loyalty base through programs to acquire new loyalty customers. So we think that bodes really well for the future as they -- as we -- in our language, we talk about they really focused on building the brand over time and entering 2021 with a lot of reasons to be excited about the loyalty program, some of the product launches that we've had. You've heard the news about bringing back potatoes, but there's a lot more to come in the world of Taco Bell. 
And then KFC, one of the exciting things about KFC in this environment is, obviously, it's built for this environment. Off-premise has been good to them. We've seen a massive increase in their bucket sales in the quarter. And as we go into the year, we've talked about their new chicken sandwich coming and the rollout of that in 20% of the stores now, but we're pleased with how that increases our mix of sandwiches and how that will play out as we get it in all of our stores. So across every brand, there is a reason to be excited about the future. But there's also a very uncertain environment in the U.S., as we all know, and we're remaining cautious as we move forward.

So first, if we take the U.S. specifically. In the first few weeks of the quarter, across all 4 brands, our same-store sales growth in aggregate was in the mid-teens. Of course, that strength was partly bolstered by the U.S. stimulus, which appears to be waning. 
Internationally, the sales trends have been softer. We've seen a slight deceleration from Q4 trends, owing to the impact of regional COVID resurgences plus the temporary closures due to COVID and local restrictions plus restrictions on operating hours in some of the restaurants. If you step back and you think about this quarter in total, there's a fair bit of uncertainty that makes it a bit unpredictable.

So first, on gross CapEx, yes, prior to the pandemic, we had gross CapEx around $225 million in a normal year. And so yes, with the $250 million, there is a tick-up there. It's really driven by 2 factors. One, we've now got The Habit as a part of the business, and we still have a large equity store base there. And so we will be investing in development in The Habit. And second, a smaller piece is driven by the digital investments. And of course, as we mentioned, we want to have at least $50 million in refranchising proceeds. It could be north of that. We obviously have more stores in the portfolio now with the acquisition of Habit. So hopefully, that explains that slight tick-up in the gross number. 
Second, in terms of payback on technology investments, yes, our focus is earning a return on those investments over time. However, the primary way in which we earn those returns is by those investments leading to higher sales growth and higher strength in the business, which also aids net new unit growth. And that supports our franchisees, it supports us. That's the primary way in which we earn a return on those investments. 
And then your third question around drive-thru. Obviously, off-premise has been such an important shift as we've gone through the pandemic. And yes, we continue in -- to invest in the right drive-thru technology and experience in each of our markets. In some cases, that does include digital menu boards. In other markets, we might say that's not the needed investment. But in virtually all cases, we want it to be an easy, fast experience for our customers, and we continue to focus on each brand on making sure that experience is terrific and enabling it through the right technologies for the particular market."

I think I got the gist of your question. On the U.S. business and the brand, we're really pleased with the progress that Kevin, under his leadership but also the team that we brought in from a brand and a marketing standpoint. David Graves and George Felix have done an amazing job of reinvigorating the innovation pipeline and bringing the brand forward to consumers in a way that's really resonating. And that's why you're seeing the great results there. 
We do think, as you've seen with the launch with the Detroit-style pizza more recently, we do think that there's an important role for innovation to play in that brand. And I think those guys are spot on the way to bringing it to life. So we're confident in the brand coming to life. As we've always talked about, the challenges are more around the asset base than it is about consumers' loves for the brands or the products that we serve. 
On the international side, it's obviously a different story. The assets are in better shape. But they skew more towards dine-in, and you're seeing that shift in the asset base to off-premise. Even the dine-in stores themselves are now, in many cases, offering delivery, coming up with innovative solutions to leverage technology on the dine-in experience. So I think that will continue. 
And yes, we will be helped on the international side when we get past the pandemic and people return to the stores. But the base model that we have at Pizza Hut, both internationally and domestically, of building a delivery/carryout unit is a low-cost asset to build that usually gets very high returns, is attractive to our franchisees. And that base model and the unit economics of it bodes very well for the future of the brand internationally and domestically."

I'll just end on a high note. If you didn't pick it up in the release, we opened our 25,000th KFC in Q4, ended the year with 25,000 restaurants. If you look back just 5 years ago, at the end of 2015, we had less than 20,000 restaurants. 
KFC in 2020 opened -- had 4% net new unit growth. Even in the toughest of times, this brand is growing. It's our biggest brand, and that kind of 5,000 unit growth over a 5-year period bodes well for the future. We still only scratch the surface of penetrating the world with KFC. 
Probably most importantly though, 2020 was a year in which our culture and talent was a differentiating factor in getting through it as successfully as we have. And I was so proud of the way our franchisees and our employees and -- took care of our customers and our communities, partnered together to pivot the business. And we clearly have emerged stronger, and there's a lot of enthusiasm and excitement around the world about the growth ahead of us. Thank you for your time."

We've had a strong start to 2021 with solid same-store sales results on a 2-year basis and a meaningful uplift in unit development. This performance is a testament to the incredible focus and dedication of our restaurant teams, franchisees and of our store leaders around the world who are rising above the challenges presented by the pandemic to unlock new areas of growth such as digital and off-premise, while putting the needs of our customers and local communities first. I've always believed that our success will come from leaning into our core strengths and building new capabilities that enhance our ability to grow. And the way our business has navigated through COVID-19 has only reinforced this belief. This mindset is reflected in our Recipe for Growth and Good framework, which has successfully guided our strategy and will continue to serve as our north star. Our recipe highlights our unique strength as a company, notably, our iconic brands, our unmatched global scale, our diversified network of highly capable and well-capitalized franchisees and our unparalleled culture and talent.
Today, we'll discuss our Q1 performance through the lens of this framework and the growth drivers that underpin it, and we'll highlight the specific areas where we've introduced new capabilities as we look toward the future. I'll cover 2 growth drivers, namely, relevant, easy and distinctive brands, or R.E.D., for short; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then Chris will share more details of our Q1 results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position.
I'll start with a few first quarter highlights. In Q1, Yum! system sales grew 11%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and the addition of 435 net new units during the quarter. Importantly, same-store sales grew 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of nearly 900 or about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q1 2021. This was driven by strong sales performance in North America, the U.K., Australia and Japan, with some offset from COVID-related trading restrictions in parts of Asia and Europe. Notably, all 4 of our brands had a weekly per restaurant sales record in the U.S. at least once during the quarter. And I'm very encouraged that on a 2-year basis our overall same-store sales in the U.S. increased 10%. Importantly, each of our brands experienced positive 2-year same-store sales growth on a global basis in open and operating stores during Q1. This is a great indicator for the strength and breadth of our recovery.
The key focus point for our teams was the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, all geared towards providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands. Delivery has been a significant part of this strategy, and we now have over 39,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, driven by expanded aggregator partnerships and continued investment in our own branded channels. We had another record digital system sales quarter with over $5 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year.
Now let's talk about our 4 brands, starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit. Q1 system sales grew 11%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. For the division, Q1 same-store sales were flat on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Globally, KFC's digital sales mix reached a record of 43% during the quarter, driven by the rapid expansion of delivery, click and collect and the introduction of new channel ordering options. At KFC International, same-store sales grew 7% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 '21. We continue to see strength in the U.K., Australia, Canada and Japan during the quarter and saw encouraging results in the Middle East, Mexico and Africa. Each of these markets performed well above their 2019 sales levels, owing to their off-premise capabilities, digital strength and impressive product launches like the Share Box in Japan and the Chicken Nights promotion in Mexico. Next, at KFC U.S., we continue to see positive same-store sales, with 14% growth in Q1. Importantly, same-store sales grew 11% on a 2-year basis, thanks to all the team's hard work in building additional sales channels and growing the core business while adding hyper-relevant product innovation such as the new Chicken Sandwich. Our sandwich is performing at more than twice the volumes of our prior U.S. sandwich launches. And all initial indications are that it's highly incremental. Customers are loving the product and coming back more frequently for it. In fact, as we've entered Q2, demand for the new sandwich has been so strong that, coupled with general tightening in domestic chicken supply, our main challenge has been keeping up with that demand.
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit. The division reported Q1 system sales growth of 7%, driven by 12% same-store sales growth and a 4% unit decline. Global Q1 same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Overall, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 8%. Same-store sales declined 7% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 10% same-store sales growth for the quarter. Similar to KFC, our developed markets with high off-premise capabilities, digital strength and newsworthy products continue to perform well.
Pizza Hut U.S. had another stellar quarter, delivering 23% same-store sales growth in the off-premise channel, with 16% overall same-store sales growth. Overall same-store sales grew 8% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021 and was driven by a combination of compelling value with the $10 Tastemaker offer and category-leading innovation with the launch of the unique Detroit Style Pizza and the reboot of our iconic Stuffed Crust Pizza.
As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 36% of our divisional operating profit, Q1 system sales grew 11%, driven by a 9% same-store sales growth and 1% unit growth. For the division, Q1 same-store sales grew 10% on a 2-year basis. The quarter kicked off with the return of Nacho Fries, this time offered in the $5 Nacho Fries Box. We also introduced our first digital-led product launch with the $5 Build Your Own Cravings Box available exclusively on the Taco Bell app or web, which drove a meaningful increase in loyalty memberships during the quarter.
And finally, our newest brand, The Habit Burger Grill, delivered 13% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth during the quarter. Q1 same-store sales grew 3% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores that were temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. We introduced our new Patty Melt, and our sales growth was aided by reduced government restrictions and government stimulus. Encouragingly, digital sales continued to mix above 40%, even as dining rooms reopened, and we saw a steady improvement in the dine-in channel throughout the quarter.
On to the Recipe for Growth, starting with R.E.D. brands. Having 4 brands across more than 50,000 restaurants provides us with an enviable platform to understand how consumers are behaving in every corner of the world and to use that understanding to capture future growth in our sales overnight and our brands over time. In some cases, this means strengthening our ability to grow sales at a faster pace and bringing in strong diverse tech talent. It's with this in mind that we were excited to close on 2 strategic acquisitions during the quarter, being Kvantum, Inc. and Tictuk Technologies. Kvantum is a true innovator in marketing optimization with a proven track record of adding significant value with enabling data-driven decisions to drive return on advertising dollars and sales increases. We have seen material improvements in both marketing spend efficiencies and same-store sales growth in our Pizza Hut U.K. off-premise and Pizza Hut Taiwan businesses as a result of leveraging their toolkit. And at the end of last year, both Taco Bell U.S. and KFC U.S. engaged Kvantum services on marketing calendar and mix optimization. Tictuk presents an exciting opportunity to expand access by providing frictionless ordering through text, social media and other conversational channels in literally just a few clicks. We've deployed their platform in approximately 900 KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants across 35 countries outside of the U.S. and have been thrilled with the agility and customer obsession of the Tictuk team. In fact, we have several examples of customers completing orders on the Tictuk platform in under 10 seconds, a truly seamless experience.
Beyond their proven capabilities, what excites me most about these acquisitions is the high-quality, culturally aligned teams we've brought into our global organization. This is a perfect segue to our Unrivaled Culture & Talent growth driver. Given the environment we've been operating in, we've had to find new ways to connect with the people across our vast global business. One way we've done this is through virtual market visits, where we virtually walk through a restaurant and connect with team members. The leadership team and I attended 4 virtual market visits during the quarter in Pizza Hut Japan, KFC Asia, Taco Bell U.S. in Times Square and KFC Africa. We each left those meetings energized and proud of how our brands are represented around the world and the incredible people that make it all happen.
Here, I also want to highlight 2 key actions we are taking to bring our Recipe for Growth and Good to life. On the equity and inclusion front in the U.S., we are taking tangible actions to represent the diverse communities where we operate by increasing Black and Latin employees and leaders in our corporate and restaurant management roles. As part of this effort, we're proud to partner with OneTen, a coalition of leading companies coming together to upskill, hire and advance 1 million Black individuals in America over the next 10 years. These actions advance our global Unlocking Opportunity Initiative in the U.S., and we are looking forward to working alongside the community of companies in OneTen as well as our franchisees to advance equity and opportunity.
Finally, as part of our broader strategy to address climate change, earlier this week, we announced our pledge to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 with a science-based target to reduce emissions by nearly 50% across our supply chain and restaurants by 2030, in partnership with our franchisees, suppliers and producers. This is an incredibly important issue to us, our customers and other stakeholders. And I'm proud of our continued progress in this space.
To wrap up, I'm encouraged by the momentum in our business as we execute our Recipe for Growth and Good to set ourselves up for the next chapter of growth. Although COVID continues to impact many geographies and make our overall path to recovery uneven, I believe that, with our iconic brands, world-class talent, inclusive culture and healthy franchise system, we are poised to enter a post-COVID world even stronger.
With that, Chris, over to you."
365997,708799233,2260345,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position.To begin, let's discuss Q1",1298,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position.
To begin, let's discuss Q1. As David mentioned, overall Yum! system sales grew 11%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 1% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 2%, which includes the negative impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q1 2021. EPS, excluding special items, was $1.07, representing a 67% increase compared to ex special EPS of $0.64 in Q1 2020. Core operating profit grew 33% in the first quarter. This performance is attributable to a stellar same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable.
I'll now provide some additional color on several items. Starting with Taco Bell, we had another impressive quarter of profitability, where company restaurant margins were 24.1%, representing a 1.7% increase over prior year. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, we expect these margins to return closer to historical levels later this year as check averages normalize, dining room patronage increases and we adjust staffing levels at our restaurants as a result.
During Q1, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due at KFC International and Pizza Hut U.S. These recoveries resulted in a $6 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $34 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $28 million of expense in Q1 2020. While we ended 2020 with $12 million of full year bad debt expense, we had large quarterly swings last year due to COVID. As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to continue to be impacted as we lap bad debt expense of $13 million in Q2 and bad debt recovery of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. While difficult to forecast, at this point, we don't expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full year basis.
Most importantly, our franchisees are generally on solid financial ground despite the uncertainties caused by COVID. We recently completed the restructuring of our largest Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee in D.C. that resulted in Flynn Restaurant Group joining the Pizza Hut family. We believe our franchisees are well positioned to partner with us as we look to accelerate out of COVID.
General and administrative expenses were $206 million. We still anticipate the timing of full year 2021 G&A to be back-end-weighted as it has been historically. And we estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be slightly less than $1 billion for the full year 2021. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs and utilizes our unique scale remains unchanged, and we expect our G&A ratio to move back toward our historical target as sustained growth resumes.
Interest expense was approximately $131 million, an increase of 11% compared to Q1 2020, driven by write-offs of historical debt issuance costs and other onetime financing costs associated with the Q1 refinancing.
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $25 million for the quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business, with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. As a reminder, for 2021, we may be slightly higher than the $250 million gross CapEx amount to catch up spend on repair, maintenance and remodels delayed owing to COVID as well as selective strategic development in the U.S., primarily for The Habit Burger Grill, for which refranchising proceeds may not be fully realized this year.
Now on to our Unmatched Operating Capability growth driver. With so much of our sales now going through off-premise channels, our operations teams have been laser-focused on delivering a fast, enjoyable experience for customers. As a result, KFC U.S. improved their drive-thru speed by nearly 15 seconds in the quarter over last year. And Taco Bell U.S. delivered their fastest average drive-thru speed in 8 years, while serving a staggering 17 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year. Importantly, 1/3 of these additional cars served were digital orders, which typically carry a higher check value, not to mention an optimized customer experience. Additionally, we continue to make tangible progress on scaling our in-house built technology platform. During the quarter, we deployed the pickup and delivery ordering solution across all KFC U.S. restaurants, including the launch of our first-ever custom-built KFC app. Early signs are highly encouraging, and this gives us confidence as we look to further optimize and scale the platform. 
Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the first quarter, we opened 660 restaurants and closed 225, resulting in 435 net new units. Most notably, KFC delivered 4% unit growth, with strength in China, India, Russia and Thailand. At Pizza Hut, we were pleased to add 71 net new units, reflecting a positive trajectory following the COVID-related dislocations and closures of last year. We still have more work to do, and there will be choppiness related to the uncertainty of COVID and our continuing transition to a more modern estate, but we are encouraged by strong unit economics in many markets and our resilient global franchise base.
We are also proud to announce that, shortly after the quarter ended, we opened our first ever Taco Bell in Malaysia. Not only was this the 31st international market Taco Bell has entered, but it was the first market entry where all training and launch programs were conducted virtually, a real breakthrough by the amazing Taco Bell Asia team.
Overall, we are pleased with the momentum at the end of 2020 and into the early part of 2021, and this increases our confidence that we can return to 4% annual unit growth sooner rather than later. In 2021, we're optimistic that we will accomplish at least 3% unit growth.
Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $560 million, excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 4.9x, which returns us to our target of approximately 5x. Second, we repurchased 2.6 million shares totaling $275 million at an average price per share of $106. Third, we executed a series of transactions that added resiliency to our business while balancing liquidity, flexibility and cost.
During the quarter, we amended and extended our credit facility and refinanced our term loans. We also priced a new Yum! Brands, Inc. holding company bond, which closed on April 1, subsequent to quarter end. Proceeds from this new bond, which carries a coupon of 4.625% and matures in 2032 will be used to repay $1.05 billion of 5.25% restricted group notes due in 2026, which we intend to retire later in the second quarter. All combined, the transactions were leverage-neutral and, importantly, allowed us to boost liquidity, lower interest going forward and extend maturities. As always, we'll continue to look for opportunities to further optimize our capital structure, depending on market and business conditions.
Lastly, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases.
With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Just really about the U.S. brands for KFC and Pizza Hut. I'm particularly curious about Pizza Hut. But Both of those brands have had a pretty good run during COVID, but they've also been doing some pretty good stuff on the marketing front lately, so new management and the like. So I'm wondering how you feel those brands are set up for post-COVID. Do you think they can lap me or flat coming out of this as they lap some of these COVID comparisons? 
And I think, particularly with regard to Pizza Hut, I think people are curious about the health of that system. And obviously, it's a long way away now the concerns of 2019, the franchisee profitability if the unit closures over, any sort of feelings about the long-term health of that business?"

But very importantly, they've done a great job setting themselves up for future success. A lot of that, as you mentioned, good marketing, the rollout of the KFC sandwich. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but it bears repeating. That has been a very successful launch with a great product. It really is a winning product in the category, and we're excited about the impact that will have, along with Secret Recipe Fries that rolled out in the quarter.
But on Pizza Hut specifically, the comment about health is also well put. The Pizza Hut franchisees over the last year, given the success they've had, the ability to close some of the underperforming dine-in stores that we have been trying to get out of, those -- all of those moves together have strengthened their financial condition in a very big way. And that sets them up for a much better growth going forward. A big part of that is just the ownership of NPC, which we also mentioned, Greg Flynn and his organization taking over a good chunk of the Pizza Hut U.S. stores is a huge positive for the brand. They're great restaurant operators, great businessmen that has a great team underneath him, knows how to run restaurants as well as anybody in this country. And very excited about the impact he will have taking over those stores and improving their operations, fixing up the assets and growing the business."

And for Taco Bell, I think there's excitement across the board for everything they've done over the last year under Mark King's leadership and the great talent that we have at the brand and with our franchise partners, one of the strongest franchise systems you'll ever find. The international development story is one that bears mentioning in terms of the opportunities we have there. We're starting to see ourselves get to scale in some markets. We always know that when we get to about 100 units in a market that's when you really can start to unlock development, leverage marketing dollars to really create a virtuous cycle and a better unit economic play. We're starting to see that happen in a few markets around the world, and I think we're excited about the upside there. But even in the U.S., we also are leaning more into development as the unit economics look great right now. The opportunities in the U.S. real estate landscape are there. And our franchise partners are financially healthy and eager to go after them in concert with our team and picking the right opportunities that make money for them.
The progress that we've made over the last year on digital is also an important part of the Taco Bell story. We're coming out of 2020 with a great loyalty program and a lot of loyalty members. That progress was made last year as we increased our digital sales. That lays the foundation for more success going forward. We did this -- the first digital-only promotion of the $5 Create Your Own Box. It's a great example of how having that digital business increasing gives us new tools to grow sales. So I think the brand is really hitting on all cylinders. The product innovation is there. Once again, they got something out of fries for the quarter, and they've got a great pipeline of stuff coming down the road. And the future for Taco Bell is incredibly bright with accelerating development growth, a strengthening brand, a great leadership team, great franchise partners."

Good question. If you look at Q1, I think a couple of things stand out. We had strong gross openings which were, in particular, driven by a few key markets in Asia, but general strength in openings across the board. You saw in the U.S., fewer closures. And in general, in the Pizza Hut global system, fewer closures than we had last year, which, as we said in the prepared remarks, we think reflects a bit of a turn there, although there's still a lot of work to be done on the asset transformation, and there's still going to be choppiness from a unit standpoint in the Pizza Hut system. And so those are kind of what drove the shape of development in the quarter. As we said, there's still a lot of uncertainty going forward. If you get outside of the U.S., the COVID situation in certain countries is still very dire, and that leads to some unpredictability. That's why we're not yet ready to commit to exactly when we can get back to the 4% number.

I think, as you think about the things that happened during COVID accelerating trends, which ones of those are going to be sticky, I think we expect that ticket will come down from where it's at. But that -- I don't know that it's going to return to its old levels. And we think that's good. The same thing could be said for some of the digital business, the increases that we've had in digital. That's going to be stickier and stay in our business. Even in the U.S. as we see dining rooms reopen, we're not seeing, for example, a decline in Taco Bell's digital business.

So Tictuk enhances that by giving us one more way, one more channel for customers to easily access our brands through channels like WhatsApp, social media, text messaging. We've had a really good success with it in the nearly 1,000 stores where we've already used Tictuk. And we have high expectations for that team to continue to bring on new markets and expand within each of the brands around the globe. We think it's a great customer experience, really easy to reorder, just a few seconds for those customers. So we're excited about what it does on the platform.
If you then think about another key area of our technology strategy, which is data and analytics and our ability to drive insights, Kvantum fits squarely against that. brings a new capability in-house that many of our markets around the globe have used to optimize their marketing investments. And so we're excited that they're now continuing to serve more and more of our businesses internally.
Both of these, we think, are high return. They're on the smaller side, but high-return acquisitions. And importantly, they create a competitive advantage.

Good question, Brian. I think all of this is actually fairly intuitive. Where we're seeing ourselves successful is, for the most part, in developed markets like the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K. for KFC, where they're ahead of the curve a little bit on vaccination, keeping the virus under control. People are back trading and where our business is going into the pandemic had skewed more off-premise to begin with and had well-developed digital and tech capabilities. So that trend is continuing for all the markets, really. I think that's something that we're pleased with is that where we were going, which usually we're a little bit ahead and developed market versus emerging markets is on point for this environment. So conversely, the markets that are struggling are the ones perhaps where we had skewed more dine-in going into the pandemic and where we have maybe government action that is limiting our ability to trade. For example, in some markets, I think, in India, we've got to close our stores now at 3:00 in the afternoon. That's obviously going to have an impact on our business. So less mobility leads to less sales. But we know that those situations will work themselves, hopefully, out sooner rather than later, which is why I think long term we're still very confident in the international business and returning to even stronger growth."

Thanks, Sara. I'll take the first part of your question on technology. If you think about it, we do ask ourselves the question of should we build the capability in-house, should we acquire it and bring it in-house or should we contract with an external provider. And we run that test. And we think about, gosh, we should have it in-house if it is a strategic competitive advantage with high switching costs, then we need to have that in-house. We then assess our ability to develop it versus the speed of integrating and the opportunity to attract or find a great candidate to acquire. Obviously, our ability to develop in-house is terrific right now with Clay Johnson coming on board over a year ago, plus the strong technology teams that we have at each brand. And that's where you saw the success with the launch of our KFC U.S. e-commerce platform, which will continue to expand to other parts of the business. The Tictuk and Kvantum acquisitions for the reasons we talked about earlier, we think it was the right thing given that we'd already seen the success and the impact they had on our system to bring those in-house. And then we've got plenty of examples of where we contract with service providers where it's either a less strategic capability or the switching costs are low. So that's how we think about that. And again, as David said, we drive return from these primarily by driving system sales growth and creating better unit economics for our franchisees, which furthers development in the long run."

So a lot of this stuff is going to start to create even more synergies as we put what we believe is going to be the greatest tech team in the restaurant industry together.
On the loyalty side, clearly, the move to digital that we're seeing with the consumer -- with our consumer base, really enables us to leverage loyalty in an even bigger way. So Pizza Hut, which has had a loyalty program for quite some time now, it continues to see more and more of their business going through that loyalty program, driven by frequent users that love the program. That's why I mentioned earlier I was so excited about seeing Taco Bell launch their loyalty program. It would be hard to do when their digital mix was pretty low. Now that they have a much bigger digital mix, that's a great backdrop for us to engage with loyalty on our Taco Bell customers. And just as we would expect, we're seeing those customers coming back more frequently, excited about the program and giving us a new channel to communicate with them, market to them and grow the business.
I guess that -- as the last question, I'll just wrap up by saying we're all quite excited about Q1, but we know there's a lot more work to do. I think what you saw in Q1 just demonstrates the resilience of the business, how we're coming out of the pandemic in a lot of markets that are now getting to the other side of this stronger with a better foundation to grow, evidenced by the development progress were made in the quarter. But we all know this is a journey. We haven't reached the finish line. We're not doing a victory dance, but we are very excited about the future. Appreciate everybody's time today and look forward to talking to you on the next call"

We've had a strong start to 2021 with solid same-store sales results on a 2-year basis and a meaningful uplift in unit development. This performance is a testament to the incredible focus and dedication of our restaurant teams, franchisees and above-store leaders around the world who are rising above the challenges presented by the pandemic to unlock new areas of growth such as digital and off-premise while putting the needs of our customers and local communities first. 
I've always believed that our success will come from leaning into our core strengths and building new capabilities that enhance our ability to grow, and the way our business has navigated through COVID-19 has only reinforced this belief. This mindset is reflected in our Recipe for Growth and Good framework, which has successfully guided our strategy and will continue to serve as our North Star. Our recipe highlights our unique strength as a company, notably our iconic brands, our unmatched global scale, our diversified network of highly capable and well-capitalized franchisees and our unparalleled culture and talent. 
Today, we'll discuss our Q1 performance through the lens of this framework and the growth drivers that underpin it, and we'll highlight the specific areas where we've introduced new capabilities as we look toward the future. I'll cover 2 growth drivers, namely Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or R.E.D. for short; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then Chris will share more details of our Q1 results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
I'll start with a few first quarter highlights. In Q1, Yum! system sales grew 11%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and the addition of 435 net new units during the quarter. Importantly, same-store sales grew 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of nearly 900 or about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q1 2021. This was driven by strong sales performance in North America, the U.K., Australia and Japan, with some offset from COVID-related trading restrictions in parts of Asia and Europe. 
Notably, all 4 of our brands had a weekly per restaurant sales record in the U.S. at least once during the quarter, and I'm very encouraged that on a 2-year basis our overall same-store sales in the U.S. increased 10%. Importantly, each of our brands experienced positive 2-year same-store sales growth on a global basis in open and operating stores during Q1. This is a great indicator for the strength and breadth of our recovery. 
The key focus point for our teams was the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, all geared towards providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands. Delivery has been a significant part of this strategy, and we now have over 39,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, driven by expanded aggregator partnerships and continued investment in our own branded channels. We had another record digital system sales quarter with over $5 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year. 
Now let's talk about our 4 brands, starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit. Q1 system sales grew 11%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. For the division, Q1 same-store sales were flat on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Globally, KFC's digital sales mix reached a record of 43% during the quarter, driven by the rapid expansion of delivery, click and collect and the introduction of new channel ordering options. 
At KFC International, same-store sales grew 7% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 '21. We continue to see strength in the U.K., Australia, Canada and Japan during the quarter and saw encouraging results in the Middle East, Mexico and Africa. Each of these markets performed well above their 2019 sales levels, owing to their off-premise capabilities, digital strength and impressive product launches like the Share Box in Japan and the Chicken Nights promotion in Mexico. 
Next, at KFC U.S., we continue to see positive same-store sales with 14% growth in Q1. Importantly, same-store sales grew 11% on a 2-year basis thanks to all the team's hard work in building additional sales channels and growing the core business while adding hyper-relevant product innovations such as the new chicken sandwich. Our sandwich is performing at more than twice the volumes of our prior U.S. sandwich launches, and all initial indications are that it's highly incremental. Customers are loving the product and coming back more frequently for it. In fact, as we've entered Q2, demand for the new sandwich has been so strong that, coupled with general tightening in domestic chicken supply, our main challenge has been keeping up with that demand. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit. The division reported Q1 system sales growth of 7%, driven by 12% same-store sales growth and a 4% unit decline. Global Q1 same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. 
Overall, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 8%. Same-store sales declined 7% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 10% same-store sales growth for the quarter. Similar to KFC, our developed markets with high off-premise capabilities, digital strength and newsworthy products continued to perform well. 
Pizza Hut U.S. had another stellar quarter, delivering 23% same-store sales growth in the off-premise channel, with 16% overall same-store sales growth. Overall same-store sales grew 8% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021 and was driven by a combination of compelling value with the $10 Tastemaker offer and category-leading innovation with the launch of the unique Detroit-style pizza and the reboot of our iconic Stuffed Crust Pizza. 
As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 36% of our divisional operating profit, Q1 system sales grew 11%, driven by a 9% same-store sales growth and 1% unit growth. For the division, Q1 same-store sales grew 10% on a 2-year basis. The quarter kicked off with the return of Nacho Fries, this time offered in the $5 Nacho Fries box. We also introduced our first digital-led product launch with the $5 Build Your Own Cravings Box available exclusively on the Taco Bell app or web, which drove a meaningful increase in loyalty memberships during the quarter. 
And finally, our newest brand, The Habit Burger Grill, delivered 13% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth during the quarter. Q1 same-store sales grew 3% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores that were temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. We introduced our new Patty Melt, and our sales growth was aided by reduced government restrictions and government stimulus. Encouragingly, digital sales continued to mix above 40% even as dining rooms reopened and we saw a steady improvement in the dine-in channel throughout the quarter. 
On to the Recipe for Growth, starting with R.E.D. brands. Having 4 brands across more than 50,000 restaurants provides us with an enviable platform to understand how consumers are behaving in every corner of the world and to use that understanding to capture future growth in our sales overnight and our brands over time. In some cases, this means strengthening our ability to grow sales at a faster pace and bringing in strong diverse tech talent. It's with this in mind that we were excited to close on 2 strategic acquisitions during the quarter, being Kvantum Inc. and Tictuk Technologies. 
Kvantum is a true innovator in marketing optimization with a proven track record of adding significant value with enabling data-driven decisions to drive return on advertising dollars and sales increases. We have seen material improvements in both marketing spend efficiencies and same-store sales growth in our Pizza Hut U.K. off-premise and Pizza Hut Taiwan businesses as a result of leveraging their toolkit. And at the end of last year, both Taco Bell U.S. and KFC U.S. engaged Kvantum services on marketing calendar and mix optimization. 
Tictuk presents an exciting opportunity to expand access by providing frictionless ordering through text, social media and other conversational channels in literally just a few clicks. We've deployed their platform in approximately 900 KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants across 35 countries outside of the U.S. and have been thrilled with the agility and customer obsession of the Tictuk team. In fact, we have several examples of customers completing orders on the Tictuk platform in under 10 seconds, a truly seamless experience. 
Beyond their proven capabilities, what excites me most about these acquisitions is the high-quality, culturally aligned teams we've brought into our global organization. This is a perfect segue to our Unrivaled Culture & Talent growth driver. 
Given the environment we've been operating in, we've had to find new ways to connect with the people across our vast global business. One way we've done this is through virtual market visits, where we virtually walk through a restaurant and connect with team members. The leadership team and I attended 4 virtual market visits during the quarter in Pizza Hut Japan, KFC Asia, Taco Bell U.S. in Times Square and KFC Africa. We each left those meetings energized and proud of how our brands are represented around the world and the incredible people that make it all happen. 
Here, I also want to highlight 2 key actions we are taking to bring our Recipe for Growth and Good to life. On the equity and inclusion front in the U.S., we are taking tangible actions to represent the diverse communities where we operate by increasing Black and Latinx employees and leaders in our corporate and restaurant management roles. As part of this effort, we're proud to partner with OneTen, a coalition of leading companies coming together to upskill, hire and advance 1 million Black individuals in America over the next 10 years. These actions advance our global Unlocking Opportunity Initiative in the U.S., and we are looking forward to working alongside the community of companies in OneTen as well as our franchisees to advance equity and opportunity. 
Finally, as part of our broader strategy to address climate change, earlier this week, we announced our pledge to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 with a science-based target to reduce emissions by nearly 50% across our supply chain and restaurants by 2030 in partnership with our franchisees, suppliers and producers. This is an incredibly important issue to us, our customers and other stakeholders, and I'm proud of our continued progress in this space. 
To wrap up, I'm encouraged by the momentum in our business as we execute our Recipe for Growth and Good to set ourselves up for the next chapter of growth. Although COVID continues to impact many geographies and make our overall path to recovery uneven, I believe that with our iconic brands, world-class talent, inclusive culture and healthy franchise system, we are poised to enter a post-COVID world even stronger. 
With that, Chris, over to you."
365997,708799233,2260735,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, let's discuss Q",1297,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
To begin, let's discuss Q1. As David mentioned, overall Yum! system sales grew 11%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 1% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 2%, which includes the negative impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q1 2021. 
EPS excluding special items was $1.07, representing a 67% increase compared to ex-special EPS of $0.64 in Q1 2020. Core operating profit grew 33% in the first quarter. This performance is attributable to a stellar same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable. 
I'll now provide some additional color on several items, starting with Taco Bell. We had another impressive quarter of profitability where company restaurant margins were 24.1%, representing a 1.7% increase over prior year. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, we expect these margins to return closer to historical levels later this year as check averages normalize, dining room patronage increases and we adjust staffing levels at our restaurants as a result. 
During Q1, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due at KFC International and Pizza Hut U.S. These recoveries resulted in a $6 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $34 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $28 million of expense in Q1 2020. While we ended 2020 with $12 million of full year bad debt expense, we had large quarterly swings last year due to COVID. As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to continue to be impacted as we lap bad debt expense of $13 million in Q2 and bad debt recovery of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. While difficult to forecast, at this point, we don't expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full year basis. 
Most importantly, our franchisees are generally on solid financial ground despite the uncertainties caused by COVID. We recently completed the restructuring of our largest Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee, NPC, that resulted in Flynn Restaurant Group joining the Pizza Hut family. We believe our franchisees are well positioned to partner with us as we look to accelerate out of COVID. 
General and administrative expenses were $206 million. We still anticipate the timing of full year 2021 G&A to be back end weighted as it has been historically, and we estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be slightly less than $1 billion for the full year 2021. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs and utilizes our unique scale remains unchanged, and we expect our G&A ratio to move back toward our historical target as sustained growth resumes. Interest expense was approximately $131 million, an increase of 11% compared to Q1 2020, driven by write-offs of historical debt issuance costs and other onetime financing costs associated with the Q1 refinancing. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $25 million for the quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. As a reminder, for 2021, we may be slightly higher than the $250 million gross CapEx amount to catch up spend on repair, maintenance and remodels delayed owing to COVID as well as selective strategic development in the U.S., primarily for The Habit Burger Grill, for which refranchising proceeds may not be fully realized this year. 
Now on to our Unmatched Operating Capability growth driver. With so much of our sales now going through off-premise channels, our operations teams have been laser-focused on delivering a fast, enjoyable experience for customers. As a result, KFC U.S. improved their drive-thru speed by nearly 15 seconds in the quarter over last year, and Taco Bell U.S. delivered their fastest average drive-thru speed in 8 years while serving a staggering 17 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year. Importantly, 1/3 of these additional cars served were digital orders, which typically carry a higher check value, not to mention an optimized customer experience. 
Additionally, we continue to make tangible progress on scaling our in-house built technology platform. During the quarter, we deployed the pickup and delivery ordering solution across all KFC U.S. restaurants, including the launch of our first-ever custom-built KFC app. Early signs are highly encouraging, and this gives us confidence as we look to further optimize and scale the platform.  
Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the first quarter, we opened 660 restaurants and closed 225, resulting in 435 net new units. Most notably, KFC delivered 4% unit growth, with strength in China, India, Russia and Thailand. At Pizza Hut, we were pleased to add 71 net new units, reflecting a positive trajectory following the COVID-related dislocations and closures of last year. We still have more work to do and there will be choppiness related to the uncertainty of COVID and our continuing transition to a more modern estate, but we are encouraged by strong unit economics in many markets and our resilient global franchise base. 
We are also proud to announce that shortly after the quarter ended, we opened our first-ever Taco Bell in Malaysia. Not only was this the 31st international market Taco Bell has entered, but it was the first market entry where all training and launch programs were conducted virtually, a real breakthrough by the amazing Taco Bell Asia team. 
Overall, we are pleased with the momentum at the end of 2020 and into the early part of 2021, and this increases our confidence that we can return to 4% annual unit growth sooner rather than later. In 2021, we're optimistic that we will accomplish at least 3% unit growth. 
Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $560 million excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 4.9x, which returns us to our target of approximately 5x. 
Second, we repurchased 2.6 million shares totaling $275 million at an average price per share of $106. Third, we executed a series of transactions that added resiliency to our business while balancing liquidity, flexibility and cost. During the quarter, we amended and extended our credit facility and refinanced our term loans. 
We also priced a new Yum! Brands, Inc. holding company bond which closed on April 1, subsequent to quarter end. Proceeds from this new bond, which carries a coupon of 4.625% and matures in 2032, will be used to repay $1.05 billion of 5.25% restricted group notes due in 2026, which we intend to retire later in the second quarter. All combined, the transactions were leverage-neutral and importantly, allowed us to boost liquidity, lower interest going forward and extend maturities. As always, we'll continue to look for opportunities to further optimize our capital structure, depending on market and business conditions. Lastly, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

So I'm wondering how you feel those brands are set up for post COVID. Do you think they can lap near flat coming out of this as they lap some of these COVID comparisons? 
And I think particularly with regard to Pizza Hut, I think people are curious about the health of that system.

I think you're right, KFC and Pizza Hut have done a tremendous job navigating this tricky environment over the last year, but very importantly, they've done a great job setting themselves up for future success. A lot of that, as you mentioned, good marketing, the rollout of the KFC sandwich. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks but bears repeating. That has been a very successful launch with a great product. It really is a winning product in the category, and we're excited about the impact that will have, along with Secret Recipe Fries that rolled out in the quarter.
But on Pizza Hut specifically, the comment about health is also well put. The Pizza Hut franchisees, over the last year, given the success they've had, the ability to close some of the underperforming dine-in stores that we have been trying to get out of, those -- all of those moves together have strengthened their financial condition in a very big way. And that sets them up for a much better growth going forward. A big part of that is just the ownership of NPC, which we also mentioned. 
Greg Flynn and his organization taking over a good chunk of the Pizza Hut U.S. stores is a huge positive for the brand. They're great restaurant operators, great businessman that has a great team underneath him, knows how to run restaurants as well as anybody in this country. And very excited about the impact he will have taking over those stores and improving their operations, fixing up the assets and growing the business."

KFC, we think, has historically been strong, and we want it to continue to be strong. But we have high expectations for Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and The Habit. 
Common across all of them is, we think, strong franchisees, very strong unit economics that improve as the business rebounds from COVID, continued brand love from consumers and ability to serve them on an off-premise basis. Plus you're seeing us now integrate digital into the formats and so post COVID, optimized formats in each of those brands. And so that, coupled with our very strong development teams, we think supports us on that trajectory back. And so we have expectations that we see strength across all of the brands going forward from a development standpoint."

David, I think you talked about some of the key drivers of strength in this most recent quarter. Just curious, on the go forward, some of the drivers you're most excited about, whether it's digital, the loyalty program that you touched on, how that new product pipeline looks. And just as we think about the reopening developments and dynamics going forward, some of the headwinds maybe from competition reopening but also for Taco Bell kind of late night coming back, maybe breakfast coming back, curious if you guys could speak to some of those tailwinds as well."

And for Taco Bell, I think there's excitement across the board for everything they've done over the last year under Mark King's leadership and the great talent that we have at the brand and with our franchise partners, one of the strongest franchise",349,"Yes. And for Taco Bell, I think there's excitement across the board for everything they've done over the last year under Mark King's leadership and the great talent that we have at the brand and with our franchise partners, one of the strongest franchise systems you'll ever find. The international development story is one that bears mentioning in terms of the opportunities we have there. 
We're starting to see ourselves get to scale in some markets. We always know that when we get to about 100 units in a market, that's when you really can start to unlock development, leverage marketing dollars to really create a virtuous cycle and a better unit economic play. We're starting to see that happen in a few markets around the world, and I think we're excited about the upside there. 
But even in the U.S., we also are leaning more into development as the unit economics look great right now. The opportunities in the U.S. real estate landscape are there, and our franchise partners are financially healthy and eager to go after them in concert with our team and picking the right opportunities that make money for them.
The progress that we've made over the last year on digital is also an important part of the Taco Bell story. We're coming out of 2020 with a great loyalty program and a lot of loyalty members. That progress was made last year as we increased our digital sales. That lays the foundation for more success going forward. We did this first -- the first digital-only promotion of the $5 create your own box. It's a great example of how having that digital business increasing gives us new tools to grow sales. 
So I think the brand is really hitting on all cylinders. The product innovation is there. Once again, they got something out of fries for the quarter, and they've got a great pipeline of stuff coming down the road. And the future for Taco Bell is incredibly bright with accelerating development growth, a strengthening brand, a great leadership team and great franchise partners."

We had strong gross openings which were in particular driven by a few key markets in Asia, but general strength in openings across the board. You saw in the U.S., fewer closures and in general, in the Pizza Hut global system, fewer closures than we had last year, which, as we said in the prepared remarks, we think reflects a bit of a turn there, although there's still a lot of work to be done on the asset transformation and there's still going to be choppiness from a unit standpoint in the Pizza Hut system. And so those are kind of what drove the shape of development in the quarter. 
As we said, there's still a lot of uncertainty going forward. If you get outside of the U.S., the COVID situation in certain countries is still very dire, and that leads to some unpredictability. That's why we're not yet ready to commit to exactly when we can get back to the 4% number. But we do have enough confidence as we look at the current pipeline to say that we think we'll be at the 3% number at least this year. But again, we've still got a fair bit of uncertainty out there given the global situation."

And I'll just -- obviously, with 290 brand-country combinations, it varies -- a lot of this varies by each one of those. But in general, we are seeing, as markets reopen, ticket come down a little bit. But the thing that determined a lot of our success going into this was our ability to serve family meals and serve larger tickets. So the brands that had those options like KFC buckets and Pizza Hut meals for sharing tended to do better, and we're not seeing that all go away. I think as you think about the things that happened during COVID, accelerating trends, which ones of those are going to be sticky, I think we expect that ticket will come down from where it's at, but that -- I don't know that it's going to return to its old levels. And we think that's good. 
The same thing could be said for some of the digital business, the increases that we've had in digital. That's going to be stickier and stay in our business. Even in the U.S. as we see dining rooms reopen, we're not seeing, for example, a decline in Taco Bell's digital business. And so we're holding on to those gains. So yes, it's probably fair to expect ticket to start to moderate but not -- I don't know that it's going to return to pre-COVID levels."

If you think about the key areas of our technology strategy, they tie to 2 of those key areas: one being our e-commerce and technology platform. So Tictuk enhances that by giving us one more way, one more channel for customers to easily access our brands through channels like WhatsApp, social media, text messaging. We've had a really good success with it in the nearly 1,000 stores where we've already used Tictuk, and we have high expectations for that team to continue to bring on new markets and expand within each of the brands around the globe. We think it's a great customer experience, really easy to reorder, just a few seconds for those customers. So we're excited about what it does on the platform.
If you then think about another key area of our technology strategy, which is data and analytics and our ability to drive insights, Kvantum fits squarely against that. It brings a new capability in-house that many of our markets around the globe have used to optimize their marketing investments. And so we're excited that they're now continuing to serve more and more of our businesses internally.
Both of these, we think, are high return -- they're on the smaller side but high-return acquisitions. And importantly, they create a competitive advantage. And the reason we decided to acquire them is there's also the scale economies that come from being able to apply their capabilities across the breadth of our global business."

The return for Yum! comes through top line growth in our franchise units, which leads to more royalty income. 
We think we've really got a great model here where we do these smaller acquisitions but we can scale them across the world. They have almost no impact on our P&L initially, and then the return comes from growing sales at units, improving franchise economics, which we all know is a virtuous cycle, which leads to more development and healthier franchisees that's really our #1 goal."

Good question, Brian. I think all of this is actually fairly intuitive. Where we're seeing ourselves successful is, for the most part, in developed markets like the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K. for KFC, where they're ahead of the curve a little bit on vaccination, keeping the virus under control, people are back trading and where our business is going into the pandemic had skewed more off-premise to begin with and had well-developed digital and tech capabilities. So that trend is continuing for all the markets really. I think that's something that we're pleased with, is that where we were going, which usually we're a little bit ahead in developed market versus emerging markets, is on point for this environment. 
So conversely, the markets that are struggling are the ones perhaps where we had skewed more dine-in going into the pandemic and where we have maybe government action that is limiting our ability to trade. For example,  in some markets, I think, in India, we've got to close our stores now at 3:00 in the afternoon. That's obviously going to have an impact on our business. So less mobility leads to less sales, but we know that those situations will work themselves, hopefully, out sooner rather than later, which is why I think, long term, we're still very confident in the international business and returning to even stronger growth."

And then any color you can give on loyalty for Taco Bell? I know Pizza Hut has a loyalty program. Anything you can tell me about frequency, what that looks like when people join or average spend?

Thanks, Sara. I'll take the first part of your question on technology. If you think about it, we do ask ourselves the question of should we build the capability in-house, should we acquire it and bring it in-house or should we contract with an external provider, and we run that test. And we think about, gosh, we should have it in-house -- if it is a strategic competitive advantage with high switching costs, then we need to have that in-house. We then assess our ability to develop it versus the speed of integrating and the opportunity to attract or find a great candidate to acquire. 
Obviously, our ability to develop in-house is terrific right now with Clay Johnson coming onboard over a year ago, plus the strong technology teams that we have at each brand. And that's where you saw the success with the launch of our KFC U.S. e-commerce platform, which we'll continue to expand to other parts of the business. The Tictuk and Kvantum acquisitions, for the reasons we talked about earlier, we think it was the right thing given that we'd already seen the success and the impact they had, had on our system to bring those in-house. 
And then we've got plenty of examples of where we contract with service providers where it's either a less strategic capability or the switching costs are low. So that's how we think about that. And again, as David said, we drive return from these primarily by driving system sales growth and creating better unit economics for our franchisees, which furthers development in the long run."

And past acquisitions that we've done like QuikOrder have really paid off, not only being done as a Pizza Hut acquisition but leveraging the talent and some of the IP across other brands. So this thing is really -- got all sorts of synergies and benefits as we make the right acquisitions. 
We've also done acquisitions outside of tech, like we bought Collider, a consumer insights company, that has been enormously helpful in us navigating the marketing environment all around the world and making sure we stay connected with consumers. And Collider in particular is really excited about the acquisition we did with Kvantum, which will help them come up with insights on the marketing side and then implement those insights most efficiently using Kvantum's algorithms. So a lot of this stuff is going to start to create even more synergies as we put what we believe is going to be the greatest tech team in the restaurant industry together.
On the loyalty side, clearly, the move to digital that we're seeing with the consumer -- with our consumer base really enables us to leverage loyalty in an even bigger way. So Pizza Hut, which has had a loyalty program for quite some time now, it continues to see more and more of their business going through that loyalty program, driven by frequent users that love the program. That's why I mentioned earlier I was so excited about seeing Taco Bell launch their loyalty program. 
It would be hard to do when their digital mix was pretty low. Now that they have a much bigger digital mix, that's a great backdrop for us to engage with loyalty on our Taco Bell customers. And just as we would expect, we're seeing those customers coming back more frequently, excited about the program and giving us a new channel to communicate with them, market to them and grow the business.
I guess that was the last question. I'll just wrap up by saying we're all quite excited about Q1, but we know there's a lot more work to do. I think what you saw in Q1 just demonstrates the resilience of the business, how we're coming out of the pandemic in a lot of markets that are now getting to the other side of this stronger with a better foundation to grow, evidenced by the development progress we made in the quarter. But we all know this is a journey and we haven't reached the finish line. We're not doing a victory dance, but we are very excited about the future.

We've had a strong start to 2021 with solid same-store sales results on a 2-year basis and a meaningful uplift in unit development. This performance is a testament to the incredible focus and dedication of our restaurant teams, franchisees and above-store leaders around the world who are rising above the challenges presented by the pandemic to unlock new areas of growth such as digital and off-premise while putting the needs of our customers and local communities first. 
I've always believed that our success will come from leaning into our core strengths and building new capabilities that enhance our ability to grow, and the way our business has navigated through COVID-19 has only reinforced this belief. This mindset is reflected in our Recipe for Growth and Good framework, which has successfully guided our strategy and will continue to serve as our North Star. Our recipe highlights our unique strength as a company, notably our iconic brands, our unmatched global scale, our diversified network of highly capable and well-capitalized franchisees and our unparalleled culture and talent. 
Today, we'll discuss our Q1 performance through the lens of this framework and the growth drivers that underpin it, and we'll highlight the specific areas where we've introduced new capabilities as we look toward the future. I'll cover 2 growth drivers, namely Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or RED for short; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then Chris will share more details of our Q1 results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
I'll start with a few first quarter highlights. In Q1, Yum! system sales grew 11%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and the addition of 435 net new units during the quarter. Importantly, same-store sales grew 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of nearly 900 or about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q1 2021. This was driven by strong sales performance in North America, the U.K., Australia and Japan, with some offset from COVID-related trading restrictions in parts of Asia and Europe. 
Notably, all 4 of our brands had a weekly per restaurant sales record in the U.S. at least once during the quarter, and I'm very encouraged that on a 2-year basis our overall same-store sales in the U.S. increased 10%. Importantly, each of our brands experienced positive 2-year same-store sales growth on a global basis in open and operating stores during Q1. This is a great indicator for the strength and breadth of our recovery. 
The key focus point for our teams was the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, all geared towards providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands. Delivery has been a significant part of this strategy, and we now have over 39,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, driven by expanded aggregator partnerships and continued investment in our own branded channels. We had another record digital system sales quarter with over $5 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year. 
Now let's talk about our 4 brands, starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit. Q1 system sales grew 11%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. For the division, Q1 same-store sales were flat on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Globally, KFC's digital sales mix reached a record of 43% during the quarter, driven by the rapid expansion of delivery, click and collect and the introduction of new channel ordering options. 
At KFC International, same-store sales grew 7% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 '21. We continue to see strength in the U.K., Australia, Canada and Japan during the quarter and saw encouraging results in the Middle East, Mexico and Africa. Each of these markets performed well above their 2019 sales levels, owing to their off-premise capabilities, digital strength and impressive product launches like the Share Box in Japan and the Chicken Nights promotion in Mexico. 
Next, at KFC U.S., we continue to see positive same-store sales with 14% growth in Q1. Importantly, same-store sales grew 11% on a 2-year basis, thanks to all the team's hard work in building additional sales channels and growing the core business while adding hyper-relevant product innovations such as the new Chicken Sandwich. Our sandwich is performing at more than twice the volumes of our prior U.S. sandwich launches, and all initial indications are that it's highly incremental. Customers are loving the product and coming back more frequently for it. In fact, as we've entered Q2, demand for the new sandwich has been so strong that, coupled with general tightening in domestic chicken supply, our main challenge has been keeping up with that demand. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit, the division reported Q1 system sales growth of 7%, driven by 12% same-store sales growth and a 4% unit decline. Global Q1 same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. 
Overall Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 8%. Same-store sales declined 7% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 10% same-store sales growth for the quarter. Similar to KFC, our developed markets with high off-premise capabilities, digital strength and newsworthy products continued to perform well. 
Pizza Hut U.S. had another stellar quarter, delivering 23% same-store sales growth in the off-premise channel, with 16% overall same-store sales growth. Overall same-store sales grew 8% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021, and was driven by a combination of compelling value with the $10 Tastemaker offer and category-leading innovation with the launch of the unique Detroit Style pizza and the reboot of our iconic Stuffed Crust Pizza. 
As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 36% of our divisional operating profit, Q1 system sales grew 11%, driven by a 9% same-store sales growth and 1% unit growth. For the division, Q1 same-store sales grew 10% on a 2-year basis. The quarter kicked off with the return of Nacho Fries, this time offered in the $5 Nacho Fries Box. We also introduced our first digital-led product launch with the $5 Build Your Own Cravings Box available exclusively on the Taco Bell app or web, which drove a meaningful increase in loyalty memberships during the quarter. 
And finally, our newest brand, The Habit Burger Grill, delivered 13% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth during the quarter. Q1 same-store sales grew 3% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores that were temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. We introduced our new Patty Melt, and our sales growth was aided by reduced government restrictions and government stimulus. Encouragingly, digital sales continued to mix above 40% even as dining rooms reopened and we saw a steady improvement in the dine-in channel throughout the quarter. 
Onto the Recipe for Growth, starting with RED brands. Having 4 brands across more than 50,000 restaurants provides us with an enviable platform to understand how consumers are behaving in every corner of the world and to use that understanding to capture future growth in our sales overnight and our brands over time. In some cases, this means strengthening our ability to grow sales at a faster pace and bringing in strong diverse tech talent. It's with this in mind that we were excited to close on 2 strategic acquisitions during the quarter, being Kvantum Inc. and Tictuk Technologies. 
Kvantum is a true innovator in marketing optimization with a proven track record of adding significant value in enabling data-driven decisions to drive return on advertising dollars and sales increases. We have seen material improvements in both marketing spend efficiencies and same-store sales growth in our Pizza Hut U.K. off-premise and Pizza Hut Taiwan businesses as a result of leveraging their toolkit. And at the end of last year, both Taco Bell U.S. and KFC U.S. engaged Kvantum services on marketing calendar and mix optimization. 
Tictuk presents an exciting opportunity to expand access by providing frictionless ordering through text, social media and other conversational channels in literally just a few clicks. We've deployed their platform in approximately 900 KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants across 35 countries outside of the U.S. and have been thrilled with the agility and customer obsession of the Tictuk team. In fact, we have several examples of customers completing orders on the Tictuk platform in under 10 seconds, a truly seamless experience. 
Beyond their proven capabilities, what excites me most about these acquisitions is the high-quality, culturally aligned teams we've brought into our global organization. This is a perfect segue to our Unrivaled Culture & Talent growth driver. 
Given the environment we've been operating in, we've had to find new ways to connect with the people across our vast global business. One way we've done this is through virtual market visits, where we virtually walk through a restaurant and connect with team members. The leadership team and I attended 4 virtual market visits during the quarter in Pizza Hut Japan, KFC Asia, Taco Bell U.S. in Times Square and KFC Africa. We each left those meetings energized and proud of how our brands are represented around the world and the incredible people that make it all happen. 
Here, I also want to highlight 2 key actions we are taking to bring our Recipe for Growth and Good to life. On the equity and inclusion front in the U.S., we are taking tangible actions to represent the diverse communities where we operate by increasing Black and Latinx employees and leaders in our corporate and restaurant management roles. As part of this effort, we're proud to partner with OneTen, a coalition of leading companies coming together to upskill, hire and advance 1 million Black individuals in America over the next 10 years. These actions advance our global Unlocking Opportunity initiative in the U.S., and we are looking forward to working alongside the community of companies in OneTen as well as our franchisees to advance equity and opportunity. 
Finally, as part of our broader strategy to address climate change, earlier this week, we announced our pledge to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 with a science-based target to reduce emissions by nearly 50% across our supply chain and restaurants by 2030 in partnership with our franchisees, suppliers and producers. This is an incredibly important issue to us, our customers and other stakeholders, and I'm proud of our continued progress in this space. 
To wrap up, I'm encouraged by the momentum in our business as we execute our Recipe for Growth and Good to set ourselves up for the next chapter of growth. Although COVID continues to impact many geographies and make our overall path to recovery uneven, I believe that with our iconic brands, world-class talent, inclusive culture and healthy franchise system, we are poised to enter a post-COVID world even stronger. 
With that, Chris, over to you."
365997,708799233,2260740,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, let's discuss Q",1297,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
To begin, let's discuss Q1. As David mentioned, overall Yum! system sales grew 11%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 1% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 2%, which includes the negative impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q1 2021. 
EPS excluding special items was $1.07, representing a 67% increase compared to ex-special EPS of $0.64 in Q1 2020. Core operating profit grew 33% in the first quarter. This performance is attributable to a stellar same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable. 
I'll now provide some additional color on several items, starting with Taco Bell. We had another impressive quarter of profitability where company restaurant margins were 24.1%, representing a 1.7% increase over prior year. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, we expect these margins to return closer to historical levels later this year as check averages normalize, dining room patronage increases and we adjust staffing levels at our restaurants as a result. 
During Q1, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due at KFC International and Pizza Hut U.S. These recoveries resulted in a $6 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $34 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $28 million of expense in Q1 2020. While we ended 2020 with $12 million of full year bad debt expense, we had large quarterly swings last year due to COVID. As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to continue to be impacted as we lap bad debt expense of $13 million in Q2 and bad debt recovery of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. While difficult to forecast, at this point, we don't expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full year basis. 
Most importantly, our franchisees are generally on solid financial ground despite the uncertainties caused by COVID. We recently completed the restructuring of our largest Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee, NPC, that resulted in Flynn Restaurant Group joining the Pizza Hut family. We believe our franchisees are well positioned to partner with us as we look to accelerate out of COVID. 
General and administrative expenses were $206 million. We still anticipate the timing of full year 2021 G&A to be back end weighted as it has been historically, and we estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be slightly less than $1 billion for the full year 2021. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs and utilizes our unique scale remains unchanged, and we expect our G&A ratio to move back toward our historical target as sustained growth resumes. Interest expense was approximately $131 million, an increase of 11% compared to Q1 2020, driven by write-offs of historical debt issuance costs and other onetime financing costs associated with the Q1 refinancing. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $25 million for the quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. As a reminder, for 2021, we may be slightly higher than the $250 million gross CapEx amount to catch up spend on repair, maintenance and remodels delayed owing to COVID as well as selective strategic development in the U.S., primarily for The Habit Burger Grill, for which refranchising proceeds may not be fully realized this year. 
Now on to our Unmatched Operating Capability growth driver. With so much of our sales now going through off-premise channels, our operations teams have been laser-focused on delivering a fast, enjoyable experience for customers. As a result, KFC U.S. improved their drive-thru speed by nearly 15 seconds in the quarter over last year, and Taco Bell U.S. delivered their fastest average drive-thru speed in 8 years while serving a staggering 17 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year. Importantly, 1/3 of these additional cars served were digital orders, which typically carry a higher check value, not to mention an optimized customer experience. 
Additionally, we continue to make tangible progress on scaling our in-house built technology platform. During the quarter, we deployed the pickup and delivery ordering solution across all KFC U.S. restaurants, including the launch of our first-ever custom-built KFC app. Early signs are highly encouraging, and this gives us confidence as we look to further optimize and scale the platform. 
Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the first quarter, we opened 660 restaurants and closed 225, resulting in 435 net new units. Most notably, KFC delivered 4% unit growth, with strength in China, India, Russia and Thailand. At Pizza Hut, we were pleased to add 71 net new units, reflecting a positive trajectory following the COVID-related dislocations and closures of last year. We still have more work to do and there will be choppiness related to the uncertainty of COVID and our continuing transition to a more modern estate, but we are encouraged by strong unit economics in many markets and our resilient global franchise base. 
We are also proud to announce that shortly after the quarter ended, we opened our first-ever Taco Bell in Malaysia. Not only was this the 31st international market Taco Bell has entered, but it was the first market entry where all training and launch programs were conducted virtually, a real breakthrough by the amazing Taco Bell Asia team. 
Overall, we are pleased with the momentum at the end of 2020 and into the early part of 2021, and this increases our confidence that we can return to 4% annual unit growth sooner rather than later. In 2021, we're optimistic that we will accomplish at least 3% unit growth. 
Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $560 million excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 4.9x, which returns us to our target of approximately 5x. 
Second, we repurchased 2.6 million shares totaling $275 million at an average price per share of $106. Third, we executed a series of transactions that added resiliency to our business while balancing liquidity, flexibility and cost. During the quarter, we amended and extended our credit facility and refinanced our term loans. 
We also priced a new Yum! Brands, Inc. holding company bond which closed on April 1, subsequent to quarter end. Proceeds from this new bond, which carries a coupon of 4.625% and matures in 2032, will be used to repay $1.05 billion of 5.25% restricted group notes due in 2026, which we intend to retire later in the second quarter. All combined, the transactions were leverage-neutral and importantly, allowed us to boost liquidity, lower interest going forward and extend maturities. As always, we'll continue to look for opportunities to further optimize our capital structure, depending on market and business conditions. Lastly, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

So I'm wondering how you feel those brands are set up for post COVID. Do you think they can lap near flat coming out of this as they lap some of these COVID comparisons? And I think particularly with regard to Pizza Hut, I think people are curious about the health of that system.

I think you're right, KFC and Pizza Hut have done a tremendous job navigating this tricky environment over the last year, but very importantly, they've done a great job setting themselves up for future success. A lot of that, as you mentioned, good marketing, the rollout of the KFC sandwich. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but bears repeating, that has been a very successful launch with a great product. It really is a winning product in the category, and we're excited about the impact that will have, along with Secret Recipe Fries that rolled out in the quarter.
But on Pizza Hut specifically, the comment about health is also well put. The Pizza Hut franchisees, over the last year, given the success they've had, the ability to close some of the underperforming dine-in stores that we have been trying to get out of, those -- all of those moves together have strengthened their financial condition in a very big way. And that sets them up for a much better growth going forward. A big part of that is just the ownership of NPC, which we also mentioned. 
Greg Flynn and his organization taking over a good chunk of the Pizza Hut U.S. stores is a huge positive for the brand. They're great restaurant operators, great businessman that has a great team underneath him, knows how to run restaurants as well as anybody in this country. And very excited about the impact he will have taking over those stores and improving their operations, fixing up the assets and growing the business."

KFC, we think, has historically been strong, and we want it to continue to be strong. But we have high expectations for Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and The Habit. 
Common across all of them is, we think, strong franchisees, very strong unit economics that improve as the business rebounds from COVID, continued brand love from consumers and ability to serve them on an off-premise basis. Plus you're seeing us now integrate digital into the formats and so post COVID, optimized formats in each of those brands. And so that, coupled with our very strong development teams, we think supports us on that trajectory back. And so we have expectations that we see strength across all of the brands going forward from a development standpoint."

And for Taco Bell, I think there's excitement across the board for everything they've done over the last year under Mark King's leadership and the great talent that we have at the brand and with our franchise partners, one of the strongest franchise",349,"Yes. And for Taco Bell, I think there's excitement across the board for everything they've done over the last year under Mark King's leadership and the great talent that we have at the brand and with our franchise partners, one of the strongest franchise systems you'll ever find. The international development story is one that bears mentioning in terms of the opportunities we have there.
We're starting to see ourselves get to scale in some markets. We always know that when we get to about 100 units in a market, that's when you really can start to unlock development, leverage marketing dollars to really create a virtuous cycle and a better unit economic play. We're starting to see that happen in a few markets around the world, and I think we're excited about the upside there. 
But even in the U.S., we also are leaning more into development as the unit economics look great right now. The opportunities in the U.S. real estate landscape are there, and our franchise partners are financially healthy and eager to go after them in concert with our team and picking the right opportunities that make money for them.
The progress that we've made over the last year on digital is also an important part of the Taco Bell story. We're coming out of 2020 with a great loyalty program and a lot of loyalty members. That progress was made last year as we increased our digital sales. That lays the foundation for more success going forward. We did this first -- the first digital-only promotion of the $5 Create Your Own Box. It's a great example of how having that digital business increasing gives us new tools to grow sales. 
So I think the brand is really hitting on all cylinders. The product innovation is there. Once again, they got something out of fries for the quarter, and they've got a great pipeline of stuff coming down the road. And the future for Taco Bell is incredibly bright with accelerating development growth, a strengthening brand, a great leadership team and great franchise partners."

We had strong gross openings which were in particular driven by a few key markets in Asia, but general strength in openings across the board. You saw in the U.S. fewer closures, and in general, in the Pizza Hut global system, fewer closures than we had last year, which as we said in the prepared remarks, we think reflects a bit of a turn there, although there's still a lot of work to be done on the asset transformation and there's still going to be choppiness from a unit standpoint in the Pizza Hut system. And so those are kind of what drove the shape of development in the quarter. 
As we said, there's still a lot of uncertainty going forward. If you get outside of the U.S., the COVID situation in certain countries is still very dire, and that leads to some unpredictability. That's why we're not yet ready to commit to exactly when we can get back to the 4% number. But we do have enough confidence as we look at the current pipeline to say that we think we'll be at the 3% number at least this year. But again, we've still got a fair bit of uncertainty out there given the global situation."

And I'll just -- obviously, with 290 brand-country combinations, it varies -- a lot of this varies by each one of those. But in general, we are seeing, as markets reopen, ticket come down a little bit. But the thing that determined a lot of our success going into this was our ability to serve family meals and serve larger tickets. So the brands that had those options like KFC buckets and Pizza Hut meals for sharing tended to do better, and we're not seeing that all go away. I think as you think about the things that happened during COVID, accelerating trends, which ones of those are going to be sticky, I think we expect that ticket will come down from where it's at, but that -- I don't know that it's going to return to its old levels. And we think that's good. 
The same thing could be said for some of the digital business, the increases that we've had in digital, that's going to be stickier and stay in our business. Even in the U.S. as we see dining rooms reopen, we're not seeing, for example, a decline in Taco Bell's digital business. And so we're holding on to those gains. So yes, it's probably fair to expect ticket to start to moderate but not -- I don't know that it's going to return to pre-COVID levels."

I know, David, you had mentioned that Kvantum has been in a couple of markets so far and Tictuk, if I'm saying the name correctly, has been at about 900 stores outside of the U.S. So I'm curious to hear what you expect these platforms to deliver and how you expect them to spread across the globe, what sort of unlock you're expecting for sales. And maybe perhaps dig into what you're seeing in those stores where the technology has been deployed versus stores where that hasn't been the case. And if there's any incremental investment perhaps on headcount in order to see this opportunity scale up across the globe."

If you think about the key areas of our technology strategy, they tie to 2 of those key areas: one being our e-commerce and technology platform. So Tictuk enhances that by giving us one more way, one more channel for customers to easily access our brands through channels like WhatsApp, social media, text messaging. We've had a really good success with it in the nearly 1,000 stores where we've already used Tictuk, and we have high expectations for that team to continue to bring on new markets and expand within each of the brands around the globe. We think it's a great customer experience, really easy to reorder, just a few seconds for those customers. So we're excited about what it does on the platform.
If you then think about another key area of our technology strategy, which is data and analytics and our ability to drive insights, Kvantum fits squarely against that. It brings a new capability in-house that many of our markets around the globe have used to optimize their marketing investments. And so we're excited that they're now continuing to serve more and more of our businesses internally. Both of these, we think, are high return -- they're on the smaller side but high-return acquisitions. And importantly, they create a competitive advantage. And the reason we decided to acquire them is there's also the scale economies that come from being able to apply their capabilities across the breadth of our global business."

We're buying these companies in order to improve our capability and provide services to our franchisees at the lowest possible cost that are really unique proprietary capabilities that we would have. They're not designed to drive a profit for Yum!. We want to provide them at the lowest cost to our franchisees. The return for Yum! comes through top line growth in our franchise units, which leads to more royalty income. 
We think we've really got a great model here where we do these smaller acquisitions, but we can scale them across the world. They have almost no impact on our P&L initially, and then the return comes from growing sales at units, improving franchise economics, which we all know is a virtuous cycle, which leads to more development and healthier franchisees that's really our #1 goal."

Good question, Brian. I think all of this is actually fairly intuitive. Where we're seeing ourselves successful is, for the most part, in developed markets like the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K. for KFC, where they're ahead of the curve a little bit on vaccination, keeping the virus under control, people are back trading and where our business is going into the pandemic had skewed more off-premise to begin with and had well-developed digital and tech capabilities. So that trend is continuing for all the markets really. I think that's something that we're pleased with, is that where we were going, which usually we're a little bit ahead in developed market versus emerging markets, is on point for this environment. 
So conversely, the markets that are struggling are the ones perhaps where we had skewed more dine-in going into the pandemic and where we have maybe government action that is limiting our ability to trade. For example, in some markets, I think, in India, we've got to close our stores now at 3:00 in the afternoon. That's obviously going to have an impact on our business. So less mobility leads to less sales, but we know that those situations will work themselves, hopefully, out sooner rather than later, which is why I think, long term, we're still very confident in the international business and returning to even stronger growth."

And then any color you can give on loyalty for Taco Bell? I know Pizza Hut has a loyalty program. Anything you can tell me about frequency, what that looks like when people join or average spend? Just as loyalty programs become more pervasive, I'm trying to figure out if they're still having the same kind of impact on the business."

Thanks, Sara. I'll take the first part of your question on technology. If you think about it, we do ask ourselves the question of should we build the capability in-house, should we acquire it and bring it in-house or should we contract with an external provider, and we run that test. And we think about, gosh, we should have it in-house -- if it is a strategic competitive advantage with high switching costs, then we need to have that in-house. We then assess our ability to develop it versus the speed of integrating and the opportunity to attract or find a great candidate to acquire. 
Obviously, our ability to develop in-house is terrific right now with Clay Johnson coming onboard over a year ago, plus the strong technology teams that we have at each brand. And that's where you saw the success with the launch of our KFC U.S. e-commerce platform, which we'll continue to expand to other parts of the business. The Tictuk and Kvantum acquisitions, for the reasons we talked about earlier, we think it was the right thing given that we'd already seen the success and the impact they had, had on our system to bring those in-house. 
And then we've got plenty of examples of where we contract with service providers where it's either a less strategic capability or the switching costs are low. So that's how we think about that. And again, as David said, we drive return from these primarily by driving system sales growth and creating better unit economics for our franchisees, which furthers development in the long run."

And past acquisitions that we've done like QuikOrder have really paid off, not only being done as a Pizza Hut acquisition but leveraging the talent and some of the IP across other brands.

And past acquisitions that we've done like QuikOrder have really paid off, not only being done as a Pizza Hut acquisition but leveraging the talent and some of the IP across other brands. So this thing is really -- got all sorts of synergies and benefits as we make the right acquisitions. 
We've also done acquisitions outside of tech, like we bought Collider, a consumer insights company, that has been enormously helpful in us navigating the marketing environment all around the world and making sure we stay connected with consumers. And Collider, in particular, is really excited about the acquisition we did with Kvantum, which will help them come up with insights on the marketing side and then implement those insights most efficiently using Kvantum's algorithms. So a lot of this stuff is going to start to create even more synergies as we put what we believe is going to be the greatest tech team in the restaurant industry together.
On the loyalty side, clearly, the move to digital that we're seeing with the consumer -- with our consumer base really enables us to leverage loyalty in an even bigger way. So Pizza Hut, which has had a loyalty program for quite some time now, it continues to see more and more of their business going through that loyalty program, driven by frequent users that love the program. That's why I mentioned earlier I was so excited about seeing Taco Bell launch their loyalty program. 
It would be hard to do when their digital mix was pretty low. Now that they have a much bigger digital mix, that's a great backdrop for us to engage with loyalty on our Taco Bell customers. And just as we would expect, we're seeing those customers coming back more frequently, excited about the program and giving us a new channel to communicate with them, market to them and grow the business.
I guess that was the last question. I'll just wrap up by saying we're all quite excited about Q1, but we know there's a lot more work to do. I think what you saw in Q1 just demonstrates the resilience of the business, how we're coming out of the pandemic in a lot of markets that are now getting to the other side of this stronger with a better foundation to grow, evidenced by the development progress we made in the quarter. But we all know this is a journey and we haven't reached the finish line. We're not doing a victory dance, but we are very excited about the future.

We've had a strong start to 2021 with solid same-store sales results on a 2-year basis and a meaningful uplift in unit development. This performance is a testament to the incredible focus and dedication of our restaurant teams, franchisees and above-store leaders around the world who are rising above the challenges presented by the pandemic to unlock new areas of growth such as digital and off-premise while putting the needs of our customers and local communities first. 
I've always believed that our success will come from leaning into our core strengths and building new capabilities that enhance our ability to grow, and the way our business has navigated through COVID-19 has only reinforced this belief. This mindset is reflected in our Recipe for Growth and Good framework, which has successfully guided our strategy and will continue to serve as our North Star. Our recipe highlights our unique strength as a company, notably our iconic brands, our unmatched global scale, our diversified network of highly capable and well-capitalized franchisees and our unparalleled culture and talent. 
Today, we'll discuss our Q1 performance through the lens of this framework and the growth drivers that underpin it, and we'll highlight the specific areas where we've introduced new capabilities as we look toward the future. I'll cover 2 growth drivers, namely Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or RED for short; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then Chris will share more details of our Q1 results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
I'll start with a few first quarter highlights. In Q1, Yum! system sales grew 11%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and the addition of 435 net new units during the quarter. Importantly, same-store sales grew 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of nearly 900 or about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q1 2021. This was driven by strong sales performance in North America, the U.K., Australia and Japan, with some offset from COVID-related trading restrictions in parts of Asia and Europe. 
Notably, all 4 of our brands had a weekly per restaurant sales record in the U.S. at least once during the quarter, and I'm very encouraged that on a 2-year basis our overall same-store sales in the U.S. increased 10%. Importantly, each of our brands experienced positive 2-year same-store sales growth on a global basis in open and operating stores during Q1. This is a great indicator for the strength and breadth of our recovery. 
The key focus point for our teams was the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, all geared towards providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands. Delivery has been a significant part of this strategy, and we now have over 39,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, driven by expanded aggregator partnerships and continued investment in our own branded channels. We had another record digital system sales quarter with over $5 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year. 
Now let's talk about our 4 brands, starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit. Q1 system sales grew 11%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. For the division, Q1 same-store sales were flat on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Globally, KFC's digital sales mix reached a record of 43% during the quarter, driven by the rapid expansion of delivery, click and collect and the introduction of new channel ordering options. 
At KFC International, same-store sales grew 7% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 '21. We continue to see strength in the U.K., Australia, Canada and Japan during the quarter and saw encouraging results in the Middle East, Mexico and Africa. Each of these markets performed well above their 2019 sales levels, owing to their off-premise capabilities, digital strength and impressive product launches like the Share Box in Japan and the Chicken Nights promotion in Mexico. 
Next, at KFC U.S., we continue to see positive same-store sales with 14% growth in Q1. Importantly, same-store sales grew 11% on a 2-year basis, thanks to all the team's hard work in building additional sales channels and growing the core business while adding hyper-relevant product innovations such as the new Chicken Sandwich. Our sandwich is performing at more than twice the volumes of our prior U.S. sandwich launches, and all initial indications are that it's highly incremental. Customers are loving the product and coming back more frequently for it. In fact, as we've entered Q2, demand for the new sandwich has been so strong that, coupled with general tightening in domestic chicken supply, our main challenge has been keeping up with that demand. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit, the division reported Q1 system sales growth of 7%, driven by 12% same-store sales growth and a 4% unit decline. Global Q1 same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. 
Overall Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 8%. Same-store sales declined 7% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 10% same-store sales growth for the quarter. Similar to KFC, our developed markets with high off-premise capabilities, digital strength and newsworthy products continued to perform well. 
Pizza Hut U.S. had another stellar quarter, delivering 23% same-store sales growth in the off-premise channel, with 16% overall same-store sales growth. Overall same-store sales grew 8% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021, and was driven by a combination of compelling value with the $10 Tastemaker offer and category-leading innovation with the launch of the unique Detroit Style pizza and the reboot of our iconic Stuffed Crust Pizza. 
As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 36% of our divisional operating profit, Q1 system sales grew 11%, driven by a 9% same-store sales growth and 1% unit growth. For the division, Q1 same-store sales grew 10% on a 2-year basis. The quarter kicked off with the return of Nacho Fries, this time offered in the $5 Nacho Fries Box. We also introduced our first digital-led product launch with the $5 Build Your Own Cravings Box available exclusively on the Taco Bell app or web, which drove a meaningful increase in loyalty memberships during the quarter. 
And finally, our newest brand, The Habit Burger Grill, delivered 13% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth during the quarter. Q1 same-store sales grew 3% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores that were temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. We introduced our new Patty Melt, and our sales growth was aided by reduced government restrictions and government stimulus. Encouragingly, digital sales continued to mix above 40% even as dining rooms reopened and we saw a steady improvement in the dine-in channel throughout the quarter. 
Onto the Recipe for Growth, starting with RED brands. Having 4 brands across more than 50,000 restaurants provides us with an enviable platform to understand how consumers are behaving in every corner of the world and to use that understanding to capture future growth in our sales overnight and our brands over time. In some cases, this means strengthening our ability to grow sales at a faster pace and bringing in strong diverse tech talent. It's with this in mind that we were excited to close on 2 strategic acquisitions during the quarter, being Kvantum Inc. and Tictuk Technologies. 
Kvantum is a true innovator in marketing optimization with a proven track record of adding significant value in enabling data-driven decisions to drive return on advertising dollars and sales increases. We have seen material improvements in both marketing spend efficiencies and same-store sales growth in our Pizza Hut U.K. off-premise and Pizza Hut Taiwan businesses as a result of leveraging their toolkit. And at the end of last year, both Taco Bell U.S. and KFC U.S. engaged Kvantum services on marketing calendar and mix optimization. 
Tictuk presents an exciting opportunity to expand access by providing frictionless ordering through text, social media and other conversational channels in literally just a few clicks. We've deployed their platform in approximately 900 KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants across 35 countries outside of the U.S. and have been thrilled with the agility and customer obsession of the Tictuk team. In fact, we have several examples of customers completing orders on the Tictuk platform in under 10 seconds, a truly seamless experience. 
Beyond their proven capabilities, what excites me most about these acquisitions is the high-quality, culturally aligned teams we've brought into our global organization. This is a perfect segue to our Unrivaled Culture & Talent growth driver. 
Given the environment we've been operating in, we've had to find new ways to connect with the people across our vast global business. One way we've done this is through virtual market visits, where we virtually walk through a restaurant and connect with team members. The leadership team and I attended 4 virtual market visits during the quarter in Pizza Hut Japan, KFC Asia, Taco Bell U.S. in Times Square and KFC Africa. We each left those meetings energized and proud of how our brands are represented around the world and the incredible people that make it all happen. 
Here, I also want to highlight 2 key actions we are taking to bring our Recipe for Growth and Good to life. On the equity and inclusion front in the U.S., we are taking tangible actions to represent the diverse communities where we operate by increasing Black and Latinx employees and leaders in our corporate and restaurant management roles. As part of this effort, we're proud to partner with OneTen, a coalition of leading companies coming together to upskill, hire and advance 1 million Black individuals in America over the next 10 years. These actions advance our global Unlocking Opportunity initiative in the U.S., and we are looking forward to working alongside the community of companies in OneTen as well as our franchisees to advance equity and opportunity. 
Finally, as part of our broader strategy to address climate change, earlier this week, we announced our pledge to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 with a science-based target to reduce emissions by nearly 50% across our supply chain and restaurants by 2030 in partnership with our franchisees, suppliers and producers. This is an incredibly important issue to us, our customers and other stakeholders, and I'm proud of our continued progress in this space. 
To wrap up, I'm encouraged by the momentum in our business as we execute our Recipe for Growth and Good to set ourselves up for the next chapter of growth. Although COVID continues to impact many geographies and make our overall path to recovery uneven, I believe that with our iconic brands, world-class talent, inclusive culture and healthy franchise system, we are poised to enter a post-COVID world even stronger. 
With that, Chris, over to you."

Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
To begin, let's discuss Q1. As David mentioned, overall Yum! system sales grew 11%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 1% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 2%, which includes the negative impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q1 2021. 
EPS excluding special items was $1.07, representing a 67% increase compared to ex-special EPS of $0.64 in Q1 2020. Core operating profit grew 33% in the first quarter. This performance is attributable to a stellar same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable. 
I'll now provide some additional color on several items, starting with Taco Bell. We had another impressive quarter of profitability where company restaurant margins were 24.1%, representing a 1.7% increase over prior year. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, we expect these margins to return closer to historical levels later this year as check averages normalize, dining room patronage increases and we adjust staffing levels at our restaurants as a result. 
During Q1, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due at KFC International and Pizza Hut U.S. These recoveries resulted in a $6 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $34 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $28 million of expense in Q1 2020. While we ended 2020 with $12 million of full year bad debt expense, we had large quarterly swings last year due to COVID. As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to continue to be impacted as we lap bad debt expense of $13 million in Q2 and bad debt recovery of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. While difficult to forecast, at this point, we don't expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full year basis. 
Most importantly, our franchisees are generally on solid financial ground despite the uncertainties caused by COVID. We recently completed the restructuring of our largest Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee, NPC, that resulted in Flynn Restaurant Group joining the Pizza Hut family. We believe our franchisees are well positioned to partner with us as we look to accelerate out of COVID. 
General and administrative expenses were $206 million. We still anticipate the timing of full year 2021 G&A to be back end weighted as it has been historically, and we estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be slightly less than $1 billion for the full year 2021. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs and utilizes our unique scale remains unchanged, and we expect our G&A ratio to move back toward our historical target as sustained growth resumes. Interest expense was approximately $131 million, an increase of 11% compared to Q1 2020, driven by write-offs of historical debt issuance costs and other onetime financing costs associated with the Q1 refinancing. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $25 million for the quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. As a reminder, for 2021, we may be slightly higher than the $250 million gross CapEx amount to catch up spend on repair, maintenance and remodels delayed owing to COVID as well as selective strategic development in the U.S., primarily for The Habit Burger Grill, for which refranchising proceeds may not be fully realized this year. 
Now on to our Unmatched Operating Capability growth driver. With so much of our sales now going through off-premise channels, our operations teams have been laser-focused on delivering a fast, enjoyable experience for customers. As a result, KFC U.S. improved their drive-thru speed by nearly 15 seconds in the quarter over last year, and Taco Bell U.S. delivered their fastest average drive-thru speed in 8 years while serving a staggering 17 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year. Importantly, 1/3 of these additional cars served were digital orders, which typically carry a higher check value, not to mention an optimized customer experience. 
Additionally, we continue to make tangible progress on scaling our in-house built technology platform. During the quarter, we deployed the pickup and delivery ordering solution across all KFC U.S. restaurants, including the launch of our first-ever custom-built KFC app. Early signs are highly encouraging, and this gives us confidence as we look to further optimize and scale the platform. 
Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the first quarter, we opened 660 restaurants and closed 225, resulting in 435 net new units. Most notably, KFC delivered 4% unit growth, with strength in China, India, Russia and Thailand. At Pizza Hut, we were pleased to add 71 net new units, reflecting a positive trajectory following the COVID-related dislocations and closures of last year. We still have more work to do and there will be choppiness related to the uncertainty of COVID and our continuing transition to a more modern estate, but we are encouraged by strong unit economics in many markets and our resilient global franchise base. 
We are also proud to announce that shortly after the quarter ended, we opened our first-ever Taco Bell in Malaysia. Not only was this the 31st international market Taco Bell has entered, but it was the first market entry where all training and launch programs were conducted virtually, a real breakthrough by the amazing Taco Bell Asia team. 
Overall, we are pleased with the momentum at the end of 2020 and into the early part of 2021, and this increases our confidence that we can return to 4% annual unit growth sooner rather than later. In 2021, we're optimistic that we will accomplish at least 3% unit growth. 
Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $560 million excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 4.9x, which returns us to our target of approximately 5x. 
Second, we repurchased 2.6 million shares totaling $275 million at an average price per share of $106. Third, we executed a series of transactions that added resiliency to our business while balancing liquidity, flexibility and cost. During the quarter, we amended and extended our credit facility and refinanced our term loans. 
We also priced a new Yum! Brands, Inc. holding company bond which closed on April 1, subsequent to quarter end. Proceeds from this new bond, which carries a coupon of 4.625% and matures in 2032, will be used to repay $1.05 billion of 5.25% restricted group notes due in 2026, which we intend to retire later in the second quarter. All combined, the transactions were leverage-neutral and importantly, allowed us to boost liquidity, lower interest going forward and extend maturities. As always, we'll continue to look for opportunities to further optimize our capital structure, depending on market and business conditions. Lastly, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

So I'm wondering how you feel those brands are set up for post COVID. Do you think they can lap near flat coming out of this as they lap some of these COVID comparisons? And I think particularly with regard to Pizza Hut, I think people are curious about the health of that system. And obviously, it's a long way -- way is now the concerns of 2019, but franchisee profitability as the unit closures over. Any sort of feelings about the long-term health of that business?"

I think you're right, KFC and Pizza Hut have done a tremendous job navigating this tricky environment over the last year, but very importantly, they've done a great job setting themselves up for future success. A lot of that, as you mentioned, good marketing, the rollout of the KFC sandwich. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but bears repeating, that has been a very successful launch with a great product. It really is a winning product in the category, and we're excited about the impact that will have, along with Secret Recipe Fries that rolled out in the quarter.
But on Pizza Hut specifically, the comment about health is also well put. The Pizza Hut franchisees, over the last year, given the success they've had, the ability to close some of the underperforming dine-in stores that we have been trying to get out of, those -- all of those moves together have strengthened their financial condition in a very big way. And that sets them up for a much better growth going forward. A big part of that is just the ownership of NPC, which we also mentioned. 
Greg Flynn and his organization taking over a good chunk of the Pizza Hut U.S. stores is a huge positive for the brand. They're great restaurant operators, great businessman that has a great team underneath him, knows how to run restaurants as well as anybody in this country. And very excited about the impact he will have taking over those stores and improving their operations, fixing up the assets and growing the business."

Our expectation for all of our brands is to be growing units, and that's been our history and will continue to be our expectation going forward. KFC, we think, has historically been strong, and we want it to continue to be strong. But we have high expectations for Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and The Habit. 
Common across all of them is, we think, strong franchisees, very strong unit economics that improve as the business rebounds from COVID, continued brand love from consumers and ability to serve them on an off-premise basis. Plus you're seeing us now integrate digital into the formats and so post COVID, optimized formats in each of those brands. And so that, coupled with our very strong development teams, we think supports us on that trajectory back. And so we have expectations that we see strength across all of the brands going forward from a development standpoint."

And for Taco Bell, I think there's excitement across the board for everything they've done over the last year under Mark King's leadership and the great talent that we have at the brand and with our franchise partners, one of the strongest franchise",349,"Yes. And for Taco Bell, I think there's excitement across the board for everything they've done over the last year under Mark King's leadership and the great talent that we have at the brand and with our franchise partners, one of the strongest franchise systems you'll ever find. The international development story is one that bears mentioning in terms of the opportunities we have there.
We're starting to see ourselves get to scale in some markets. We always know that when we get to about 100 units in a market, that's when you really can start to unlock development, leverage marketing dollars to really create a virtuous cycle and a better unit economic play. We're starting to see that happen in a few markets around the world, and I think we're excited about the upside there. 
But even in the U.S., we also are leaning more into development as the unit economics look great right now. The opportunities in the U.S. real estate landscape are there, and our franchise partners are financially healthy and eager to go after them in concert with our team and picking the right opportunities that make money for them.
The progress that we've made over the last year on digital is also an important part of the Taco Bell story. We're coming out of 2020 with a great loyalty program and a lot of loyalty members. That progress was made last year as we increased our digital sales. That lays the foundation for more success going forward. We did this first -- the first digital-only promotion of the $5 Create Your Own Box. It's a great example of how having that digital business increasing gives us new tools to grow sales. 
So I think the brand is really hitting on all cylinders. The product innovation is there. Once again, they got something out of fries for the quarter, and they've got a great pipeline of stuff coming down the road. And the future for Taco Bell is incredibly bright with accelerating development growth, a strengthening brand, a great leadership team and great franchise partners."

We had strong gross openings which were in particular driven by a few key markets in Asia, but general strength in openings across the board. You saw in the U.S. fewer closures, and in general, in the Pizza Hut global system, fewer closures than we had last year, which as we said in the prepared remarks, we think reflects a bit of a turn there, although there's still a lot of work to be done on the asset transformation and there's still going to be choppiness from a unit standpoint in the Pizza Hut system. And so those are kind of what drove the shape of development in the quarter. 
As we said, there's still a lot of uncertainty going forward. If you get outside of the U.S., the COVID situation in certain countries is still very dire, and that leads to some unpredictability. That's why we're not yet ready to commit to exactly when we can get back to the 4% number. But we do have enough confidence as we look at the current pipeline to say that we think we'll be at the 3% number at least this year. But again, we've still got a fair bit of uncertainty out there given the global situation."

But the thing that determined a lot of our success going into this was our ability to serve family meals and serve larger tickets. So the brands that had those options like KFC buckets and Pizza Hut meals for sharing tended to do better, and we're not seeing that all go away. I think as you think about the things that happened during COVID, accelerating trends, which ones of those are going to be sticky, I think we expect that ticket will come down from where it's at, but that -- I don't know that it's going to return to its old levels. And we think that's good. 
The same thing could be said for some of the digital business, the increases that we've had in digital, that's going to be stickier and stay in our business. Even in the U.S. as we see dining rooms reopen, we're not seeing, for example, a decline in Taco Bell's digital business. And so we're holding on to those gains. So yes, it's probably fair to expect ticket to start to moderate but not -- I don't know that it's going to return to pre-COVID levels."

We think it's a great customer experience, really easy to reorder, just a few seconds for those customers. So we're excited about what it does on the platform.
If you then think about another key area of our technology strategy, which is data and analytics and our ability to drive insights, Kvantum fits squarely against that. It brings a new capability in-house that many of our markets around the globe have used to optimize their marketing investments.

So conversely, the markets that are struggling are the ones perhaps where we had skewed more dine-in going into the pandemic and where we have maybe government action that is limiting our ability to trade. For example, in some markets, I think, in India, we've got to close our stores now at 3:00 in the afternoon. That's obviously going to have an impact on our business. So less mobility leads to less sales, but we know that those situations will work themselves, hopefully, out sooner rather than later, which is why I think, long term, we're still very confident in the international business and returning to even stronger growth."

And then any color you can give on loyalty for Taco Bell? I know Pizza Hut has a loyalty program. Anything you can tell me about frequency, what that looks like when people join or average spend? Just as loyalty programs become more pervasive, I'm trying to figure out if they're still having the same kind of impact on the business."

I'll take the first part of your question on technology.

Thanks, Sara. I'll take the first part of your question on technology. If you think about it, we do ask ourselves the question of should we build the capability in-house, should we acquire it and bring it in-house or should we contract with an external provider, and we run that test. And we think about, gosh, we should have it in-house -- if it is a strategic competitive advantage with high switching costs, then we need to have that in-house. We then assess our ability to develop it versus the speed of integrating and the opportunity to attract or find a great candidate to acquire. 
Obviously, our ability to develop in-house is terrific right now with Clay Johnson coming onboard over a year ago, plus the strong technology teams that we have at each brand. And that's where you saw the success with the launch of our KFC U.S. e-commerce platform, which we'll continue to expand to other parts of the business. The Tictuk and Kvantum acquisitions, for the reasons we talked about earlier, we think it was the right thing given that we'd already seen the success and the impact they had, had on our system to bring those in-house. 
And then we've got plenty of examples of where we contract with service providers where it's either a less strategic capability or the switching costs are low. So that's how we think about that. And again, as David said, we drive return from these primarily by driving system sales growth and creating better unit economics for our franchisees, which furthers development in the long run."

And past acquisitions that we've done like QuikOrder have really paid off, not only being done as a Pizza Hut acquisition but leveraging the talent and some of the IP across other brands. So this thing is really -- got all sorts of synergies and benefits as we make the right acquisitions. 
We've also done acquisitions outside of tech, like we bought Collider, a consumer insights company, that has been enormously helpful in us navigating the marketing environment all around the world and making sure we stay connected with consumers. And Collider, in particular, is really excited about the acquisition we did with Kvantum, which will help them come up with insights on the marketing side and then implement those insights most efficiently using Kvantum's algorithms. So a lot of this stuff is going to start to create even more synergies as we put what we believe is going to be the greatest tech team in the restaurant industry together.
On the loyalty side, clearly, the move to digital that we're seeing with the consumer -- with our consumer base really enables us to leverage loyalty in an even bigger way. So Pizza Hut, which has had a loyalty program for quite some time now, it continues to see more and more of their business going through that loyalty program, driven by frequent users that love the program. That's why I mentioned earlier I was so excited about seeing Taco Bell launch their loyalty program. 
It would be hard to do when their digital mix was pretty low. Now that they have a much bigger digital mix, that's a great backdrop for us to engage with loyalty on our Taco Bell customers. And just as we would expect, we're seeing those customers coming back more frequently, excited about the program and giving us a new channel to communicate with them, market to them and grow the business.
I guess that was the last question. I'll just wrap up by saying we're all quite excited about Q1, but we know there's a lot more work to do. I think what you saw in Q1 just demonstrates the resilience of the business, how we're coming out of the pandemic in a lot of markets that are now getting to the other side of this stronger with a better foundation to grow, evidenced by the development progress we made in the quarter. But we all know this is a journey and we haven't reached the finish line. We're not doing a victory dance, but we are very excited about the future.

I'm excited to share our strong second quarter results as we delivered record second quarter unit development and 23% same-store sales growth. Importantly, each division reported positive same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis, a step-up from first quarter trends. This sustained momentum was underpinned by our investments in digital and off-premise and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of consumers in an ever-changing environment. 
Though COVID obviously creates a more challenged operating environment, our confidence is stronger than ever in our ability to navigate the resulting uncertainties and in the long-term growth potential of Yum!. As a result, we're reinstating our long-term growth algorithm with 1 important change. We are raising our previous guidance of 4% unit growth to between 4% and 5% unit growth. As a reminder, our long-term growth algorithm includes 2% to 3% same-store sales growth and mid- to high single-digit system sales growth, leading to high single-digit core operating profit growth. The diversification of our global portfolio, the resilience of our business model and the agility of our teams are allowing us to compete and win in a full range of market conditions, including both those markets with accelerated recovery and markets still heavily impacted by COVID. Looking forward, our iconic brands and unmatched scale in combination with the world-class talent in our restaurant teams, franchisees and above store leaders have uniquely positioned us for sustained growth. 
Now we'll discuss our recipe for growth and our Q2 performance and the growth drivers that underpin it. To start, I'll cover 2 growth drivers, namely Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or RED for short, and unrivaled culture and talent. Then Chris will share more details of our Q2 results, our unmatched operating capability and bold restaurant development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. 
First, a few highlights from the quarter. In Q2, Yum! system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth. Importantly, same-store sales grew 4% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of approximately 700 or about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021. This was driven by continued strong sales momentum in North America, the U.K. and Australia with improved performance in Europe as it began to reopen and show signs of recovery. As I mentioned earlier, each of our brands delivered positive 2-year same-store sales growth on a global basis, including the impact of temporary closures, and each brand also reported an improvement in the 2-year trend. This is a great indicator for the sustained strength and breadth of our recovery. Even more exciting is the extremely strong net new unit growth of 603 units that we delivered during the quarter, which was both broad-based and record setting. 
Looking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, we've seen that while the overall is positive, the recovery will neither be consistent from country-to-country nor linear within a country. This insight reinforces the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple on- and off-premise channels. We've seen that increased customer mobility driven by reopening trends and vaccinations contributed to strong performance in many of our markets. A key growth driver for our business and priority for our teams is the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, geared towards providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands. Even as economies continue to reopen, the importance of the off-premise occasion remains a top priority. We delivered a second quarter record with over $5 billion in digital sales, a 35% increase over the prior year. Even more exciting, for the first time on a trailing 12-month basis, we delivered more than $20 billion in [indiscernible] We believe these sales are highly incremental and results from our investments in our digital and technology ecosystem, which enable our teams to deliver an even more RED customer experience. 
To bring the impact of our digital efforts to life, I want to share a few proof points. At Taco Bell U.S., the launch of our Taco Bell Rewards program in 2020 has continued to grow digital sales for the brand with features such as loyalty member exclusives and early access to crave or 
[Audio Gap] 
We're seeing significant uptick in frequency and higher spend per visit leading to an increase in overall spend of 35% for active customers in the Taco Bell Rewards program compared to their preloyalty behavior. As another example, at KFC U.S., we launched our internally built KFC e-commerce website and app in early 2021, replacing our previous third-party solution. As a result, our 2021 digital sales are on pace to soon surpass last year's full year digital sales amount. 
Now let's talk about our RED brands. Starting with the KFC division, which accounts for approximately 51% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 35%, driven by 30% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. At KFC International, same-store sales grew 36% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. We had truly outstanding results in markets leading the recovery with double-digit 2-year same-store sales growth in the U.K., Australia, Canada and the Middle East. Our strong off-premise capabilities, digital strength and value offerings have continued to meet shifting consumer demand around the globe, and there is opportunity for continued recovery as reopening and mobility increases globally. 
Next, at KFC U.S., we continue to see strong momentum with 11% same-store sales growth in Q2. Importantly, same-store sales grew 19% on a 2-year basis, owing to the continued strength of our group occasion business, the digital capabilities mentioned earlier and our new Chicken Sandwich. Our Chicken Sandwich performed exceptionally well and provides us with a solid platform to drive additional sales layers in the future. 
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit, the division reported Q2 system sales growth of 10%, driven by 10% same-store sales growth. While the division had a 3% unit decline versus last year, driven by the elevated COVID-related dislocations and closures of 2020, it has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1. Global Q2 same-store sales grew 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. 
Overall, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 16%. Same-store sales declined 6% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 21% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis for the quarter, and delivery continued to be the primary driver of growth as the shift towards an off-premise model continues in most of our Pizza Hut markets. The top line results from Australia, Canada, Malaysia and our U.K. delivery business are shining examples of what it means to nail the RED brand strategy. These markets continue to unlock off-premise growth opportunities through a focus on value and innovation, a digital-first customer experience and distinctive communications with the help our of magnetic ambassadors, spokespeople who bring our brand to life across the world. 
At Pizza Hut U.S., we continue to see positive same-store sales with 4% overall same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, the off-premise channel grew 18% and overall same-store sales grew 9%, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Pizza Hut also delivered strong product news with the continued success of our iconic Stuffed Crust Pizza and the successful return of a consumer favorite, the Edge Pizza during the quarter. 
As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 31% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 24%, driven by a 21% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 12% on a 2-year basis. The quarter kicked off with the return of the Quesalupa as part of the fan favorite $5 Chalupa Cravings box followed by the relaunch of the iconic Naked Chicken Chalupa. In May, we launched our first-ever global brand campaign, #ISeeATaco in which fans could score a free taco when the moon looked like a taco. We generated over 2 billion impressions and step-change brand awareness, especially in our international markets where we have a tremendous runway for growth. 
And finally, The Habit Burger Grill delivered 31% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Q2 same-store sales grew 7% on a 2-year basis. Importantly, digital sales continued to mix over 35%, only a modest pullback from Q1 even as dining rooms continued reopening and dine-in sales saw a steady improvement throughout the quarter. On the innovation front, we introduced the Brunch Charburger during the quarter, a unique all-day breakfast offering that included crisp, golden tots, house-made secret sauce and a freshly cracked egg. In addition to providing customers with a seamless experience to access our brands, we continue to invest in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate and run a restaurant. As previously announced in the quarter, we've agreed to acquire Dragontail Technologies, a cutting-edge restaurant technology company whose platform is focused on optimizing and managing the entire food preparation process from order through delivery, including automating the kitchen flow, driver dispatch and customer order tracking. The acquisition is subject to various approvals, and we expect to by close the end of the third quarter. We will not be able to comment further on Dragontail today, but you can find additional information in the May 26 press release. 
An important factor of RED brands is having a positive impact and the desire to make good, easy for customers. Our Recipe for Good framework focuses on our commitment to investing in the right recipe today. We were proud to publish our 2020 Recipe for Good report this week, which highlights our strategic investments in truly responsible growth and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and impact on the planet. The report includes updates on our key commitments on critical issues like climate change and equity and inclusion. I'm confident that our plans in these areas have the right ingredients for us to succeed and make a positive impact for our people, franchisees, customers and communities. 
Now to unrivaled culture and talent. Two of our key assets are our iconic brands and the people that bring our brands to life around the world every day. As I've mentioned in previous quarters, COVID has further strengthened the collaboration partnership across our entire system. A great example of this is our relationship with our independent supply chain purchasing co-op in the U.S. RSCS. Many of you probably saw the recent announcement that the CEO of RSCS, Steve McCormick, has made the decision to retire in early 2022 and that RSCS Chief Operating Officer, Todd Imhof, was unanimously selected to succeed Steve in the role of CEO. Steve has had a tremendous and positive impact on our business for nearly a decade, and our entire system is grateful for his leadership. 
At the same time, Todd is the right leader to step into this role and lead the RSCS as moving forward as it continues to provide a true competitive advantage for our entire U.S. business. Our culture unrivaled and talent has always been a towering strength of Yum!, and I'm incredibly proud of our ability to bring our brands and people together in ways we haven't in the past. During the quarter, we hosted several virtual meetings where we fostered collaboration on a global scale for our franchisees and teams, including marketing, planning meetings, ops development programs, a global finance summit, Leaning with Leaders sessions and company-wide chats, just to name a few. It's during these meetings that we realized we are all more alike than we are different and the power that our brands and our culture have to bring people together. 
To wrap up, I'm pleased with the sustained momentum in our business and the agility we've shown in the last year, and I'm optimistic that we are set up to win. Our results demonstrate the resilience of our diversified global business and confidence in our strategies, which are fueled by the underlying health of our franchise system. We're poised to accelerate growth and maximize value creation for all our stakeholders for years to come. 
With that, Chris, over to you."
365997,713077296,2354014,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our unmatched operating capability and bold restaurant development growth drivers and our solid liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, let's discuss Q",1642,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our unmatched operating capability and bold restaurant development growth drivers and our solid liquidity and balance sheet position. 
To begin, let's discuss Q2. Overall, Yum! system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 4%, which includes the negative impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021. We delivered 2% unit growth year-over-year, which included a Q2 record of 603 net new units. EPS, excluding special items, was $1.16, representing a 41% increase compared to ex special EPS of $0.82 in Q2 2020. Core operating profit grew 53% in the second quarter, driven by accelerated same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable. 
At Taco Bell, company restaurant margins were 25.9%, 1.4 points higher than prior year. Favorable sales flow-through was partially offset by labor and commodity inflation as well as increasing semivariable costs as we return to normal operations. As mentioned on our previous call, we expect these margins to return closer to historical pre-COVID levels later this year given inflationary pressures along with increased staffing at our restaurants as a result of increases in dining room patronage and a return toward our historical daypart mix. 
During Q2, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due, primarily led by KFC International. These recoveries resulted in a $4 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $17 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $13 million of expense in Q2 2020. As a reminder, we ended 2020 with $12 million of full year bad debt expense with large quarterly swings due to COVID. As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to be negatively impacted in the second half as we lap bad debt recoveries of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. While difficult to forecast at this point, we still don't expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full year basis. 
General and administrative expenses were $230 million. Full year 2021 G&A is expected to be back-end weighted as it has been historically. We now estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be approximately $1 billion for the full year 2021, a slight increase from our Q1 estimate, attributable to increased incentive-based compensation. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs with our unique scale benefits is unchanged, and we expect our G&A to system sales ratio to move back toward our historic ratio as sustained growth continues. 
Reported interest expense was $159 million, an increase of 21% compared to Q2 2020, driven by a special item charge of $34 million related to early redemption of restricted route bonds during the quarter. Interest expense, ex special, was approximately $125 million, a decrease of 5%, driven by recent refinancing actions and the elimination of revolver balances held in the prior year. We still expect our 2021 interest expense to be approximately $500 million, excluding the previously mentioned $34 million special item charge similar to 2020. We plan to continue to take advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance debt at attractive rates. As a reminder, this will result in higher onetime expenses but will be favorable to interest expense going forward. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $16 million for the quarter. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. As a reminder, for 2021, we may be slightly higher than the $250 million gross CapEx amount to catch up on repair, maintenance and remodels as well as selective strategic development in the U.S. 
Now on to our unmatched operating capability growth driver. Our restaurants are operated by world-class franchisees who are experienced in competing and winning in any environment. It's well known that the U.S. is facing a competitive labor market, which is more pronounced relative to other markets across our diverse global footprint. We and our franchisees are leaning into our unrivaled culture which differentiates our brands to compete in a tight labor market with a focus on retention and recruiting. I'll add some color by sharing examples from our Taco Bell company restaurants. I'll start first with recruitment. We posted hiring parties, which have led to a significant uptick in employee hires. We also launched a fast apply option to make the application process easier and more efficient by reducing the application time from 8 minutes to 2 minutes. On the retention front, we've supported and rewarded our team members by offering a variety of incentives, including paid time off, free family meals and increased employee development activities, to name a few. We've always prioritized investing in our people, and we recognize the importance now more than ever to ensure we maintain focus on our unmatched operating capability to deliver a RED customer experience. 
At the same time, our system is well positioned to sustain strong unit economics while managing the inflationary environment related to labor market dynamics and commodity cost trends. On the commodity front, there is no one better equipped to navigate this environment given our massive cross-brand purchasing scale through our domestic supply chain co-op, RSCS, that gives our franchisees many benefits, including advantaged end-to-end sourcing and supply chain costs. We are also confident in the pricing power of our brands and partner closely with our franchisees as they make strategic pricing decisions in their respective markets to deal with cost pressures while still providing customers with relevant value and distinctive products. 
As David mentioned earlier, we are also prioritizing investments in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate a restaurant while also providing an enhanced customer experience. As an example, Pizza Hut International continues to demonstrate significant momentum on this front as evidenced by increased customer satisfaction metrics. Their improvements are fueled by continued adoption of frictionless restaurant technology, including our in-house intelligent coaching app called HutBot that launched at the end of 2020 and is now live in 40 markets covering 4,000 restaurants. HutBot eases the daily management of our stores with the RGM, leading to a better customer experience. At Taco Bell, we've continued excelling at serving more customers through our drive-thrus. We had our sixth consecutive quarter of under 4-minute drive-thru order to delivery time. Speed for Q2 was 6 seconds faster than Q2 2020. And our team served 4 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year. A huge shout out to our operators and team members for continuing to break records and speed with the increased demand in off-premise. The drive-through experience is an increasingly critical competitive advantage for our brands so these improvements position us well to win going forward. 
That's a perfect segue to our bold restaurant development growth driver, which I'm particularly thrilled to speak about today. Our net new unit growth of 603 during the quarter was broad-based across brands and geographies, making this not only a record quarter, but also capping a record first half. These results speak to the strength of our iconic brands and growing food categories, supported by a healthy, well-capitalized franchise system primed for consistent growth. Most notably, KFC opened 428 net new units during the quarter with significant builds in China, Russia, India, Latin America and Thailand, contributing to 5% unit growth year-over-year. As many of you know, KFC has the first-mover advantage in several emerging markets with a strong domestic footprint upon which to grow. This impressive development quarter from KFC speaks to the power of this global brand and the unit economics that underpin it. Pizza Hut has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1, underpinned by the strength in gross openings and moderating store closures. Pizza Hut opened 99 net new units during the quarter, led by strong development in China, India and Asia. Taco Bell opened 74 net new units. And we're excited to share that Taco Bell International had its best development quarter ever, opening 30 net new units led by Spain and the U.K. In the U.S., we opened our flagship Taco Bell Cantina in Times Square with a digital-forward footprint and personalized experience. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the first half of the year, and we're extremely proud to announce 4% to 5% unit growth guidance, led by development from all 4 brands across our footprint. 
Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position and priorities for capital allocation. We ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $552 million, excluding restricted cash. The strong recovery in EBITDA during Q2 drove our consolidated net leverage down to approximately 4.5x, temporarily below our target of approximately 5x. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares totaling $255 million at an average price per share of $119. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $530 million of shares at an average price of $112. Finally, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. Overall, I'm extremely proud of our Q2 results, the resilience of our business model and the agility of our teams. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

But really that all starts with the unit economics. When our unit economics are good, it's an attractive proposition for our franchisees to build. You saw [indiscernible] last night talk about that. We're seeing that in the vast majority of the world right now, which is what gives us the confidence to make that commitment to 4% to 5% net new unit growth. And just to clarify, that would apply to 2021 as well as 2022 and beyond. As far as domestically, we do think we've talked about this past on calls. We do think that there's upside for KFC and Pizza Hut, particularly in the U.S. Taco Bell is starting to accelerate the development. So that all -- that trend is moving. But KFC and Pizza haven't historically been growing in the U.S., and we think there's every reason in the world they should be net growers and their shift will continue."

You're seeing Taco Bell with strong domestic growth, but you also saw a strong international growth in Taco Bell development. And they are now back on track, running ahead of where they were in 2019. We expect to get to 100 units, for example, in Spain this year and have other markets that are getting to scale. And then you've seen a marked trajectory change in Pizza Hut.

You've seen us make investments in things like Quick Order, Quantum, Tictuk, Dragontail now more recently and then investments in people. So this is something where we've been building up the capability in all aspects. We developed a road map to win in digital, and now we're implementing that. And it's actually been accelerated by COVID, but it's all the things that we were expecting to happen to the business are happening. It's really hard to single out which part of the business is going to benefit most from digital because all of our brands are very rapidly becoming digital brands. You're seeing that in the numbers. Obviously, the brands like Pizza Hut that tend -- that started with a bigger digital base of customers launched loyalty first. They're getting a benefit because it's central to what they do. But really on a growth basis, it's the brands like our other brands that started up from a smaller base that are really getting a big benefit. And it is both the U.S. and an international play. It's widespread and we do think it can fuel the business for a long time to become part of the reason why we've confidently reinstated our long-term growth algorithm."

In the U.S., it is a topic that we and our franchisees are collaborating closely on. We are well positioned to deal with this. First, when we have commodity inflation, as we mentioned in the remarks, we have greater purchasing scale than most players in the industry. RSCS, which leverages purchasing across the brands, gives our franchisees advantaged cost and negotiating capability from a sourcing standpoint. We are also seeing some wage inflation as you mentioned. But when we think about dealing with both of those, the next lever that our franchisees and our brands pull is pricing. And so we are confident that our brands have strong pricing power and our franchisees, who are the ones who actually make those decisions in their restaurants are being very thoughtful about how to do that. They use analytics. They tend to layer these in over time so that they don't get too far ahead of the consumer. And our brands, obviously, are very smart about how they create mix in the menu. I would say we've been very thoughtful and have increased pricing moderately across the brands in the U.S. to deal with this, but we're confident in the ability to continue to pull those levers to deal with this respectively."

So we do think digital is part of our the upside for development as we go forward. And you're also seeing our brands develop new assets that take advantage of that. Taco Bell, the best example of that is the Taco Bell Gold Mobile asset, which is, as you mentioned, the smaller footprint, more reliant on digital and should give our franchisees better unit economics. Obviously, this all starts and ends with franchisee unit economics. And to the extent that digital improves that, it's going to drive development."

I'm excited to share our strong second quarter results as we delivered record second quarter unit development and 23% same-store sales growth. Importantly, each division reported positive same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis, a step-up from first quarter trends. This sustained momentum was underpinned by our investments in digital and off-premise and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of consumers in an ever-changing environment. Though COVID obviously creates a more challenged operating environment, our confidence is stronger than ever in our ability to navigate the resulting uncertainties and in the long-term growth potential of Yum!. 
As a result, we're reinstating our long-term growth algorithm with one important change. We are raising our previous guidance of 4% unit growth to between 4% and 5% unit growth. As a reminder, our long-term growth algorithm includes 2% to 3% same-store sales growth and mid- to high single-digit system sales growth, leading to high single-digit core operating profit growth. The diversification of our global portfolio, the resilience of our business model and the agility of our teams are allowing us to compete and win in a full range of market conditions, including both those markets with accelerated recovery and markets still heavily impacted by COVID. Looking forward, our iconic brands and unmatched scale in combination with the world-class talent in our restaurant teams, franchisees and above-store leaders have uniquely positioned us for sustained growth.  
Now we'll discuss our Recipe for Growth and our Q2 performance and the growth drivers that underpin it. To start, I'll cover 2 growth drivers, namely Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or RED for short; and Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then, Chris will share more details of our Q2 results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position.  
First, a few highlights from the quarter. In Q2, Yum! system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth. Importantly, same-store sales grew 4% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of approximately 700 or about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021. This was driven by continued strong sales momentum in North America, the U.K. and Australia with improved performance in Europe as it began to reopen and show signs of recovery. 
As I mentioned earlier, each of our brands delivered positive 2-year same-store sales growth on a global basis, including the impact of temporary closures, and each brand also reported an improvement in the 2-year trend from Q1. This is a great indicator for the sustained strength and breadth of our recovery. Even more exciting is the extremely strong net new unit growth of 603 units that we delivered during the quarter, which was both broad-based and record-setting.  
Looking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, we've seen that while the overall global trend is positive, the recovery will neither be consistent from country-to-country nor linear within a country. This insight reinforces the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple on- and off-premise channels. We've seen that increased customer mobility driven by reopening trends and vaccinations contributed to strong performance in many of our markets. 
A key growth driver for our business and priority for our teams is the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, geared towards providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands. Even as economies continue to reopen, the importance of the off-premise occasion remains a top priority. We delivered a second quarter record with over $5 billion in digital sales, a 35% increase over the prior year. Even more exciting, for the first time on a trailing 12-month basis, we delivered more than $20 billion in digital sales. We believe these sales are highly incremental and results from our investments in our digital and technology ecosystem, which enable our teams to deliver an even more RED customer experience.  
To bring the impact of our digital efforts to life, I want to share a few proof points. At Taco Bell U.S., the launch of our Taco Bell rewards program in 2020 has continued to grow digital sales for the brand with features such as loyalty member exclusives and early access to crave-worthy promotions. We're incredibly excited by the early results from the program and the future growth opportunity that remains. We're seeing significant uptick in frequency and higher spend per visit, leading to an increase in overall spend of 35% for active customers in the Taco Bell rewards program compared to their pre-loyalty behavior. 
As another example, at KFC U.S., we launched our internally built KFC e-commerce website and app in early 2021, replacing our previous third-party solution. As a result, our 2021 digital sales are on pace to soon surpass last year's full year digital sales amount.  
Now let's talk about our RED brands. Starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for approximately 51% of our divisional operating profit. Q2 system sales grew 35%, driven by 30% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. 
At KFC International, same-store sales grew 36% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. We had truly outstanding results in markets leading the recovery with double-digit 2-year same-store sales growth in the U.K., Australia, Canada and the Middle East. Our strong off-premise capabilities, digital strength and value offerings have continued to meet shifting consumer demand around the globe, and there is opportunity for continued recovery as reopening and mobility increases globally.  
Next, at KFC U.S., we continue to see strong momentum with 11% same-store sales growth in Q2. Importantly, same-store sales grew 19% on a 2-year basis, owing to the continued strength of our group occasion business, the digital capabilities mentioned earlier and our new chicken sandwich. Our chicken sandwich performed exceptionally well and provides us with a solid platform to drive additional sales layers in the future.  
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit. The division reported Q2 system sales growth of 10%, driven by 10% same-store sales growth. While the division had a 3% unit decline versus last year, driven by the elevated COVID-related dislocations and closures of 2020, it has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1. Global Q2 same-store sales grew 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. 
Overall, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 16%. Same-store sales declined 6% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 21% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis for the quarter, and delivery continued to be the primary driver of growth as the shift towards an off-premise model continues in most of our Pizza Hut markets. 
The top line results from our Australia, Canada, Malaysia and our U.K. delivery business are shining examples of what it means to nail the RED brand strategy. These markets continue to unlock off-premise growth opportunities through a focus on value and innovation, a digital-first customer experience and distinctive communications with the help of our magnetic ambassadors spokespeople who bring our brand to life across the world.  
At Pizza Hut U.S., we continue to see positive same-store sales with 4% overall same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, the off-premise channel grew 18% and overall same-store sales grew 9%, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Pizza Hut also delivered strong product news with the continued success of our iconic Stuffed Crust Pizza and the successful return of a consumer favorite, The Edge pizza, during the quarter.  
As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 31% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 24%, driven by a 21% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 12% on a 2-year basis. The quarter kicked off with the return of the Quesalupa as part of the fan favorite $5 chalupa cravings box, followed by the relaunch of the iconic Naked Chicken Chalupa. In May, we launched our first-ever global brand campaign, #ISeeATaco, in which fans could score a free taco when the moon looked like a taco. We've generated over 2 billion impressions and step-change brand awareness, especially in our international markets where we have a tremendous runway for growth.  
And finally, The Habit Burger Grill delivered 31% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Q2 same-store sales grew 7% on a 2-year basis. Importantly, digital sales continued to mix over 35%, only a modest pullback from Q1 even as dining rooms continued reopening and dine-in sales saw a steady improvement throughout the quarter. On the innovation front, we introduced the Brunch Charburger during the quarter, a unique all-day breakfast offering that included crisp golden tots, house-made secret sauce and a freshly cracked egg. 
In addition to providing customers with a seamless experience to access our brands, we continue to invest in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate and run a  restaurant. As previously announced in the quarter, we've agreed to acquire Dragontail Technologies, a cutting-edge restaurant technology company whose platform is focused on optimizing and managing the entire food preparation process from order through delivery, including automating the kitchen flow, driver dispatch and customer order tracking. The acquisition is subject to various approvals, and we expect to by close the end of the third quarter. We will not be able to comment further on Dragontail today, but you can find additional information in the May 26 press release.  
An important factor of RED brands is having a positive impact and the desire to make good easy for customers. Our Recipe for Good framework focuses on our commitment to investing in the right recipe today. We were proud to publish our 2020 Recipe for Good report this week, which highlights our strategic investments in socially responsible growth and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and impact on the planet. The report includes updates on our key commitments on critical issues like climate change and equity and inclusion. I'm confident that our plans in these areas have the right ingredients for us to succeed and make a positive impact for our people, franchisees, customers and communities.  
Now to Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Two of our key assets are our iconic brands and the people that bring our brands to life around the world every day. As I've mentioned in previous quarters, COVID has further strengthened the collaboration and partnership across our entire system. A great example of this is our relationship with our independent supply chain purchasing co-op in the U.S., RSCS. 
Many of you probably saw the recent announcement that the CEO of RSCS, Steve McCormick, has made the decision to retire in early 2022 and that RSCS Chief Operating Officer, Todd Imhoff, was unanimously selected to succeed Steve in the role of CEO. Steve has had a tremendous and positive impact on our business for nearly a decade, and our entire system is grateful for his leadership. At the same time, Todd is the right leader to step into this role and lead the RSCS moving forward as it continues to provide a true competitive advantage for our entire U.S. business. 
Our Unrivaled Culture and Talent has always been a towering strength of Yum!, and I'm incredibly proud of our ability to bring our brands and people together in ways we haven't in the past. During the quarter, we hosted several virtual meetings where we fostered collaboration on a global scale for our franchisees and teams, including marketing planning meetings, ops development programs, a global finance summit, Lean in with Leaders sessions and company-wide chats, just to name a few. It's during these meetings that we realize we are all more alike than we are different and the power that our brands and our culture have to bring people together.  
To wrap up, I'm pleased with the sustained momentum in our business and the agility we've shown in the last year, and I'm optimistic that we are set up to win. Our results demonstrate the resilience of our diversified global business and confidence in our strategies which are fueled by the underlying health of our franchise system. We're poised to accelerate growth and maximize value creation for all our stakeholders for years to come.  
With that, Chris, over to you."
365997,713077296,2354293,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our solid liquidity and balance sheet position.  To begin, let's discuss",1640,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our solid liquidity and balance sheet position.  
To begin, let's discuss Q2. Overall Yum! system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 4%, which includes the negative impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021. We delivered 2% unit growth year-over-year, which included a Q2 record of 603 net new units. 
EPS excluding special items was $1.16, representing a 41% increase compared to ex-special EPS of $0.82 in Q2 2020. Core operating profit grew 53% in the second quarter, driven by accelerated same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable.  
At Taco Bell, company restaurant margins were 25.9%, 1.4 points higher than prior year. Favorable sales flow-through was partially offset by labor and commodity inflation as well as increasing semi-variable costs as we return to normal operations. As mentioned on our previous call, we expect these margins to return closer to historical pre-COVID levels later this year, given inflationary pressures along with increased staffing at our restaurants as a result of increases in dining room patronage and a return toward our historical daypart mix.  
During Q2, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due, primarily led by KFC International. These recoveries resulted in a $4 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $17 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $13 million of expense in Q2 2020. As a reminder, we ended 2020 with $12 million of full year bad debt expense with large quarterly swings due to COVID. As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to be negatively impacted in the second half as we lap bad debt recoveries of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. While difficult to forecast, at this point, we still don't expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full year basis.  
General and administrative expenses were $230 million. Full year 2021 G&A is expected to be back-end weighted as it has been historically. We now estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be approximately $1 billion for the full year 2021, a slight increase from our Q1 estimate, attributable to increased incentive-based compensation. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs with our unique scale benefits is unchanged, and we expect our G&A to system sales ratio to move back toward our historic ratio as sustained growth continues.  
Reported interest expense was $159 million, an increase of 21% compared to Q2 2020, driven by a special item charge of $34 million related to early redemption of restricted group bonds during the quarter. Interest expense ex special was approximately $125 million, a decrease of 5%, driven by recent refinancing actions and the elimination of revolver balances held in the prior year. We still expect our 2021 interest expense to be approximately $500 million, excluding the previously mentioned $34 million special item charge, similar to 2020. We plan to continue to take advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance debt at attractive rates. As a reminder, this will result in higher onetime expenses but will be favorable to interest expense going forward.  
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $16 million for the quarter. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. As a reminder, for 2021, we may be slightly higher than the $250 million gross CapEx amount to catch up on repair, maintenance and remodels as well as selective strategic development in the U.S.  
Now on to our Unmatched Operating Capability growth driver. Our restaurants are operated by world-class franchisees who are experienced in competing and winning in any environment. It's well known that the U.S. is facing a competitive labor market, which is more pronounced relative to other markets across our diverse global footprint. We and our franchisees are leaning into our unrivaled culture which differentiates our brands to compete in a tight labor market with a focus on retention and recruiting. I'll add some color by sharing examples from our Taco Bell company restaurants. 
I'll start first with recruitment. We've hosted hiring parties, which have led to a significant uptick in employee hires. We also launched a fast apply option to make the application process easier and more efficient by reducing the application time from 8 minutes to 2 minutes. 
On the retention front, we've supported and rewarded our team members by offering a variety of incentives, including paid time-off, free family meals and increased employee development activities, to name a few. We've always prioritized investing in our people and we recognize the importance now more than ever to ensure we maintain focus on our unmatched operating capability to deliver a RED customer experience. 
At the same time, our system is well positioned to sustain strong unit economics while managing the inflationary environment related to labor market dynamics and commodity cost trends. On the commodity front, there is no one better equipped to navigate this environment given our massive cross-brand purchasing scale through our domestic supply chain co-op, RSCS, that gives our franchisees many benefits, including advantaged end-to-end sourcing and supply chain costs. We are also confident in the pricing power of our brands and partner closely with our franchisees as they make strategic pricing decisions in their respective markets to deal with cost pressures while still providing customers with relevant value and distinctive products.  
As David mentioned earlier, we are also prioritizing investments in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate a restaurant while also providing an enhanced customer experience. As an example, Pizza Hut International continues to demonstrate significant momentum on this front as evidenced by increased customer satisfaction metrics. Their improvements are fueled by continued adoption of frictionless restaurant technology, including our in-house intelligent coaching app called HutBot that launched at the end of 2020 and is now live in 40 markets, covering 4,000 restaurants. HutBot eases the daily management of our stores for the RGM, leading to a better customer experience. 
At Taco Bell, we've continued excelling at serving more customers through our drive-thrus. We had our sixth consecutive quarter of under 4-minute drive-thru order to delivery time. Speed for Q2 was 6 seconds faster than Q2 2020, and our team served 4 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year. A huge shout out to our operators and team members for continuing to break records and speed with the increased demand in off-premise. The drive-thru experience is an increasingly critical competitive advantage for our brands so these improvements position us well to win going forward.  
That's a perfect segue to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver, which I'm particularly thrilled to speak about today. Our net new unit growth of 603 during the quarter was broad-based across brands and geographies, making this not only a record quarter but also capping a record first half. These results speak to the strength of our iconic brands in growing food categories, supported by a healthy, well-capitalized franchise system primed for sustained growth. 
Most notably, KFC opened 428 net new units during the quarter with significant builds in China, Russia, India, Latin America and Thailand, contributing to 5% unit growth year-over-year. As many of you know, KFC has the first-mover advantage in several emerging markets with a strong domestic footprint upon which to grow. This impressive development quarter from KFC speaks to the power of this global brand and the unit economics that underpin it. 
Pizza Hut has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1, underpinned by the strength in gross openings and moderating store closures. Pizza Hut opened 99 net new units during the quarter, led by strong development in China, India and Asia. 
Taco Bell opened 74 net new units. And we're excited to share that Taco Bell International had its best development quarter ever, opening 30 net new units, led by Spain and the U.K. In the U.S., we opened our flagship Taco Bell Cantina in Times Square with a digital-forward footprint and personalized experience. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the first half of the year, and we're extremely proud to announce 4% to 5% unit growth guidance, led by development from all 4 brands across our footprint.  
Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position and priorities for capital allocation. We ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $552 million, excluding restricted cash. The strong recovery in EBITDA during Q2 drove our consolidated net leverage down to approximately 4.5x, temporarily below our target of approximately 5x. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares totaling $255 million at an average price per share of $119. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $530 million of shares at an average price of $112. Finally, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. 
Overall, I'm extremely proud of our Q2 results, the resilience of our business model and the agility of our teams. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

What time frame is reasonable to expect? Could this become visible in '22, for example? 
And just specifically on the KFC brand domestically, it's doing very well on a same-store sales basis. I don't think there's been a lot of development though over the last several years. How do you think about domestic development specifically or generally playing into that? And in the KFC brand, specifically, do you see opportunity here in the U.S. just given the repositioning of that brand?"

Yes, obviously, we're excited about net new unit development. And as you know, we do have a lot of visibility into the pipeline of our -- of development because it takes about 12 months to plant the seed of development before you get to the opening. So we're working with our franchise partners around the world to get that visibility, understand what's coming down the pike, and that's what gives us the increasing confidence. 
But really, that all starts with the unit economics. When our unit economics are good, it's an attractive proposition for our franchisees to build. You saw Yum China last night talk about that. We're seeing that in the vast majority of the world right now, which is what gives us the confidence to make that commitment to 4% to 5% net unit -- new unit growth. And just to clarify, that would apply to 2021 as well as 2022 and beyond. 
As far as domestically, we do think -- and we've talked about this past on calls. We do think that there's upside for KFC and Pizza Hut particularly in the U.S. Taco Bell is starting to accelerate the development. So that went all -- that trend is moving. But KFC and Pizza haven't historically been growing in the U.S., and we think there's every reason in the world they should be net growers. And they're shifting into that in 2021, and we think that will continue."

You're seeing Taco Bell with strong domestic growth, but you also saw strong international growth in Taco Bell development. And they are now back on track, running ahead of where they were in 2019. We expect to get to 100 units, for example, in Spain this year and have other markets that are getting to scale.

As far as the second question on catch-up units, certainly, there were some units that were put on hold in 2020 that have opened in 2021, no doubt. And that's helping us get to the number for 2021 because we had to restart the development engine. But by issuing the guidance as part of our long-term algorithm, we're obviously clearly trying to signal that we think that will continue into 2022 with organic growth, again, based on the factors I mentioned earlier, strong unit economics, healthy franchisees, strong brands all around the world in general."

The KFC International business obviously showed quarter-over-quarter improvement in the 2-year trends, which we're excited about and we think reflects the strength of the brand across its markets. You do see differences depending on the COVID situation and the state of each of those markets in that business. 
More developed markets where we're seeing recovery advance are running further ahead, where you've got more customer mobility and fewer restrictions on operating hours, those sorts of things for our restaurants and where the footprint is more off-premise ready. And so if you look at markets like the U.K., for example, running incredibly strong, north of 40% growth in the quarter. The emerging markets have a bit of a longer tail on recovery. And so that's what you're seeing. But in general, great trend and improvement over the entire KFC International business."

I'm wondering if that's an interesting reason why multiyear growth might be higher coming out of COVID as the headwinds from COVID directly ease. For example, I think the digital order mix was 20 points higher at global KFC versus pre-COVID levels, at least earlier in this year. So I'm wondering, what brands, and maybe broken out by U.S. versus international, do you see the digital step-up proving to be the biggest help to multiyear sales growth in '22 and beyond or whenever we finally have COVID headwinds ease?"

We've been making investments and developed a long-term strategy for how to win in digital for many years now, so this is starting to pay off. 
It's not something that happened overnight. You've seen us make investments in things like QuikOrder, Kvantum, Tictuk, Dragontail now more recently and then investments in people. So this is something where we've been building up the capability in all aspects. We developed a road map to win in digital, and now we're implementing that. And it's actually been accelerated by COVID. But it's all the things that we were expecting to happen to the business are happening. 
It's really hard to single out which part of the business is going to benefit most from digital because all of our brands are very rapidly becoming digital brands. You're seeing that in the numbers. Obviously, the brands like Pizza Hut that tend to -- that started with a bigger digital base of customers, launched loyalty first, they're getting a benefit because it's so central to what they do. But really, on a growth basis, it's the brands like -- our other brands that started up from a smaller base that are really getting a big benefit. 
And it is both a U.S. and an international play. It's widespread. And we do think it can fuel the business for a long time to come, part of the reason why we've confidently reinstated our long-term growth algorithm."

In the U.S., the -- it is a topic that we and our franchisees are collaborating closely on. We are well positioned to deal with this. First, when we have commodity inflation, as we mentioned in the remarks, we have greater purchasing scale than most players in the industry. RSCS, which leverages purchasing across the brands, gives our franchisees advantaged cost and negotiating capability from a sourcing standpoint. 
We are also seeing some wage inflation, as you mentioned. But when we think about dealing with both of those, the next lever that our franchisees and our brands pull is pricing. And so we are confident that our brands have strong pricing power. And our franchisees, who are the ones who actually make those decisions in their restaurants, are being very thoughtful about how to do that. 
They use analytics. They tend to layer these in over time so that they don't get too far ahead of the consumer. And our brands obviously are very smart about how they create mix in the menu. I would say we've been very thoughtful and have increased pricing moderately across the brands in the U.S. to deal with this, but we're confident in the ability to continue to pull those levers to deal with this effectively."

It's going to give you better unit economics when you have higher check and less labor associated with the check and stickier customers, by the way. So we do think digital is part of our -- the upside for development as we go forward. 
And you're also seeing our brands develop new assets that take advantage of that. Taco Bell -- the best example of that is the Taco Bell Go Mobile asset, which is, as you mentioned, a smaller footprint, more reliant on digital and should give our franchisees better unit economics. Obviously, this all starts and ends with franchisee unit economics. And to the extent that digital improves that, it's going to drive development."

And through COVID, both Pizza Hut U.S. and Pizza Hut International have continued to drive progress on that front. If we take Pizza Hut U.S. specifically, you saw last year that we drove a number of closures in the system that did move our mix of delco assets by a few percentage points. So we're continuing to make progress on that transformation. 
There's still further to go so we're going to continue to drive that. But in terms of net unit count, you've seen a change in that trajectory. We were actually slightly positive this quarter in Pizza Hut U.S., which we think reflects the improved unit economics in the U.S. that stem from the strength of the brand. And then across both Pizza Hut U.S. and across Pizza Hut International, you're continuing to see strong growth in off-premise, roughly 20% in both -- I think we were 18% in Pizza Hut U.S. on a 2-year basis and 21% in Pizza Hut International. 
So we think the strategy is working. We think the brand is strengthening. Still more work to go on continuing to transition the asset base, but we've seen a change in trajectory on unit count."

I'm excited to share our strong second quarter results as we delivered record second quarter unit development and 23% same-store sales growth. Importantly, each division reported positive same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis, a step-up from first quarter trends. This sustained momentum was underpinned by our investments in digital and off-premise and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of consumers in an ever-changing environment. 
Though COVID obviously creates a more challenged operating environment, our confidence is stronger than ever in our ability to navigate the resulting uncertainties and in the long-term growth potential of Yum! As a result, we're reinstating our long-term growth algorithm with one important change. We are raising our previous guidance of 4% unit growth to between 4% and 5% unit growth. As a reminder, our long-term growth algorithm includes 2% to 3% same-store sales growth and mid- to high single-digit system sales growth, leading to high single-digit core operating profit growth. 
The diversification of our global portfolio, the resilience of our business model and the agility of our teams are allowing us to compete and win in a full range of market conditions, including both those markets with accelerated recovery and markets still heavily impacted by COVID. Looking forward, our iconic brands and unmatched scale, in combination with the world-class talent in our restaurant teams, franchisees and above-store leaders, have uniquely positioned us for sustained growth.  
Now we'll discuss our Recipe for Growth and our Q2 performance and the growth drivers that underpin it. To start, I'll cover 2 growth drivers, namely Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or RED for short; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then, Chris will share more details of our Q2 results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position.  
First, a few highlights from the quarter. In Q2, Yum! system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth. Importantly, same-store sales grew 4% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of approximately 700 or about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021. This was driven by continued strong sales momentum in North America, the U.K. and Australia with improved performance in Europe as it began to reopen and show signs of recovery. 
As I mentioned earlier, each of our brands delivered positive 2-year same-store sales growth on a global basis, including the impact of temporary closures, and each brand also reported an improvement in the 2-year trend from Q1. This is a great indicator for the sustained strength and breadth of our recovery. Even more exciting is the extremely strong net new unit growth of 603 units that we delivered during the quarter, which was both broad-based and record-setting.  
Looking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, we've seen that while the overall global trend is positive, the recovery will neither be consistent from country-to-country nor linear within a country. This insight reinforces the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple on- and off-premise channels. We've seen that increased customer mobility driven by reopening trends and vaccinations contributed to strong performance in many of our markets. 
A key growth driver for our business and priority for our teams is the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, geared towards providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands. Even as economies continue to reopen, the importance of the off-premise occasion remains a top priority. We delivered a second quarter record with over $5 billion in digital sales, a 35% increase over the prior year. Even more exciting, for the first time on a trailing 12-month basis, we delivered more than $20 billion in digital sales. We believe these sales are highly incremental and result from our investments in our digital and technology ecosystem, which enable our teams to deliver an even more RED customer experience.  
To bring the impact of our digital efforts to life, I want to share a few proof points. At Taco Bell U.S., launch of our Taco Bell rewards program in 2020 has continued to grow digital sales for the brand with features such as loyalty member exclusives and early access to crave-worthy promotions. We're incredibly excited by the early results from the program and the future growth opportunity that remains. We're seeing significant uptick in frequency and higher spend per visit, leading to an increase in overall spend of 35% for active customers in the Taco Bell rewards program compared to their preloyalty behavior. 
As another example, at KFC U.S., we launched our internally built KFC e-commerce website and app in early 2021, replacing our previous third-party solution. As a result, our 2021 digital sales are on pace to soon surpass last year's full year digital sales amount.  
Now let's talk about our RED brands. Starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for approximately 51% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 35% driven by 30% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. 
At KFC International, same-store sales grew 36% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. We had truly outstanding results in markets leading the recovery with double-digit 2-year same-store sales growth in the U.K., Australia, Canada and the Middle East. Our strong off-premise capabilities, digital strength and value offerings have continued to meet shifting consumer demand around the globe, and there is opportunity for continued recovery as reopening and mobility increases globally.  
Next, at KFC U.S., we continued to see strong momentum with 11% same-store sales growth in Q2. Importantly, same-store sales grew 19% on a 2-year basis, owing to the continued strength of our group occasion business, the digital capabilities mentioned earlier and our new chicken sandwich. Our chicken sandwich performed exceptionally well and provides us with a solid platform to drive additional sales layers in the future.  
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit, the division reported Q2 system sales growth of 10%, driven by 10% same-store sales growth. While the division had a 3% unit decline versus last year, driven by the elevated COVID-related dislocations and closures of 2020, it has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1. Global Q2 same-store sales grew 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. 
Overall, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 16%. Same-store sales declined 6% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 21% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis for the quarter, and delivery continued to be the primary driver of growth as the shift towards an off-premise model continues in most of our Pizza Hut markets. 
The top line results from our Australia, Canada, Malaysia and our U.K. delivery business are shining examples of what it means to nail the RED brand strategy. These markets continue to unlock off-premise growth opportunities through a focus on value and innovation, a digital-first customer experience and distinctive communications with the help of our magnetic ambassadors, spokespeople who bring our brand to life across the world.  
At Pizza Hut U.S., we continued to see positive same-store sales with 4% overall same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, the off-premise channel grew 18%, and overall same-store sales grew 9%, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Pizza Hut also delivered strong product news with the continued success of our iconic Stuffed Crust Pizza and the successful return of a consumer favorite, The Edge pizza, during the quarter.  
As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 31% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 24%, driven by a 21% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 12% on a 2-year basis. The quarter kicked off with the return of the Quesalupa as part of the fan favorite $5 chalupa cravings box, followed by the relaunch of the iconic Naked Chicken Chalupa. In May, we launched our first-ever global brand campaign, #ISeeATaco, in which fans could score a free taco when the moon looked like a taco. We've generated over 2 billion impressions and step-change brand awareness, especially in our international markets where we have a tremendous runway for growth.  
And finally, The Habit Burger Grill delivered 31% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Q2 same-store sales grew 7% on a 2-year basis. Importantly, digital sales continued to mix over 35%, only a modest pullback from Q1 even as dining rooms continued reopening and dine-in sales saw a steady improvement throughout the quarter. On the innovation front, we introduced the Brunch Charburger during the quarter, a unique all-day breakfast offering that included crisp golden tots, house-made secret sauce and a freshly cracked egg. 
In addition to providing customers with a seamless experience to access our brands, we continue to invest in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate and run a  restaurant. As previously announced in the quarter, we've agreed to acquire Dragontail Technologies, a cutting-edge restaurant technology company, whose platform is focused on optimizing and managing the entire food preparation process from order through delivery, including automating the kitchen flow, driver dispatch and customer order tracking. The acquisition is subject to various approvals, and we expect to by close the end of the third quarter. We will not be able to comment further on Dragontail today, but you can find additional information in the May 26 press release. 
An important factor of RED brands is having a positive impact and the desire to make good easy for customers. Our Recipe for Good framework focuses on our commitment to investing in the right recipe today. We were proud to publish our 2020 Recipe for Good report this week, which highlights our strategic investments in socially responsible growth and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and impact on the planet. The report includes updates on our key commitments on critical issues like climate change and equity and inclusion. I'm confident that our plans in these areas have the right ingredients for us to succeed and make a positive impact for our people, franchisees, customers and communities. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Two of our key assets are our iconic brands and the people that bring our brands to life around the world every day. As I've mentioned in previous quarters, COVID has further strengthened the collaboration and partnership across our entire system. A great example of this is our relationship with our independent supply chain purchasing co-op in the U.S., RSCS. Many of you probably saw the recent announcement that the CEO of RSCS, Steve McCormick, has made the decision to retire in early 2022 and that RSCS Chief Operating Officer, Todd Imhoff, was unanimously selected to succeed Steve in the role of CEO. Steve has had a tremendous and positive impact on our business for nearly a decade, and our entire system is grateful for his leadership. At the same time, Todd is the right leader to step into this role and lead the RSCS moving forward as it continues to provide a true competitive advantage for our entire U.S. business. 
Our Unrivaled Culture & Talent has always been a towering strength of Yum!, and I'm incredibly proud of our ability to bring our brands and people together in ways we haven't in the past. During the quarter, we hosted several virtual meetings where we fostered collaboration on a global scale for our franchisees and teams, including marketing planning meetings, ops development programs, a global finance summit, Lean in with Leaders sessions and company-wide chats, just to name a few. It's during these meetings that we realize we are all more alike than we are different and the power that our brands and our culture have to bring people together.  
To wrap up, I'm pleased with the sustained momentum in our business and the agility we've shown in the last year, and I'm optimistic that we are set up to win. Our results demonstrate the resilience of our diversified global business and confidence in our strategies which are fueled by the underlying health of our franchise system. We're poised to accelerate growth and maximize value creation for all our stakeholders for years to come.  
With that, Chris, over to you."
365997,713077296,2359661,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our solid liquidity and balance sheet position.  To begin, let's discuss",1639,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our solid liquidity and balance sheet position.  
To begin, let's discuss Q2. Overall Yum! system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 4%, which includes the negative impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021. We delivered 2% unit growth year-over-year, which included a Q2 record of 603 net new units. 
EPS excluding special items was $1.16, representing a 41% increase compared to ex special EPS of $0.82 in Q2 2020. Core operating profit grew 53% in the second quarter, driven by accelerated same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable. 
At Taco Bell, company restaurant margins were 25.9%, 1.4 points higher than prior year. Favorable sales flow-through was partially offset by labor and commodity inflation as well as increasing semi-variable costs as we return to normal operations. As mentioned on our previous call, we expect these margins to return closer to historical pre-COVID levels later this year given inflationary pressures along with increased staffing at our restaurants as a result of increases in dining room patronage and a return toward our historical daypart mix.  
During Q2, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due, primarily led by KFC International. These recoveries resulted in a $4 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $17 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $13 million of expense in Q2 2020. As a reminder, we ended 2020 with $12 million of full year bad debt expense with large quarterly swings due to COVID. As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to be negatively impacted in the second half as we lap bad debt recoveries of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. While difficult to forecast, at this point, we still don't expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full year basis.  
General and administrative expenses were $230 million. Full year 2021 G&A is expected to be back-end weighted, as it has been historically. We now estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be approximately $1 billion for the full year 2021, a slight increase from our Q1 estimate, attributable to increased incentive-based compensation. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs with our unique scale benefits is unchanged, and we expect our G&A to system sales ratio to move back toward our historic ratio as sustained growth continues.  
Reported interest expense was $159 million, an increase of 21% compared to Q2 2020, driven by a special item charge of $34 million related to early redemption of restricted group bonds during the quarter. Interest expense ex special was approximately $125 million, a decrease of 5%, driven by recent refinancing actions and the elimination of revolver balances held in the prior year. We still expect our 2021 interest expense to be approximately $500 million, excluding the previously mentioned $34 million special item charge, similar to 2020. We plan to continue to take advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance debt at attractive rates. As a reminder, this will result in higher onetime expenses but will be favorable to interest expense going forward. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $16 million for the quarter. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. As a reminder, for 2021, we may be slightly higher than the $250 million gross CapEx amount to catch up on repair, maintenance and remodels as well as selective strategic development in the U.S.  
Now on to our Unmatched Operating Capability growth driver. Our restaurants are operated by world-class franchisees who are experienced in competing and winning in any environment. It's well known that the U.S. is facing a competitive labor market, which is more pronounced relative to other markets across our diverse global footprint. We and our franchisees are leaning into our unrivaled culture, which differentiates our brands to compete in a tight labor market with a focus on retention and recruiting. I'll add some color by sharing examples from our Taco Bell company restaurants. 
I'll start first with recruitment. We've hosted hiring parties, which have led to a significant uptick in employee hires. We also launched a fast apply option to make the application process easier and more efficient by reducing the application time from 8 minutes to 2 minutes. On the retention front, we've supported and rewarded our team members by offering a variety of incentives, including paid time off, free family meals and increased employee development activities, to name a few. We've always prioritized investing in our people, and we recognize the importance now more than ever to ensure we maintain focus on our Unmatched Operating Capability to deliver a RED customer experience. 
At the same time, our system is well positioned to sustain strong unit economics while managing the inflationary environment related to labor market dynamics and commodity cost trends. On the commodity front, there is no one better equipped to navigate this environment given our massive cross-brand purchasing scale through our domestic supply chain co-op, RSCS, that gives our franchisees many benefits, including advantaged end-to-end sourcing and supply chain costs. We are also confident in the pricing power of our brands and partner closely with our franchisees as they make strategic pricing decisions in their respective markets to deal with cost pressures while still providing customers with relevant value and distinctive products.  
As David mentioned earlier, we are also prioritizing investments in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate a restaurant while also providing an enhanced customer experience. As an example, Pizza Hut International continues to demonstrate significant momentum on this front, as evidenced by increased customer satisfaction metrics. Their improvements are fueled by continued adoption of frictionless restaurant technology, including our in-house intelligent coaching app called HutBot that launched at the end of 2020 and is now live in 40 markets, covering 4,000 restaurants. HutBot eases the daily management of our stores for the RGM, leading to a better customer experience. 
At Taco Bell, we've continued excelling at serving more customers through our drive-thrus. We had our sixth consecutive quarter of under 4-minute drive-thru order-to-delivery time. Speed for Q2 was 6 seconds faster than Q2 2020, and our team served 4 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year. A huge shout-out to our operators and team members for continuing to break records and speed with the increased demand in off-premise. The drive-thru experience is an increasingly critical competitive advantage for our brands, so these improvements position us well to win going forward.  
That's a perfect segue to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver, which I'm particularly thrilled to speak about today. Our net new unit growth of 603 during the quarter was broad-based across brands and geographies, making this not only a record quarter but also capping a record first half. These results speak to the strength of our iconic brands in growing food categories, supported by a healthy, well-capitalized franchise system primed for sustained growth. 
Most notably, KFC opened 428 net new units during the quarter with significant builds in China, Russia, India, Latin America and Thailand, contributing to 5% unit growth year-over-year. As many of you know, KFC has the first-mover advantage in several emerging markets with a strong domestic footprint upon which to grow. This impressive development quarter from KFC speaks to the power of this global brand and the unit economics that underpin it. 
Pizza Hut has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1, underpinned by the strength in gross openings and moderating store closures. Pizza Hut opened 99 net new units during the quarter, led by strong development in China, India and Asia. 
Taco Bell opened 74 net new units. And we're excited to share that Taco Bell International had its best development quarter ever, opening 30 net new units, led by Spain and the U.K. In the U.S., we opened our flagship Taco Bell Cantina in Times Square with a digital-forward footprint and personalized experience. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the first half of the year, and we're extremely proud to announce 4% to 5% unit growth guidance, led by development from all 4 brands across our footprint.  
Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position and priorities for capital allocation. We ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $552 million, excluding restricted cash. The strong recovery in EBITDA during Q2 drove our consolidated net leverage down to approximately 4.5x, temporarily below our target of approximately 5x. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares totaling $255 million at an average price per share of $119. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $530 million of shares at an average price of $112. Finally, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. 
Overall, I'm extremely proud of our Q2 results, the resilience of our business model and the agility of our teams. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

What time frame is reasonable to expect? Could this become visible in '22, for example? 
And just specifically on the KFC brand domestically, it's doing very well on a same-store sales basis. I don't think there's been a lot of development though over the last several years. How do you think about domestic development specifically or generally playing into that? And in the KFC brand, specifically, do you see opportunity here in the U.S. just given the repositioning of that brand?"

Yes, obviously, we're excited about net new unit development. And as you know, we do have a lot of visibility into the pipeline of our -- of development because it takes about 12 months to plant the seed of development before you get the opening. So we're working with our franchise partners around the world to get that visibility, understand what's coming down the pipe, and that's what gives us the increasing confidence. 
But really, that all starts with the unit economics. When our unit economics are good, it's an attractive proposition for our franchisees to build. You saw Yum China last night talk about that. We're seeing that in the vast majority of the world right now, which is what gives us the confidence to make that commitment to 4% to 5% net unit -- new unit growth. And just to clarify, that would apply to 2021 as well as 2022 and beyond. 
As far as domestically, we do think -- and we've talked about this past on calls, we do think that there's upside for KFC and Pizza Hut, particularly in the U.S. Taco Bell has started to accelerate the development. So that went all -- that train is moving. But KFC and Pizza Hut haven't historically been growing in the U.S., and we think there's every reason in the world they should be net growers. And they're shifting into that in 2021, and we think that will continue."

And we expect them to continue to be the leader. 
But we have high expectations for the other brands. You're seeing Taco Bell with strong domestic growth, but you also saw strong international growth in Taco Bell development. And they are now back on track, running ahead of where they were in 2019. We expect to get to 100 units, for example, in Spain this year and have other markets that are getting to scale. 
And then you've seen a marketed -- marked trajectory change in Pizza Hut. We took last year to drive our asset transformation strategy. We made some closures that helped accelerate that. And now you've seen the trajectory change in plus 99 in Pizza Hut this year. So we have high expectations for growth across all the brands."

As far as the second question on catch-up units, certainly, there were some units that were put on hold in 2020 that have opened in 2021, no doubt. And that's helping us get to the number for 2021 because we had to restart the development engine. But by issuing the guidance as part of our long-term algorithm, we're obviously clearly trying to signal that we think that will continue into 2022 with organic growth, again, based on the factors I mentioned earlier: strong unit economics, healthy franchisees, strong brands all around the world in general."

More developed markets where we're seeing recovery advance are running further ahead, where you've got more customer mobility and fewer restrictions on operating hours, those sorts of things for our restaurants and where the footprint is more off-premise ready. And so if you look at markets like the U.K., for example, running incredibly strong, north of 40% growth in the quarter. The emerging markets have a bit of a longer tail on recovery.

We've been making investments and developed a long-term strategy for how to win in digital for many years now, so this is starting to pay off. 
It's not something that happened overnight. You've seen us make investments in things like QuikOrder, Kvantum, Tictuk, Dragontail now more recently and then investments in people. So this is something where we've been building up the capability in all aspects. We've developed a road map to win in digital, and now we're implementing that. And it's actually been accelerated by COVID. But it's all the things that we were expecting to happen to the business are happening. 
It's really hard to single out which part of the business is going to benefit most from digital because all of our brands are very rapidly becoming digital brands. You're seeing that in the numbers. Obviously, the brands like Pizza Hut that tend to -- that started with a bigger digital base of customers, launched loyalty first, they're getting a benefit because it's so central to what they do. But really, on a growth basis, it's the brands like our other brands that started up from a smaller base that are really getting a big benefit.

First, when we have commodity inflation, as we mentioned in the remarks, we have greater purchasing scale than most players in the industry. RSCS, which leverages purchasing across the brands, gives our franchisees advantaged cost and negotiating capability from a sourcing standpoint. 
We are also seeing some wage inflation, as you mentioned. But when we think about dealing with both of those, the next lever that our franchisees and our brands pull is pricing. And so we are confident that our brands have strong pricing power. And our franchisees, who are the ones who actually make those decisions in their restaurants, are being very thoughtful about how to do that. They use analytics. They tend to layer these in over time so that they don't get too far ahead of the consumer. And our brands, obviously, are very smart about how they create mix in the menu. I would say we've been very thoughtful and have increased pricing moderately across the brands in the U.S. to deal with this, but we're confident in the ability to continue to pull those levers to deal with this effectively."

It's going to give you better unit economics when you have higher check and less labor associated with the check and stickier customers, by the way. So we do think digital is part of our -- the upside for development as we go forward. 
And you're also seeing our brands develop new assets that take advantage of that. Taco Bell -- the best example of that is the Taco Bell Go Mobile asset, which is, as you mentioned, a smaller footprint, more reliant on digital and should give our franchisees better unit economics. Obviously, this all starts and ends with franchisee unit economics. And to the extent that digital improves that, it's going to drive development."

The Pizza Hut strategy, as we've talked about over the last few years, has been to revitalize the brand and drive an asset transformation that is focused on a modern off-premise business. And through COVID, both Pizza Hut U.S. and Pizza Hut International have continued to drive progress on that front. If we take Pizza Hut U.S. specifically, you saw last year that we drove a number of closures in the system that did move our mix of delco assets by a few percentage points. So we're continuing to make progress on that transformation. 
There's still further to go so we're going to continue to drive that. But in terms of net unit count, you've seen a change in that trajectory. We were actually slightly positive this quarter in Pizza Hut U.S., which we think reflects the improved unit economics in the U.S. that stem from the strength of the brand. And then across both Pizza Hut U.S. and across Pizza Hut International, you're continuing to see strong growth in off-premise, roughly 20% in both. I think we were 18% in Pizza Hut U.S. on a 2-year basis and 21% in Pizza Hut International. 
So we think the strategy is working. We think the brand is strengthening. Still more work to go on continuing to transition the asset base, but we've seen a change in trajectory on unit count."

I'm excited to share our strong second quarter results as we delivered record second quarter unit development and 23% same-store sales growth. Importantly, each division reported positive same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis, a step-up from first quarter trends. This sustained momentum was underpinned by our investments in digital and off-premise and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of consumers in an ever-changing environment. 
Though COVID obviously creates a more challenged operating environment, our confidence is stronger than ever in our ability to navigate the resulting uncertainties and in the long-term growth potential of Yum! As a result, we're reinstating our long-term growth algorithm with one important change. We are raising our previous guidance of 4% unit growth to between 4% and 5% unit growth. As a reminder, our long-term growth algorithm includes 2% to 3% same-store sales growth and mid- to high single-digit system sales growth, leading to high single-digit core operating profit growth. 
The diversification of our global portfolio, the resilience of our business model and the agility of our teams are allowing us to compete and win in a full range of market conditions, including both those markets with accelerated recovery and markets still heavily impacted by COVID. Looking forward, our iconic brands and unmatched scale, in combination with the world-class talent in our restaurant teams, franchisees and above-store leaders, have uniquely positioned us for sustained growth.  
Now we'll discuss our Recipe for Growth and our Q2 performance and the growth drivers that underpin it. To start, I'll cover 2 growth drivers, namely Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or RED for short; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then, Chris will share more details of our Q2 results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position.  
First, a few highlights from the quarter. In Q2, Yum! system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth. Importantly, same-store sales grew 4% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of approximately 700 or about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021. This was driven by continued strong sales momentum in North America, the U.K. and Australia with improved performance in Europe as it began to reopen and show signs of recovery. 
As I mentioned earlier, each of our brands delivered positive 2-year same-store sales growth on a global basis, including the impact of temporary closures, and each brand also reported an improvement in the 2-year trend from Q1. This is a great indicator for the sustained strength and breadth of our recovery. Even more exciting is the extremely strong net new unit growth of 603 units that we delivered during the quarter, which was both broad-based and record-setting.  
Looking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, we've seen that while the overall global trend is positive, the recovery will neither be consistent from country-to-country nor linear within a country. This insight reinforces the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple on- and off-premise channels. We've seen that increased customer mobility driven by reopening trends and vaccinations contributed to strong performance in many of our markets. 
A key growth driver for our business and priority for our teams is the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, geared towards providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands. Even as economies continue to reopen, the importance of the off-premise occasion remains a top priority. We delivered a second quarter record with over $5 billion in digital sales, a 35% increase over the prior year. Even more exciting, for the first time on a trailing 12-month basis, we delivered more than $20 billion in digital sales. We believe these sales are highly incremental and result from our investments in our digital and technology ecosystem, which enable our teams to deliver an even more RED customer experience.  
To bring the impact of our digital efforts to life, I want to share a few proof points. At Taco Bell U.S., launch of our Taco Bell rewards program in 2020 has continued to grow digital sales for the brand with features such as loyalty member exclusives and early access to crave-worthy promotions. We're incredibly excited by the early results from the program and the future growth opportunity that remains. We're seeing significant uptick in frequency and higher spend per visit, leading to an increase in overall spend of 35% for active customers in the Taco Bell rewards program compared to their preloyalty behavior. 
As another example, at KFC U.S., we launched our internally built KFC e-commerce website and app in early 2021, replacing our previous third-party solution. As a result, our 2021 digital sales are on pace to soon surpass last year's full year digital sales amount.  
Now let's talk about our RED brands. Starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for approximately 51% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 35% driven by 30% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. 
At KFC International, same-store sales grew 36% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. We had truly outstanding results in markets leading the recovery with double-digit 2-year same-store sales growth in the U.K., Australia, Canada and the Middle East. Our strong off-premise capabilities, digital strength and value offerings have continued to meet shifting consumer demand around the globe, and there is opportunity for continued recovery as reopening and mobility increases globally.  
Next, at KFC U.S., we continued to see strong momentum with 11% same-store sales growth in Q2. Importantly, same-store sales grew 19% on a 2-year basis, owing to the continued strength of our group occasion business, the digital capabilities mentioned earlier and our new chicken sandwich. Our chicken sandwich performed exceptionally well and provides us with a solid platform to drive additional sales layers in the future.  
Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit, the division reported Q2 system sales growth of 10%, driven by 10% same-store sales growth. While the division had a 3% unit decline versus last year, driven by the elevated COVID-related dislocations and closures of 2020, it has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1. Global Q2 same-store sales grew 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. 
Overall, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 16%. Same-store sales declined 6% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 21% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis for the quarter, and delivery continued to be the primary driver of growth as the shift towards an off-premise model continues in most of our Pizza Hut markets. 
The top line results from our Australia, Canada, Malaysia and our U.K. delivery business are shining examples of what it means to nail the RED brand strategy. These markets continue to unlock off-premise growth opportunities through a focus on value and innovation, a digital-first customer experience and distinctive communications with the help of our magnetic ambassadors, spokespeople who bring our brand to life across the world.  
At Pizza Hut U.S., we continued to see positive same-store sales with 4% overall same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, the off-premise channel grew 18%, and overall same-store sales grew 9%, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Pizza Hut also delivered strong product news with the continued success of our iconic Stuffed Crust Pizza and the successful return of a consumer favorite, The Edge pizza, during the quarter.  
As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 31% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 24%, driven by a 21% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 12% on a 2-year basis. The quarter kicked off with the return of the Quesalupa as part of the fan favorite $5 chalupa cravings box, followed by the relaunch of the iconic Naked Chicken Chalupa. In May, we launched our first-ever global brand campaign, #ISeeATaco, in which fans could score a free taco when the moon looked like a taco. We've generated over 2 billion impressions and step-change brand awareness, especially in our international markets where we have a tremendous runway for growth.  
And finally, The Habit Burger Grill delivered 31% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Q2 same-store sales grew 7% on a 2-year basis. Importantly, digital sales continued to mix over 35%, only a modest pullback from Q1 even as dining rooms continued reopening and dine-in sales saw a steady improvement throughout the quarter. On the innovation front, we introduced the Brunch Charburger during the quarter, a unique all-day breakfast offering that included crisp golden tots, house-made secret sauce and a freshly cracked egg. 
In addition to providing customers with a seamless experience to access our brands, we continue to invest in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate and run a  restaurant. As previously announced in the quarter, we've agreed to acquire Dragontail Technologies, a cutting-edge restaurant technology company, whose platform is focused on optimizing and managing the entire food preparation process from order through delivery, including automating the kitchen flow, driver dispatch and customer order tracking. The acquisition is subject to various approvals, and we expect to by close the end of the third quarter. We will not be able to comment further on Dragontail today, but you can find additional information in the May 26 press release. 
An important factor of RED brands is having a positive impact and the desire to make good easy for customers. Our Recipe for Good framework focuses on our commitment to investing in the right recipe today. We were proud to publish our 2020 Recipe for Good report this week, which highlights our strategic investments in socially responsible growth and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and impact on the planet. The report includes updates on our key commitments on critical issues like climate change and equity and inclusion. I'm confident that our plans in these areas have the right ingredients for us to succeed and make a positive impact for our people, franchisees, customers and communities. 
Now to Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Two of our key assets are our iconic brands and the people that bring our brands to life around the world every day. As I've mentioned in previous quarters, COVID has further strengthened the collaboration and partnership across our entire system. A great example of this is our relationship with our independent supply chain purchasing co-op in the U.S., RSCS. Many of you probably saw the recent announcement that the CEO of RSCS, Steve McCormick, has made the decision to retire in early 2022 and that RSCS Chief Operating Officer, Todd Imhoff, was unanimously selected to succeed Steve in the role of CEO. Steve has had a tremendous and positive impact on our business for nearly a decade, and our entire system is grateful for his leadership. At the same time, Todd is the right leader to step into this role and lead the RSCS moving forward as it continues to provide a true competitive advantage for our entire U.S. business. 
Our Unrivaled Culture & Talent has always been a towering strength of Yum!, and I'm incredibly proud of our ability to bring our brands and people together in ways we haven't in the past. During the quarter, we hosted several virtual meetings where we fostered collaboration on a global scale for our franchisees and teams, including marketing planning meetings, ops development programs, a global finance summit, Lean in with Leaders sessions and company-wide chats, just to name a few. It's during these meetings that we realize we are all more alike than we are different and the power that our brands and our culture have to bring people together.  
To wrap up, I'm pleased with the sustained momentum in our business and the agility we've shown in the last year, and I'm optimistic that we are set up to win. Our results demonstrate the resilience of our diversified global business and confidence in our strategies which are fueled by the underlying health of our franchise system. We're poised to accelerate growth and maximize value creation for all our stakeholders for years to come.  
With that, Chris, over to you."

Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our solid liquidity and balance sheet position.  To begin, let's discuss",1639,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our solid liquidity and balance sheet position.  
To begin, let's discuss Q2. Overall Yum! system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 4%, which includes the negative impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021. We delivered 2% unit growth year-over-year, which included a Q2 record of 603 net new units. 
EPS excluding special items was $1.16, representing a 41% increase compared to ex special EPS of $0.82 in Q2 2020. Core operating profit grew 53% in the second quarter, driven by accelerated same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable. 
At Taco Bell, company restaurant margins were 25.9%, 1.4 points higher than prior year. Favorable sales flow-through was partially offset by labor and commodity inflation as well as increasing semi-variable costs as we return to normal operations. As mentioned on our previous call, we expect these margins to return closer to historical pre-COVID levels later this year given inflationary pressures along with increased staffing at our restaurants as a result of increases in dining room patronage and a return toward our historical daypart mix.  
During Q2, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due, primarily led by KFC International. These recoveries resulted in a $4 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $17 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $13 million of expense in Q2 2020. As a reminder, we ended 2020 with $12 million of full year bad debt expense with large quarterly swings due to COVID. As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to be negatively impacted in the second half as we lap bad debt recoveries of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. While difficult to forecast, at this point, we still don't expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full year basis.  
General and administrative expenses were $230 million. Full year 2021 G&A is expected to be back-end weighted, as it has been historically. We now estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be approximately $1 billion for the full year 2021, a slight increase from our Q1 estimate, attributable to increased incentive-based compensation. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs with our unique scale benefits is unchanged, and we expect our G&A to system sales ratio to move back toward our historic ratio as sustained growth continues.  
Reported interest expense was $159 million, an increase of 21% compared to Q2 2020, driven by a special item charge of $34 million related to early redemption of restricted group bonds during the quarter. Interest expense ex special was approximately $125 million, a decrease of 5%, driven by recent refinancing actions and the elimination of revolver balances held in the prior year. We still expect our 2021 interest expense to be approximately $500 million, excluding the previously mentioned $34 million special item charge, similar to 2020. We plan to continue to take advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance debt at attractive rates. As a reminder, this will result in higher onetime expenses but will be favorable to interest expense going forward. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $16 million for the quarter. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. As a reminder, for 2021, we may be slightly higher than the $250 million gross CapEx amount to catch up on repair, maintenance and remodels as well as selective strategic development in the U.S.  
Now on to our Unmatched Operating Capability growth driver. Our restaurants are operated by world-class franchisees who are experienced in competing and winning in any environment. It's well known that the U.S. is facing a competitive labor market, which is more pronounced relative to other markets across our diverse global footprint. We and our franchisees are leaning into our unrivaled culture, which differentiates our brands to compete in a tight labor market with a focus on retention and recruiting. I'll add some color by sharing examples from our Taco Bell company restaurants. 
I'll start first with recruitment. We've hosted hiring parties, which have led to a significant uptick in employee hires. We also launched a fast apply option to make the application process easier and more efficient by reducing the application time from 8 minutes to 2 minutes. On the retention front, we've supported and rewarded our team members by offering a variety of incentives, including paid time off, free family meals and increased employee development activities, to name a few. We've always prioritized investing in our people, and we recognize the importance now more than ever to ensure we maintain focus on our Unmatched Operating Capability to deliver a RED customer experience. 
At the same time, our system is well positioned to sustain strong unit economics while managing the inflationary environment related to labor market dynamics and commodity cost trends. On the commodity front, there is no one better equipped to navigate this environment given our massive cross-brand purchasing scale through our domestic supply chain co-op, RSCS, that gives our franchisees many benefits, including advantaged end-to-end sourcing and supply chain costs. We are also confident in the pricing power of our brands and partner closely with our franchisees as they make strategic pricing decisions in their respective markets to deal with cost pressures while still providing customers with relevant value and distinctive products.  
As David mentioned earlier, we are also prioritizing investments in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate a restaurant while also providing an enhanced customer experience. As an example, Pizza Hut International continues to demonstrate significant momentum on this front, as evidenced by increased customer satisfaction metrics. Their improvements are fueled by continued adoption of frictionless restaurant technology, including our in-house intelligent coaching app called HutBot that launched at the end of 2020 and is now live in 40 markets, covering 4,000 restaurants. HutBot eases the daily management of our stores for the RGM, leading to a better customer experience. 
At Taco Bell, we've continued excelling at serving more customers through our drive-thrus. We had our sixth consecutive quarter of under 4-minute drive-thru order-to-delivery time. Speed for Q2 was 6 seconds faster than Q2 2020, and our team served 4 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year. A huge shout-out to our operators and team members for continuing to break records and speed with the increased demand in off-premise. The drive-thru experience is an increasingly critical competitive advantage for our brands, so these improvements position us well to win going forward.  
That's a perfect segue to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver, which I'm particularly thrilled to speak about today. Our net new unit growth of 603 during the quarter was broad-based across brands and geographies, making this not only a record quarter but also capping a record first half. These results speak to the strength of our iconic brands in growing food categories, supported by a healthy, well-capitalized franchise system primed for sustained growth. 
Most notably, KFC opened 428 net new units during the quarter with significant builds in China, Russia, India, Latin America and Thailand, contributing to 5% unit growth year-over-year. As many of you know, KFC has the first-mover advantage in several emerging markets with a strong domestic footprint upon which to grow. This impressive development quarter from KFC speaks to the power of this global brand and the unit economics that underpin it. 
Pizza Hut has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1, underpinned by the strength in gross openings and moderating store closures. Pizza Hut opened 99 net new units during the quarter, led by strong development in China, India and Asia. 
Taco Bell opened 74 net new units. And we're excited to share that Taco Bell International had its best development quarter ever, opening 30 net new units, led by Spain and the U.K. In the U.S., we opened our flagship Taco Bell Cantina in Times Square with a digital-forward footprint and personalized experience. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the first half of the year, and we're extremely proud to announce 4% to 5% unit growth guidance, led by development from all 4 brands across our footprint.  
Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position and priorities for capital allocation. We ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $552 million, excluding restricted cash. The strong recovery in EBITDA during Q2 drove our consolidated net leverage down to approximately 4.5x, temporarily below our target of approximately 5x. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares totaling $255 million at an average price per share of $119. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $530 million of shares at an average price of $112. Finally, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. 
Overall, I'm extremely proud of our Q2 results, the resilience of our business model and the agility of our teams. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

What time frame is reasonable to expect? Could this become visible in '22, for example? 
And just specifically on the KFC brand domestically, it's doing very well on a same-store sales basis. I don't think there's been a lot of development though over the last several years. How do you think about domestic development specifically or generally playing into that? And in the KFC brand, specifically, do you see opportunity here in the U.S. just given the repositioning of that brand?"

Yes, obviously, we're excited about net new unit development.

So we're working with our franchise partners around the world to get that visibility, understand what's coming down the pipe, and that's what gives us the increasing confidence. 
But really, that all starts with the unit economics. When our unit economics are good, it's an attractive proposition for our franchisees to build. You saw Yum China last night talk about that. We're seeing that in the vast majority of the world right now, which is what gives us the confidence to make that commitment to 4% to 5% net unit -- new unit growth. And just to clarify, that would apply to 2021 as well as 2022 and beyond. 
As far as domestically, we do think -- and we've talked about this past on calls, we do think that there's upside for KFC and Pizza Hut, particularly in the U.S. Taco Bell has started to accelerate the development. So that went all -- that train is moving. But KFC and Pizza Hut haven't historically been growing in the U.S., and we think there's every reason in the world they should be net growers. And they're shifting into that in 2021, and we think that will continue."

And they are now back on track, running ahead of where they were in 2019. We expect to get to 100 units, for example, in Spain this year and have other markets that are getting to scale. 
And then you've seen a marketed -- marked trajectory change in Pizza Hut. We took last year to drive our asset transformation strategy. We made some closures that helped accelerate that.

As far as the second question on catch-up units, certainly, there were some units that were put on hold in 2020 that have opened in 2021, no doubt. And that's helping us get to the number for 2021 because we had to restart the development engine.

More developed markets where we're seeing recovery advance are running further ahead, where you've got more customer mobility and fewer restrictions on operating hours, those sorts of things for our restaurants and where the footprint is more off-premise ready. And so if you look at markets like the U.K., for example, running incredibly strong, north of 40% growth in the quarter. The emerging markets have a bit of a longer tail on recovery.

So this is something where we've been building up the capability in all aspects. We've developed a road map to win in digital, and now we're implementing that. And it's actually been accelerated by COVID. But it's all the things that we were expecting to happen to the business are happening. 
It's really hard to single out which part of the business is going to benefit most from digital because all of our brands are very rapidly becoming digital brands. You're seeing that in the numbers. Obviously, the brands like Pizza Hut that tend to -- that started with a bigger digital base of customers, launched loyalty first, they're getting a benefit because it's so central to what they do.

In the U.S., the -- it is a topic that we and our franchisees are collaborating closely on. We are well positioned to deal with this. First, when we have commodity inflation, as we mentioned in the remarks, we have greater purchasing scale than most players in the industry. RSCS, which leverages purchasing across the brands, gives our franchisees advantaged cost and negotiating capability from a sourcing standpoint. 
We are also seeing some wage inflation, as you mentioned. But when we think about dealing with both of those, the next lever that our franchisees and our brands pull is pricing. And so we are confident that our brands have strong pricing power. And our franchisees, who are the ones who actually make those decisions in their restaurants, are being very thoughtful about how to do that. They use analytics. They tend to layer these in over time so that they don't get too far ahead of the consumer. And our brands, obviously, are very smart about how they create mix in the menu. I would say we've been very thoughtful and have increased pricing moderately across the brands in the U.S. to deal with this, but we're confident in the ability to continue to pull those levers to deal with this effectively."

There's still further to go so we're going to continue to drive that. But in terms of net unit count, you've seen a change in that trajectory.

365997,1675682294,2415470,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share our strong third quarter results underpinned by record-breaking unit development, continued strong digital sales and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of our consumers in an",1983,"Thank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share our strong third quarter results underpinned by record-breaking unit development, continued strong digital sales and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of our consumers in an ever-changing environment. 
During the third quarter, we delivered 5% same-store sales growth or 3% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis. Despite a challenging operating environment due to the ongoing COVID pandemic, I'm extremely proud that we opened 760 net new units, a Q3 record with broad-based strength across our portfolio. While Yum! China continues to be a leader in development, we opened 379 net new units across the rest of our portfolio roughly equivalent to our Q3 2019 global net new units, including China. Our continued positive development momentum this quarter is a testament to the strength of our iconic brands, fueled by strong unit economics and a healthy, well-capitalized franchise system primed for sustained growth. 
Now we'll discuss our Q3 results and 2 of the 4 growth drivers that underpin our recipe for growth: our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or RED for short, and our unrivaled culture and talent. I will also share an update on our ESG agenda, which we call our Recipe for Good. Then Chris will talk about our other 2 growth drivers: our unmatched operating capability and bold restaurant development, in addition to providing more details on our third quarter financial performance and our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. 
First, a few highlights from the quarter. Overall, Yum! third quarter system sales grew 8%, led by same-store sales growth of 5%. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 3%, which includes the impact of around 500 stores or 1% temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q3. COVID restrictions and limited mobility in a few markets, primarily in Asia, had a significant impact on sales. However, our sales momentum remained strong as evidenced by the fact that our global 2-year same-store sales growth, excluding Asia, accelerated since last quarter. 
Sales strength continued in many developed markets, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada with significant recovery seen across Europe as restrictions eased throughout the quarter. We've also seen pockets of strength in our portfolio of emerging markets, including the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and India, to name a few. 
As we previously shared, looking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, our recovery will neither be consistent from country to country nor linear within a country, reinforcing the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple on- and off-premise channels. A key growth driver for our business remains the continued acceleration of our digital and technology strategy, including how we leverage our global scale with technology investments to enhance the customer and employee experience, strengthen restaurant unit economics and provide a competitive advantage for our franchisees. 
We're seeing strong and sustained momentum through our digital and off-premise channels across our global business, even as customers return to our dining rooms. We posted over $5 billion in global digital sales with a near 40% digital mix during Q3. We continue to expand delivery capabilities across the globe, setting a record this quarter with over 41,000 stores offering delivery to our customers. 
Most recently, we acquired Dragontail Systems, which will allow us to tap into the power of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process and further enhance our delivery capabilities. Where we've deployed Dragontail's cutting-edge technology, we found that it makes it easier for team members to operate and run a restaurant and helps our franchisees strengthen store operations, all resulting in a better customer experience. 
This is the perfect segue to talk about our 4 RED brands. Starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for 52% of our operating profit Q3 system sales grew 11%, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, Q3 same-store sales were up 1%, which included the impact of 1% of the stores being temporarily closed due to COVID. At KFC International, same-store sales grew 6% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis. 
As previously mentioned, increased COVID case counts and limited mobility in a few key Asian markets pressured top line trends in the quarter. This quarter, several Western European markets joined the group of resilient market leading the recovery where sales have fully recovered to pre-COVID levels. Strong digital and off-premise growth, newsworthy products and doubling down on value offerings have fueled top line growth in these markets, coupled with the continued strength of the chicken category across the QSR segment goal. 
Next, at KFC U.S., same-store sales grew 4% during the quarter, while same-store sales increased 13% on a 2-year basis. The continued success of our Chicken Sandwich and the strength of the group occasion remains significant drivers of our same-store sales growth. Additionally, as of July, our year-to-date digital sales in the U.S. surpassed our full year 2020 digital sales, which speaks to the results we're seeing from our investments in this critical growth channel. 
Now on to the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 17% of our operating profit. Q3 system sales grew 4%, driven by 1% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. For the division, 2-year same-store sales grew 1% during the quarter, which included the impact of 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3 2021. Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 6% during the quarter. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales declined 4%. 
While our Pizza Hut International business continues to be pressured given our substantial dine-in mix, the sustained strength in our off-premise business, as reflected by 21% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis, bodes well for the future of the brand and continues to fuel franchisee interest in investing in assets focused on serving the off-premise occasion. Our markets continue to demonstrate what it means to be RED by focusing on strong value propositions and innovative partnerships, including beyond meat product offerings in 2 markets this quarter. 
At Pizza Hut U.S., we continue to see positive momentum with 2% same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 8%, and the off-premise channel grew 17%. Pizza Hut continues to delight customers by bringing only from Pizza Hut premium innovation with the launch of the Edge Pizza and the return of the successful Detroit style pizza in Q3. Additionally, we promoted the Big Dinner Box during back-to-school season to offer an easy dinner solution for our Pizza Hut customers. 
Moving on to Taco Bell, which accounts for 31% of our operating profit. Third quarter system sales grew 8%, driven by 3% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. Two-year same-store sales growth was 8% for the quarter. Taco Bell continues to focus on long-term growth opportunities by expanding into multiple category entry points, including the relaunch of Breakfast in August and the Fried Chicken category with the Crispy Chicken Sandwich Taco during the quarter. 
Meanwhile, Taco Bell International remains focused on their mission to make tacos cool around the world, while also ensuring the brand is culturally relevant in each market. In the U.K., we gave away free tacos to the country to celebrate England advancing to the finals in the European championship. Players on the English team even tweeted on behalf of the brand, resulting in Taco Bell being one of the top trending brands on Twitter during the finals. 
And finally, at the Habit Burger Grill, we saw system sales grew 19% during the quarter driven by 11% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 7%, which included the impact of about 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3. We continue to see strong results through our digital channels, even as customers return to our dining room. 
During the quarter, we launched a Culinary Forward Balsamic Grilled Chicken and Asparagus salad that highlighted our unmatched chargrilled chicken and seasonal ingredients. Now I'll discuss our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver. The hallmark of Yum! is our people-first culture. We have tremendous leaders across our organization that have been developed internally to lead our brands. And because of our culture, we're able to attract world-class external talent. 
This quarter, we had the opportunity to announce some exciting internal promotions with planned leadership transition. First, Tony Lowings, CEO of KFC, will be retiring on March 1, 2022. I want to thank Tony for his more than 25 years working at Yum! He has embodied what it means to be a people-first leader throughout his career and will no doubt leave a lasting legacy on the KFC brand. Tony's successor will be Sabir Sami, KFC's Global Chief Operations Officer, who is an incredibly well-respected and experienced leader who has played a pivotal role in the KFC Global business. 
Sabir's promotion to CEO of KFC provided an opportunity to elevate another internal talent with Dyke Shipp stepping in as President of KFC after serving us KFC's Global Chief People and Development Officer. With their combined experience of over 40 years with Yum!, both Sabir and Dyke will assume their new roles effective January 1, 2022. I couldn't be more confident in our ability to continue to unleash the power of this iconic brand with both Sabir and Dyke leading KFC. 
Next, we recently announced that David Graves, Pizza Hut U.S. General Manager, will be promoted to President of Pizza Hut U.S., effective January 1, 2022. Alongside Kevin Hochman, David has helped architect the Pizza Hut U.S. strategy and is the right person to lead the way forward for the brand by continuing to partner with our franchisee. With this promotion, Kevin Hochman, Interim President of Pizza Hut U.S. and President of KFC U.S., will return full-time to KFC U.S. 
 I would like to thank Kevin for his unwavering commitment and leadership over the past 2 years as he led the Pizza Hut U.S. business and franchisees for a critical turnaround that has shown tremendous progress to date, all while simultaneously taking KFC U.S. to new heights. These internal promotions demonstrate that our deep bench of experienced leaders is a real competitive advantage for us across the restaurant industry. 
Lastly, we recruited significant external talent with the appointment of Aaron Powell as Chief Executive Officer at Pizza Hut. Aaron joins us from Kimberly-Clark, where he most recently led their Asia Pacific business. We're thrilled to have Aaron join our leadership team with his seasoned CPG executive experience and believe his leadership, alongside Vipul Chawla and David Graves, will help fuel the brand's growth strategy. 
Equally as important as our Recipe for Growth is our Recipe for Good. I could not be prouder of the progress Yum! brands have made this year in sharpening the focus and execution of our ESG agenda, particularly on climate action and sustainable packaging, alongside our global unlocking opportunity initiatives to tackle inequality. We are advancing our plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our global system and supply chain by nearly half by 2030, while we work to implement, learn from and scale pilots for reusable, recyclable and compostable packaging in the front of our restaurants to meet our 2025 public commitment. 
Across all of our brands, we're focused on building a resilient business for the future with purpose and sustainability at the core. Our iconic brands and unmatched scale put us in a class of our own. We're competitively advantaged given the size and capabilities of our franchise system, and I'm thrilled with our teams as we continue to be nimble and meet the consumer where they are. Overall, I'm proud of how our business is performing, and I'm confident that we're positioned to win in a post-COVID world. 
With that, Chris, over to you."
365997,1675682294,2415470,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our unmatched operating capability in both restaurant development growth drivers and our solid balance sheet and liquidity position. I'll start by discussing our fi",1709,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our unmatched operating capability in both restaurant development growth drivers and our solid balance sheet and liquidity position. 
I'll start by discussing our financial results. Our results year-to-date through Q3, highlighted by 15% system sales growth, translating into strong core operating profit growth of 26%, demonstrate the resilience and strength of our economic model. The continued momentum reflected in our results reaffirms our confidence in delivering on an annual basis the long-term growth algorithm we reinstated on our last call, specifically 2% to 3% same-store sales growth plus 4% to 5% net new unit growth translating to mid- to high single-digit system sales growth and high single-digit operating profit growth. 
In the third quarter specifically, Yum! system sales grew 8%, driven by 5% same-store sales growth or 3% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3. We delivered 4% unit growth year-over-year, which included a record of 760 net new units this quarter. Core operating profit increased 3% for the quarter, in line with our internal expectations when accounting for onetime items that impacted comparability. 
The largest of these items was the lap of last year's bad debt recoveries, which accounted for a 5-point headwind to core operating profit growth. EPS, excluding special items, was $1.22, representing a 21% increase compared to ex special EPS of $1.01 in the third quarter last year. Reflected in our ex special EPS this quarter is an investment gain on our approximate 5% investment in Devyani International Limited, an entity that operates KFC and Pizza Hut franchised units in India. Our minority stake in Devyani was acquired in lieu of cash proceeds upon the refranchising of approximately 60 KFCs in India during 2019 and 2020. 
During the third quarter, Devyani completed an initial public offering, and we began reflecting the change in fair value of our investment in our results during the quarter. This resulted in $52 million of pretax investment gains on our approximate 5% stake, which added $0.16 to EPS, but did not impact our core operating profit. 
During Q3, we had bad debt expense of $3 million. As a reminder, we have large quarterly swings in bad debt last year due to COVID, and we're lapping $21 million in bad debt recoveries in the third quarter of last year resulting in a year-over-year headwind of 5 points or $24 million to core operating profit growth this quarter. We expect core operating profit growth to be negatively impacted again in Q4 as we lap bad debt recoveries of $8 million in the fourth quarter last year. 
Our general and administrative expenses on an ex special basis for the quarter were $249 million. On a full year basis this year, we now estimate consolidated G&A will be approximately $1.05 billion, an increase of about $60 million above our incoming expectations for the year, driven entirely by our above-target incentive compensation based on our strong business performance. 
Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs with our unique scale benefits is unchanged. We expect our G&A to system sales ratio to move back to 1.7% next year on a full year basis. Finally, we note that Taco Bell company store margins have begun to normalize in the back half of this year due to increased staffing in our restaurants as we return to our historical daypart mix, wage investments and recent commodity inflation. While there will be quarterly variability due to the dynamic environment, we are confident in our ability to consistently deliver Taco Bell company store margins in line with our historical precoded levels for full year 2021 and beyond. 
Next, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities. We continue to invest in our technology strategy to expand both our digital capabilities and restaurant technology solutions. We're prioritizing making it easier to operate a restaurant, ultimately driving efficiencies in our stores to enhance franchise unit economics while also improving the customer experience. To that end, during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Dragontail Systems, a restaurant technology company that enhances both the team member and customer experience. Dragontail uses innovative technology that streamlines the order management process in the restaurant and optimizes delivery routes for drivers, resulting in our customers receiving the freshest possible product. 
Thus far, the Dragontail solution has been deployed in 13 markets and over 1,700 stores across the Pizza Hut system. Many Pizza Hut restaurants leveraging Dragontail's platform have already seen a positive impact on sales, order fulfillment and customer satisfaction scores, including product freshness and delivery times. I recently participated in virtual store visits in the U.K. and in Latin America, where franchisees demonstrated benefits of the Dragontail System and share their team members' excitement. 
Another example of how our technology investments yield enhanced operating performance is Taco Bell's continued execution of its all-access technology initiative. This connected suite of core restaurant technology solutions is used to optimize operations and create a frictionless customer experience. These strategic efforts contributed to Taco Bell's seventh consecutive quarter with drive-through times below 4 minutes, enabling the brand to serve more customers through the drive-through while also delivering a great customer experience. 
Moving on to our bold restaurant development growth driver. I'm thrilled to discuss how we delivered another record development quarter with 760 net new units, including meaningful contributions across multiple geographies and our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell global brands. While we continue to see strong development from Yum! China, our brands are also seeing broad-based development across other markets. The widespread strength in our store-level economics and cash-on-cash returns improving relative to pre-COVID levels are key drivers contributing to the acceleration in development we're seeing around the world. 
Our KFC international markets have seen impressive development as China, Russia, India, Latin America and the Middle East continued to deliver strong unit development during the third quarter. Additionally, over the past year, Pizza Hut International has driven a significant inflection in their unit growth, going from negative net new units in 2020 to opening nearly 200 net new units during the third quarter. We expect this momentum to continue, a further testament to the confidence our franchisees have in the future of the brand. 
At Taco Bell International, we continue to see strong development as key markets are approaching scale. Not only are we seeing strong development across our brands, but given the continued strength of digital and off-premise growth, our teams continue to evolve the asset types being developed into more digitally enabled format. As an example, we now have 23 Go Mobile locations at Taco Bell U.S. These technology-forward restaurants, which include dual drive-thrus with a dedicated mobile pickup lane, mobile pickup shelves and a faster bellhop experience, among other things, have been a big hit, and we have more in our development pipeline. 
Next, I'll provide an update on our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. In August, we completed our third whole business securitization issuance at Taco Bell in the past 5 years. issuing $2.25 billion of new securitization notes. The weighted average yield of the new notes was approximately 2.24% and the proceeds were used to opportunistically repay $1.3 billion of existing higher coupon Taco Bell securitization notes and to support our share buyback program. We still expect our 2021 interest expense to be approximately $500 million, in line with 2020. 
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, excluding restricted cash. Due to our continued recovery in EBITDA, our consolidated net leverage continues to be temporarily below our target of approximately 5x. With respect to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at an average share price of $127 per share, totaling approximately $330 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $860 million of shares at an average price of $117. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds during the quarter, were $49 million. We now expect net capital expenditures of approximately $175 million for the full year, reflecting roughly $75 million in refranchising proceeds and $250 million of gross CapEx. Lastly, our capital priorities remain unchanged. We invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to take a moment to address both labor and cost inflation pressures and how Yum! is well positioned to navigate these challenges. U.S. labor availability remains tight across most industries, driving wage inflation and staffing challenges that have resulted in a small number of our stores, limiting operating hours particularly during the early morning and late-night dayparts. While our franchisees are not immune to these market pressures, we believe the power of our scale and the larger average size of our franchisees relative to those of our QSR peers enables our system to manage the inflationary environment better than most. 
For example, while many small chains and independent restaurants experience difficulties adapting to these market dynamics, our franchisees continue to invest through this environment, accelerating investments that help widen their strategic advantage. Additionally, our people-first culture is a true competitive advantage in both attracting and retaining team members. We're confident in the ability of our brands to respond to dynamic market conditions and are working closely with our franchisees to assess strategic opportunities to take price as and when needed, while ensuring we continue to offer compelling value to our customers. While store level margins have moderated, franchisee unit economics generally remain incredibly healthy. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter, driven by impressive unit growth and sustained digital sales. We continue to invest in our digital ecosystem to scale technologies and provide a unique competitive advantage for our franchise operators while enhancing the customer and team member experience. Our franchise system is healthy and well positioned to invest through the near-term pressures, fueling our development engine and future unit growth. Our unit growth and sustained sales momentum, despite lingering COVID impacts, only make us more confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

So is there any notable impact to sales just from staffing shortages there? So if you could just sort of talk about the overall trends in staffing in particular, and why maybe you saw some deceleration on a 2-year basis?"

And given the culture that we have in our restaurants across all of our brands and the kind of environments that our franchisees create for their employees with paychecks and then pathways to advancement, I think we're getting through this better than most. Yes, we're really proud of the results we put up across all of the brands this quarter. You guys probably saw, it's on a 2-year basis, we're positive on all 4 brands. On a 1-year basis, we're positive on all 4 brands. And then obviously, the big news is the 760 net new units that we opened for the quarter. 
So a very strong quarter. We've got pluses and minuses. John, if you're talking about in the U.S., KFC was up 13% on a 2-year basis. Pizza Hut's HMR business, Home Meal Replacement business, was up 17%. Taco Bell was a little bit softer. For them, late night and breakfast become a little bit more of a challenge, and they skew a little bit more towards individual meals. And I think that's what you're seeing. Every brand has a different set of attributes as we go through this. Some will play better in this environment than other, but all of our brands are really doing quite well, which is contributing to this great quarter."

And then on unit growth, do you -- the results are very strong, and it's hard to see weakness or holdbacks from a development standpoint from a macro sense, but we would expect there to be that, that there would be some friction out there given all the macro challenges around COVID.

Obviously, the numbers that we put up in this quarter are truly record setting, right? 760 net new units in third quarter is a record for Yum! We're at 1,800 net new units year-to-date basically, which is closing in on the record we set for Yum! in 2019 for full year development. And I think you're right. There's probably some friction that we're experiencing that we haven't been able to open all the units that we could because of some challenges. But this is where the big advantages of Yum! come in. Our scale, our purchasing capability, the size of our franchisees, their access to capital. We've been anticipating some of the supply chain challenges ordering ahead of time, securing the inventory we need on equipment, for example, to get through this without having equipment delays to open restaurants. 
So I do think there's further upside to the numbers we're putting up. And I do think if we continue these trends, we'll obviously set a record for Yum! in the fourth quarter. And we probably have a shot at setting a record for the restaurant industry all time for a number of units open in 1 year. I look forward to reporting back on that in our fourth quarter call. As for Taco Bell, the Taco Bell sales are up 15%, system sales are up 15% on a 2-year basis. We're making no apologies for that. The business is doing quite well, very strong. It does have its own unique challenges since it skews a little bit more towards individual meals versus family occasions. You're seeing the brands like Pizza Hut and KFC that skewed towards family occasions performing even better. But Taco Bell performance is strong. In Q3, we made some investments in -- on the marketing side that weren't designed to pay off on the top line, such as relaunching breakfast. We know those will have benefits for us down the road. So we're proud of what's going on at Taco Bell with system sales growth like that, unit growth, like we're seeing all across Yum! and Taco Bell, I'm excited about the future for all our brands."

And then, Chris, I think you mentioned in your comments that you're seeing improved cash on cash returns in a lot of markets, and I was hoping that you could elaborate on what you meant there specifically."

And if you think about the drivers, the #1 driver is unit economics. So that sort of gets at both parts of your question. Around the globe, in general, our franchisees are seeing strong EBITDA and they are seeing that translate to improved returns whenever they build restaurants. Remember, these are our franchisees putting their capital to work. And that's where I think the strength of the brand and the larger average size of our franchisees really matters. They're able to see through near-term fluctuations related to COVID around the globe and invest for the long term. 
The second driver on development is the strong development teams that we have who are focused and incentivized to go create great results on the development front. And they have an improved set of capabilities. We're now bringing analytics to bear how we set our development plans in a number of markets around the globe. We're bringing new prototypes to bear. We talked about the Go Mobile concept, which is primed for digital growth with Taco Bell. We have similar examples in other brands. So it's a broad set of drivers that are supporting this growth. 
And you've seen this trajectory change, in particular in the Pizza Hut business. That's been an important driver of where the numbers are. Pizza Hut International putting a plus 200 in the quarter, that's more than 300 better than where they were a year ago, and you've seen Pizza Hut U.S. stabilize. So those are also important drivers. So broad-based strength in development right now."

And I think this is where the strength of our operating model and our capability set around sourcing really shines. We saw some of those supply chain challenges related to equipment that are sort of a global challenge. We saw those on the horizon early this year, and our supply chain teams were building resiliency plans at that point, and they worked with our franchisees around the globe to get ahead on purchasing for those equipment and reserving capacity with suppliers. There's certainly going to be some local challenges here and there related to permitting. But again, this is where that capability set helped us get ahead plus our larger, more sophisticated franchisees invest ahead. They have sophisticated teams who are driving their development. And that's a big asset here as well. So yes, we've probably left a few units on the table this year as a result of that. But in general, we don't see that as a constraint on our long-term development pattern."

Obviously, inflation is a story not just in our industry but across sectors. And again, I think this is a situation where Yum!'s operating model sets us and our franchisees up to deal with those challenges really well. And I think of 3 things. One, keep in mind our footprint, 60% of our sales are outside the U.S., and these inflation challenges are most acute in the U.S. And we see it in a few pockets around the globe, most acute in the U.S. Second, in the U.S., think about our scale. We purchased across all 4 brands together with RFCS. We have a professional team of highly talented strategic sourcing experts. They're working away right now. I can tell you, throughout this inflationary trend, they saw it coming. They've got plans on finding ways to offset that. So we're leveraging our scale to help manage costs in those -- against those pressures. 
And then third, to your point, we pulled a number of levers to manage margin with our franchisees. Our brands are working proactively with the franchisees. You mentioned product design. I'm sure we're doing a little bit of that. We've done some menu management. We'll think about how to optimize promotions. And of course, pricing is a lever that's available. But our franchisees and our brands, they manage and they balance the short term and the long term. In the short term, they want to make sure we're providing strong value to the customer, that we don't get too far ahead of the consumer. But in the long run, whenever I talk to our franchisees, they're confident that long-term margins in the restaurants will be sustained, and we can continue the momentum we've seen on restaurant profit coming through the last couple of years."

We've now started closing on a few deals. We closed on 2 already with Yum! franchisees entering the Habit system and we have more in the hopper. 
So we're seeing strong demand and interest in becoming Habit franchisees because the unit economics are great, all the reasons why we bought them. As far as international goes, same story there. As you know, they're already in a couple of countries. I just was on the call yesterday where we were evaluating a new potential partner to enter in another country.

Look, Pizza Hut U.S. is obviously a bright spot for us right now and will be for the long term as all the work that we've been doing over the last few years, investing in digital and capabilities and working with our franchise partners, has really started to pay off. This quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. sales were up 17% on an off-premise basis, which is the heart of the business and the future of the business. But it's not immune to the same staffing challenges that everybody is facing. So we had -- I'm sure those sales were held back to some degree by the challenges of getting drivers. We actually saw our carryout business is now starting to grow faster. When we don't have the ability to get drivers, we're still able to pivot to carry out. 
So we know that there's a lot of demand for what we're offering at Pizza Hut and with a bright future in the U.S. The other thing I'll point out is our investment in digital at Pizza Hut has been -- was really one of our leading investments in the world of digital. That's one of the advantages that Yum! has, is our knowledge of digital through the Pizza Hut business. I hope you guys all picked up on the fact that we had over $5 billion of digital sales yet again this quarter. But interesting context on that across Yum! is our dine-in business started to climb this quarter. So from Q2 to Q3, we did see a return to dine-in, yet we saw digital sales go up and we saw digital mix go up, which is proving that not only is it sticky, that it's still something that's going to continue to grow for us, which is a great sign for all of our brands as we move forward. 
With that, I just want to thank everybody for the time on the call. We're obviously excited about what's going on with digital and what's going on with net new unit development, widespread same-store sales growth on a 1- and 2-year basis across all of our brands. A lot of momentum in the business right now. A lot of enthusiasm from our franchise partners with record profits at the unit level and very excited about the path forward for Yum! and our 4 brands.

I'm pleased to share our strong third quarter results underpinned by record-breaking unit development, continued strong digital sales and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of our consumers in an ever-changing environment.
During the third quarter, we delivered 5% same-store sales growth or 3% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis. Despite a challenging operating environment due to the ongoing COVID pandemic, I'm extremely proud that we opened 760 net-new units, a Q3 record, with broad-based strength across our portfolio. While Yum China continues to be a leader in development, we opened 379 net-new units across the rest of our portfolio, roughly equivalent to our Q3 2019 global net-new units, including China.
Our continued positive development momentum this quarter is a testament to the strength of our iconic brands, fueled by strong unit economics and a healthy, well-capitalized franchise system primed for sustained growth. Now we'll discuss our Q3 results and 2 of the 4 growth drivers that underpin our recipe for growth: our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or RED for short; and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. I will also share an update on our ESG agenda, which we call our Recipe for Good. Then Chris will talk about our other 2 growth drivers: our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development, in addition to providing more details on our third quarter financial performance and our strong balance sheet and liquidity position.
First, a few highlights from the quarter. Overall, Yum! third quarter system sales grew 8%, led by same-store sales growth of 5%. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 3%, which includes the impact of around 500 stores or 1% temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q3. COVID restrictions and limited mobility in a few markets, primarily in Asia, had a significant impact on sales. However, our sales momentum remained strong as evidenced by the fact that our global 2-year same-store sales growth, excluding Asia, accelerated since last quarter.
Sales strength continued in many developed markets, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada with significant recovery seen across Europe as restrictions eased throughout the quarter. We've also seen pockets of strength in our portfolio of emerging markets, including the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and India, to name a few. As we've previously shared, looking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, our recovery will neither be consistent from country to country nor linear within a country, reinforcing the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple on- and off-premise channels. 
A key growth driver for our business remains the continued acceleration of our digital and technology strategy, including how we leverage our global scale with technology investments to enhance the customer and employee experience, strengthen restaurant unit economics and provide a competitive advantage for our franchisees. We're seeing strong and sustained momentum through our digital and off-premise channels across our global business, even as customers return to our dining rooms. We posted over $5 billion in global digital sales with a near 40% digital mix during Q3. We continue to expand delivery capabilities across the globe, setting a record this quarter with over 41,000 stores offering delivery to our customers.
Most recently, we acquired Dragontail Systems, which will allow us to tap into the power of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process and further enhance our delivery capabilities. Where we've deployed Dragontail's cutting-edge technology, we found that it makes it easier for team members to operate and run a restaurant and helps our franchisees strengthen store operations, all resulting in a better customer experience. 
This is the perfect segue to talk about our 4 RED brands. Starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for 52% of our operating profit, Q3 system sales grew 11%, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, Q3 same-store sales were up 1%, which included the impact of 1% of the stores being temporarily closed due to COVID. At KFC International, same-store sales grew 6% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis. As previously mentioned, increased COVID case counts and limited mobility in a few key Asian markets pressured top line trends in the quarter. 
This quarter, several Western European markets joined the group of resilient market leading the recovery where sales have fully recovered to pre-COVID levels. Strong digital and off-premise growth, newsworthy products and doubling down on value offerings have fueled top line growth in these markets, coupled with the continued strength of the chicken category across the QSR segment globally.
Next, at KFC U.S., same-store sales grew 4% during the quarter, while same-store sales increased 13% on a 2-year basis. The continued success of our Chicken Sandwich and the strength of the group occasion remains significant drivers of our same-store sales growth. Additionally, as of July, our year-to-date digital sales in the U.S. surpassed our full year 2020 digital sales, which speaks to the results we're seeing from our investments in this critical growth channel.
Now on to the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 17% of our operating profit. Q3 system sales grew 4%, driven by 1% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. For the division, 2-year same-store sales grew 1% during the quarter, which included the impact of 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3 2021. Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 6% during the quarter. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales declined 4%.
While our Pizza Hut International business continues to be pressured given our substantial dine-in mix, the sustained strength in our off-premise business, as reflected by 21% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis, bodes well for the future of the brand and continues to fuel franchisee interest in investing in assets focused on serving the off-premise occasion. Our markets continue to demonstrate what it means to be RED by focusing on strong value propositions and innovative partnerships, including Beyond Meat product offerings in 2 markets this quarter.
At Pizza Hut U.S., we continued to see positive momentum with 2% same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 8%, and the off-premise channel grew 17%. Pizza Hut continues to delight customers by bringing Only from Pizza Hut premium innovation with the launch of The Edge pizza and the return of the successful Detroit-Style pizza in Q3. Additionally, we promoted the Big Dinner Box during back-to-school season to offer an easy dinner solution for our Pizza Hut customers.
Moving on to Taco Bell, which accounts for 31% of our operating profit. Third quarter system sales grew 8%, driven by 3% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. Two-year same-store sales growth was 8% for the quarter. Taco Bell continues to focus on long-term growth opportunities by expanding into multiple category entry points, including the relaunch of breakfast in August and the fried chicken category with the Crispy Chicken Sandwich Taco during the quarter.
Meanwhile, Taco Bell International remains focused on their mission to make tacos cool around the world, while also ensuring the brand is culturally relevant in each market. In the U.K., we gave away free tacos to the country to celebrate England advancing to the finals in the European championship. Players on the English team even tweeted on behalf of the brand, resulting in Taco Bell being one of the top trending brands on Twitter during the finals.
And finally, at the Habit Burger Grill, we saw system sales grow 19% during the quarter, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 7%, which included the impact of about 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3. We continue to see strong results through our digital channels, even as customers returned to our dining rooms. During the quarter, we launched a culinary-forward Balsamic Grilled Chicken and Asparagus salad that highlighted our unmatched chargrilled chicken and seasonal ingredients. 
Now I'll discuss our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. A hallmark of Yum! is our people-first culture. We have tremendous leaders across our organization that have been developed internally to lead our brands. And because of our culture, we're able to attract world-class external talent.
This quarter, we have the opportunity to announce some exciting internal promotions with planned leadership transition. First, Tony Lowings, CEO of KFC, will be retiring on March 1, 2022. I want to thank Tony for his more than 25 years working at Yum! He has embodied what it means to be a people-first leader throughout his career and will no doubt leave a lasting legacy on the KFC brand. Tony's successor will be Sabir Sami, KFC's Global Chief Operations Officer, who is an incredibly well-respected and experienced leader who has played a pivotal role in the KFC global business.
Sabir's promotion to CEO of KFC provided an opportunity to elevate another internal talent with Dyke Shipp stepping in as President of KFC after serving as KFC's global Chief People and Development Officer. With their combined experience of over 40 years with Yum!, both Sabir and Dyke will assume their new roles effective January 1, 2022. I couldn't be more confident in our ability to continue to unleash the power of this iconic brand with both Sabir and Dyke leading KFC.
Next, we recently announced that David Graves, Pizza Hut U.S. General Manager, will be promoted to President of Pizza Hut U.S., effective January 1, 2022. Alongside Kevin Hochman, David has helped architect the Pizza Hut U.S. strategy and is the right person to lead the way forward for the brand by continuing to partner with our franchisees. 
With this promotion, Kevin Hochman, Interim President of Pizza Hut U.S. and President of KFC U.S., will return full-time to KFC U.S. I would like to thank Kevin for his unwavering commitment and leadership over the past 2 years as he led the Pizza Hut U.S. business and franchisees through a critical turnaround that has shown tremendous progress to date, all while simultaneously taking KFC U.S. to new heights. These internal promotions demonstrate that our deep bench of experienced leaders is a real competitive advantage for us across the restaurant industry.
Lastly, we recruited significant external talent with the appointment of Aaron Powell as Chief Executive Officer at Pizza Hut. Aaron joins us from Kimberly-Clark, where he most recently led their Asia Pacific business. We're thrilled to have Aaron join our leadership team with his seasoned CPG executive experience and believe his leadership, alongside Vipul Chawla and David Graves, will help fuel the brand's growth strategy.
Equally as important as our Recipe for Growth is our Recipe for Good. I could not be prouder of the progress Yum! and our brands have made this year in sharpening the focus and execution of our ESG agenda, particularly on climate action and sustainable packaging, alongside our global unlocking opportunity initiatives to tackle inequality. We are advancing our plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our global system and supply chain by nearly half by 2030. While we work to implement, learn from and scale pilots for reusable, recyclable and compostable packaging in the front of our restaurants to meet our 2025 public commitments.  
Across all of our brands, we're focused on building a resilient business for the future with purpose and sustainability at the core. Our iconic brands and unmatched scale put us in a class of our own. We're competitively advantaged given the size and capabilities of our franchise system, and I'm thrilled with our teams as we continue to be nimble and meet the consumer where they are. Overall, I'm proud of how our business is performing, and I'm confident that we're positioned to win in a post-COVID world.
With that, Chris, over to you."

I'll start by discussing our f",1702,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our solid balance sheet and liquidity position. 
I'll start by discussing our financial results. Our results year-to-date through Q3, highlighted by 15% system sales growth translating into strong core operating profit growth of 26%, demonstrate the resilience and strength of our economic model. The continued momentum reflected in our results reaffirms our confidence in delivering on an annual basis the long-term growth algorithm we reinstated on our last call, specifically 2% to 3% same-store sales growth plus 4% to 5% net-new unit growth translating to mid- to high single-digit system sales growth and high single-digit operating profit growth.
In the third quarter specifically, Yum! system sales grew 8%, driven by 5% same-store sales growth or 3% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3. We delivered 4% unit growth year-over-year, which included a record of 760 net-new units this quarter. Core operating profit increased 3% for the quarter, in line with our internal expectations when accounting for onetime items that impacted comparability.
The largest of these items was the lap of last year's bad debt recoveries, which accounted for a 5-point headwind to core operating profit growth. EPS, excluding special items, was $1.22, representing a 21% increase compared to ex special EPS of $1.01 in the third quarter last year. 
Reflected in our ex special EPS this quarter is an investment gain on our approximate 5% investment in Devyani International Limited, an entity that operates KFC and Pizza Hut franchised units in India. Our minority stake in Devyani was acquired in lieu of cash proceeds upon the refranchising of approximately 60 KFCs in India during 2019 and 2020. 
During the third quarter, Devyani completed an initial public offering, and we began reflecting the change in fair value of our investment in our results during the quarter. This resulted in $52 million of pretax investment gains on our approximate 5% stake, which added $0.16 to EPS, but did not impact our core operating profit. 
During Q3, we had bad debt expense of $3 million. As a reminder, we have large quarterly swings in bad debt last year due to COVID, and we're lapping $21 million in bad debt recoveries in the third quarter of last year resulting in a year-over-year headwind of 5 points or $24 million to core operating profit growth this quarter. We expect core operating profit growth to be negatively impacted again in Q4 as we lap bad debt recoveries of $8 million in the fourth quarter last year. 
Our general and administrative expenses on an ex special basis for the quarter were $249 million. On a full year basis this year, we now estimate consolidated G&A will be approximately $1.05 billion, an increase of about $60 million above our incoming expectations for the year, driven entirely by our above-target incentive compensation based on our strong business performance. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs with our unique scale benefits is unchanged. We expect our G&A to system sales ratio to move back to 1.7% next year on a full year basis. 
Finally, we note that Taco Bell company store margins have begun to normalize in the back half of this year due to increased staffing in our restaurants as we return to our historical daypart mix, wage investments and recent commodity inflation. While there will be quarterly variability due to the dynamic environment, we are confident in our ability to consistently deliver Taco Bell company store margins in line with our historical pre-COVID levels for full year 2021 and beyond. 
Next, I'll discuss our Unmatched Operating Capabilities. We continue to invest in our technology strategy to expand both our digital capabilities and restaurant technology solutions. We're prioritizing making it easier to operate a restaurant, ultimately driving efficiencies in our stores to enhance franchise unit economics while also improving the customer experience. To that end, during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Dragontail Systems, a restaurant technology company that enhances both the team member and customer experience. Dragontail uses innovative technology that streamlines the order management process in the restaurant and optimizes delivery routes for drivers, resulting in our customers receiving the freshest possible product. 
Thus far, the Dragontail solution has been deployed in 13 markets and over 1,700 stores across the Pizza Hut system. Many Pizza Hut restaurants leveraging Dragontail's platform have already seen a positive impact on sales, order fulfillment and customer satisfaction scores, including product freshness and delivery times. I recently participated in virtual store visits in the U.K. and in Latin America, where franchisees demonstrated benefits of the Dragontail System and shared their team members' excitement. 
Another example of how our technology investments yield enhanced operating performance is Taco Bell's continued execution of its all-access technology initiative. This connected suite of core restaurant technology solutions is used to optimize operations and create a frictionless customer experience. These strategic efforts contributed to Taco Bell's seventh consecutive quarter with drive-through times below 4 minutes, enabling the brand to serve more customers through the drive-through while also delivering a great customer experience.
Moving on to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. I'm thrilled to discuss how we delivered another record development quarter with 760 net-new units, including meaningful contributions across multiple geographies at our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell global brands. While we continue to see strong development from Yum China, our brands are also seeing broad-based development across other markets. The widespread strength in our store-level economics and cash-on-cash returns improving relative to pre-COVID levels are key drivers contributing to the acceleration in development we're seeing around the world. 
Our KFC International markets have seen impressive development as China, Russia, India, Latin America and the Middle East continued to deliver strong unit development during the third quarter. Additionally, over the past year, Pizza Hut International has driven a significant inflection in their unit growth, going from negative net-new units in 2020 to opening nearly 200 net-new units during the third quarter. We expect this momentum to continue, a further testament to the confidence our franchisees have in the future of the brand. At Taco Bell International, we continue to see strong development as key markets are approaching scale. 
Not only are we seeing strong development across our brands, but given the continued strength of digital and off-premise growth, our teams continue to evolve the asset types being developed into more digitally enabled formats. As an example, we now have 23 Go Mobile locations at Taco Bell U.S. These technology-forward restaurants, which include dual drive-thrus with a dedicated mobile pickup lane, mobile pickup shelves and a faster bellhop experience, among other things, have been a big hit, and we have more in our development pipeline. 
Next, I'll provide an update on our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. In August, we completed our third whole business securitization issuance at Taco Bell in the past 5 years, issuing $2.25 billion of new securitization notes. The weighted average yield of the new notes was approximately 2.24% and the proceeds were used to opportunistically repay $1.3 billion of existing higher coupon Taco Bell securitization notes and to support our share buyback program. We still expect our 2021 interest expense to be approximately $500 million, in line with 2020. 
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, excluding restricted cash. Due to our continued recovery in EBITDA, our consolidated net leverage continues to be temporarily below our target of approximately 5x. 
With respect to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at an average share price of $127 per share, totaling approximately $330 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $860 million of shares at an average price of $117. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, during the quarter were $49 million. We now expect net capital expenditures of approximately $175 million for the full year, reflecting roughly $75 million in refranchising proceeds and $250 million of gross CapEx. Lastly, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases.
Before wrapping up, I'd like to take a moment to address both labor and cost inflation pressures and how Yum! is well positioned to navigate these challenges. U.S. labor availability remains tight across most industries, driving wage inflation and staffing challenges that have resulted in a small number of our stores limiting operating hours particularly during the early morning and late-night dayparts. While our franchisees are not immune to these market pressures, we believe the power of our scale and the larger average size of our franchisees relative to those of our QSR peers enables our system to manage the inflationary environment better than most. 
For example, while many small chains and independent restaurants experience difficulties adapting to these market dynamics, our franchisees continue to invest through this environment, accelerating investments that help widen their strategic advantage. Additionally, our people-first culture is a true competitive advantage in both attracting and retaining team members. We're confident in the ability of our brands to respond to dynamic market conditions and are working closely with our franchisees to assess strategic opportunities to take price as and when needed, while ensuring we continue to offer compelling value to our customers. While store-level margins have moderated, franchisee unit economics generally remain incredibly healthy. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter, driven by impressive unit growth and sustained digital sales. We continue to invest in our digital ecosystem to scale technologies and provide a unique competitive advantage for our franchise operators while enhancing the customer and team member experience. Our franchise system is healthy and well positioned to invest through the near-term pressures, fueling our development engine and future unit growth. Our unit growth and sustained sales momentum, despite lingering COVID impacts, only make us more confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

But I think our -- we're doing an amazing job in the field of being focused on retention. We won't have a staffing problem if we don't have any open jobs if we retain the employees that we have. And given the culture that we have in our restaurants across all of our brands and the kind of environments that our franchisees create for their employees with paychecks and then pathways to advancement, I think we're getting through this better than most. 
Yes, we're really proud of the results we put up across all of the brands this quarter. You guys probably saw, it's, on a 2-year basis, we're positive on all 4 brands. On a 1-year basis, we're positive on all 4 brands. And then obviously, the big news is the 760 net-new units that we opened for the quarter.
So a very strong quarter. We've got pluses and minuses, john, if you're talking about in the U.S. KFC was up 13% on a 2-year basis. Pizza Hut's HMR business, home meal replacement business, was up 17%. Taco Bell was a little bit softer. For them, late night and breakfast become a little bit more of a challenge, and they skew a little bit more towards individual meals. And I think that's what you're seeing. Every brand has a different set of attributes as we go through this. Some will play better in this environment than other, but all of our brands are really doing quite well, which is contributing to this great quarter."

Also just bigger picture, why you think Taco Bell, on a 2-year basis, might not be doing as well as the industry average of drive-thru chains out there? 
And then on unit growth, do you -- the results are very strong, and it's hard to see weakness or holdbacks from a development standpoint from a macro sense. But we would expect there to be that, that there would be some friction out there given all the macro challenges around COVID. Do you believe that there is -- something holds you back even in these strong numbers?"

Obviously, the numbers that we put up in this quarter are truly record setting, right? 760 net-new units in the third quarter is a record for Yum! We're at 1,800 net-new units year-to-date basically, which is closing in on the record we set for Yum! in 2019 for full year development. 
And I think you're right. There's probably some friction that we're experiencing. That we haven't been able to open all the units that we could because of some challenges. But this is where the big advantages of Yum! come in. Our scale, our purchasing capability, the size of our franchisees, their access to capital. We've been anticipating some of the supply chain challenges ordering ahead of time, securing the inventory we need on equipment, for example, to get through this without having equipment delays to open restaurants.
So I do think there's further upside to the numbers we're putting up. And I do think if we continue these trends, we'll obviously set a record for Yum! in the fourth quarter. And we probably have a shot at setting a record for the restaurant industry all time for a number of units open in 1 year. I look forward to reporting back on that in our fourth quarter call. 
As for Taco Bell, the Taco Bell sales are up 15%. System sales are up 15% on a 2-year basis. We make no apologies for that. The business is doing quite well, very strong. It does have its own unique challenges since it skews a little bit more towards individual meals versus family occasions. You're seeing the brands, like Pizza Hut and KFC that skewed towards family occasions, performing even better. But Taco Bell performance is strong. 
In Q3, we made some investments in -- on the marketing side that weren't designed to pay off on the top line, such as relaunching breakfast. We know those will have benefits for us down the road. So we're proud of what's going on at Taco Bell, with system sales growth like that, unit growth like we're seeing all across Yum! and at Taco Bell. I'm excited about the future for all our brands."

And if you think about the drivers, the #1 driver is unit economics. So that sort of gets at both parts of your question. Around the globe, in general, our franchisees are seeing strong EBITDA, and they are seeing that translate to improved returns whenever they build restaurants. Remember, these are our franchisees putting their capital to work. And that's where I think the strength of the brand and the larger average size of our franchisees really matters. They're able to see through near-term fluctuations related to COVID around the globe and invest for the long term. 
The second driver on development is the strong development teams that we have who are focused and incentivized to go create great results on the development front. And they have an improved set of capabilities. We're now bringing analytics to bear in how we set our development plans in a number of markets around the globe. We're bringing new prototypes to bear. We talked about the Go Mobile concept, which is primed for digital growth with Taco Bell. We have similar examples in other brands. So it's a broad set of drivers that are supporting this growth. 
And you've seen this trajectory change, in particular in the Pizza Hut business. That's been an important driver of where the numbers are. Pizza Hut International putting up plus 200 in the quarter, that's more than 300 better than where they were a year ago, and you've seen Pizza Hut U.S. stabilize. So those are also important drivers.

There's certainly going to be some local challenges here and there related to permitting. But again, this is where that capability set helped us get ahead, plus our larger, more sophisticated franchisees invest ahead. They have sophisticated teams who are driving their development, and that's a big asset here as well. So yes, we've probably left a few units on the table this year as a result of that.

Obviously, inflation is a story, not just in our industry but across sectors. And again, I think this is a situation where Yum!'s operating model sets us and our franchisees up to deal with those challenges really well. And I think of 3 things: One, keep in mind our footprint, 60% of our sales are outside the U.S., and these inflation challenges are most acute in the U.S. And we see it in a few pockets around the globe, but most acute in the U.S. 
Second, in the U.S., think about our scale. We purchase across all 4 brands together with RSCS. We have a professional team of highly talented, strategic sourcing experts. They're working away right now, I can tell you, throughout this inflationary trend. They saw it coming. They've got plans on finding ways to offset that. So we're leveraging our scale to help manage costs in those -- against those pressures. 
And then third, to your point, we pulled a number of levers to manage margin with our franchisees. Our brands are working proactively with the franchisees. You mentioned product design. I'm sure we're doing a little bit of that. We've done some menu management. We'll think about how to optimize promotions. And of course, pricing is a lever that's available. 
But our franchisees and our brands, they manage and they balance the short term and the long term. In the short term, they want to make sure we're providing strong value to the customer, that we don't get too far ahead of the consumer. But in the long run, whenever I talk to our franchisees, they're confident that long-term margins in the restaurants will be sustained, and we can continue the momentum we've seen on restaurant profit coming through the last couple of years."

Maybe anything you could share about how far along you may or may not be or operational goal posts that you would like to achieve first? And then just number two, David, I'm curious, are you spending any time yet looking for international partners? Or is it just too early for that for Habit?"

If you think about it, they started pre-pandemic, 60% dine-in sales. So they had the biggest hill to climb in this environment and just put up a plus 7% on a 2-year basis. So the way they pivoted has been truly impressive. 
I think it hasn't gone unnoticed. We've had lots of demand from potential franchisees, both in the Yum! system and outside the Yum! system to enter. We've now started closing on a few deals. We closed on 2 already with Yum! franchisees entering the Habit system, and we have more in the hopper. So we're seeing strong demand and interest in becoming Habit franchisees because the unit economics are great, all the reasons why we bought them. 
As far as international goes, same story there. As you know, they're already in a couple of countries. I just was on the call yesterday where we were evaluating a new potential partner to enter in another country. So we've built up a little bit of capability in the team internationally to focus on Habit international and see every indication that, that can become a growth driver for Yum! down the road."

Look, Pizza Hut U.S. is obviously a bright spot for us right now and will be for the long term as all the work that we've been doing over the last few years, investing in digital and capabilities and working with our franchise partners, has really started to pay off. This quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. sales were up 17% on an off-premise basis, which is the heart of the business and the future of the business. But it's not immune to the same staffing challenges that everybody is facing. So we had -- I'm sure those sales were held back to some degree by the challenges of getting drivers. We actually saw our carryout business is now starting to grow faster. When we don't have the ability to get drivers, we're still able to pivot to carry out. But -- so we know that there's a lot of demand for what we're offering at Pizza Hut and with a bright future in the U.S. 
The other thing I'll point out is our investment in digital at Pizza Hut has been -- was really one of our leading investments in the world of digital. That's one of the advantages that Yum! has, is our knowledge of digital through the Pizza Hut business. I hope you guys all picked up on the fact that we had over $5 billion of digital sales yet again this quarter. But interesting context on that across Yum! is our dine-in business started to climb this quarter. So from Q2 to Q3, we did see a return to dine-in, yet we saw digital sales go up. And we saw digital mix go up, which is proving that not only is it sticky, that it's still something that's going to continue to grow for us, which is a great sign for all of our brands as we move forward. 
With that, I just want to thank everybody for the time on the call. We're obviously excited about what's going on with digital and what's going on with net-new unit development, widespread same-store sales growth on a 1- and 2-year basis across all of our brands. A lot of momentum in the business right now. A lot of enthusiasm from our franchise partners with record profits at the unit level and very excited about the path forward for Yum! and our 4 brands. Thank you."

I'm pleased to share our strong third quarter results underpinned by record-breaking unit development, continued strong digital sales and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of our consumers in an ever-changing environment.
During the third quarter, we delivered 5% same-store sales growth or 3% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis. Despite a challenging operating environment due to the ongoing COVID pandemic, I'm extremely proud that we opened 760 net-new units, a Q3 record, with broad-based strength across our portfolio. While Yum China continues to be a leader in development, we opened 379 net-new units across the rest of our portfolio, roughly equivalent to our Q3 2019 global net-new units, including China.
Our continued positive development momentum this quarter is a testament to the strength of our iconic brands, fueled by strong unit economics and a healthy, well-capitalized franchise system primed for sustained growth. Now we'll discuss our Q3 results and 2 of the 4 growth drivers that underpin our recipe for growth: our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or R.E.D. for short; and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. I will also share an update on our ESG agenda, which we call our Recipe for Good. 
Then Chris will talk about our other 2 growth drivers: our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development, in addition to providing more details on our third quarter financial performance and our strong balance sheet and liquidity position.
First, a few highlights from the quarter. Overall, Yum! third quarter system sales grew 8%, led by same-store sales growth of 5%. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 3%, which includes the impact of around 500 stores or 1% temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q3. COVID restrictions and limited mobility in a few markets, primarily in Asia, had a significant impact on sales. However, our sales momentum remained strong as evidenced by the fact that our global 2-year same-store sales growth, excluding Asia, accelerated since last quarter.
Sales strength continued in many developed markets, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada with significant recovery seen across Europe as restrictions eased throughout the quarter. We've also seen pockets of strength in our portfolio of emerging markets, including the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and India, to name a few. As we've previously shared, looking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, our recovery will neither be consistent from country to country nor linear within a country, reinforcing the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple on- and off-premise channels. 
A key growth driver for our business remains the continued acceleration of our digital and technology strategy, including how we leverage our global scale with technology investments to enhance the customer and employee experience, strengthen restaurant unit economics and provide a competitive advantage for our franchisees. We're seeing strong and sustained momentum through our digital and off-premise channels across our global business, even as customers return to our dining rooms. We posted over $5 billion in global digital sales with a near 40% digital mix during Q3. We continue to expand delivery capabilities across the globe, setting a record this quarter with over 41,000 stores offering delivery to our customers.
Most recently, we acquired Dragontail Systems, which will allow us to tap into the power of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process and further enhance our delivery capabilities. Where we've deployed Dragontail's cutting-edge technology, we found that it makes it easier for team members to operate and run a restaurant and helps our franchisees strengthen store operations, all resulting in a better customer experience. 
This is the perfect segue to talk about our 4 R.E.D. brands. Starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for 52% of our operating profit, Q3 system sales grew 11%, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, Q3 same-store sales were up 1%, which included the impact of 1% of the stores being temporarily closed due to COVID. At KFC International, same-store sales grew 6% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis. As previously mentioned, increased COVID case counts and limited mobility in a few key Asian markets pressured top line trends in the quarter. 
This quarter, several Western European markets joined the group of resilient market leading the recovery where sales have fully recovered to pre-COVID levels. Strong digital and off-premise growth, newsworthy products and doubling down on value offerings have fueled top line growth in these markets, coupled with the continued strength of the chicken category across the QSR segment globally.
Next, at KFC U.S., same-store sales grew 4% during the quarter, while same-store sales increased 13% on a 2-year basis. The continued success of our chicken sandwich and the strength of the group occasion remains significant drivers of our same-store sales growth. Additionally, as of July, our year-to-date digital sales in the U.S. surpassed our full year 2020 digital sales, which speaks to the results we're seeing from our investments in this critical growth channel.
Now on to the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 17% of our operating profit. Q3 system sales grew 4%, driven by 1% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. For the division, 2-year same-store sales grew 1% during the quarter, which included the impact of 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3 2021. Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 6% during the quarter. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales declined 4%.
While our Pizza Hut International business continues to be pressured given our substantial dine-in mix, the sustained strength in our off-premise business, as reflected by 21% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis, bodes well for the future of the brand and continues to fuel franchisee interest in investing in assets focused on serving the off-premise occasion. Our markets continue to demonstrate what it means to be R.E.D. by focusing on strong value propositions and innovative partnerships, including Beyond Meat product offerings in 2 markets this quarter.
At Pizza Hut U.S., we continued to see positive momentum with 2% same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 8%, and the off-premise channel grew 17%. Pizza Hut continues to delight customers by bringing Only from Pizza Hut premium innovation with the launch of The Edge pizza and the return of the successful Detroit-Style pizza in Q3. Additionally, we promoted the Big Dinner Box during back-to-school season to offer an easy dinner solution for our Pizza Hut customers.
Moving on to Taco Bell, which accounts for 31% of our operating profit. Third quarter system sales grew 8%, driven by 3% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. Two-year same-store sales growth was 8% for the quarter. Taco Bell continues to focus on long-term growth opportunities by expanding into multiple category entry points, including the relaunch of breakfast in August and the fried chicken category with the Crispy Chicken Sandwich Taco during the quarter.
Meanwhile, Taco Bell International remains focused on their mission to make tacos cool around the world, while also ensuring the brand is culturally relevant in each market. In the U.K., we gave away free tacos to the country to celebrate England advancing to the finals in the European championship. Players on the English team even tweeted on behalf of the brand, resulting in Taco Bell being one of the top trending brands on Twitter during the finals.
And finally, at the Habit Burger Grill, we saw system sales grow 19% during the quarter, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 7%, which included the impact of about 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3. We continue to see strong results through our digital channels, even as customers returned to our dining rooms. During the quarter, we launched a culinary-forward Balsamic Grilled Chicken and Asparagus salad that highlighted our unmatched chargrilled chicken and seasonal ingredients. 
Now I'll discuss our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. A hallmark of Yum! is our people-first culture. We have tremendous leaders across our organization that have been developed internally to lead our brands. And because of our culture, we're able to attract world-class external talent.
This quarter, we have the opportunity to announce some exciting internal promotions with planned leadership transition. First, Tony Lowings, CEO of KFC, will be retiring on March 1, 2022. I want to thank Tony for his more than 25 years working at Yum!. He has embodied what it means to be a people-first leader throughout his career and will no doubt leave a lasting legacy on the KFC brand. Tony's successor will be Sabir Sami, KFC's Global Chief Operations Officer, who is an incredibly well-respected and experienced leader who has played a pivotal role in the KFC global business.
Sabir's promotion to CEO of KFC provided an opportunity to elevate another internal talent with Dyke Shipp stepping in as President of KFC after serving as KFC's Global Chief People and Development Officer. With their combined experience of over 40 years with Yum!, both Sabir and Dyke will assume their new roles effective January 1, 2022.  I couldn't be more confident in our ability to continue to unleash the power of this iconic brand with both Sabir and Dyke leading KFC.
Next, we recently announced that David Graves, Pizza Hut U.S. General Manager, will be promoted to President of Pizza Hut U.S., effective January 1, 2022. Alongside Kevin Hochman, David has helped architect the Pizza Hut U.S. strategy and is the right person to lead the way forward for the brand by continuing to partner with our franchisees. 
With this promotion, Kevin Hochman, Interim President of Pizza Hut U.S. and President of KFC U.S., will return full-time to KFC U.S. I would like to thank Kevin for his unwavering commitment and leadership over the past 2 years as he led the Pizza Hut U.S. business and franchisees through a critical turnaround that has shown tremendous progress to date, all while simultaneously taking KFC U.S. to new heights. These internal promotions demonstrate that our deep bench of experienced leaders is a real competitive advantage for us across the restaurant industry.
Lastly, we recruited significant external talent with the appointment of Aaron Powell as Chief Executive Officer at Pizza Hut. Aaron joins us from Kimberly-Clark, where he most recently led their Asia Pacific business. We're thrilled to have Aaron join our leadership team with his seasoned CPG executive experience and believe his leadership, alongside Vipul Chawla and David Graves, will help fuel the brand's growth strategy.
Equally as important as our Recipe for Growth is our Recipe for Good. I could not be prouder of the progress Yum! and our brands have made this year in sharpening the focus and execution of our ESG agenda, particularly on climate action and sustainable packaging, alongside our global unlocking opportunity initiatives to tackle inequality. We are advancing our plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our global system and supply chain by nearly half by 2030. While we work to implement, learn from and scale pilots for reusable, recyclable and compostable packaging in the front of our restaurants to meet our 2025 public commitments.  
Across all of our brands, we're focused on building a resilient business for the future with purpose and sustainability as the core. Our iconic brands and unmatched scale put us in a class of our own. We're competitively advantaged given the size and capabilities of our franchise system, and I'm thrilled with our teams as we continue to be nimble and meet the consumer where they are. Overall, I'm proud of how our business is performing, and I'm confident that we're positioned to win in a post-COVID world.
With that, Chris, over to you."
365997,1675682294,2420326,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our solid balance sheet and liquidity position.

Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our solid balance sheet and liquidity position. 
I'll start by discussing our financial results. Our results year-to-date through Q3, highlighted by 15% system sales growth translating into strong core operating profit growth of 26%, demonstrate the resilience and strength of our economic model. The continued momentum reflected in our results reaffirms our confidence in delivering, on an annual basis, the long-term growth algorithm we reinstated on our last call, specifically 2% to 3% same-store sales growth plus 4% to 5% net-new unit growth translating to mid- to high single-digit system sales growth and high single-digit operating profit growth.
In the third quarter specifically, Yum! system sales grew 8%, driven by 5% same-store sales growth or 3% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3. We delivered 4% unit growth year-over-year, which included a record of 760 net-new units this quarter. Core operating profit increased 3% for the quarter, in line with our internal expectations when accounting for onetime items that impacted comparability.
The largest of these items was the lap of last year's bad debt recoveries, which accounted for a 5-point headwind to core operating profit growth. EPS, excluding special items, was $1.22, representing a 21% increase compared to ex special EPS of $1.01 in the third quarter last year. 
Reflected in our ex special EPS this quarter is an investment gain on our approximate 5% investment in Devyani International Limited, an entity that operates KFC and Pizza Hut franchised units in India. Our minority stake in Devyani was acquired in lieu of cash proceeds upon the refranchising of approximately 60 KFCs in India during 2019 and 2020. 
During the third quarter, Devyani completed an initial public offering, and we began reflecting the change in fair value of our investment in our results during the quarter. This resulted in $52 million of pretax investment gains on our approximate 5% stake, which added $0.16 to EPS, but did not impact our core operating profit. 
During Q3, we had bad debt expense of $3 million. As a reminder, we have large quarterly swings in bad debt last year due to COVID, and we're lapping $21 million in bad debt recoveries in the third quarter of last year resulting in a year-over-year headwind of 5 points or $24 million to core operating profit growth this quarter. We expect core operating profit growth to be negatively impacted again in Q4 as we lap bad debt recoveries of $8 million in the fourth quarter last year. 
Our general and administrative expenses on an ex special basis for the quarter were $249 million. On a full year basis this year, we now estimate consolidated G&A will be approximately $1.05 billion, an increase of about $60 million above our incoming expectations for the year, driven entirely by our above-target incentive compensation based on our strong business performance. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs with our unique scale benefits is unchanged. We expect our G&A to system sales ratio to move back to 1.7% next year on a full year basis. 
Finally, we note that Taco Bell company store margins have begun to normalize in the back half of this year due to increased staffing in our restaurants as we return to our historical daypart mix, wage investments and recent commodity inflation. While there will be quarterly variability due to the dynamic environment, we are confident in our ability to consistently deliver Taco Bell company store margins in line with our historical pre-COVID levels for full year 2021 and beyond.
Next, I'll discuss our Unmatched Operating Capabilities. We continue to invest in our technology strategy to expand both our digital capabilities and restaurant technology solutions. We're prioritizing making it easier to operate a restaurant, ultimately driving efficiencies in our stores to enhance franchise unit economics while also improving the customer experience. To that end, during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Dragontail Systems, a restaurant technology company that enhances both the team member and customer experience. Dragontail uses innovative technology that streamlines the order management process in the restaurant and optimizes delivery routes for drivers, resulting in our customers receiving the freshest possible product.
Thus far, the Dragontail solution has been deployed in 13 markets and over 1,700 stores across the Pizza Hut system. Many Pizza Hut restaurants leveraging Dragontail's platform have already seen a positive impact on sales, order fulfillment and customer satisfaction scores, including product freshness and delivery times. I recently participated in virtual store visits in the U.K. and in Latin America, where franchisees demonstrated benefits of the Dragontail System and shared their team members' excitement. 
Another example of how our technology investments yield enhanced operating performance is Taco Bell's continued execution of its all-access technology initiative. This connected suite of core restaurant technology solutions is used to optimize operations and create a frictionless customer experience. These strategic efforts contributed to Taco Bell's seventh consecutive quarter with drive-through times below 4 minutes, enabling the brand to serve more customers through the drive-through while also delivering a great customer experience.
Moving on to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. I'm thrilled to discuss how we delivered another record development quarter with 760 net-new units, including meaningful contributions across multiple geographies at our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell global brands. While we continue to see strong development from Yum China, our brands are also seeing broad-based development across other markets. The widespread strength in our store-level economics and cash-on-cash returns improving relative to pre-COVID levels are key drivers contributing to the acceleration in development we're seeing around the world. 
Our KFC International markets have seen impressive development as China, Russia, India, Latin America and the Middle East continued to deliver strong unit development during the third quarter. Additionally, over the past year, Pizza Hut International has driven a significant inflection in their unit growth, going from negative net-new units in 2020 to opening nearly 200 net-new units during the third quarter. We expect this momentum to continue, a further testament to the confidence our franchisees have in the future of the brand. At Taco Bell International, we continue to see strong development as key markets are approaching scale. 
Not only are we seeing strong development across our brands, but given the continued strength of digital and off-premise growth, our teams continue to evolve the asset types being developed into more digitally enabled formats. As an example, we now have 23 Go Mobile locations at Taco Bell U.S. These technology-forward restaurants, which include dual drive-thrus with a dedicated mobile pickup lane, mobile pickup shelves and a faster bellhop experience, among other things, have been a big hit, and we have more in our development pipeline. 
Next, I'll provide an update on our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. In August, we completed our third whole business securitization issuance at Taco Bell in the past 5 years, issuing $2.25 billion of new securitization notes. The weighted average yield of the new notes was approximately 2.24% and the proceeds were used to opportunistically repay $1.3 billion of existing higher coupon Taco Bell securitization notes and to support our share buyback program. We still expect our 2021 interest expense to be approximately $500 million, in line with 2020. 
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, excluding restricted cash. Due to our continued recovery in EBITDA, our consolidated net leverage continues to be temporarily below our target of approximately 5x.
With respect to our share buyback programs, during the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at an average share price of $127 per share, totaling approximately $330 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $860 million of shares at an average price of $117. 
Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, during the quarter were $49 million. We now expect net capital expenditures of approximately $175 million for the full year, reflecting roughly $75 million in refranchising proceeds and $250 million of gross CapEx. Lastly, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases.
Before wrapping up, I'd like to take a moment to address both labor and cost inflation pressures and how Yum! is well positioned to navigate these challenges. U.S. labor availability remains tight across most industries, driving wage inflation and staffing challenges that have resulted in a small number of our stores limiting operating hours particularly during the early morning and late-night dayparts. While our franchisees are not immune to these market pressures, we believe the power of our scale and the larger average size of our franchisees relative to those of our QSR peers enables our system to manage the inflationary environment better than most. 
For example, while many small chains and independent restaurants experience difficulties adapting to these market dynamics, our franchisees continue to invest through this environment, accelerating investments that help widen their strategic advantage. Additionally, our people-first culture is a true competitive advantage in both attracting and retaining team members. We're confident in the ability of our brands to respond to dynamic market conditions and are working closely with our franchisees to assess strategic opportunities to take price as and when needed, while ensuring we continue to offer compelling value to our customers. While store-level margins have moderated, franchisee unit economics generally remain incredibly healthy. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter, driven by impressive unit growth and sustained digital sales. We continue to invest in our digital ecosystem to scale technologies and provide a unique competitive advantage for our franchise operators while enhancing the customer and team member experience. Our franchise system is healthy and well positioned to invest through the near-term pressures, fueling our development engine and future unit growth. Our unit growth and sustained sales momentum, despite lingering COVID impacts, only make us more confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm. 
With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

While it was strong on a 2-year basis, there was some deceleration. Stimulus may have played a role last quarter, so maybe that was a false read. That would also seem to be the brand, just given your comments on staffing in early morning and late night that may have been impacted. So was there any notable impact to sales just from staffing shortages there? So if you could just sort of talk about the overall trends in staffing in particular, and why maybe you saw some deceleration on a 2-year basis?"

But I think our -- we're doing an amazing job in the field of being focused on retention. We won't have a staffing problem if we don't have any open jobs if we retain the employees that we have. And given the culture that we have in our restaurants across all of our brands and the kind of environments that our franchisees create for their employees with paychecks and then pathways to advancement, I think we're getting through this better than most. 
Yes, we're really proud of the results we put up across all of the brands this quarter. You guys probably saw, it's, on a 2-year basis, we're positive on all 4 brands. On a 1-year basis, we're positive on all 4 brands. And then obviously, the big news is the 760 net-new units that we opened for the quarter.
So a very strong quarter. We've got pluses and minuses, John, if you're talking about in the U.S. KFC was up 13% on a 2-year basis. Pizza Hut's HMR business, home meal replacement business, was up 17%. Taco Bell was a little bit softer. For them, late night and breakfast become a little bit more of a challenge, and they skew a little bit more towards individual meals. And I think that's what you're seeing. Every brand has a different set of attributes as we go through this. Some will play better in this environment than other, but all of our brands are really doing quite well, which is contributing to this great quarter."

Also just bigger picture, why you think Taco Bell, on a 2-year basis, might not be doing as well as the industry average of drive-thru chains out there? 
And then on unit growth, do you -- the results are very strong, and it's hard to see weakness or holdbacks from a development standpoint from a macro sense. But we would expect there to be that, that there would be some friction out there given all the macro challenges around COVID. Do you believe that there is -- something holds you back even in these strong numbers?"

Obviously, the numbers that we put up in this quarter are truly record setting, right? 760 net-new units in the third quarter is a record for Yum!. We're at 1,800 net-new units year-to-date basically, which is closing in on the record we set for Yum! in 2019 for full year development. 
And I think you're right. There's probably some friction that we're experiencing. That we haven't been able to open all the units that we could because of some challenges. But this is where the big advantages of Yum! come in. Our scale, our purchasing capability, the size of our franchisees, their access to capital. We've been anticipating some of the supply chain challenges ordering ahead of time, securing the inventory we need on equipment, for example, to get through this without having equipment delays to open restaurants.
So I do think there's further upside to the numbers we're putting up. And I do think if we continue these trends, we'll obviously set a record for Yum! in the fourth quarter. And we probably have a shot at setting a record for the restaurant industry all time for a number of units open in 1 year. I look forward to reporting back on that in our fourth quarter call. 
As for Taco Bell, the Taco Bell sales are up 15%. System sales are up 15% on a 2-year basis. We are making no apologies for that. The business is doing quite well, very strong. It does have its own unique challenges since it skews a little bit more towards individual meals versus family occasions. You're seeing the brands, like Pizza Hut and KFC that skewed towards family occasions, performing even better. But Taco Bell performance is strong. 
In Q3, we made some investments in -- on the marketing side that weren't designed to pay off on the top line, such as relaunching breakfast. We know those will have benefits for us down the road. So we're proud of what's going on at Taco Bell, with system sales growth like that, unit growth like we're seeing all across Yum! and at Taco Bell. I'm excited about the future for all our brands."

And if you think about the drivers, the #1 driver is unit economics. So that sort of gets at both parts of your question. Around the globe, in general, our franchisees are seeing strong EBITDA, and they are seeing that translate to improved returns whenever they build restaurants. Remember, these are our franchisees putting their capital to work. And that's where I think the strength of the brand and the larger average size of our franchisees really matters. They're able to see through near-term fluctuations related to COVID around the globe and invest for the long term. 
The second driver on development is the strong development teams that we have who are focused and incentivized to go create great results on the development front. And they have an improved set of capabilities. We're now bringing analytics to bear in how we set our development plans in a number of markets around the globe. We're bringing new prototypes to bear. We talked about the Go Mobile concept, which is primed for digital growth with Taco Bell. We have similar examples in other brands. So it's a broad set of drivers that are supporting this growth. 
And you've seen this trajectory change, in particular in the Pizza Hut business. That's been an important driver of where the numbers are. Pizza Hut International putting up plus 200 in the quarter, that's more than 300 better than where they were a year ago, and you've seen Pizza Hut U.S. stabilize. So those are also important drivers. So broad-based strength in development right now."

And of course, I ask that in the context of -- your supply chain seems to have gotten worse in the past 6 months, and perhaps some of the stores that opened in the third quarter benefited from what was ordered 6 months ago or even longer.

And I think this is where the strength of our operating model and our capability set around sourcing really shines. We saw some of those supply chain challenges related to equipment that are sort of a global challenge. We saw those on the horizon early this year, and our supply chain teams were building resiliency plans at that point, and they worked with our franchisees around the globe to get ahead on purchasing for those equipment and reserving capacity with suppliers. 
There's certainly going to be some local challenges here and there related to permitting. But again, this is where that capability set helped us get ahead, plus our larger, more sophisticated franchisees invest ahead. They have sophisticated teams who are driving their development, and that's a big asset here as well. So yes, we've probably left a few units on the table this year as a result of that. But in general, we don't see that as a constraint on our long-term development pattern."

Obviously, inflation is a story, not just in our industry but across sectors. And again, I think this is a situation where Yum!'s operating model sets us and our franchisees up to deal with those challenges really well. And I think of 3 things: one, keep in mind our footprint, 60% of our sales are outside the U.S., and these inflation challenges are most acute in the U.S. And we see it in a few pockets around the globe, but most acute in the U.S. 
Second, in the U.S., think about our scale. We purchase across all 4 brands together with RSCS. We have a professional team of highly talented, strategic sourcing experts. They're working away right now, I can tell you, throughout this inflationary trend. They saw it coming. They've got plans on finding ways to offset that. So we're leveraging our scale to help manage costs in those -- against those pressures.
And then third, to your point, we pulled a number of levers to manage margin with our franchisees. Our brands are working proactively with the franchisees. You mentioned product design. I'm sure we're doing a little bit of that. We've done some menu management. We'll think about how to optimize promotions. And of course, pricing is a lever that's available. 
But our franchisees and our brands, they manage and they balance the short term and the long term. In the short term, they want to make sure we're providing strong value to the customer, that we don't get too far ahead of the consumer. But in the long run, whenever I talk to our franchisees, they're confident that long-term margins in the restaurants will be sustained, and we can continue the momentum we've seen on restaurant profit coming through the last couple of years."

I think it hasn't gone unnoticed. We've had lots of demand from potential franchisees, both in the Yum! system and outside the Yum! system to enter. We've now started closing on a few deals. We closed on 2 already with Yum! franchisees entering the Habit system, and we have more in the hopper. So we're seeing strong demand and interest in becoming Habit franchisees because the unit economics are great, all the reasons why we bought them. 
As far as international goes, same story there. As you know, they're already in a couple of countries.

This quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. sales were up 17% on an off-premise basis, which is the heart of the business and the future of the business. But it's not immune to the same staffing challenges that everybody is facing. So we had -- I'm sure those sales were held back to some degree by the challenges of getting drivers. We actually saw our carryout business is now starting to grow faster. When we don't have the ability to get drivers, we're still able to pivot to carry out. But -- so we know that there's a lot of demand for what we're offering at Pizza Hut and with a bright future in the U.S. 
The other thing I'll point out is our investment in digital at Pizza Hut has been -- was really one of our leading investments in the world of digital. That's one of the advantages that Yum! has, is our knowledge of digital through the Pizza Hut business. I hope you guys all picked up on the fact that we had over $5 billion of digital sales yet again this quarter. But interesting context on that across Yum! is our dine-in business started to climb this quarter. So from Q2 to Q3, we did see a return to dine-in, yet we saw digital sales go up. And we saw digital mix go up, which is proving that not only is it sticky, that it's still something that's going to continue to grow for us, which is a great sign for all of our brands as we move forward. 
With that, I just want to thank everybody for the time on the call. We're obviously excited about what's going on with digital and what's going on with net-new unit development, widespread same-store sales growth on a 1- and 2-year basis across all of our brands.
