Before we get started, I'd l",1723,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. 
On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. Before we get started, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the tumultuous year that was 2020. It was a year that tested everything from our physical health to our mental state of mind, to how we see one another, it has impacted our colleagues, our families, our communities around the world. It brought personal hardship and loss, stresses and challenges that none of us would have predicted a year ago. 
I believe we've learned a lot about ourselves and our society over the past year. And while 2020 is behind us, many issues and difficulties remain. But let's not forget 2020 also showed us that the world can work together towards a common goal, to develop vaccines in order to solve a global problem. And for that, I'm both thankful and I remain optimistic about our future. 
Now on to the discussion of the quarter and year. We delivered an excellent fourth quarter in the midst of the pandemic. We grew organically. We picked up momentum and grew through acquisitions. We improved our productivity and raised our quality. We continue to invest in our bedrock culture. I'm extremely proud of how the team performed during the quarter and the full year. 
In our brokerage segment for the fourth quarter, reported revenue growth was a positive 3.6%. Most of that or 3.1% was organic revenue growth. We executed on our cost containment playbook and further utilized our centers of excellence, saving about $60 million in the quarter, helping drive our net earnings margin higher by 281 basis points and expanding our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 579 basis points. And net earnings were up 33% and adjusted EBITDAC was up 30%, another fantastic quarter for the brokerage team. 
Let me walk you around the world and give you some sound bites about each of our brokerage units, starting with our PC operations. In U.S. retail, organic growth was strong at about 4.5%. New business and client retention was similar to last year's fourth quarter. And midterm policy modifications, including full policy cancellations were slightly better than prior year levels. 
In our U.S. wholesale operations, Risk Placement Services, organic was about 5%. Open brokerage organic was more than 20% due to strong renewals, fueled by double-digit rate increases. Our MGA programs binding businesses were up about 2%. Retention was better sequentially, but as expected, new business wins are still lagging given the economy. 
Moving to the U.K. Around 4.5% organic for the quarter in both our retail and specialty operations, new and lost business was consistent with prior year. And special mention to our aviation team. They performed well in their largest quarter of the year, helping clients navigate exposures that were down significantly, call it, 30% to 40% and rate increases that pushed premiums close to pre-COVID levels. 
Australia and New Zealand combined posted organic of about 1%. The spread between new and lost business was similar to last year, but we are not getting as much lift from rate and exposure as we had in previous years. 
And finally, our Canadian retail operations posted organic of 13%, another terrific new business quarter combined with a nice tick up in client retention and strong rate environment. So overall, our global PC operations posted 4.5% organic, which is a bit better than the 4% we discussed at our December Investor Day. 
Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Fourth quarter organic was around minus 2%, which is at the favorable end of what we thought during our December IR Day. Similar to the previous couple of quarters, fees from consulting arrangements and special project work were down. However, revenue from our traditional health and welfare business continues to hold up with slightly positive fourth quarter organic, which is an encouraging sign. 
So when I bring PC and benefits together, total brokerage segment organic of 3.1%, a really strong quarter in this environment, and even better when you consider the tough compare against the fourth quarter 2019 of over 6%. 
Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market, starting with the rate environment. Global PC rates continue to march higher during the fourth quarter and overall. Rate was up around 8% across our footprint. Rates in Canada led the way up more than 12%. The U.S. was up more than 8% with wholesale stronger than retail, including rate increases of 15% within our wholesale open brokerage operations, followed by the U.K., including London Specialty, at about 5% and  Australia and New Zealand combined in the low single digits. 
By line of business, property and professional liability are up 12%, other casualty lines are up mid- to high-single digits, and workers' comp was flat to modestly positive. Not only are PC rates continuing to rise, terms and conditions are tightening and capacity is becoming increasingly constrained for some coverages. Nearly every area and line of business is firm or firming, and there are even a few lines that are very hard like umbrella, cyber and public company D&O. 
So needless to say, it is a difficult PC environment. This is where our teams excel: Helping businesses, many of which are still struggling, navigate the market through creative program design, shopping coverages and altering programs with increasing deductibles or reduced limits to help their risk management programs fit their budgets. 
Looking forward, I see a similar PC market conditions continuing in 2021. And while economic growth is coming, the pace of the recovery remains uncertain. So we remain laser-focused on what we can control, delivering the very best insurance and risk management advice, now successfully doing this virtually more than ever before, constantly improving our high-quality customer service, engaging with new prospects and growing our new business pipeline. 
Thus far, in January, full policy cancellations and other midterm policy adjustments are trending similar to January 2020. While it's still early, we are seeing year-over-year renewal premium increases at levels comparable to fourth quarter 2020. On the benefit side, the annual enrollment season is behind us. And for many of our clients, we saw covered lives stabilized from last year's declines. While retention and new business were similar to pre-COVID levels. In addition, a few of our benefits consulting practices are seeing increased activity and engagements early on in the year. 
So while there's a lot of year left, these early January indications give me further conviction that full year 2021 brokerage segment organic will be even better than 3.2% we delivered in 2020. 
Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. Following an active December, we finished the fourth quarter with 10 completed brokerage mergers representing about $100 million of estimated annualized revenues. And we've announced a handful more so far in January, representing an additional $85 million of estimated annualized revenues. This includes the Bollington merger in the U.K., which we think will close in early February after receiving regulatory approval this week. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
As I look at our M&A pipeline, we have 30 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $300 million of annualized revenues. We believe we are the platform of choice for successful entrepreneurs looking to take their business to the next level by leveraging our niche expertise, our tools and data, in addition to being a great place for their employees to advance their careers. We expect to have a very active 2021, particularly in the U.S. due to concerns related to possible tax changes. 
So to wrap up the brokerage segment. For the full year, we delivered: 5.4% growth in revenue; 3.2% all in organic growth; adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 418 basis points, fueled by cost savings of about $180 million; and we completed 27 mergers, representing about $250 million of estimated annualized revenue, a fantastic year for the brokerage team. 
Next, I would like to move to our risk management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic edged back into positive territory, nicely surpassing our December expectations of being down as much as 2%. We had some positive lift due to increasing COVID-related workers' compensation claims and saw strong retention and new business. So we ended 2020 with full year organic of minus 2.7% in this environment, to close a year in which core claim counts were down double digits for more than 10 months of the year and after posting a 10% organic decline in the second quarter alone is a just terrific recovery story. 
Going back to April and the beginning of the pandemic, we set our sights on delivering full year 2020 adjusted EBITDAC similar to 2019. Even with full year revenues forecasted to be down $30 million or more and boy, did the team to deliver. The team proactively managed its workforce, carefully rebalanced claim loads across adjusters and implemented expense controls, ultimately driving 2020 adjusted EBITDAC of nearly $150 million, $4 million better than 2019. Being able to grow full year EBITDAC, despite organic revenues that were backwards, is just fantastic work by the risk management team. 
As we look forward, January claim counts are trending very similar to the fourth quarter with many clients operating still at partial capacity. With new business sold in 2020 incepting over the next few quarters and still room for substantial job recovery, we believe full year 2021 organic will be closer to pre-COVID levels, in the mid single-digit range. 
Let me wrap up with some comments regarding our unique and resilient Gallagher culture. Culture guides our organization, our people in both good times and even more so in demanding times. And I believe culture is the source of our perseverance, our determination and our constant push for excellence. I'm extremely proud of our collective successes during 2020, but more importantly, how we came together to work as a team even while physically apart. Our culture has never been better, and I believe we are ending 2021 even stronger. 
Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"
252186,700977175,2184719,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J.

I'll echo Pat's comments and great quarter and an excellent year. I, too, would like to extend my appreciation to the team. 
Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cost savings, provide some -- a few observations from our CFO commentary document that we post on our website, then I'll do a vignette on our clean energy investments and finish with some thoughts on M&A, cash and liquidity. 
All right. Let's turn to the earnings release, Page 6, to the brokerage EBITDAC table. You'll see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by about $85 million over last year's fourth quarter, resulting in about 580 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $60 million of cost savings relative to fourth quarter '19 adjusted for [indiscernible] So underlying margin expansion was about 115 basis points on 3.1% all-in organic, which on its own is impressive. 
When you move to Page 8, the [ Risk Management ] segment, we grew EBITDAC a bit more than $4 million on slightly positive organic, resulting in about 190 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $5 million of cost savings relative to Q4 '19, which was moderated just a little by new client ramp-up costs. So underlying margins were up just a bit. That too is actually giving the flattish organic this quarter. 
Categories of fourth quarter savings for the combined brokerage and risk management segment were consistent with second and third quarter: Reduced travel, entertainment and advertising, about $25 million; reduced consulting and professional fees, $14 million; reduced outside labor and other workforce savings, $16 million; office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs, about $10 million. So that totals around $65 million, which is consistent with what we said at our December IR Day. 
Now looking forward, the pace of recovery isn't clear. We came into the year with another virus surge, now maybe some positive cases coming down. Some areas are imposing more lockdowns, yet others are loosening up. There's been some successes, but mostly delays in a vaccine rollout. And now it's looking like more and more that the stimulus might be caught in gridlock here in the U.S. 
Regardless of whether you're looking at half full or half empty glass, very few outlooks are expecting the business environment to be much different by the end of the first quarter. So for us, when it comes to first quarter '21, we're in organic in the 3% to 4% range, and we're seeing expense savings similar to fourth quarter '20, call it another $600 million -- excuse me, $60 million. If that happens, and we could again show margin expansion over about 500 basis points. Then looking towards second, third and fourth quarters of '21, it gets a little more tricky when you do your models. Because the slope of the recovery is still uncertain. And we're -- we're already realizing substantial COVID-induced expense savings beginning early in April of '20. 
But if the recovery steps up in those quarters, and we get back to organic of, say, high 4% or 5%, it does give us a path towards holding full year margins, especially if travel and entertainment remains limited. 
Now all of this needs to be taken into context. In 2017, '18 and '19, we were expanding margins 50 to 75 basis points a year on organic in that 4% to 5% range. Then the COVID hit, we execute on our cost containment playbook and still managed to grow organic 3%. That pops margins over 400 basis points in the face of this global pandemic. 
So now what I'm saying is that we have a fighting chance to hold or even improve full year margins here in '21 on the prospect of getting closer to pre-pandemic organic growth later in the year. To me, that's still about a bullish story as you can write. 
Now if we move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. On Page 2, the blue fourth quarter column. You'll see most of the items are consistent with what we provided during our December IR day, and that's in the gray column. FX came in $0.01 better and severance and integration costs also $0.01 better when you compare that to the prior quarters. 
Also on Page 2 in the reddish column, we're now providing our quarterly look at 2021, a few comments. First, foreign exchange. With the U.S. dollar weakening and if it stays that way throughout the year, 2021 revenue could see a $100 million tailwind in brokerage and $14 million in risk management. Wouldn't be much EPS impact within risk management, but could translate into a nickel or so for our brokerage segment. That would even be better on reported EBITDA. 
Second, amortization expense. We're currently forecasting a little over $100 million a quarter in brokerage, which includes the all-announced mergers to date. You can see the roll in revenues associated with all-announced mergers to date on Page 5. And then also, don't forget to adjust your amortization expense in the second and later quarters to reflect any future M&A you might be including in your model. 
Third, when you look at M&A multiples shown on Page 2 on the last line of the table, like Pat said, we had an active December, closing 10, 3 of which were on the larger end of our typical tuck-in size. That pushed the multiple up a turn or so this year, but it's still creating a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple. More importantly, it brings some really terrific merger partners to the team, letting us grow better together over the long haul. 
When you move to Page 3 of the CFO commentary in the corporate table. When you compare our December IR Day estimates in the gray column with our fourth quarter results in the blue column, we posted favorable interest expense due to strong cash flows, we had better clean energy earnings, in line M&A expense and a slightly more favorable corporate line. Also on Page 3, we're now providing a first look at [ '21 ] ranges for the corporate segment, and that's in the reddish column. Nothing surprising, and there's no change on our outlook for clean energy, still in that $60 million to $75 million of annual after-tax earnings we provided during our IR day. 
So this brings me to my vignette on clean energy. You'll read on Page 4, Note 5 of the CFO commentary document, that these investments are winding down at the end of '21, unless there's an extension. That means in 2022, we will have 0 GAAP earnings. But remember, that will be more than replaced with substantial cash flow benefits. In other words, '21 and prior years were the credit generation years when we report the GAAP benefit in our P&L, but '22 starts the cash harvest years where we'll get considerably larger cash benefits in our operating cash flows. 
Here's the shortcut way to think about how to compete those cash benefits. First, if you go to Page 14 of the earnings release, about the 7th line down in our balance sheet, you'll read that we have a deferred tax asset of over $1 billion, mostly consisting of clean energy credit carryforwards. With 1 more year of credit generation, that asset should grow by another $100 million. So call it, $1.1 billion of credit carryovers by the end of '21. 
Then assuming '22, we will begin using more credits than we've been using thus far. How -- third, then how fast we'll be using those credits will depend on how fast we grow our U.S. taxable income. But for this illustration, and if you assume a 7-year period, it might mean we would be harvesting about $125 million to $150 million in '22, with that ramping up to, say, about $175 million to $200 million in 2028. It's a little odd that GAAP earnings go to 0, and then the cash benefits become dramatically better, but that's just how it works. This is and has been a really important part of our story over the last decade, so I think it was worth an extra time today. 
All right. Let me go on to some comments on cash and M&A. At December 31, available cash on hand was nearly $700 million. We have a significant untapped capacity on our revolving credit facility, and we have another year ahead of us of really strong cash flows. That might mean that we would have perhaps up to $2.5 billion of M&A capacity here in '21. That's a terrific position as we come into a year that we see as perhaps the most active year ever in the brokerage M&A space. 
Okay. That wraps up '20 and we're positioned really well for '21. Organic looks better, bolt-on M&A looks better. We have a decent chance of keeping a largest chunk of our cost savings [indiscernible] in the year of harvesting cash flows from our clean energy initiatives. And most important, I can feel our team's excitement about coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever before. My thanks to them for another fantastic year. 
Back to you, Pat."

As it emerges for the quarters this year, it really is kind of a sensitive interplay between organic and then just really what happens with the economy. 
We'll follow our customers' expectations. We are learning that they are much more receptive now to virtual interactions, allowed us to get our niche expertise at the point of sale easier than jumping on an airplane and spending days traveling. So we are learning a lot and -- but we will follow our customers' expectations.

Or when we think about the path from 3% to 4% organic growth, the 5% to 6% organic growth, are we just waiting for the economy to improve and the shots to get in the arms, so everyone can get back out there and living?"

You start with March of last year, and the answer to that is yes. Having said that, they have a lot of needs and a lot of requests. So we were running webinars around COVID, return to work, all kinds of different -- ads cyber or what have you. Blew my mind, thousands of people signed up. And it was not unusual for us to run a webinar with 5,000 attendees. I mean, I never heard of such a thing. 
So it's a huge thirst for information. Which helped our people, of course, know exactly some of the hot buttons that they should be talking to potential clients. And to get out -- and I was amazed. I really would have told you that I thought maybe new business would have hunkered down. I didn't think our loss business would increase because of that. 
In fact, it's amazing to me the kind of new business that we did generate. So I think that it gives us a lot of confidence to sell the kind of business we sold last year. And you'd get some fall over from '19 into the first quarter, maybe a little in the second quarter. But everything from May on was really generated after the first of the year. So really an incredible new business year. 
Secondly, are we seeing the advent potentially of people beginning to come back into the businesses? I think, yes. I think we're seeing that there is going to -- and whether stimulus happens or not, I think businesses have learned how to do this, just to look at your local restaurants. The night about a year ago, they weren't -- or March, they might -- they're not going to survive. Takeout is not making them robust, but they're surviving, and they're ready. 
I mean in the Chicago land area, now we can go to restaurants again. They have very limited occupancy. But they are ready, they're welcoming, they want people back, and people are excited about it. So I think the pent-up demand for people to be able to go do things is also going to be helpful. 
Then lastly, let's not forget something. I told you guys this 1,000 times. I don't like hard markets. And I get it, they all look good on paper, what have you. But they tick every customer off and they're suffering through this right now because they don't only have a choice, but they are going to shop. And we are there for them to understand that both our data capabilities as well as our professional niche capabilities and our ability to work them through the process of taking more risk, becoming more -- becoming more self-insured, that's our bread and butter. We're better at that than anybody. 
So I think that, that is -- it's all of those combined that leads me to believe that we see a very robust new business year ahead in '21 and '22."

So when you look at the -- where we're really getting leverage, I think that we're getting leverage because of our scale, especially relative to that, to that level of competitor, the smaller ones that we compete with day in and day out. 
I think we have opportunities to continue to use our lower cost labor locations and our centers of excellence. I think our ability in order to rationalize our real estate footprint, I think that we can buy goods and services cheaper. I think our ability to automate many of the interactions with the clients and with our own employees, all of those things, I would say that Gallagher is positioned. We have a common agency management system in most of our countries, in most of our businesses. Those are things that we believe that we will continue to bring scale advantages versus our smaller competitors. 
How do I feel about it comparing to, let's say, the other top 10 brokers? First of all, you got to pick the ones that have the culture that want to work together and make it happen. And then you've got to pick the ones that haven't already gone down this journey to see whether or not they're there yet or not. But we think that we're in a really terrific place to continue to leverage our technologies and our scale compared to most of our competition.

And the smaller brokers have the problem of just simply not having the capabilities that clients are starting to ask for. And these can be simple questions like: How do I know? How do I know you just gave me the best deal? When I was out selling 30 years ago on a daily basis, that would be answered by saying I went to 3 carriers, that's the best price. That does not float today. They want to know what you're doing with clients, what carriers are doing it, where the ranges are, what their loss ratio looks like compared to others. They want detail. They want data. 
Smaller people can't do that. So what you've got is folks that are losing accounts to the likes of ourselves, and we're out telling them, why wouldn't you come to a place that's happy to pay you for what you hunt and kill, and at the same time you have all the support and the capabilities in the world.

So the workload associated with a rate increase that comes from exposure units, not that much more. If it comes from additional rate, that means we want to go out and shop it more, we'll take a little bit more effort. But because of our efficiencies, we can do that at a pretty low-cost month. 
So just the number of policies or the exposure units or a modest rate increase or decrease doesn't change our workload that much. So I wouldn't say that, that would have a significant impact on margin if you're kind of in that 2% to 4% range on rates and exposures. 
When you're asking the next part of the question about where do we see the kind of the old, tried and true line. If you grow organically, 3% is our margin lift in it? Yes, I think there is.

I don't have -- I've got to be considering my own survival tactics, and I surmise there'd be less shopping of our existing business. 
I was right a little bit. It certainly didn't stop shopping. It wasn't like everything came to a grounding halt. But if you're a good broker, and we've got really good competition in this market, in a hard market you, early on explain to your client, that if you are unhappy with a hard market and you want to be really unhappier, shop the hell out of it because you're going to get slaughtered. And in fact, in a hard market, shopping does decrease. 
Unfortunately, as things ease up a bit, people are unhappy and intends to increase shopping. So right now, we're in a very firm and firming market, and people understand that they need our expertise. And it also does scare some of those littler competitors that we compete with 90% of the time not at being so bold is to say they can do better than we do. Pretty tough to prove it."

First, I still believe that EBITDAC is a good proxy for how to value a broker. Then you just have to back off the cash taxes paid. And interest expense, of course, and the cash taxes paid and interest yield on that. But if you basically start with EBITDAC, you're going to get pretty close to the way, and that's been a traditional way. 
So what does that mean for Gallagher, is that we've said this for years, we still pay taxes. People sometimes think that we're not paying our fair share. That's not the case at all. We still pay taxes. It runs about -- I've said this, if you go back to when tax changed, that we are -- that we're -- we think that we're going to pay in that 5% to 6% to 7% of EBITDA range just as a proxy. We're probably at that same range even if tax rates go up, to 28% from 21%. It would be a book rate differential. It wouldn't really be a cash difference. If the Biden tax measures were put in place, it might cost us $10 million a year in taxes more Paul. But it wouldn't be a huge number. 
The value of tax credits become more valuable if tax rates go up. So really, for Gallagher, it's to take our EBITDA, back off our CapEx, back off our interest expense and put in 7% or 8% for cash taxes paid, and you get pretty close to the cash flow amount for Gallagher. I might have missed something in there, but I think I got most of the pieces in that. But I would start with EBITDA still."

I'm confident that we can deliver another great year of financial performance in 2021 and truly believe that as an enterprise, we are just getting started. So thanks for being with us, folks. We appreciate it."

On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
Before we get started, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the tumultuous year that was 2020. It was a year that tested everything from our physical health to our mental state of mind, to how we see one another. It has impacted our colleagues, our families, our communities around the world. It brought personal hardship and loss, stresses and challenges that none of us would have predicted a year ago.
I believe we've learned a lot about ourselves and our society over the past year. And while 2020 is behind us, many issues and difficulties remain. But let's not forget 2020 also showed us that the world can work together towards a common goal, to develop vaccines in order to solve a global problem. And for that, I'm both thankful and I remain optimistic about our future.
Now on to the discussion of the quarter and the year. We delivered an excellent fourth quarter in the midst of the pandemic. We grew organically. We picked up momentum and grew through acquisitions. We improved our productivity and raised our quality. We continue to invest in our bedrock culture. I'm extremely proud of how the team performed during the quarter and the full year.
In our Brokerage segment for the fourth quarter, reported revenue growth was a positive 3.6%. Most of that, or 3.1%, was organic revenue growth. We executed on our cost containment playbook and further utilized our centers of excellence, saving about $60 million in the quarter, helping drive our net earnings margin higher by 281 basis points and expanding our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 579 basis points. And net earnings were up 33% and adjusted EBITDAC was up 30%, another fantastic quarter for the brokerage team.
Let me walk you around the world and give you some sound bites about each of our brokerage units, starting with our PC operations. In U.S. retail, organic growth was strong at about 4.5%. New business and client retention was similar to last year's fourth quarter. And midterm policy modifications, including full policy cancellations, were slightly better than prior year levels.
In our U.S. wholesale operations, Risk Placement Services, organic was about 5%. Open brokerage organic was more than 20% due to strong renewals, fueled by double-digit rate increases. Our MGA programs binding businesses were up about 2%. Retention was better sequentially, but as expected, new business wins are still lagging given the economy.
Moving to the U.K. Around 4.5% organic for the quarter. In both our retail and specialty operations, new and lost business was consistent with prior year. And special mention to our aviation team. They performed well in their largest quarter of the year, helping clients navigate exposures that were down significantly, call it, 30% to 40%, and rate increases that pushed premiums close to pre-COVID levels.
Australia and New Zealand combined posted organic of about 1%. The spread between new and lost business was similar to last year, but we are not getting as much lift from rate and exposure as we had in previous years.
And finally, our Canadian retail operations posted organic of 13%, another terrific new business quarter combined with a nice tick-up in client retention and strong rate environment. So overall, our global PC operations posted 4.5% organic, which is a bit better than the 4% we discussed at our December Investor Day.
Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Fourth quarter organic was around minus 2%, which is at the favorable end of what we thought during our December IR Day. Similar to the previous couple of quarters, fees from consulting arrangements and special project work were down. However, revenue from our traditional health and welfare business continues to hold up with slightly positive fourth quarter organic, which is an encouraging sign. So when I bring PC and benefits together, total Brokerage segment organic of 3.1%, a really strong quarter in this environment and even better when you consider the tough compare against the fourth quarter 2019 of over 6%.
Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market, starting with the rate environment. Global PC rates continue to march higher during the fourth quarter and overall. Rate was up around 8% across our footprint. Rates in Canada led the way, up more than 12%. The U.S. was up more than 8% with wholesale stronger than retail, including rate increases of 15% within our wholesale open brokerage operations, followed by the U.K., including London Specialty, at about 5% and Australia and New Zealand combined in the low single digits.
By line of business, property and professional liability are up 12%. Other casualty lines are up mid- to high single digits. And workers' comp was flat to modestly positive. Not only are PC rates continuing to rise, terms and conditions are tightening, and capacity is becoming increasingly constrained for some coverages. Nearly every area and line of business is firm or firming, and there are even a few lines that are very hard like umbrella, cyber and public company D&O.
So needless to say, it is a difficult PC environment. This is where our teams excel: helping businesses, many of which are still struggling, navigate the market through creative program design, shopping coverages and altering programs with increasing deductibles or reduced limits to help their risk management programs fit their budgets.
Looking forward, I see a similar PC market conditions continuing in 2021. And while economic growth is coming, the pace of the recovery remains uncertain. So we remain laser-focused on what we can control, delivering the very best insurance and risk management advice, now successfully doing this virtually more than ever before, constantly improving our high-quality customer service, engaging with new prospects and growing our new business pipeline.
Thus far in January, full policy cancellations and other midterm policy adjustments are trending similar to January 2020. While it's still early, we are seeing year-over-year renewal premium increases at levels comparable to fourth quarter 2020. On the benefit side, the annual enrollment season is behind us. And for many of our clients, we saw covered lives stabilized from last year's declines, while retention and new business were similar to pre-COVID levels. In addition, a few of our benefits consulting practices are seeing increased activity and engagements early on in the year. So while there's a lot of the year left, these early January indications give me further conviction that full year 2021 Brokerage segment organic will be even better than the 3.2% we delivered in 2020.
Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. Following an active December, we finished the fourth quarter with 10 completed brokerage mergers representing about $100 million of estimated annualized revenues. And we've announced a handful more so far in January, representing an additional $85 million of estimated annualized revenues. This includes the Bollington merger in the U.K., which we think will close in early February after receiving regulatory approval this week. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.
As I look at our M&A pipeline, we have 30 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $300 million of annualized revenues. We believe we are the platform of choice for successful entrepreneurs looking to take their business to the next level by leveraging our niche expertise, our tools and data, in addition to being a great place for their employees to advance their careers. We expect to have a very active 2021, particularly in the U.S. due to concerns related to possible tax changes.
So to wrap up the Brokerage segment. For the full year, we delivered 5.4% growth in revenue, 3.2% all in organic growth; adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 418 basis points, fueled by cost savings of about $180 million. And we completed 27 mergers, representing about $250 million of estimated annualized revenue. A fantastic year for the brokerage team.
Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic edged back into positive territory, nicely surpassing our December expectations of being down as much as 2%. We had some positive lift due to increasing COVID-related workers' compensation claims and saw strong retention and new business. So we ended 2020 with full year organic of minus 2.7%. In this environment, to close a year in which core claim counts were down double digits for more than 10 months of the year and after posting a 10% organic decline in the second quarter alone is a just terrific recovery story.
Going back to April and the beginning of the pandemic, we set our sights on delivering full year 2020 adjusted EBITDAC similar to 2019, even with full year revenues forecasted to be down $30 million or more. And boy, did the team deliver. The team proactively managed its workforce, carefully rebalanced claim loads across adjusters and implemented expense controls, ultimately driving 2020 adjusted EBITDAC of nearly $150 million, $4 million better than 2019. Being able to grow full year EBITDAC despite organic revenues that were backwards is just fantastic work by the Risk Management team.
As we look forward, January claim counts are trending very similar to the fourth quarter with many clients operating still at partial capacity. With new business sold in 2020 incepting over the next few quarters and still room for substantial job recovery, we believe full year 2021 organic will be closer to pre-COVID levels, in the mid-single-digit range.
Let me wrap up with some comments regarding our unique and resilient Gallagher culture. Culture guides our organization, our people in both good times and even more so in demanding times. And I believe culture is the source of our perseverance, our determination and our constant push for excellence. I'm extremely proud of our collective successes during 2020, but more importantly, how we came together to work as a team even while physically apart. Our culture has never been better, and I believe we are ending 2021 even stronger.
Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"
252186,700977175,2184910,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J.

I'll echo Pat's comments. A great quarter and an excellent year. I, too, would like to extend my appreciation to the team.
Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cost savings, provide some -- a few observations from our CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. Then I'll do a vignette on our clean energy investments and finish with some thoughts on M&A, cash and liquidity.
All right. Let's turn to the earnings release, Page 6, to the Brokerage EBITDAC table. You'll see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by about $85 million over last year's fourth quarter, resulting in about 580 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $60 million of cost savings relative to fourth quarter '19 adjusted for [ mergers ]. So underlying margin expansion was about 115 basis points on 3.1% all-in organic, which on its own is impressive.
When you move to Page 8, the Risk Management segment. We grew EBITDAC a bit more than $4 million on slightly positive organic, resulting in about 190 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $5 million of cost savings relative to Q4 '19, which was moderated just a little by new client ramp-up costs. So underlying margins were up just a bit. That, too, is excellent given the flattish organic this quarter.
Categories of fourth quarter savings for the combined Brokerage and Risk Management segment were consistent with second and third quarter: reduced travel, entertainment and advertising, about $25 million; reduced consulting and professional fees, $14 million; reduced outside labor and other workforce savings, $16 million; office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs, about $10 million. So that totals around $65 million, which is consistent with what we said at our December IR Day.
Now looking forward, the pace of recovery isn't clear. We came into the year with another virus surge, now maybe some positive cases coming down. Some areas are imposing more lockdowns, yet others are loosening up. There's been some successes but mostly delays in the vaccine rollout. And now it's looking like more and more that the stimulus might be caught in gridlock here in the U.S.
Regardless of whether you're looking at half full or half empty glass, very few outlooks are expecting the business environment to be much different by the end of the first quarter. So for us, when it comes to first quarter '21, we're seeing organic in the 3% to 4% range, and we're seeing expense savings similar to fourth quarter '20, call it another $600 million -- excuse me, $60 million. If that happens, we could again show margin expansion of about 500 basis points. 
Then looking towards second, third and fourth quarters of '21, it gets a little more tricky when you do your models because the slope of the recovery is still uncertain. And we're already realizing substantial COVID-induced expense savings beginning early in April of '20. But if the recovery steps up in those quarters and we get back to organic of, say, high 4% or 5%, it does give us a path towards holding full year margins, especially if travel and entertainment remains limited.
Now all of this needs to be taken into context. In 2017, '18 and '19, we were expanding margins 50 to 75 basis points a year on organic in that 4% to 5% range. Then the COVID hit. We executed on our cost containment playbook and still managed to grow organic 3%. That pops margins over 400 basis points in the face of this global pandemic. So now what I'm saying is that we have a fighting chance to hold or even improve full year margins here in '21 on the prospect of getting closer to pre-pandemic organic growth later in the year. To me, that's still about a bullish story as you can write.
Now if we move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. On Page 2, the blue fourth quarter column. You'll see most of the items are consistent with what we provided during our December IR Day, and that's in the gray column. FX came in $0.01 better and severance and integration costs also $0.01 better when you compare that to the prior quarters.
Also on Page 2 in the reddish column, we're now providing our quarterly look at 2021. A few comments. First, foreign exchange. With the U.S. dollar weakening and if it stays that way throughout the year, 2021 revenue could see a $100 million tailwind in Brokerage and $14 million in Risk Management. Wouldn't be much EPS impact within Risk Management but could translate into $0.05 or so for our Brokerage segment. And that would even be better on reported EBITDAC.
Second, amortization expense. We're currently forecasting a little over $100 million a quarter in Brokerage, which includes the all-announced mergers to date. You can see the roll in revenues associated with all-announced mergers to date on Page 5. And then also, don't forget to adjust your amortization expense in the second and later quarters to reflect any future M&A you might be including in your model.
Third, when you look at M&A multiples shown on Page 2 on the last line in the table, like Pat said, we had an active December, closing 10, 3 of which were on the larger end of our typical tuck-in size. That pushed the multiple up a turn or so this year but still creating a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple. More importantly, it brings some really terrific merger partners to the team, letting us grow better together over the long haul.
When you move to Page 3 of the CFO commentary in the Corporate table. When you compare our December IR Day estimates in the gray column with our fourth quarter results in the blue column, we posted favorable interest expense due to strong cash flows. We had better clean energy earnings, in line M&A expense and a slightly more favorable corporate line. 
Also on Page 3, we're now providing a first look at '21 ranges for the Corporate segment, and that's in the reddish column. Nothing surprising, and there's no change on our outlook for clean energy, still in that $60 million to $75 million of annual after-tax earnings we provided during our IR Day.
So this brings me to my vignette on clean energy. You'll read on Page 4, Note 5 of the CFO commentary document that these investments are winding down at the end of '21, unless there's an extension. That means in 2022, we will have 0 GAAP earnings. But remember, that will be more than replaced with substantial cash flow benefits. In other words, '21 and prior years were the credit generation years when we report the GAAP benefit in our P&L, but '22 starts the cash harvest years where we'll get considerably larger cash benefits in our operating cash flows.
Here's the shortcut way to think about how to compute those cash benefits. First, if you go to Page 14 of the earnings release, about the seventh line down in our balance sheet, you'll read that we have a deferred tax asset of over $1 billion, mostly consisting of clean energy credit carryforwards. With 1 more year of credit generation, that asset should grow by another $100 million. So call it $1.1 billion of credit carryovers by the end of '21. Then assume in '22 we will begin using more credits than we've been using thus far. 
How -- third, then how fast we'll be using those credits will depend on how fast we grow our U.S. taxable income. But for this illustration, and if you assume a 7-year period, it might mean we would be harvesting about $125 million to $150 million in '22, with that ramping up to, say, about $175 million to $200 million in 2028. It's a little odd that GAAP earnings go to 0, and then the cash benefits become dramatically better, but that's just how it works. This is and has been a really important part of our story over the last decade, so I think it was worth some extra time today.
All right. Let me go on to some comments on cash and M&A. At December 31, available cash on hand was nearly $700 million. We have a significant untapped capacity on our revolving credit facility, and we have another year ahead of us of really strong cash flows. That might mean that we would have perhaps up to $2.5 billion of M&A capacity here in '21. That's a terrific position as we come into a year that we see as perhaps the most active year ever in the brokerage M&A space.
Okay. That wraps up '20 and we're positioned really well for '21. Organic looks better. Bolt-on M&A looks better. We have a decent chance of keeping a largest chunk of our cost savings, [ assuming we're going to have a ] year of harvesting cash flows from our clean energy initiatives. And most important, I can feel our team's excitement about coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever before. My thanks to them for another fantastic year.
Back to you, Pat."

As it emerges for the quarters this year, it really is kind of a sensitive interplay between organic and then just really what happens with the economy. 
We'll follow our customers' expectations. We are learning that they are much more receptive now to virtual interactions, allowing us to get our niche expertise at the point of sale easier than jumping on an airplane and spending days traveling. So we are learning a lot and -- but we will follow our customers' expectations. How that exactly plays out in the second and third and fourth quarters really depends on how fast the organic moves from that 3% to 4% range up into maybe the 5% or 6% range."

In thinking about the sales pipeline, I'm trying to contemplate, I guess, in my mind, clients would have hunkered down early on in COVID and been less likely to change brokers or to really contemplate a move like that. Does it feel like people are just getting more comfortable with the world we live in today and that's opening up? Or when we think about the path from 3% to 4% organic growth, the 5% to 6% organic growth, are we just waiting for the economy to improve and the shots to get in the arms so everyone can get back out there and living?"

You start with March of last year, and the answer to that is yes. Having said that, they have a lot of needs and a lot of requests. So we were running webinars around COVID, return to work, all kinds of different -- cyber, what have you. Blew my mind. Thousands of people signed up. And it was not unusual for us to run a webinar with 5,000 attendees. I mean I never heard of such a thing. 
So there's a huge thirst for information, which helped our people, of course, know exactly some of the hot buttons that they should be talking to potential clients. And to get out -- and I was amazed. I really would have told you that I thought maybe new business would have hunkered down. I didn't think our lost business would increase because of that. 
In fact, it's amazing to me the kind of new business that we did generate. So I think that it gives us a lot of confidence to sell the kind of business we sold last year. And you'd get some fall-over from '19 into the first quarter, maybe a little in the second quarter. But everything from May on was really generated after the first of the year. So really an incredible new business year. 
Secondly, are we seeing the advent potentially of people beginning to come back into the businesses? I think, yes. I think we're seeing that there is going to -- and whether stimulus happens or not, I think businesses have learned how to do this. Take just a look at your local restaurants. About a year ago, they weren't -- or March, they might -- they're not going to survive. Takeout is not making them robust but they're surviving and they're ready. I mean in the Chicago land area now, we can go to restaurants again. They have very limited occupancy. But they are ready. They're welcoming. They want people back and people are excited about it. So I think the pent-up demand for people to be able to go do things is also going to be helpful. 
Then lastly, let's not forget something. I told you guys this 1,000 times. I don't like hard markets. And I get it, they all look good on paper, what have you. But they tick every customer off, and they're suffering through this right now because they don't only have a choice, but they are going to shop. And we are there for them to understand that both our data capabilities as well as our professional niche capabilities and our ability to work them through the process of taking more risk, becoming more -- becoming more self-insured, that's our bread and butter. We're better at that than anybody. So I think that, that is -- it's all of those combined that leads me to believe that we see a very robust new business year ahead in '21 and '22."

I think we have opportunities to continue to use our lower-cost labor locations and our centers of excellence. I think our ability in order to rationalize our real estate footprint, I think that we can buy goods and services cheaper, I think our ability to automate many of the interactions with the clients and with our own employees, all of those things, I would say that Gallagher is positioned. We have a common agency management system in most of our countries, in most of our businesses. Those are things that we believe that will continue to bring scale advantages versus our smaller competitors. 
How do I feel about it comparing to, let's say, the other top 10 brokers? First of all, you got to pick the ones that have the culture that want to work together and make it happen. And then you've got to pick the ones that haven't already gone down this journey to see whether or not they're there yet or not.

Doug mentioned that 90% of the time we compete, we compete with smaller brokers. And the smaller brokers have the problem of just simply not having the capabilities that clients are starting to ask for. And these can be simple questions, like how do I know? How do I know you just gave me the best deal? When I was out selling 30 years ago on a daily basis, that would be answered by saying, ""I went to 3 carriers, that's the best price."" That does not float today. They want to know what you're doing with clients, what carriers are doing it, where the ranges are, what their loss ratio looks like compared to others. They want detail. They want data. 
Smaller people can't do that. So what you've got is folks that are losing accounts to the likes of ourselves, and we're out telling them, ""Why wouldn't you come to a place that's happy to pay you for what you hunt and kill, and at the same time, you have all the support and the capabilities in the world.""

So I would think there are different ways to get to 4% to 5% organic growth, and each of those potentially has a very different impact on margins, namely, if you're getting more of that organic growth through rate versus exposure unit growth.

And then on the flip side, I think in the past, you used to talk about needing to get at least 3% organic in order to keep margins stable. How should we think about, let's say, 3% organic growth for -- if you achieve that in '21? What does that mean for margins?"

The workload -- the difference in workload on a customer that is adding exposure units, i.e., adding vehicles or changing miles, isn't significant, whether they're adding a couple of values. So the workload associated with a rate increase that comes from exposure units, not that much more. If it comes from additional rate, that means we want to go out and shop it more, we'll take a little bit more effort. But because of our efficiencies, we can do that at a pretty low-cost month. 
So just the number of policies or the exposure units or a modest rate increase or decrease doesn't change our workload that much. So I wouldn't say that, that would have a significant impact on margin if you're kind of in that 2% to 4% range on rates and exposures. 
When you're asking the next part of the question about where do we see the kind of the old, tried and true line, if you grow organically, 3% is our margin lift in it, yes, I think there is.

This is where it is. I don't have -- I've got to be considering my own survival tactics. And I surmise there'd be less shopping of our existing business. 
I was right a little bit. It certainly didn't stop shopping. It wasn't like everything came to a grounding halt. But if you're a good broker, and we've got really good competition in this market, in a hard market you early on explain to your client that if you are unhappy with a hard market and you want to be really unhappier, shop the hell out of it because you're going to get slaughtered. And in fact, in a hard market, shopping does decrease. Pardon me.
Unfortunately, as things ease up a bit, people are unhappy and intends to increase shopping. So right now, we're in a very firm and firming market, and people understand that they need our expertise. And it also does scare some of those little competitors that we compete with 90% of the time out of being so bold as to say they can do better than we do. Pretty tough to prove it."

First, I still believe that EBITDAC is a good proxy for how to value a broker. Then you just have to back off the cash taxes paid and interest expense, of course, and the cash taxes paid and interest yield on that. But if you basically start with EBITDAC, you're going to get pretty close to the way, and that's been a traditional way. 
So what does that mean for Gallagher is that we've said this for years, we still pay taxes. People sometimes think that we're not paying our fair share. That's not the case at all. We still pay taxes. It runs about -- I've said this, if you go back to when tax changed, that we are -- we think that we're going to pay in that 5% to 6% to 7% of EBITDA range just as a proxy. We're probably at that same range even if tax rates go up to 28% from 21%. It would be a book rate differential. It wouldn't really be a cash difference. If the Biden tax measures were put in place, it might cost us $10 million a year in taxes more, Paul. But it wouldn't be a huge number. 
The value of tax credits become more valuable if tax rates go up. So really, for Gallagher, it's to take our EBITDA, back off our CapEx, back off our interest expense and put in 7% or 8% for cash taxes paid, and you get pretty close to the cash flow amount for Gallagher. I might have missed something in there, but I think I got most of the pieces in that. But I would start with EBITDA still."

On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
Before we get started, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the tumultuous year that was 2020. It was a year that tested everything from our physical health to our mental state of mind, to how we see one another. It has impacted our colleagues, our families, our communities around the world. It brought personal hardship and loss, stresses and challenges that none of us would have predicted a year ago.
I believe we've learned a lot about ourselves and our society over the past year. And while 2020 is behind us, many issues and difficulties remain. But let's not forget 2020 also showed us that the world can work together towards a common goal, to develop vaccines in order to solve a global problem. And for that, I'm both thankful and I remain optimistic about our future.
Now on to the discussion of the quarter and the year. We delivered an excellent fourth quarter in the midst of the pandemic. We grew organically. We picked up momentum and grew through acquisitions. We improved our productivity and raised our quality. We continue to invest in our bedrock culture. I'm extremely proud of how the team performed during the quarter and the full year.
In our Brokerage segment for the fourth quarter, reported revenue growth was a positive 3.6%. Most of that, or 3.1%, was organic revenue growth. We executed on our cost containment playbook and further utilized our centers of excellence, saving about $60 million in the quarter, helping drive our net earnings margin higher by 281 basis points and expanding our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 579 basis points. And net earnings were up 33% and adjusted EBITDAC was up 30%, another fantastic quarter for the brokerage team.
Let me walk you around the world and give you some sound bites about each of our brokerage units, starting with our PC operations. In U.S. retail, organic growth was strong at about 4.5%. New business and client retention was similar to last year's fourth quarter. And midterm policy modifications, including full policy cancellations, were slightly better than prior year levels.
In our U.S. wholesale operations, Risk Placement Services, organic was about 5%. Open brokerage organic was more than 20% due to strong renewals, fueled by double-digit rate increases. Our MGA programs binding businesses were up about 2%. Retention was better sequentially, but as expected, new business wins are still lagging given the economy.
Moving to the U.K. Around 4.5% organic for the quarter. In both our retail and specialty operations, new and lost business was consistent with prior year. And special mention to our aviation team. They performed well in their largest quarter of the year, helping clients navigate exposures that were down significantly, call it, 30% to 40%, and rate increases that pushed premiums close to pre-COVID levels.
Australia and New Zealand combined posted organic of about 1%. The spread between new and lost business was similar to last year, but we are not getting as much lift from rate and exposure as we had in previous years.
And finally, our Canadian retail operations posted organic of 13%, another terrific new business quarter combined with a nice tick-up in client retention and strong rate environment. So overall, our global PC operations posted 4.5% organic, which is a bit better than the 4% we discussed at our December Investor Day.
Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Fourth quarter organic was around minus 2%, which is at the favorable end of what we thought during our December IR Day. Similar to the previous couple of quarters, fees from consulting arrangements and special project work were down. However, revenue from our traditional health and welfare business continues to hold up with slightly positive fourth quarter organic, which is an encouraging sign. So when I bring PC and benefits together, total Brokerage segment organic of 3.1%, a really strong quarter in this environment and even better when you consider the tough compare against the fourth quarter 2019 of over 6%.
Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market, starting with the rate environment. Global PC rates continue to march higher during the fourth quarter and overall. Rate was up around 8% across our footprint. Rates in Canada led the way, up more than 12%. The U.S. was up more than 8% with wholesale stronger than retail, including rate increases of 15% within our wholesale open brokerage operations, followed by the U.K., including London Specialty, at about 5% and Australia and New Zealand combined in the low single digits.
By line of business, property and professional liability are up 12%. Other casualty lines are up mid- to high single digits. And workers' comp was flat to modestly positive. Not only are PC rates continuing to rise, terms and conditions are tightening, and capacity is becoming increasingly constrained for some coverages. Nearly every area and line of business is firm or firming, and there are even a few lines that are very hard like umbrella, cyber and public company D&O.
So needless to say, it is a difficult PC environment. This is where our teams excel: helping businesses, many of which are still struggling, navigate the market through creative program design, shopping coverages and altering programs with increasing deductibles or reduced limits to help their risk management programs fit their budgets.
Looking forward, I see a similar PC market conditions continuing in 2021. And while economic growth is coming, the pace of the recovery remains uncertain. So we remain laser-focused on what we can control, delivering the very best insurance and risk management advice, now successfully doing this virtually more than ever before, constantly improving our high-quality customer service, engaging with new prospects and growing our new business pipeline.
Thus far in January, full policy cancellations and other midterm policy adjustments are trending similar to January 2020. While it's still early, we are seeing year-over-year renewal premium increases at levels comparable to fourth quarter 2020. On the benefit side, the annual enrollment season is behind us. And for many of our clients, we saw covered lives stabilized from last year's declines, while retention and new business were similar to pre-COVID levels. In addition, a few of our benefits consulting practices are seeing increased activity and engagements early on in the year. So while there's a lot of the year left, these early January indications give me further conviction that full year 2021 Brokerage segment organic will be even better than the 3.2% we delivered in 2020.
Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. Following an active December, we finished the fourth quarter with 10 completed brokerage mergers representing about $100 million of estimated annualized revenues. And we've announced a handful more so far in January, representing an additional $85 million of estimated annualized revenues. This includes the Bollington merger in the U.K., which we think will close in early February after receiving regulatory approval this week. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.
As I look at our M&A pipeline, we have 30 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $300 million of annualized revenues. We believe we are the platform of choice for successful entrepreneurs looking to take their business to the next level by leveraging our niche expertise, our tools and data, in addition to being a great place for their employees to advance their careers. We expect to have a very active 2021, particularly in the U.S. due to concerns related to possible tax changes.
So to wrap up the Brokerage segment. For the full year, we delivered 5.4% growth in revenue, 3.2% all in organic growth; adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 418 basis points, fueled by cost savings of about $180 million. And we completed 27 mergers, representing about $250 million of estimated annualized revenue. A fantastic year for the brokerage team.
Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic edged back into positive territory, nicely surpassing our December expectations of being down as much as 2%. We had some positive lift due to increasing COVID-related workers' compensation claims and saw strong retention and new business. So we ended 2020 with full year organic of minus 2.7%. In this environment, to close a year in which core claim counts were down double digits for more than 10 months of the year and after posting a 10% organic decline in the second quarter alone is a just terrific recovery story.
Going back to April and the beginning of the pandemic, we set our sights on delivering full year 2020 adjusted EBITDAC similar to 2019, even with full year revenues forecasted to be down $30 million or more. And boy, did the team deliver. The team proactively managed its workforce, carefully rebalanced claim loads across adjusters and implemented expense controls, ultimately driving 2020 adjusted EBITDAC of nearly $150 million, $4 million better than 2019. Being able to grow full year EBITDAC despite organic revenues that were backwards is just fantastic work by the Risk Management team.
As we look forward, January claim counts are trending very similar to the fourth quarter with many clients operating still at partial capacity. With new business sold in 2020 incepting over the next few quarters and still room for substantial job recovery, we believe full year 2021 organic will be closer to pre-COVID levels, in the mid-single-digit range.
Let me wrap up with some comments regarding our unique and resilient Gallagher culture. Culture guides our organization, our people in both good times and even more so in demanding times. And I believe culture is the source of our perseverance, our determination and our constant push for excellence. I'm extremely proud of our collective successes during 2020, but more importantly, how we came together to work as a team even while physically apart. Our culture has never been better, and I believe we are ending 2021 even stronger.
Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"
252186,700977175,2184977,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J.

I'll echo Pat's comments. A great quarter and an excellent year. I, too, would like to extend my appreciation to the team.
Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cost savings, provide some -- a few observations from our CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. Then I'll do a vignette on our clean energy investments and finish with some thoughts on M&A, cash and liquidity.
All right. Let's turn to the earnings release, Page 6, to the Brokerage EBITDAC table. You'll see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by about $85 million over last year's fourth quarter, resulting in about 580 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $60 million of cost savings relative to fourth quarter '19 adjusted for [ mergers ]. So underlying margin expansion was about 115 basis points on 3.1% all-in organic, which on its own is impressive.
When you move to Page 8, the Risk Management segment. We grew EBITDAC a bit more than $4 million on slightly positive organic, resulting in about 190 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $5 million of cost savings relative to Q4 '19, which was moderated just a little by new client ramp-up costs. So underlying margins were up just a bit. That, too, is excellent given the flattish organic this quarter.
Categories of fourth quarter savings for the combined Brokerage and Risk Management segment were consistent with second and third quarter: reduced travel, entertainment and advertising, about $25 million; reduced consulting and professional fees, $14 million; reduced outside labor and other workforce savings, $16 million; office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs, about $10 million. So that totals around $65 million, which is consistent with what we said at our December IR Day.
Now looking forward, the pace of recovery isn't clear. We came into the year with another virus surge, now maybe some positive cases coming down. Some areas are imposing more lockdowns, yet others are loosening up. There's been some successes but mostly delays in the vaccine rollout. And now it's looking like more and more that the stimulus might be caught in gridlock here in the U.S.
Regardless of whether you're looking at half full or half empty glass, very few outlooks are expecting the business environment to be much different by the end of the first quarter. So for us, when it comes to first quarter '21, we're seeing organic in the 3% to 4% range, and we're seeing expense savings similar to fourth quarter '20, call it another $600 million -- excuse me, $60 million. If that happens, we could again show margin expansion of about 500 basis points. 
Then looking towards second, third and fourth quarters of '21, it gets a little more tricky when you do your models because the slope of the recovery is still uncertain. And we're already realizing substantial COVID-induced expense savings beginning early in April of '20. But if the recovery steps up in those quarters and we get back to organic of, say, high 4% or 5%, it does give us a path towards holding full year margins, especially if travel and entertainment remains limited.
Now all of this needs to be taken into context. In 2017, '18 and '19, we were expanding margins 50 to 75 basis points a year on organic in that 4% to 5% range. Then the COVID hit. We executed on our cost containment playbook and still managed to grow organic 3%. That pops margins over 400 basis points in the face of this global pandemic. So now what I'm saying is that we have a fighting chance to hold or even improve full year margins here in '21 on the prospect of getting closer to pre-pandemic organic growth later in the year. To me, that's still about a bullish story as you can write.
Now if we move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. On Page 2, the blue fourth quarter column. You'll see most of the items are consistent with what we provided during our December IR Day, and that's in the gray column. FX came in $0.01 better and severance and integration costs also $0.01 better when you compare that to the prior quarters.
Also on Page 2 in the reddish column, we're now providing our quarterly look at 2021. A few comments. First, foreign exchange. With the U.S. dollar weakening and if it stays that way throughout the year, 2021 revenue could see a $100 million tailwind in Brokerage and $14 million in Risk Management. Wouldn't be much EPS impact within Risk Management but could translate into $0.05 or so for our Brokerage segment. And that would even be better on reported EBITDAC.
Second, amortization expense. We're currently forecasting a little over $100 million a quarter in Brokerage, which includes the all-announced mergers to date. You can see the roll in revenues associated with all-announced mergers to date on Page 5. And then also, don't forget to adjust your amortization expense in the second and later quarters to reflect any future M&A you might be including in your model.
Third, when you look at M&A multiples shown on Page 2 on the last line in the table, like Pat said, we had an active December, closing 10, 3 of which were on the larger end of our typical tuck-in size. That pushed the multiple up a turn or so this year but still creating a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple. More importantly, it brings some really terrific merger partners to the team, letting us grow better together over the long haul.
When you move to Page 3 of the CFO commentary in the Corporate table. When you compare our December IR Day estimates in the gray column with our fourth quarter results in the blue column, we posted favorable interest expense due to strong cash flows. We had better clean energy earnings, in line M&A expense and a slightly more favorable corporate line. 
Also on Page 3, we're now providing a first look at '21 ranges for the Corporate segment, and that's in the reddish column. Nothing surprising, and there's no change on our outlook for clean energy, still in that $60 million to $75 million of annual after-tax earnings we provided during our IR Day.
So this brings me to my vignette on clean energy. You'll read on Page 4, Note 5 of the CFO commentary document that these investments are winding down at the end of '21, unless there's an extension. That means in 2022, we will have 0 GAAP earnings. But remember, that will be more than replaced with substantial cash flow benefits. In other words, '21 and prior years were the credit generation years when we report the GAAP benefit in our P&L, but '22 starts the cash harvest years where we'll get considerably larger cash benefits in our operating cash flows.
Here's the shortcut way to think about how to compute those cash benefits. First, if you go to Page 14 of the earnings release, about the seventh line down in our balance sheet, you'll read that we have a deferred tax asset of over $1 billion, mostly consisting of clean energy credit carryforwards. With 1 more year of credit generation, that asset should grow by another $100 million. So call it $1.1 billion of credit carryovers by the end of '21. Then assume in '22 we will begin using more credits than we've been using thus far. 
How -- third, then how fast we'll be using those credits will depend on how fast we grow our U.S. taxable income. But for this illustration, and if you assume a 7-year period, it might mean we would be harvesting about $125 million to $150 million in '22, with that ramping up to, say, about $175 million to $200 million in 2028. It's a little odd that GAAP earnings go to 0, and then the cash benefits become dramatically better, but that's just how it works. This is and has been a really important part of our story over the last decade, so I think it was worth some extra time today.
All right. Let me go on to some comments on cash and M&A. At December 31, available cash on hand was nearly $700 million. We have a significant untapped capacity on our revolving credit facility, and we have another year ahead of us of really strong cash flows. That might mean that we would have perhaps up to $2.5 billion of M&A capacity here in '21. That's a terrific position as we come into a year that we see as perhaps the most active year ever in the brokerage M&A space.
Okay. That wraps up '20 and we're positioned really well for '21. Organic looks better. Bolt-on M&A looks better. We have a decent chance of keeping a largest chunk of our cost savings, [ assuming we're going to have a ] year of harvesting cash flows from our clean energy initiatives. And most important, I can feel our team's excitement about coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever before. My thanks to them for another fantastic year.
Back to you, Pat."

As it emerges for the quarters this year, it really is kind of a sensitive interplay between organic and then just really what happens with the economy. 
We'll follow our customers' expectations. We are learning that they are much more receptive now to virtual interactions, allowing us to get our niche expertise at the point of sale easier than jumping on an airplane and spending days traveling. So we are learning a lot and -- but we will follow our customers' expectations. How that exactly plays out in the second and third and fourth quarters really depends on how fast the organic moves from that 3% to 4% range up into maybe the 5% or 6% range."

In thinking about the sales pipeline, I'm trying to contemplate, I guess, in my mind, clients would have hunkered down early on in COVID and been less likely to change brokers or to really contemplate a move like that. Does it feel like people are just getting more comfortable with the world we live in today and that's opening up? Or when we think about the path from 3% to 4% organic growth, the 5% to 6% organic growth, are we just waiting for the economy to improve and the shots to get in the arms so everyone can get back out there and living?"

You start with March of last year, and the answer to that is yes. Having said that, they have a lot of needs and a lot of requests. So we were running webinars around COVID, return to work, all kinds of different -- cyber, what have you. Blew my mind. Thousands of people signed up. And it was not unusual for us to run a webinar with 5,000 attendees. I mean I never heard of such a thing. 
So there's a huge thirst for information, which helped our people, of course, know exactly some of the hot buttons that they should be talking to potential clients. And to get out -- and I was amazed. I really would have told you that I thought maybe new business would have hunkered down. I didn't think our lost business would increase because of that. 
In fact, it's amazing to me the kind of new business that we did generate. So I think that it gives us a lot of confidence to sell the kind of business we sold last year. And you'd get some fall-over from '19 into the first quarter, maybe a little in the second quarter. But everything from May on was really generated after the first of the year. So really an incredible new business year. 
Secondly, are we seeing the advent potentially of people beginning to come back into the businesses? I think, yes. I think we're seeing that there is going to -- and whether stimulus happens or not, I think businesses have learned how to do this. Take just a look at your local restaurants. About a year ago, they weren't -- or March, they might -- they're not going to survive. Takeout is not making them robust but they're surviving and they're ready. I mean in the Chicago land area now, we can go to restaurants again. They have very limited occupancy. But they are ready. They're welcoming. They want people back and people are excited about it. So I think the pent-up demand for people to be able to go do things is also going to be helpful. 
Then lastly, let's not forget something. I told you guys this 1,000 times. I don't like hard markets. And I get it, they all look good on paper, what have you. But they tick every customer off, and they're suffering through this right now because they don't only have a choice, but they are going to shop. And we are there for them to understand that both our data capabilities as well as our professional niche capabilities and our ability to work them through the process of taking more risk, becoming more -- becoming more self-insured, that's our bread and butter. We're better at that than anybody. So I think that, that is -- it's all of those combined that leads me to believe that we see a very robust new business year ahead in '21 and '22."

So when you look at the -- where we're really getting leverage, I think that we're getting leverage because of our scale, especially relative to that, to that level of competitor, the smaller ones that we compete with day in and day out. 
I think we have opportunities to continue to use our lower-cost labor locations and our centers of excellence. I think our ability in order to rationalize our real estate footprint, I think that we can buy goods and services cheaper, I think our ability to automate many of the interactions with the clients and with our own employees, all of those things, I would say that Gallagher is positioned. We have a common agency management system in most of our countries, in most of our businesses. Those are things that we believe that will continue to bring scale advantages versus our smaller competitors. 
How do I feel about it comparing to, let's say, the other top 10 brokers? First of all, you got to pick the ones that have the culture that want to work together and make it happen. And then you've got to pick the ones that haven't already gone down this journey to see whether or not they're there yet or not.

And the smaller brokers have the problem of just simply not having the capabilities that clients are starting to ask for. And these can be simple questions, like how do I know? How do I know you just gave me the best deal? When I was out selling 30 years ago on a daily basis, that would be answered by saying, ""I went to 3 carriers, that's the best price."" That does not float today. They want to know what you're doing with clients, what carriers are doing it, where the ranges are, what their loss ratio looks like compared to others. They want detail. They want data. 
Smaller people can't do that. So what you've got is folks that are losing accounts to the likes of ourselves, and we're out telling them, ""Why wouldn't you come to a place that's happy to pay you for what you hunt and kill, and at the same time, you have all the support and the capabilities in the world.""

So I would think there are different ways to get to 4% to 5% organic growth, and each of those potentially has a very different impact on margins, namely, if you're getting more of that organic growth through rate versus exposure unit growth.

And then on the flip side, I think in the past, you used to talk about needing to get at least 3% organic in order to keep margins stable. How should we think about, let's say, 3% organic growth for -- if you achieve that in '21? What does that mean for margins?"

The workload -- the difference in workload on a customer that is adding exposure units, i.e., adding vehicles or changing miles, isn't significant, whether they're adding a couple of values. So the workload associated with a rate increase that comes from exposure units, not that much more. If it comes from additional rate, that means we want to go out and shop it more, we'll take a little bit more effort. But because of our efficiencies, we can do that at a pretty low-cost month. 
So just the number of policies or the exposure units or a modest rate increase or decrease doesn't change our workload that much. So I wouldn't say that, that would have a significant impact on margin if you're kind of in that 2% to 4% range on rates and exposures. 
When you're asking the next part of the question about where do we see the kind of the old, tried and true line, if you grow organically, 3% is our margin lift in it, yes, I think there is.

This is where it is. I don't have -- I've got to be considering my own survival tactics. And I surmise there'd be less shopping of our existing business. 
I was right a little bit. It certainly didn't stop shopping. It wasn't like everything came to a grounding halt. But if you're a good broker, and we've got really good competition in this market, in a hard market you early on explain to your client that if you are unhappy with a hard market and you want to be really unhappier, shop the hell out of it because you're going to get slaughtered. And in fact, in a hard market, shopping does decrease. Pardon me.
Unfortunately, as things ease up a bit, people are unhappy and intends to increase shopping. So right now, we're in a very firm and firming market, and people understand that they need our expertise. And it also does scare some of those little competitors that we compete with 90% of the time out of being so bold as to say they can do better than we do. Pretty tough to prove it."

First, I still believe that EBITDAC is a good proxy for how to value a broker. Then you just have to back off the cash taxes paid and interest expense, of course, and the cash taxes paid and interest yield on that. But if you basically start with EBITDAC, you're going to get pretty close to the way, and that's been a traditional way. 
So what does that mean for Gallagher is that we've said this for years, we still pay taxes. People sometimes think that we're not paying our fair share. That's not the case at all. We still pay taxes. It runs about -- I've said this, if you go back to when tax changed, that we are -- we think that we're going to pay in that 5% to 6% to 7% of EBITDA range just as a proxy. We're probably at that same range even if tax rates go up to 28% from 21%. It would be a book rate differential. It wouldn't really be a cash difference. If the Biden tax measures were put in place, it might cost us $10 million a year in taxes more, Paul. But it wouldn't be a huge number. 
The value of tax credits become more valuable if tax rates go up. So really, for Gallagher, it's to take our EBITDA, back off our CapEx, back off our interest expense and put in 7% or 8% for cash taxes paid, and you get pretty close to the cash flow amount for Gallagher. I might have missed something in there, but I think I got most of the pieces in that. But I would start with EBITDA still."

What a fantastic quarter. We executed against ou",1332,"Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
What a fantastic quarter. We executed against our 4 long-term operating priorities to drive shareholder value: first, we grew organically; second, we grew through acquisitions; third, we improved our productivity while raising our quality; and fourth, we continued to reap the benefits of our unique Gallagher culture. I'm extremely proud of how our team continues to execute and deliver world-class expertise and service day in and day out. We're off to a great start in 2021. 
So let me give you some more detail on the quarter, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth of 12.2%. Of that, 6% was organic revenue growth, better than our recent IR Day expectations, thanks to an excellent March. Our cost containment efforts saved about $60 million in the quarter, helping drive our net earnings margin higher by 94 basis points and expand our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 480 basis points. And net earnings were up 17% and adjusted EBITDAC was up 24%, an excellent quarter from the Brokerage team. 
Let me walk you around the world and give you some soundbites about each of our Brokerage units, starting with our P/C operations. In the U.S., retail organic growth was strong at about 5%. New business was excellent and retention remains strong. In our U.S. wholesale operations, Risk Placement Services organic was about 6%. Open brokerage organic was 15% due to rate increases, higher levels of new business and improved retention. Our MGA program's binding businesses were up about 4%. Retention in new business were similar to the first quarter of 2020. However, we did see a little bit more tailwind from rate and exposure during the quarter. 
Moving to the U.K., over 7% organic for the quarter. In both our retail and specialty operations, new business was up over prior year while retention held pretty steady. Australia and New Zealand combined posted organic of 3%. New business and retention were both similar to prior year. And finally, our Canadian retail operations, excellent organic of 13%. Fantastic new business and rate all added to our stellar performance again this quarter. So overall, our global P/C operations posted more than 7% organic, which is better than the 5% to 6% we discussed at our Investor Day, thanks to a really strong March. 
Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. First quarter organic was up slightly, which is better than our March IR Day expectations. Revenue from our traditional health and welfare business held up well, while fees from consulting arrangements, special project work and our life business were up slightly. So when I bring P/C and Benefits together, total Brokerage segment organic was 6%, a really strong start to the year. 
Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the P/C market, starting with the rate environment. Global P/C rates remain firm overall and the increases we saw during the first quarter of 2021 are consistent with the past couple of quarters. Rates in Canada led the way, up double digits, driven by property and professional liability. In the U.S., rates were up about 7%, including double-digit rate increases within our wholesale open brokerage operations. Our U.K. retail and London specialty operations combined, rates are up about 5%. And finally, Australia and New Zealand combined, rate increases are in the low single digits. 
At the same time, capacity is constrained in certain lines and carriers are pushing for tighter terms and conditions. There are also quite a few pockets in the U.S., Canada and London specialty market that I would describe as hard such as cat-exposed properties, cyber, umbrella and public company D&O, just to name a few. So the global P/C environment remains difficult but is giving us some tailwinds. 
Looking forward, we don't see conditions that would indicate this rate environment will change anytime soon, and we are seeing more and more economic activity across our client base. For example, customers are adding coverages and exposures to their existing policies. And through yesterday, April endorsements, premium audits and other midterm policy adjustments are a net positive overall. That, too, is an encouraging sign. 
On the benefits side, a recovering labor market in 2021 should favorably impact our core health and welfare business. And we remain optimistic that we will start to see some incremental HR consulting and special project work. This is a terrific time for our team to shine, firm global rates, increasing exposure units and recovering employment. Our clients need our expertise and we are there with the very best insurance, consulting and risk management advice. So while there's a lot of year left, I have greater conviction that our full year 2021 Brokerage segment organic will be equal to or perhaps even better than pre-pandemic 2019 organic. 
Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We finished the first quarter with 5 completed brokerage mergers, representing about $90 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
As I look at our tuck-in M&A pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing about $250 million of annualized revenues. Our global platform is a great fit for savvy and successful entrepreneurs. We have the tools, data, products, niche expertise and carrier relationships to help these owners support their current clients and take their business to the next level. 
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was 0.6%, which is in line with our March IR Day expectations of about flat. It was still a tough compare to pre-pandemic first quarter 2020. However, there is no doubt we are starting to see more and more core workers' comp claim activity when compared to what we were seeing last year at this time. Traditional workers' comp claims are returning and we are seeing fewer and fewer COVID-related claims. Our cost containment efforts paid off again this quarter. We saved around $4 million and expanded our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 180 basis points to 18.4%, another great quarter of execution by the Gallagher Bassett team. 
Looking forward to the next 3 quarters, we would expect new claims arising to be higher than what we saw last year, perhaps not back to pre-pandemic levels quite yet but certainly higher than last year. So when I combine that with some really nice new business wins, we should be back to seeing organic in the upper single digits for the next few quarters. That would also bode well for keeping margins above 18% for the remainder of the year. 
Let me wrap up with some comments regarding our unique Gallagher culture. It's a culture that emphasizes doing things the right way for the right reasons with the right people. It's a culture of service, service to our clients, to one another and to the communities where we work and where we live. And our culture continues to be recognized externally. Just last week, Forbes named Gallagher one of the best U.S. employers for diversity. And that's on top of Gallagher being recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies for the tenth year in a row, 10 straight years, and once again, the sole insurance broker recognized. 
These recognitions are a direct reflection of our more than 30,000 global colleagues working together as a team guided by the 25 tenets of the Gallagher Way. Culture is a key differentiator for our franchise. Every day, all of our people get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture, to live our culture, and I believe our culture has never been stronger. Doug, over to you."

Gallagher & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll echo Pat's comments, an excellent quarter and a terrific start to the year. Today, I'll spend most of my time on both our cost savings initiatives and our clean energy cash flows, then highlight a few items",1151,"Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll echo Pat's comments, an excellent quarter and a terrific start to the year. Today, I'll spend most of my time on both our cost savings initiatives and our clean energy cash flows, then highlight a few items in our CFO commentary document, and I'll close with some comments on M&A, cash and liquidity. 
Before I plunge in on cost, 1 quick comment on Page 3 in the Brokerage segment organic table. You'll see that we had a great quarter for contingent commissions. There is a little bit of favorable timing in there, call it about 50 basis points on total organic. That will flip the other way next quarter but regardless, a really solid quarter. 
Okay, let's go to Page 5, the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. You'll see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by $122 million over last year's first quarter, resulting in about 480 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. That would have been closer to 550 basis points, but as we discussed in our March IR Day, M&A isn't as seasonally large, and we did strengthen bonus a bit, given our outlook for 2021 as considerably more optimistic today than it was last year at this time, standing at the gates of a global pandemic. 
Within that $122 million of EBITDAC growth is about $60 million that is directly related to our cost savings initiatives, call that about 370 basis points of margin expansion. So when controlling for these 3 items, we see underlying margin expansion of about 180 basis points on that 6% all inorganic, once again, absolutely terrific execution by the team. 
Moving on to the Risk Management segment on Page 6. We grew adjusted EBITDAC by $4.3 million, resulting in about 180 basis points of adjusted margin expansion, leading us to post margins nicely over 18%. Most of that was due to our cost savings initiatives. So when I combine our Brokerage and Risk Management segments, savings were around $64 million, pretty similar to the last 3 quarters. And that consists of: reduced travel, entertainment and advertising, about $25 million; reduced consulting and professional fees, about $15 million; reduced outside labor and other workforce costs, about $15 million; and then reduced office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs of about another $9 million. 
But remember, first quarter 2021 is the last quarter we have a favorable comparison to pre-pandemic spend levels. So now it's all about how much of the cost savings we can hold going forward. As I look at it today, I still believe we will hold a lot of it. As we have said before, we do see certain costs coming back but that won't happen overnight. Our best guess is maybe $15 million coming back in the second quarter '21, then step that up by about $5 million to $7 million in the third quarter and a similar step-up again in the fourth quarter. Those amounts that I've given are relative to 2020 same quarters adjusted for the roll-in impact of M&A. 
As for how that translates into margins, that's really dependent on where we land on organic. But say you assume organic is around 5% or above for the remainder of the year, the math would say that would be enough to show some full year margin expansion. And regardless of where we land, let's keep this in perspective for the longer term. The pandemic has allowed and perhaps even forced us to accelerate a lot of the improvements we had on the drawing board and also served as an opportunity to design new and better ways to run our business. Both of these make us more productive today than we were 15 months ago and our service quality has even improved. This will provide a lasting benefit for years to come. 
So let's move now to the CFO commentary document we posted on our investor website. On Page 3, most items are very similar to what we provided at our March IR Day. On Page 4, both clean energy and the corporate line came in better than we had provided in March. The corporate line is just timing between first and third quarters for certain tax items. But the clean energy investments had a much better quarter and we bumped up our full year estimate. It's now looking like $70 million to $80 million of full year after-tax earnings, which is really good news. 
Next, flip to Page 5 of the CFO commentary. If you missed the clean energy vignette that I gave during our March IR Day, it might be worth a listen to the replay on our website, starts with the hour and 9-minute mark. Here are the punchlines: first, recall, 2021 is the last year of what we call the credit generation era; second, 2022 will be the first meaningful year in the cash harvesting era. This means 2021 is the last year we will report GAAP earnings, and 2022 will be the first year meaningful cash flows show up in our cash flow statement. 
You'll see here on Page 5 that we think 2022 annual cash flows could increase by around $125 million to $150 million. And finally, this is not a 1-year benefit to cash flow. We have more than $1 billion of tax credit carryforwards on our balance sheet that should favorably impact cash flows for the next 6 to 7 years. 
As for M&A capacity, at March 31, available cash on hand was more than $400 million, and we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. So with cash on hand, our untapped borrowing capacity and another year of strong cash flows, it means upwards of $2.5 billion of M&A capacity here in '21. With a nice M&A pipeline, we are in good shape to continue with our tuck-in strategy. 
Before I pass it back to Pat, and that was a mouthful, as I sit here today, I see a lot of positives. Organic has nice tailwinds from rate and exposure growth. Add to that a lot of pent-up consumer demand and perhaps a wave of governmental spending. Both could be additional growth catalysts. We have a robust M&A pipeline that should continue to grow, especially if an increase in capital gains tax gets momentum. 
And we've learned a lot from the pandemic on how to operate better, faster and cheaper, all the while improving service quality. And our productivity gains we achieved over the last year appear to be sticky. This all bodes well for another year of strong cash flow generation, with a kicker starting in 2022 from our clean energy investment. So we are very well positioned operationally and financially. I can feel the excitement out in the field about coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever before. It's setting up to be another great year. Back to you, Pat."

What a fantastic quarter. We executed against ou",1332,"Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
What a fantastic quarter. We executed against our 4 long-term operating priorities to drive shareholder value: first, we grew organically; second, we grew through acquisitions; third, we improved our productivity while raising our quality; and fourth, we continue to reap the benefits of our unique Gallagher culture. I'm extremely proud of how our team continues to execute and deliver world-class expertise and service day in and day out. We're off to a great start in 2021. 
So let me give you some more detail on the quarter, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth of 12.2%. Of that, 6% was organic revenue growth, better than our recent IR Day expectations, thanks to an excellent March. Our cost containment efforts saved about $60 million in the quarter, helping drive our net earnings margin higher by 94 basis points and expand our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 480 basis points. And net earnings were up 17% and adjusted EBITDAC was up 24%, an excellent quarter from the Brokerage team. 
Let me walk you around the world and give you some soundbites about each of our Brokerage units, starting with our P/C operations. In the U.S., retail organic growth was strong at about 5%. New business was excellent and retention remains strong. In our U.S. wholesale operations, Risk Placement Services organic was about 6%. Open brokerage organic was 15% due to rate increases, higher levels of new business and improved retention. Our MGA program's binding businesses were up about 4%. Retention in new business were similar to the first quarter of 2020. However, we did see a little bit more tailwind from rate and exposure during the quarter. 
Moving to the U.K., over 7% organic for the quarter. In both our retail and specialty operations, new business was up over prior year while retention held pretty steady. Australia and New Zealand combined posted organic of 3%. New business and retention were both similar to prior year. And finally, our Canadian retail operations, excellent organic of 13%, fantastic new business and rate all added to our stellar performance again this quarter. So overall, our global P/C operations posted more than 7% organic, which is better than the 5% to 6% we discussed at our Investor Day, thanks to a really strong March. 
Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. First quarter organic was up slightly, which is better than our March IR Day expectations. Revenue from our traditional health and welfare business held up well, while fees from consulting arrangements, special project work and our life business were up slightly. So when I bring P/C and Benefits together, total Brokerage segment organic was 6%, a really strong start to the year. 
Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the P/C market, starting with the rate environment. Global P/C rates remain firm overall and the increases we saw during the first quarter of 2021 are consistent with the past couple of quarters. Rates in Canada led the way, up double digits, driven by property and professional liability. In the U.S., rates were up about 7%, including double-digit rate increases within our wholesale open brokerage operations. Our U.K. retail and London specialty operations combined, rates are up about 5%. And finally, Australia and New Zealand combined, rate increases are in the low single digits. 
At the same time, capacity is constrained in certain lines and carriers are pushing for tighter terms and conditions. There are also quite a few pockets in the U.S., Canada and London specialty market that I would describe as hard such as cat-exposed properties, cyber, umbrella and public company D&O, just to name a few. So the global P/C environment remains difficult but is giving us some tailwinds. 
Looking forward, we don't see conditions that would indicate this rate environment will change anytime soon, and we are seeing more and more economic activity across our client base. For example, customers are adding coverages and exposures to their existing policies. And through yesterday, April endorsements, premium audits and other midterm policy adjustments are a net positive overall. That, too, is an encouraging sign. 
On the benefits side, a recovering labor market in 2021 should favorably impact our core health and welfare business. And we remain optimistic that we will start to see some incremental HR consulting and special project work. This is a terrific time for our team to shine, firm global rates, increasing exposure units and recovering employment. Our clients need our expertise and we are there with the very best insurance, consulting and risk management advice. So while there's a lot of year left, I have greater conviction that our full year 2021 Brokerage segment organic will be equal to or perhaps even better than pre-pandemic 2019 organic. 
Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We finished the first quarter with 5 completed brokerage mergers, representing about $90 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
As I look at our tuck-in M&A pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing about $250 million of annualized revenues. Our global platform is a great fit for savvy and successful entrepreneurs. We have the tools, data, products, niche expertise and carrier relationships to help these owners support their current clients and take their business to the next level. 
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was 0.6%, which is in line with our March IR Day expectations of about flat. It was still a tough compare to pre-pandemic first quarter 2020. However, there is no doubt we are starting to see more and more core workers' comp claim activity when compared to what we were seeing last year at this time. Traditional workers' comp claims are returning and we are seeing fewer and fewer COVID-related claims. Our cost containment efforts paid off again this quarter. We saved around $4 million and expanded our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 180 basis points to 18.4%, another great quarter of execution by the Gallagher Bassett team. 
Looking forward to the next 3 quarters, we would expect new claims arising to be higher than what we saw last year, perhaps not back to pre-pandemic levels quite yet but certainly higher than last year. So when I combine that with some really nice new business wins, we should be back to seeing organic in the upper single digits for the next few quarters. That would also bode well for keeping margins above 18% for the remainder of the year. 
Let me wrap up with some comments regarding our unique Gallagher culture. It's a culture that emphasizes doing things the right way for the right reasons with the right people. It's a culture of service, service to our clients, to one another and to the communities where we work and where we live. And our culture continues to be recognized externally. Just last week, Forbes named Gallagher one of the best U.S. employers for diversity. And that's on top of Gallagher being recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies for the 10th year in a row, 10 straight years, and once again, the sole insurance broker recognized. 
These recognitions are a direct reflection of our more than 30,000 global colleagues working together as a team guided by the 25 tenets of the Gallagher Way. Culture is a key differentiator for our franchise. Every day, all of our people get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture, to live our culture, and I believe our culture has never been stronger. Doug, over to you."

Gallagher & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll echo Pat's comments, an excellent quarter and a terrific start to the year. Today, I'll spend most of my time on both our cost savings initiatives and our clean energy cash flows, then highlight a few items",1152,"Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll echo Pat's comments, an excellent quarter and a terrific start to the year. Today, I'll spend most of my time on both our cost savings initiatives and our clean energy cash flows, then highlight a few items in our CFO commentary document, and I'll close with some comments on M&A, cash and liquidity. 
Before I plunge in on cost, 1 quick comment on Page 3 in the Brokerage segment organic table. You'll see that we had a great quarter for contingent commissions. There is a little bit of favorable timing in there, call it about 50 basis points on total organic. That will flip the other way next quarter but regardless, a really solid quarter. 
Okay, let's go to Page 5, the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. You'll see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by $122 million over last year's first quarter, resulting in about 480 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. That would have been closer to 550 basis points, but as we discussed in our March IR Day, M&A roll-in isn't as seasonally large, and we did strengthen bonus a bit, given our outlook for 2021 as considerably more optimistic today than it was last year at this time, standing at the gates of a global pandemic. 
Within that $122 million of EBITDAC growth is about $60 million that is directly related to our cost savings initiatives, call that about 370 basis points of margin expansion. So when controlling for these 3 items, we see underlying margin expansion of about 180 basis points on that 6% all-in organic, once again, absolutely terrific execution by the team. 
Moving on to the Risk Management segment on Page 6. We grew adjusted EBITDAC by $4.3 million, resulting in about 180 basis points of adjusted margin expansion, leading us to post margins nicely over 18%. Most of that was due to our cost savings initiatives. So when I combine our Brokerage and Risk Management segments, savings were around $64 million, pretty similar to the last 3 quarters. And that consists of: reduced travel, entertainment and advertising, about $25 million; reduced consulting and professional fees, about $15 million; reduced outside labor and other workforce costs, about $15 million; and then reduced office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs of about another $9 million. 
But remember, first quarter 2021 is the last quarter we have a favorable comparison to pre-pandemic spend levels. So now it's all about how much of the cost savings we can hold going forward. As I look at it today, I still believe we will hold a lot of it. As we have said before, we do see certain costs coming back but that won't happen overnight. Our best guess is maybe $15 million coming back in the second quarter '21, then step that up by about $5 million to $7 million in the third quarter and a similar step-up again in the fourth quarter. Those amounts that I've given are relative to 2020 same quarters adjusted for the roll-in impact of M&A. 
As for how that translates into margins, that's really dependent on where we land on organic. But say you assume organic is around 5% or above for the remainder of the year, the math would say that would be enough to show some full year margin expansion. And regardless of where we land, let's keep this in perspective for the longer term. The pandemic has allowed and perhaps even forced us to accelerate a lot of the improvements we had on the drawing board and also served as an opportunity to design new and better ways to run our business. Both of these make us more productive today than we were 15 months ago and our service quality has even improved. This will provide a lasting benefit for years to come. 
So let's move now to the CFO commentary document we posted on our investor website. On Page 3, most items are very similar to what we provided at our March IR Day. On Page 4, both clean energy and the corporate line came in better than we had provided in March. The corporate line is just timing between first and third quarters for certain tax items. But the clean energy investments had a much better quarter and we bumped up our full year estimate. It's now looking like $70 million to $80 million of full year after-tax earnings, which is really good news. 
Next, flip to Page 5 of the CFO commentary. If you missed the clean energy vignette that I gave during our March IR Day, it might be worth to listen to the replay on our website, starts with the hour and 9-minute mark. Here are the punchlines: First, recall, 2021 is the last year of what we call the credit generation era; second, 2022 will be the first meaningful year in the cash harvesting era. This means 2021 is the last year we will report GAAP earnings, and 2022 will be the first year meaningful cash flows show up in our cash flow statement. 
You'll see here on Page 5 that we think 2022 annual cash flows could increase by around $125 million to $150 million. And finally, this is not a 1-year benefit to cash flow. We have more than $1 billion of tax credit carryforwards on our balance sheet that should favorably impact cash flows for the next 6 to 7 years. 
As for M&A capacity, at March 31, available cash on hand was more than $400 million, and we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. So with cash on hand, our untapped borrowing capacity and another year of strong cash flows, it means upwards of $2.5 billion of M&A capacity here in '21. With a nice M&A pipeline, we are in good shape to continue with our tuck-in strategy. 
Before I pass it back to Pat, and that was a mouthful, as I sit here today, I see a lot of positives. Organic has nice tailwinds from rate and exposure growth. Add to that a lot of pent-up consumer demand and perhaps a wave of governmental spending. Both could be additional growth catalysts. We have a robust M&A pipeline that should continue to grow, especially if an increase in capital gains tax gets momentum. 
And we've learned a lot from the pandemic on how to operate better, faster and cheaper, all the while improving service quality. And our productivity gains we achieved over the last year appear to be sticky. This all bodes well for another year of strong cash flow generation, with a kicker starting in 2022 from our clean energy investment. So we are very well positioned operationally and financially. I can feel the excitement out in the field about coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever before. It's setting up to be another great year. Back to you, Pat."

And we think that what works at Gallagher are people that want to come in and sell insurance. And we've worked hard over the number of years to show that we're a broker run by brokers and so we like to sell insurance.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. 
We had an excellent second quarter. The team delivered on all 4 of our long-term operating priorities to drive shareholder value. We grew organically. We grew through acquisitions, improved our productivity all while raising our quality and maintaining our unique Gallagher culture. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 17% growth in revenue, 8.6% organic growth, but it's over 10% when adjusted for timing, which Doug will spend some time on in a few minutes. Net earnings margin expansion of 107 basis points, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 30 basis points, and we completed 8 new mergers in the quarter with more than $70 million of estimated annualized revenue. Most importantly, our Gallagher culture continues to thrive, just a fantastic quarter on all measures. 
Now before I discuss how each of our businesses performed in more detail, let me comment briefly about the termination of our agreement to purchase certain Willis Towers Watson brokerage operations. We were excited about the opportunity. I would have loved to complete the transaction. There are a lot of great people at Willis, and they would have been a great addition to our team. But here's the key point: With or without this, we remain very well positioned to support our clients, compete for new ones and ultimately drive value for all of our stakeholders. We're in the greatest business on earth, our culture is stronger than ever and I'm excited about our future. 
Okay. Back to our quarterly results, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was strong at 16%. Of that, 6.8% was organic revenue growth, a little better than our June IR Day expectation and closer to 9% adjusted for timing. Our net earnings margin moved higher by 53 basis points, and our adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded by 23 basis points, highlighting our continued expense discipline, another excellent quarter from the Brokerage team. 
Let me walk you around the world and break down our organization by geography. Starting with our PC operations. First, our domestic retail operations were very strong with more than 8% organic. New business was excellent, nicely above second quarter 2020 levels. Risk Placement Services, our domestic wholesale operations, grew 12%. This includes nearly 25% organic in open Brokerage and 6% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business and retention were both better than 2020 levels. 
Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted more than 9% organic. Specialty was 10% and retail was excellent at 9%, bolstered by new business production. Canada was up an outstanding 16%, fueled by rate and exposure growth on top of solid new business and retention. And finally, Australia and New Zealand combined grew nearly 4%, benefiting from good new business and stable retention. 
Moving to our employee benefit Brokerage and consulting business. Second quarter organic was up about 4%, which is also ahead of our June IR Day commentary and another sequential step-up over first quarter 2021 and the second half of 2020. As business activity improves, we're seeing more favorable growth in our core health and welfare, fee-for-service and retirement consulting businesses, which is encouraging -- it's an encouraging sign for the second half of the year.So when I combine PC at 9-plus percent and benefits around 4%, total Brokerage segment organic was pushing 9%. But with timing reported 6.8%, either way, another really strong performance. 
Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market. Global PC rates remain firm overall, and at the same time, we are seeing increased economic activity across our client base. Customers are adding coverages and exposures to their existing policies, and monthly positive policy endorsements are trending higher than pre-pandemic levels. And overall, second quarter renewal premium increases were similar with the first quarter. 
Moving around the world, U.S. retail was up about 8%, including double-digit increases in professional liability. Canada was up 9%, driven by increases in professional liability and package. New Zealand was flat and Australia up 6%. Moving to the U.K., Retail was up about 8%, with most classes of specialty business over 10%. And finally, within RPS, wholesale open brokerage was up 12%, while our binding operations were up 4%. So clearly, premiums are still increasing across nearly all geographies. 
Looking forward, it feels that the current renewal environment will persist for some time. Carriers that cut back capacity in some of the less profitable lines of business like property, professional liability, umbrella and cyber have yet to budge on terms or conditions or haven't reverted back to offering more limits or lower attachment points. And elevated natural catastrophes, continued impacts of the pandemic, social inflation and low investment returns are all continuing to pressure rates. That, on top of this, the potential for increased claim frequency as economies recover and carriers are making a strong case, the rate increases are likely to persist for some time. We, too, see the global PC environment remaining difficult for our clients and that is likely to remain for the foreseeable future. 
Moving to our benefits business. Our customer base is returning towards prepandemic levels a little more slowly than headline-grabbing sectors like retail, leisure and hospitality. So we are expecting even better organic in the second half. Further, our HR consulting units are very well positioned to deliver solutions as clients and prospects pivot away from controlling costs to growing their businesses and attracting, motivating and retaining their workforce in 2021 and beyond. So as I sit here today, I think second half Brokerage organic will be better than the first half and could take full year 2020 organic towards 8%. That would be a terrific step up from the 3.2% organic we reported in 2020. 
Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We completed 7 Brokerage and 1 Risk Management merger during the second quarter, representing over $70 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $300 million of annualized revenues. Our platform continues to attract entrepreneurial owners looking to leverage our data, expertise, tools and market relationships to grow their businesses. And we expect that our U.S. pipeline will grow in the second half of the year given the potential changes in capital gains taxes. So 2021 is setting up to be another successful year for our merger strategy. 
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Second quarter organic growth was pushing 20%, better than our June IR day expectations of mid-teens, and our adjusted EBITDAC margin exceeded 19%. We benefited from a revenue lift related to our 2020 new business wins, increased new arising claims within core workers' compensation and an easier pandemic-era comparison. Looking forward, the rebound in employment, economic activity and our solid new business should lead to third and fourth quarter organic nicely in double digits. For the year, we expect organic to be just over 10% and our EBITDAC margin to remain above 19%. 
So what an exciting time to be part of Gallagher. And that's because of our 35,000-plus employees and our unique Gallagher culture. It's our culture that keeps us together during the depths of the pandemic. And as we open offices around the globe yet preserving the flexibility we mastered over the last 16 months, I'm hearing the excitement about being back together. Ultimately, it's our employees that wake up every day and decide to do things the right way, the Gallagher way. That's what makes us different. It makes us special as a franchise. It attracts the very best people and merger partners and ultimately, clients. I believe our culture has never been stronger. So with 2 quarters in the books, 2021 is shaping up to be an excellent year. 
Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"

As Pat said, an excellent quarter and first half of the year. Today, I'll spend a little extra time on organic and then give you our current thinking on expenses and margins. Then I'll walk you through some of the items o",1163,"Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. As Pat said, an excellent quarter and first half of the year. Today, I'll spend a little extra time on organic and then give you our current thinking on expenses and margins. Then I'll walk you through some of the items on our CFO commentary document, and I'll finish up with some comments on cash, liquidity and capital management. 
Okay. Let's move to Page 4 of the earnings release and the Brokerage segment organic table. Headline all-in organic of 6.8%, excellent on its own, but as Pat said, really running closer to 9%. There's 2 reasons for that. First, recall that we had some favorable timing in our first quarter related to contingent commissions that caused a little unfavorable timing here in the second quarter. Call that 70 basis points. Second, also recall that we took our 606 revenue accounting adjustment in the first quarter 2020. We then adjusted that in the second quarter 2020. So that creates a more difficult compare this year second quarter. Call that about 150 basis points. These 2 items combined for about 220 basis points of a headwind here in the second quarter. We don't expect similar headwinds in the second half. 
Okay. Let's go to Page 6 to the Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC table. You'll see that we expanded our EBITDAC margin by 23 basis points here in the second quarter. Considering last year's second quarter was in the depth of the pandemic and our Brokerage segment saved $60 million in that quarter, to post any expansion at all this quarter is terrific work by the team. It shows we are indeed holding a lot of our savings. So the natural question is, when you level for the $60 million of pandemic savings last year's second quarter and about $15 million of costs that came back this second quarter, what was the underlying margin expansion? Answer to that is about 125 basis points, which on 6.8% organic feels about right. 
That $15 million mostly relates to higher utilization of our self-insurance medical plans, a modest tick-up in T&E expenses and incentive comp. So we held $45 million of cost savings this quarter, and that's really terrific. 
Looking forward, we continue to think we can hold a lot of our pandemic period savings, perhaps more than half. But naturally, some of those costs will come back. As of now, we think about $20 million of cost returned in the third quarter and $30 million return in the fourth quarter. Both of those numbers are relative to last year's same quarter. So again, the natural question might be, what organic do you need to post third and fourth quarter to overcome those expenses and still have margin expansion? Math would say about 7%, which is really the real story. Recall at the beginning of the year, after expanding margins 420 basis points in 2020, we were looking at just holding margins flat. Now we're looking at a full year margin expansion story. 
So even with the return of the expenses and again, let's say, assuming for illustration a full year organic of 7%, MAV would show another full point of margin expansion in 2021. That would mean our cumulative 2-year margin expansion would be well over 500 basis points. That really highlights the improvements in productivity that are now ingrained in how we do business and how we operate. What a great story. 
Let's move on to the Risk Management segment EBITDAC table on Page 7. Adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.7% in the quarter is fantastic. And we continue to expect the team to deliver margins above 19% for the full year, showing that our Risk Management segment can also hold some of the pandemic-induced cost savings, meaning that the 2020 step-up in margin can be sustained in 2021. 
Let's move now to Page 4 of the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. Comparing second quarter results in the blue section to our June IR Day estimate in the gray section, interest in banking is in line. Clean Energy came in better than our estimate thanks to a hot late June, less wind energy production in certain areas of the country and higher natural gas prices. Accordingly, we are increasing our full year net earnings range to $75 million to $85 million on the back of the second quarter upside. 
You'll also notice 2 non-GAAP adjustments. One related to the costs associated with the terminated Willis Towers Watson acquisition, and the other is a onetime deferred tax revaluation charge related to the statutory increase in the U.K.'s 2023 corporate tax rate. When you control for those 2 items, it shows that adjusted M&A and corporate lines were both pretty close to our June '17 estimates. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, and that's in the pinkish section, you'll see non-GAAP after-tax adjustment for $12 million to $14 million. This charge is mostly related to redeeming $650 million of debt. That's the 10-year senior notes we issued in mid-May. You'll read that also on Page 3 of the earnings release. This should also lead to lower third and fourth quarter adjusted interest and banking expense, savings maybe of $2 million to $3 million after tax each quarter. 
If you turn now to Page 5 of the CFO commentary. Go to the peach color section, just another reminder of what we've been discussing in these calls and during our IR Days for the last couple of years. 2021 is the last year our clean energy investments will show GAAP P&L earnings. Rather, beginning in 2022, we will show substantial cash flows through our cash flow statement, call it $125 million to $150 million a year for, say, 6 to 7 years. I know I've highlighted this a lot, but I just want to make sure you consider this as you build your 2022 models and beyond. 
So next, let's go to the balance sheet on Page 14, the top line cash. At June 30, cash on hand was $3.2 billion, and we have no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. We'll use that first to redeem the $650 million of debt I just discussed. And also today, we announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. That would leave us with about $1 billion of cash. Then add to that about $650 million of net cash generation in the second half. That's after dividends, CapEx, interest, taxes, et cetera. And we would also have another $600 million to $700 million of borrowing capacity, means we have upwards of $2.5 billion for M&A. When I look at the pipeline and if a capital gains tax rate change gets momentum, I think we'll have plenty of opportunities to put that capital to work at really fair multiples 
Okay. Those are my comments, an excellent quarter, an excellent first half, a bright outlook for the second half and a really terrific cash position. Back to you, Pat."

So we're doing -- the good thing about this, though, is that we are actually being able to bring our experts to the point of sale virtually much more now than we were before. So remember, the advantage that we have, and that is we have experts in every single aspect of insurance around the world. We can now drop that person into our customers' office or even if they want to do it from home virtually. International folks, there's a lot -- there's conservative less international travel. But now we can bring our experts from London right into our terrific client or prospect in Des Moines, Iowa with a click of a button. 
So that's really the competitive advantage that we have. And 90% of the time, we compete with somebody smaller than us, and they just don't have the expert. So when we can drop our expert in and bring those capabilities to bear, it's going to lead to more wins in the future. In the past, to travel somebody in for a 0.5-hour meeting, that might be a 2- or 3-day affair.

And again, I think that if you do the math on those that have reported or wherever your other insights are coming from, their second quarter and their second -- last year and this quarter might add up to about the same number. 
I think that running towards 9% is the best quarter since we posted since fourth quarter 2003. And like Pat said, this level of organic growth isn't an aberration, just to 1 of us or 2 of us or whatever. The entire industry is showing excellent organic growth. Industry is growing at a much higher clip than GDP. And I guess what I would say is our outlook for the second half of the year is pretty bullish. So that's how I would answer.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.
We had an excellent second quarter. The team delivered on all 4 of our long-term operating priorities to drive shareholder value. We grew organically. We grew through acquisitions, improved our productivity, all while raising our quality and maintaining our unique Gallagher culture. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 17% growth in revenue, 8.6% organic growth, but it's over 10% when adjusted for timing, which Doug will spend some time on in a few minutes. Net earnings margin expansion of 107 basis points, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 30 basis points, and we completed 8 new mergers in the quarter with more than $70 million of estimated annualized revenue. Most importantly, our Gallagher culture continues to thrive. Just a fantastic quarter on all measures.
Now before I discuss how each of our businesses performed in more detail, let me comment briefly about the termination of our agreement to purchase certain Willis Towers Watson brokerage operations. We were excited about the opportunity. I would have loved to complete the transaction. There are a lot of great people at Willis, and they would have been a great addition to our team. But here's the key point. With or without this, we remain very well positioned to support our clients, compete for new ones and ultimately drive value for all of our stakeholders. We're in the greatest business on earth, our culture is stronger than ever, and I'm excited about our future.
Okay. Back to our quarterly results, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was strong at 16%. Of that, 6.8% was organic revenue growth, a little better than our June IR Day expectation and closer to 9% adjusted for timing. Our net earnings margin moved higher by 53 basis points, and our adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded by 23 basis points, highlighting our continued expense discipline. Another excellent quarter from the Brokerage team.
Let me walk you around the world and break down our organization by geography, starting with our PC operations. First, our domestic retail operations were very strong with more than 8% organic. New business was excellent, nicely above second quarter 2020 levels. Risk Placement Services, our domestic wholesale operations, grew 12%. This includes nearly 25% organic in open Brokerage and 6% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business and retention were both better than 2020 levels.
Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted more than 9% organic. Specialty was 10% and retail was excellent at 9%, bolstered by new business production. Canada was up an outstanding 16%, fueled by rate and exposure growth on top of solid new business and retention. And finally, Australia and New Zealand combined grew nearly 4%, benefiting from good new business and stable retention.
Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Second quarter organic was up about 4%, which is also ahead of our June IR Day commentary and another sequential step-up over first quarter 2021 and the second half of 2020. As business activity improves, we're seeing more favorable growth in our core health and welfare, fee-for-service and retirement consulting businesses, which is encouraging -- it's an encouraging sign for the second half of the year. So when I combine PC at 9-plus percent and benefits around 4%, total Brokerage segment organic was pushing 9% but with timing reported 6.8%. Either way, another really strong performance.
Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market. Global PC rates remain firm overall, and at the same time, we are seeing increased economic activity across our client base. Customers are adding coverages and exposures to their existing policies, and monthly positive policy endorsements are trending higher than pre-pandemic levels. And overall, second quarter renewal premium increases were similar with the first quarter.
Moving around the world. U.S. retail was up about 8%, including double-digit increases in professional liability. Canada was up 9%, driven by increases in professional liability and package. New Zealand was flat and Australia up 6%. Moving to the U.K., retail was up about 8%, with most classes of specialty business over 10%. And finally, within RPS, wholesale open brokerage was up 12%, while our binding operations were up 4%. So clearly, premiums are still increasing across nearly all geographies.
Looking forward, it feels that the current renewal environment will persist for some time. Carriers that cut back capacity in some of the less profitable lines of business like property, professional liability, umbrella and cyber have yet to budge on terms or conditions or haven't reverted back to offering more limits or lower attachment points. And elevated natural catastrophes, continued impacts of the pandemic, social inflation and low investment returns are all continuing to pressure rates. And on top of this, the potential for increased claim frequency as economies recover and carriers are making a strong case, the rate increases are likely to persist for some time. We, too, see the global PC environment remaining difficult for our clients, and that is likely to remain for the foreseeable future.
Moving to our benefits business. Our customer base is returning towards pre-pandemic levels a little more slowly than headline-grabbing sectors like retail, leisure and hospitality. So we are expecting even better organic in the second half. Further, our HR consulting units are very well positioned to deliver solutions as clients and prospects pivot away from controlling costs to growing their businesses and attracting, motivating and retaining their workforce in 2021 and beyond. 
So as I sit here today, I think second half Brokerage organic will be better than the first half and could take full year 2020 organic towards 8%. That would be a terrific step-up from the 3.2% organic we reported in 2020.
Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We completed 7 Brokerage and 1 Risk Management merger during the second quarter, representing over $70 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. 
As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $300 million of annualized revenues. Our platform continues to attract entrepreneurial owners looking to leverage our data, expertise, tools and market relationships to grow their businesses. And we expect that our U.S. pipeline will grow in the second half of the year given the potential changes in capital gains taxes. So 2021 is setting up to be another successful year for our merger strategy.
Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Second quarter organic growth was pushing 20%, better than our June IR Day expectations of mid-teens, and our adjusted EBITDAC margin exceeded 19%. We benefited from a revenue lift related to our 2020 new business wins, increased new arising claims within core workers' compensation and an easier pandemic-era comparison. Looking forward, the rebound in employment, economic activity and our solid new business should lead to third and fourth quarter organic nicely in double digits. For the year, we expect organic to be just over 10% and our EBITDAC margin to remain above 19%.
So what an exciting time to be part of Gallagher. And that's because of our 35,000-plus employees and our unique Gallagher culture. It's our culture that keeps us together during the depths of the pandemic. And as we open offices around the globe yet preserving the flexibility we mastered over the last 16 months, I'm hearing the excitement about being back together. Ultimately, it's our employees that wake up every day and decide to do things the right way, the Gallagher way. That's what makes us different. It makes us special as a franchise. It attracts the very best people and merger partners and ultimately clients. I believe our culture has never been stronger. So with 2 quarters in the books, 2021 is shaping up to be an excellent year.
Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"
252186,1673975853,2355537,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. As Pat said, an excellent quarter and first half of the year. Today, I'll spend a little extra time on organic and then give you our current thinking on expenses and margins. Then I'll walk you through some of the items o",1164,"Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. As Pat said, an excellent quarter and first half of the year. Today, I'll spend a little extra time on organic and then give you our current thinking on expenses and margins. Then I'll walk you through some of the items on our CFO commentary document, and I'll finish up with some comments on cash, liquidity and capital management.
Okay. Let's move to Page 4 of the earnings release and the Brokerage segment organic table. Headline all-in organic of 6.8%, excellent on its own, but as Pat said, really running closer to 9%. There's 2 reasons for that. First, recall that we had some favorable timing in our first quarter related to contingent commissions that caused a little unfavorable timing here in the second quarter. Call that 70 basis points. Second, also recall that we took our 606 revenue accounting adjustment in the first quarter of 2020. We then adjusted that in the second quarter of 2020. So that creates a more difficult compare this year second quarter. Call that about 150 basis points. These 2 items combined for about 220 basis points of a headwind here in the second quarter. We don't expect similar headwinds in the second half.
Okay. Let's go to Page 6 to the Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC table. You'll see that we expanded our EBITDAC margin by 23 basis points here in the second quarter. Considering last year's second quarter was in the depth of the pandemic and our Brokerage segment saved $60 million in that quarter, to post any expansion at all this quarter is terrific work by the team. It shows we are indeed holding a lot of our savings. 
So the natural question is, when you levelize for the $60 million of pandemic savings last year's second quarter and about $15 million of costs that came back this second quarter, what was the underlying margin expansion? Answer to that is about 125 basis points, which on 6.8% organic feels about right. That $15 million mostly relates to higher utilization of our self-insurance medical plans, a modest tick-up in T&E expenses and incentive comp. So we held $45 million of cost savings this quarter, and that's really terrific. 
Looking forward, we continue to think we can hold a lot of our pandemic period savings, perhaps more than half. But naturally, some of those costs will come back. As of now, we think about $20 million of cost returned in the third quarter and $30 million return in the fourth quarter. Both of those numbers are relative to last year's same quarters. 
So again, the natural question might be, what organic do you need to post third and fourth quarter to overcome those expenses and still have margin expansion? Math would say about 7%, which is really the real story. Recall at the beginning of the year, after expanding margins 420 basis points in 2020, we were looking at just holding margins flat. Now we're looking at a full year margin expansion story.
So even with the return of the expenses and again, let's say, assuming for illustration a full year organic of 7%, math would show another full point of margin expansion in 2021. That would mean our cumulative 2-year margin expansion would be well over 500 basis points. That really highlights the improvements in productivity that are now ingrained in how we do business and how we operate. What a great story.
Let's move on to the Risk Management segment EBITDAC table on Page 7. Adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.7% in the quarter is fantastic. And we continue to expect the team to deliver margins above 19% for the full year, showing that our Risk Management segment can also hold some of the pandemic-induced cost savings, meaning that the 2020 step-up in margin can be sustained in 2021.
Let's move now to Page 4 of the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. Comparing second quarter results in the blue section to our June IR Day estimate in the gray section, interest and banking is in line. Clean energy came in better than our estimate, thanks to a hot late June, less wind energy production in certain areas of the country and higher natural gas prices. Accordingly, we are increasing our full year net earnings range to $75 million to $85 million on the back of the second quarter upside.
You'll also notice 2 non-GAAP adjustments. One related to the costs associated with the terminated Willis Towers Watson acquisition, and the other is a onetime deferred tax revaluation charge related to the statutory increase in the U.K.'s 2023 corporate tax rate. When you control for those 2 items, it shows that adjusted M&A and corporate lines were both pretty close to our June 17th estimates.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, and that's in the pinkish section, you'll see non-GAAP after-tax adjustment for $12 million to $14 million. This charge is mostly related to redeeming $650 million of debt. That's the 10-year senior notes we issued in mid-May. You'll read that also on Page 3 of the earnings release. This should also lead to lower third and fourth quarter adjusted interest and banking expense, savings maybe of $2 million to $3 million after tax each quarter.
If you turn now to Page 5 of the CFO commentary, go to the peach-colored section. Just another reminder of what we've been discussing in these calls and during our IR Days for the last couple of years. 2021 is the last year our clean energy investments will show GAAP P&L earnings. Rather, beginning in 2022, we will show substantial cash flows through our cash flow statement, call it $125 million to $150 million a year for, say, 6 to 7 years. I know I've highlighted this a lot, but I just want to make sure you consider this as you build your 2022 models and beyond.
So next, let's go to the balance sheet on Page 14, the top line cash. At June 30, cash on hand was $3.2 billion, and we have no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. We'll use that first to redeem the $650 million of debt I just discussed. And also today, we announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. That would leave us with about $1 billion of cash. Then add to that about $650 million of net cash generation in the second half. That's after dividends, CapEx, interest, taxes, et cetera. And we would also have another $600 million to $700 million of borrowing capacity. Means we have upwards of $2.5 billion for M&A. When I look at the pipeline and if a capital gains tax rate change gets momentum, I think we'll have plenty of opportunities to put that capital to work at really fair multiples.
Okay. Those are my comments, an excellent quarter, an excellent first half, a bright outlook for the second half and a really terrific cash position. Back to you, Pat."

Well, first of all, we have no hold on -- if somebody wants to travel to see their clients, they're more than welcome to go do it. We have no restrictions on that, and people are self-governing on that. We will meet our clients wherever they would like us to meet them in order to conduct business with them. So we are there on how they want to do it. How much is that? We probably have maybe $5 million a quarter of step-up from where we were in the past. So maybe there's an extra $5 million in our first quarter, another 5 -- maybe we're at $10 million this quarter, $15 million next and $20 million next quarter relative to the depth of the pandemic. 
So we're doing -- the good thing about this, though, is that we are actually being able to bring our experts to the point of sale virtually much more now than we were before. So remember the advantage that we have, and that is we have experts in every single aspect of insurance around the world. We can now drop that person into our customers' office or even if they want to do it from home virtually. International folks, there's a lot -- there's considerably less international travel. But now we can bring our experts from London right into our terrific client or prospect in Des Moines, Iowa with a click of a button. 
So that's really the competitive advantage that we have. And 90% of the time, we compete with somebody smaller than us, and they just don't have the expert. So when we can drop our expert in and bring those capabilities to bear, it's going to lead to more wins in the future. In the past, to travel somebody in for a 0.5-hour meeting, that might be a 2- or 3-day affair. So think about even though expenses might return to a certain extent, it's the ability to get our experts at the point of sale or the point of -- to the prospect virtually that really is the terrific outcome from the pandemic."

And again, I think that if you do the math on those that have reported or wherever your other insights are coming from, their second quarter and their second -- last year and this quarter might add up to about the same number. 
I think that running towards 9% is the best quarter since we posted since fourth quarter 2003. And like Pat said, this level of organic growth isn't an aberration just to 1 of us or 2 of us or whatever. The entire industry is showing excellent organic growth. Industry is growing at a much higher clip than GDP. And I guess what I would say is our outlook for the second half of the year is pretty bullish. So that's how I would answer it.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call to you today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as heads of our operating divisions. We had a fantastic third quarter. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments, we posted 17% growth in revenue, 10% organic growth and nearly 11% organic if you control for last year's large life sale that we've discussed frequently. Net earnings growth of 22%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%. And we completed 5 new mergers in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date closed merger count in '19, representing nearly $200 million of annualized revenue. And if you add in the pending Willis Reinsurance merger, that number would be pushing $1 billion.
So the team continues to execute at a very high level, growing organically, growing through acquisitions, improving our productivity, raising our quality and most importantly, constantly building upon our unique Gallagher culture, a terrific quarter on all measures. Let me provide a brief update on our agreement to purchase Willis Re. On the regulatory approval front, we received competition clearance in 5 of 6 jurisdictions required to close, including clearance by the U.S. Department of Justice. The final jurisdiction in the U.K. where the CMA is reviewing the transaction, that's the final jurisdiction. That review is ongoing, but we believe we're in good shape. Although there is still work to be done, at this point, we believe we're on track for a fourth quarter closing.
On the integration front, hundreds of Gallagher and Willis Re professionals are hard at work ensuring we will be well positioned to service our clients when we close. Our 40-year acquisition history allows us to leverage our proven M&A integration path. Integration is in our DNA. We're looking forward to welcoming 2,200 new colleagues to Gallagher as a family of professionals this holiday season. It's really exciting to think about all the talent and expertise that will be joining us. It's going to be incredible for our combined organization and our clients.
Okay, back to our quarterly results, starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was excellent at 16%. Of that, 9% was organic revenue growth at the upper end of our September IR Day expectation and nearly 10% controlling for last year's large life product sale. Net earnings growth was 23%, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA at 13%. Doug will provide some comments on third quarter margin and our fourth quarter outlook, but needless to say another excellent quarter from the brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and break down our organic by geography, starting with our PC operations. First, our domestic retail operations were very strong with more than 10% organic. Results were driven by good new business combined with higher exposures and continued rate increases. Risk Placement Services, our domestic wholesale operations, grew 16%. This includes more than 30% organic in open brokerage and 5% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business and retention were both up 1 point or so relative to 2020 levels.
Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted more than 9% organic. Specialty was 12% and retail was a solid 6%, both supported by excellent new business production. Australia and New Zealand combined grew more than 6%, also benefiting from good new business. And finally, Canada was up nearly 10% on the back of double-digit new business and stable retention. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Third quarter organic was up about 5%, in line with our September IR Day commentary. Controlling for last year's large life insurance product sale, organic would have been up high single digits and represents a really nice step-up from the 4% organic we reported for the second quarter and a 2% organic for the first. So we are experiencing positive revenue momentum and really encouraging sign for the remainder of the year and 2022.
So total Brokerage segment organic solidly in that 9% to 10% range, simply an excellent quarter. Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market. Global PC rates remained firm overall and pricing is positive in nearly all product lines. Overall, third quarter renewal premium increases were about 8% and similar to increases during the first half of this year. Moving around the world, U.S. retail premiums up about 8%, including nearly 10% increases in casualty and professional liability. Even workers' comp was up around 5%. In Canada, premiums up about 9%, driven by double-digit increases in professional liability and casualty. Australia and New Zealand combined, up 3% to 4%, and U.K. retail was up about 7% with double-digit increases in professional liability, while commercial auto was closer to flat.
Finally, within RPS, wholesale open brokerage premiums were up more than 10% and binding operations were up 5%. Additionally, improved economic activity even despite the Delta variant and supply chain disruptions are leading to positive policy endorsements and other favorable midterm policy adjustments as our customers add coverages and exposures to their existing policies. So premiums are still increasing almost everywhere.
As we look ahead over the coming quarters, I see the PC market remaining difficult with rate increases persisting for quite a while. In the near term, we don't see any meaningful changes in carrier underwriting appetite capacity, attachment points or terms and conditions. Long term, markets do not appear to be seeing a slowdown in rising loss costs. Global third quarter natural catastrophe losses likely in excess of $40 billion. Increased cyber incident social inflation, replacement cost inflation and supply chain disruptions. And all of this is before factoring in further increases in claim frequency as global economies recover and become even more robust. All of these factors, combined with low investment returns suggest that carriers will continue to push for rate. I just don't see a dramatic change for the foreseeable future. So it's still a very difficult and even hard in many spots global PC environment. But remember, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases through our creativity, expertise and market relationships.
As we think about the environment for our employee benefits, the improved business activity, lower unemployment and increased demand for our consulting services is driving more revenue opportunities. And our customers and prospects continue to rapidly shift away from expense control strategies to plans and tactics that will help them grow their business. And with rebounding covered lives in one of the most challenging labor markets in memory, our consulting businesses are extremely well positioned to deliver creative solutions to our clients. So as I sit here today, I think fourth quarter Brokerage segment organic will be similar to the third quarter, and that could take full year 2021 organic towards 8%. That would be a really nice improvement from the 3.2% organic we reported in 2020. To put that in perspective, 8% would be our best full year Brokerage segment organic growth in nearly 2 decades, and we think 2022 organic will end up in a very similar range.
Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. I mentioned earlier we completed 5 brokerage mergers during the quarter, representing about $16 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in M&A pipeline, we have more than 50 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $400 million of annualized revenues. So even without the reinsurance merger, it's looking like we will finish 2021 strong, wrapping up another successful year for our merger strategy.
Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic growth was 16.6%, even better than our September IR Day expectation. Margins were strong, too. Adjusted EBITDAC margin once again came in above 19%. Results continue to benefit from late 2020 and early 2021 new business wins, in addition to further improvement in new arising claims within general liability and core workers' compensation. just an exceptional quarter from the team.
Looking forward, while our fourth quarter comparison is somewhat more challenging, the recovering global economy, improving employment situation and excellent new business production should result in fourth quarter organic over 10%. That puts us on nicely above 19%. Back over the last 9 months, [Indiscernible] our commitment to our clients and that is due to our unique Gallagher culture. In these challenging times, our clients are continuing to count on us, and I'm proud of our team's unwavering client focus. Gallagher's unique culture is founded on the values in the Gallagher way. Those values have kept us on a steady course throughout the pandemic. And time and time again during these past months, our clients have shared their trust and appreciation for the value Gallagher brings to the table. It comes down to talented individuals, tapping into the power of our expertise across the globe working together during this ongoing pandemic to continue to deliver for our clients. That's the Gallagher Way, and it's the backbone of who we are as an organization. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"
252186,1684666162,2416704,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. As Pat said, a fantastic third quarter. Today, I'll touch on a few items in the earnings release, predominantly organic and margins, then I'll walk you through our CFO commentary document, and finish up with my typical co",1033,"Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. As Pat said, a fantastic third quarter. Today, I'll touch on a few items in the earnings release, predominantly organic and margins, then I'll walk you through our CFO commentary document, and finish up with my typical comments on cash, liquidity and capital management. Okay. Let's move to Page 4 of the earnings release and the Brokerage segment organic table.
Headline all-in organic is 9%, outstanding in itself, but as Pat said, really running closer to 10% due to last year's life sale. Either way, a nice step-up from the 6% we posted in the first quarter and the 6.8% in the second. As we sit now, I'm seeing a fourth quarter organic again pushing that double-digit level.
Turning now to Page 6 to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Okay. Underlying margin after controlling for the life sale was around 160 basis points. Let me take you through the math to get you to that. First, headline margins were down 48 basis points, right about where we forecasted at our September IR day. So controlling for the large life sale would bring us back to flat. Second, in September, we forecasted about $25 million of expenses returning into our structure as we emerge from the pandemic and a small amount of performance comp time. Recall expenses returning mostly related to higher utilization of our self-insured medical plans, resumption of advertising costs, more use of consultants, merit increases and a small pickup in T&E expenses. We came in right on that forecast. So controlling for these expenses also brings you to that underlying margin expansion of about 160 basis points. That feels about right on organic in that 9% to 10% range.
Looking forward, we think about $30 million of our pre-pandemic period expense savings return in the fourth quarter. And if you assume, say, 9% organic, math would say we should show 90 to 100 basis points of expansion here in the fourth quarter. So in the end, the headline story is that we have a really decent chance at growing our full year '21 margins by nearly 150 basis points, and that's even growing over the life sale and the return of costs as we come out of the pandemic. Add that to expanding margins over 400 basis points last year, means we'd be growing margins more than 550 basis points over 2 years. That really demonstrates the embedded improvements in how we do business. No matter how you look at it, it's simply outstanding work by the team.
Moving to the Risk Management segment, EBITDAC table on Page 7. Adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.5% in the quarter as an excellent result. Year-to-date, our margins are at 19.2%, which underscores our ability to maintain a large portion of our pandemic period savings. Looking forward, we think we can hold margins above 19% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That would result in about 100 basis points of margin expansion relative to 2020, another fantastic margin story.
Now let's shift to our CFO commentary document we posted on our IR website, starting on Page 4. You'll see most of the third quarter items are close to our September IR day estimates. One small exception is Brokerage segment amortization expense, about $3 million below our September IR day estimate. It's simply because we finalized our valuation work on a recent '21 acquisition but causes a small catch-up estimate change. We adjusted that out on Page 1 of the earnings release, so it doesn't benefit adjusted EPS.
Flipping to Page 5 in the corporate segment table. Sharing actual third quarter results in the blue section to our September IR estimates in gray. Interest and banking line on a reported and adjusted basis were both in line. The non-GAAP adjustment here is that $12 million charge related to the early extinguishment of debt that we issued in May related to the terminated Aon-Willis remedy package.  Acquisition cost line, mostly related to the Willis Re transaction, came in a bit higher than our IR day estimate on a reported basis, but in line on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We will see some additional transaction-related costs here in the fourth quarter. Should have a sense of what those costs might be at our December IR day. Again, we plan on presenting these costs of the non-GAAP adjustment as well.
On the corporate cost line, in line on an adjusted basis after controlling for $5 million of a onetime permanent tax item. That's a noncash and it's simply a small valuation allowance related to a couple of international M&A transactions.
And finally, clean energy. What a terrific quarter, came in much better than our estimate, thanks to our warm September, less wind in certain areas of the country and higher natural gas prices. We are increasing our full year net earnings range to $87 million to $95 million on the back of the third quarter upside.
Okay. As for cash and capital management and M&A. As you heard Pat say, we have a strong pipeline of tuck-in merger opportunities, and that's on top of the Willis Re acquisition that we hope to close here in the fourth quarter. At September 30, cash on hand was about $2.7 billion, and we have no outstanding borrowers on our credit facility. We plan to use that cash, cash flow generated during the fourth quarter and our line of credit to fund our -- the acquisition of Willis Re.
Before I turn it back over to Pat, our year-to-date performance deserves a mention. Our Brokerage and Risk Management segments combined have produced 15% growth in revenue, nearly 8% organic growth. We completed 19 new mergers this year with nearly $200 million invested money annualized revenue, net earnings margin expanded 81 basis points, adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 153 basis points, and our clean energy investments are on track to being up 30% this year, setting us up nicely for substantial additional cash flows for the coming 5 to 7 years. A terrific quarter in 9 months on all measures, positions us for another great year. Okay. Those are my comments. Back to you, Pat."

Capsicum, which was a startup, very successful became, of course, Gallagher Re. This is a very complementary business. There might be a few little areas here or there where they each touch. But there are no major renewals across the trading book that are in conflict. And so what you've got is the Gallagher Re people, who you could imagine if you're just reading about these numbers to numbers could be worried about a much larger competitor being acquired, being able to come in with their name, of course, and our brand and how we're going to sort that out and what does that mean to the clients that they've been calling on, virtually none of that exists. So what you've got is a team of people from the Willis Re side that are very excited. The people from Gallagher Re existing are very excited. They hit the ground running in January with a new improved much expanded Gallagher Re.
And that's a branding exercise that is outstanding for all parties and it brings tremendous additional capabilities because as a start-up, as you can imagine, over 3, 4, 5 years, Capsicum Re has had to develop all the individual capabilities, one at a time, pay for it as they go, still driving decent margins and top line growth. Willis is over 100 years old. They've built this stuff. They've got -- they've just got terrific depth. And so it's going to be a very strong combination with almost no conflict whatsoever."

So you've got the natural accretion of the earn-out liability. So if we buy somebody and we've got $50 million on an earn-out. We discount that back around at about 8% per year.

So if we buy somebody and we've got $50 million on an earn-out. We discount that back around at about 8% per year. So you've got the accretion of what's going to be paid out. And then you've got the change and what you think the ultimate is. So again, I think that total payout could be $50 million, let's say we put up $30 million worth of liability, expecting kind of that they're going to perform at the 60% range. You got an 8% accretion of $30 million. But if 1 day, they really overperform and we've got to pump that up to a $40 million expectation. That's the difference that goes to the change in earnout piece as well as an accretion piece. So there were the 2 different pieces. What you're seeing this quarter is we did have some acquisitions that have -- are looking like they're going to better perform. And it's that odd accounting that says that when we think that our acquisitions are going to perform better, we have to take a charge for that as we increase that liability."

I think the fact is that this is a leg on the stool that we haven't had. And I think everyone on this call knows that I've tried for years to be a big player in this business, failed miserably once, got together with a great team and had a terrific start up a second time. I had a really exciting spring thinking that we were going to land this group of people into the company through the acquisition of Willis by Aon. Had that rug pulled out from under me in late May into June and somehow was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to get this back on track for a close this year. So it's been a bit of a seesaw for me.
And part of the reason I'm excited about it is that it adds so much to the company. It adds, frankly, interestingly enough, to our ability to produce middle market retail property casualty business on a global basis. Now how is that possible? Well, number one, data; number two, that data and analytics. But it also gives us a clear insight into what is troubling and exciting to the carrier world, what's going on in their capital plans? What are they seeing accumulations? Where are we helping them? And how does that translate to what's going on in the middle market? Take construction. So that's just a whole another opportunity for me to get out in front of our team and say, look, our hit ratio today is improving, but it's still not that different than when I joined the business. Now how can that be? We know that 90-plus percent of the time when we compete in the marketplace, we're competing with somebody smaller, typically the local agent or broker that we're buying. And frankly, we should be crushing that. So I would hope that, that would lead to even more organic growth even in the retail level.
And then you go into looking at reinsurance, this isn't true, but there's 3 main players, we're going to be 1 of those. And yes, there are other players, and we were proud at Capsicum, Gallagher Re to become the fifth largest at $100 million in revenue. That's a great accomplishment, but a $1 billion player? That new capital coming into that market, those carriers that are looking to do new things, treaties that need to be reworked and tweaked, 3 competitors? I think we're going to do really well."

So I think how much more of that will be determined. But it's at the nub of capital creation. If you look at the genesis of Gallagher way back when, to really pioneer the alternative market, which is really capital creation. We take that with our captive. We take it with our -- the wholesale and where we're creating capital with other capital markets there to come up with programs and then I think that it's going to give us an opportunity to create more capital. Combine that with the knowledge that we have with respect to certain long-tail liabilities like workers' comp and general liability, I think that we can bring some pretty exciting capital formation together with Gallagher Basset to help our self-insured clients. So -- and then if you just get down into our retail business globally, I think a close partnership with the Willis and Gallagher Re, reinsurers will come up with much -- with considerably more creative ideas. I believe in our culture, where creative ideas get pursued, I think that will help us grow better together. So I don't think there's any fantasy in what Pat was saying."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as heads of our operating divisions.
We had a fantastic third quarter. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 17% growth in revenue, 10% organic growth and nearly 11% organic if you control for last year's large life sale that we've discussed frequently. Net earnings growth of 22%, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 13%. And we completed 5 new mergers in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date closed merger count to 19, representing nearly $200 million of annualized revenue. And if you add in the pending Willis Reinsurance merger, that number would be pushing $1 billion.
So the team continues to execute at a very high level, growing organically, growing through acquisitions, improving our productivity, raising our quality and, most importantly, constantly building upon our unique Gallagher culture. A terrific quarter on all measures.
Let me provide a brief update on our agreement to purchase Willis Re. On the regulatory approval front, we received competition clearance in 5 of 6 jurisdictions required to close, including clearance by the U.S. Department of Justice. The final jurisdiction in the U.K. where the CMA is reviewing the transaction, that's the final jurisdiction. That review is ongoing, but we believe we're in good shape. Although there is still work to be done, at this point, we believe we're on track for a fourth quarter closing.
On the integration front, hundreds of Gallagher and Willis Re professionals are hard at work, ensuring we will be well positioned to service our clients when we close. Our 40-year acquisition history allows us to leverage our proven M&A integration path. Integration is in our DNA. We're looking forward to welcoming 2,200 new colleagues to Gallagher as a family of professionals this holiday season. It's really exciting to think about all the talent and expertise that will be joining us. It's going to be incredible for our combined organization and our clients.
Okay. Back to our quarterly results, starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was excellent at 16%. Of that, 9% was organic revenue growth, at the upper end of our September IR Day expectation and nearly 10% controlling for last year's large life product sale. Net earnings growth was 23%, and we grew our adjusted EBITDAC 13%. Doug will provide some comments on third quarter margin and our fourth quarter outlook, but needless to say, another excellent quarter from the Brokerage team.
Let me walk you around the world and break down our organic by geography, starting with our P/C operations. First, our domestic retail operations were very strong with more than 10% organic. Results were driven by good new business combined with higher exposures and continued rate increases.
Risk Placement Services, our domestic wholesale operations, grew 16%. This includes more than 30% organic in open brokerage and 5% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business and retention were both up a point or so relative to 2020 levels.
Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted more than 9% organic. Specialty was 12%, and retail was a solid 6%, both supported by excellent new business production. Australia and New Zealand combined grew more than 6%, also benefiting from good new business. And finally, Canada was up nearly 10% on the back of double-digit new business and stable retention.
Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Third quarter organic was up about 5%, in line with our September IR Day commentary. Controlling for last year's large life insurance product sale, organic would have been up high single digits and represents a really nice step-up from the 4% organic we reported for the second quarter and a 2% organic for the first.
So we're experiencing positive revenue momentum and really encouraging sign for the remainder of the year and 2022. So total Brokerage segment organic solidly in that 9% to 10% range, simply an excellent quarter.
Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the P/C market. Global P/C rates remain firm overall, and pricing is positive in nearly all product lines. Overall third quarter renewal premium increases were about 8% and similar to increases during the first half of this year.
Moving around the world, U.S. retail premium was up about 8%, including nearly 10% increases in casualty and professional liability. Even workers' comp was up around 5%. In Canada, premium was up about 9%, driven by double-digit increases in professional liability and casualty. Australia and New Zealand combined up 3% to 4%. And U.K. retail was up about 7% with double-digit increases in professional liability, while commercial auto was closer to flat.
Finally, within RPS, wholesale open brokerage premiums were up more than 10% and binding operations were up 5%. Additionally, improved economic activity, even despite the Delta variant and supply chain disruptions, are leading to positive policy endorsements and other favorable midterm policy adjustments as our customers add coverages and exposures to their existing policies. So premiums are still increasing almost everywhere.
As we look ahead over the coming quarters, I see the P/C market remaining difficult with rate increases persisting for quite a while. In the near term, we don't see any meaningful changes in carrier underwriting appetite capacity, attachment points or terms and conditions.
Long term, markets do not appear to be seeing a slowdown in rising loss costs. Global third quarter natural catastrophe losses, likely in excess of $40 billion, increased cyber incidences, social inflation, replacement cost inflation and supply chain disruptions. And all of this is before factoring in further increases in claim frequency as global economies recover and become even more robust.
All of these factors, combined with low investment returns, suggest that carriers will continue to push for rate. I just don't see a dramatic change for the foreseeable future. So it's still a very difficult and even hard in many spots global P/C environment. But remember, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases through our creativity, expertise and market relationships.
As we think about the environment for our employee benefits, the improved business activity, lower unemployment and increased demand for our consulting services is driving more revenue opportunities. And our customers and prospects continue to rapidly shift away from expense control strategies to plans and tactics that will help them grow their business. And with rebounding covered lives in one of the most challenging labor markets in memory, our consulting businesses are extremely well positioned to deliver creative solutions to our clients.
So as I sit here today, I think fourth quarter Brokerage segment organic will be similar to the third quarter, and that could take full year 2021 organic towards 8%. That would be a really nice improvement from the 3.2% organic we reported in 2020. To put that in perspective, 8% would be our best full year Brokerage segment organic growth in nearly 2 decades, and we think 2022 organic will end up in a very similar range.
Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. I mentioned earlier we completed 5 brokerage mergers during the quarter, representing about $16 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.
As I look at our tuck-in M&A pipeline, we have more than 50 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $400 million of annualized revenues. So even without the reinsurance merger, it's looking like we will finish 2021 strong, wrapping up another successful year for our merger strategy.
Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic growth was 16.6%, even better than our September IR Day expectation. Margins were strong, too. Adjusted EBITDAC margin once again came in above 19%. Results continue to benefit from late 2020 and early 2021 new business wins, in addition to further improvement in new arising claims within general liability and core workers' compensation. Just an exceptional quarter from the team.
Looking forward, while our fourth quarter comparison is somewhat more challenging, the recovering global economy, improving employment situation and excellent new business production should result in fourth quarter organic over 10%. That puts us on track for double-digit full year organic and an EBITDAC margin nicely above 19%.
As I look back over the last 9 months, I can't help but to be really impressed with our team and our accomplishments. Our commitment to our clients and to each other is evident in our successes, and that is due to our unique Gallagher culture. In these challenging times, our clients are continuing to count on us, and I'm proud of our team's unwavering client focus. Gallagher's unique culture is founded on the values in The Gallagher Way. Those values have kept us on a steady course throughout the pandemic. And time and time again, during these past months, our clients have shared their trust and appreciation for the value Gallagher brings to the table.
It comes down to talented individuals tapping into the power of our expertise across the globe, working together during this ongoing pandemic to continue to deliver for our clients. That's The Gallagher Way, and it's the backbone of who we are as an organization.
Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?"
252186,1684666162,2416976,"Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. As Pat said, a fantastic third quarter. Today, I'll touch on a few items in the earnings release, predominantly organic and margins.

Today, I'll touch on a few items in the earnings release, predominantly organic and margins. Then I'll walk you through our CFO commentary document, and finish up with my typical comments on cash, liquidity and capital management.
Okay. Let's move to Page 4 of the earnings release and the Brokerage segment organic table. Headline all-in organic of 9%, outstanding in itself, but as Pat said, really running closer to 10% due to last year's life sale. Either way, a nice step-up from the 6% we posted in the first quarter and the 6.8% in the second. As we sit now, I'm seeing a fourth quarter organic again pushing that double-digit level.
Turning now to Page 6 to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Okay. Underlying margin after controlling for the life sale was around 160 basis points. Let me take you through the math to get you to that. First, headline margins were down 48 basis points, right about where we forecasted at our September IR day. So controlling for the large life sale would bring us back to flat.
Second, in September, we forecasted about $25 million of expenses returning into our structure as we emerge from the pandemic and a small amount of performance comp time. Recall, expenses returning mostly relate to higher utilization of our self-insured medical plans, resumption of advertising costs, more use of consultants, merit increases and a small pickup in T&E expenses. We came in right on that forecast.
So controlling for these expenses also brings you to that underlying margin expansion of about 160 basis points. That feels about right on organic in that 9% to 10% range.
Looking forward, we think about $30 million of our pandemic period expense savings return in the fourth quarter. And if you assume, say, 9% organic, math would say we should show 90 to 100 basis points of expansion here in the fourth quarter. So in the end, the headline story is that we have a really decent chance at growing our full year '21 margins by nearly 150 basis points. And that's even growing over the life sale and the return of costs as we come out of the pandemic.
Add that to expanding margins over 400 basis points last year means we'd be growing margins more than 550 basis points over 2 years. That really demonstrates the embedded improvements in how we do business. No matter how you look at it, it's simply outstanding work by the team.
Moving to the Risk Management segment EBITDAC table on Page 7. Adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.5% in the quarter is an excellent result. Year-to-date, our margins are at 19.2%, which underscores our ability to maintain a large portion of our pandemic period savings. Looking forward, we think we can hold margins above 19% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That would result in about 100 basis points of margin expansion relative to 2020, another fantastic margin story.
Now let's shift to our CFO commentary document we posted on our IR website, starting on Page 4. You'll see most of the third quarter items are close to our September IR Day estimates. One small exception is Brokerage segment amortization expense, about $3 million below our September IR Day estimate. It's simply because we finalized our valuation work on a recent '21 acquisition, which causes a small catch-up estimate change. We adjusted that out on Page 1 of the earnings release, so it doesn't benefit adjusted EPS.
Flipping to Page 5 in the Corporate segment table. Sharing actual third quarter results in the blue section to our September IR estimates in gray. Interest and banking line on a reported and adjusted basis were both in line. The non-GAAP adjustment here is that $12 million charge related to the early extinguishment of debt that we issued in May related to the terminated Aon and Willis remedy package.
Acquisition cost line, mostly related to the Willis Re transaction, came in a bit higher than our IR Day estimate on a reported basis, but in line on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We will see some additional transaction-related costs here in the fourth quarter. Should have a sense of what those costs might be at our December IR Day. Again, we plan on presenting these costs as a non-GAAP adjustment as well.
On the corporate cost line, in line on an adjusted basis after controlling for $5 million of a onetime permanent tax item, that's a noncash and it's simply a small valuation allowance related to a couple of international M&A transactions.
And finally, clean energy. What a terrific quarter, came in much better than our estimate, thanks to our warm September, less wind in certain areas of the country and higher natural gas prices. We are increasing our full year net earnings range to $87 million to $95 million on the back of the third quarter upside.
Okay. As for cash and capital management and M&A. As you heard Pat say, we have a strong pipeline of tuck-in merger opportunities, and that's on top of the Willis Re acquisition that we hope to close here in the fourth quarter. At September 30, cash on hand was about $2.7 billion, and we have no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. We plan to use that cash, cash flow generated during the fourth quarter and our line of credit to fund our -- the acquisition of Willis Re.
Before I turn it back over to Pat, our year-to-date performance deserves a mention. Our Brokerage and Risk Management segments combined have produced 15% growth in revenue, nearly 8% organic growth. We completed 19 new mergers this year with nearly $200 million investment made at annualized revenue. Net earnings margin expanded 81 basis points. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 153 basis points. And our clean energy investments are on track to being up 30% this year, setting us up nicely for substantial additional cash flows for the coming 5 to 7 years.
A terrific quarter, in my mind, on all measures, positions us for another great year. Okay. Those are my comments. Back to you, Pat."

So what you've got is a team of people from the Willis Re side that are very excited. The people from Gallagher Re existing are very excited. They hit the ground running in January with a new improved much expanded Gallagher Re. And that's a branding exercise that is outstanding for all parties, and it brings tremendous additional capabilities.
Because as a start-up, as you could imagine, over 3, 4, 5 years, Capsicum Re has had to develop all the individual capabilities one at a time, pay for it as they go, still driving decent margins and top line growth. Willis is over 100 years old. They've built this stuff. They've got -- they've just got terrific depth. And so it's going to be a very strong combination with almost no conflict whatsoever."

And the thing about workers' comp, I have to give our carrier partners credit, they know what's going on in that line every day.
And when they see a need to move rate -- and that's why during the hard market, many, many quarters, we report flat work comp because they didn't need the rate. So this is really interesting to me because they're not waiting around to find out that they are 25 points behind the 8 ball, and then trying to get it back at one swoop.

Let's say we put up $30 million worth of liability, expecting kind of that they're going to perform at the 60% range, you've got an 8% accretion on $30 million.
But if one day, they really overperform and we've got to pump that up to a $40 million expectation, that's the difference that goes to change in earn-out piece as well as an accretion piece. So those are the 2 different pieces. What you're seeing this quarter is we did have some acquisitions that have -- are looking like they're going to better perform. And it's that odd accounting that says that when we think that our acquisitions are going to perform better, we have to take a charge for that as we increase that liability."

I think the fact is that this is a leg on the stool that we haven't had. And I think everyone on this call knows that I've tried for years to be a big player in this business, failed miserably once, got together with a great team and had a terrific start-up a second time.
I had a really exciting spring thinking that we were going to land this group of people into the company through the acquisition of Willis by Aon. Had that rug pulled out from under me in late May into June and somehow was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to get this back on track for a close this year. So it's been a bit of a seesaw for me.
And part of the reason I'm excited about it is that it adds so much to the company. It adds, frankly, interestingly enough, to our ability to produce middle market retail, property/casualty business on a global basis. Now how is that possible? Well, number one, data; number two, that data and analytics. But it also gives us a clear insight into what is troubling and exciting to the carrier world, what's going on in their capital plans, what are they seeing in accumulations, where are we helping them, and how does that translate to what's going on in the middle market.
Take construction. So that's just a whole another opportunity for me to get out in front of our team and say, look, our hit ratio today is improving, but it's still not that different than when I joined the business. Now how can that be? We know that 90-plus percent of the time when we compete in the marketplace, we're competing with somebody smaller, typically, the local agent or broker that we're buying. And frankly, we should be crushing that. So I would hope that, that would lead to even more organic growth even in the retail level.
And then you go into looking at reinsurance, this isn't true, but there's 3 main players, we're going to be one of those. And yes, there are other players, and we were proud at Capsicum, Gallagher Re to become the fifth largest at $100 million in revenue. That's a great accomplishment. But a $1 billion player? That new capital coming into that market, those carriers that are looking to do new things, treaties that need to be reworked and tweaked, 3 competitors? I think we're going to do really well."

We take it with our -- the wholesale and where we're creating capital with other capital markets there to come up with programs [ in the end ]. I think that it's going to give us an opportunity to create more capital.
Combine that with the knowledge that we have with respect to certain long-tail liabilities like workers' comp and general liability, I think that we can bring some pretty exciting capital formation together with Gallagher Bassett to help our self-insured clients. So -- and then if you just get down into our retail business globally, I think a close partnership with the Willis and Gallagher Re, reinsurers will come up with much -- with considerably more creative ideas.
I believe in our culture, where creative ideas get pursued. I think that will help us grow better together. So I don't think there's any fantasy in what Pat was saying."

I think an organic, much like this year, next year in that 9% to 10% range is possible, 8%, 9%, 10% range. What will margins do next year? Well, some of that depends on how much further cost return to our structure that haven't yet returned to our structure. Remember, we have a pretty low cost basis still in the first quarter of '21. So that will revert to next quarter in '21 also. So that will put a little pressure on the year-over-year.
We're in the middle of our budget and planning cycle right now, Mark. I'll have a better answer for you on that in December. But if we're pumping out organic growth, pushing 10% next year, there's still opportunities for us to take some of that to the bottom line. How much is that going to improve margin next year? Give me until December to figure that out."
