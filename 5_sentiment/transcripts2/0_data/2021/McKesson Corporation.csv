288195,699656225,2188206,"McKesson Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Holly, and good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us on our call today. Before I get to our third quarter results, I'd like to update you on the status of discussions related to a framework proposed by a group of attorneys-general",2867,"Thank you, Holly, and good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us on our call today. 
Before I get to our third quarter results, I'd like to update you on the status of discussions related to a framework proposed by a group of attorneys-general for a broad resolution of opioid-related claims. 
In the third quarter, we made an accrual of approximately $8.1 billion, reflecting the amount we would expect to pay over a period of 18 years for opioid-related claims of governmental entities, with more than 90% intended to remediate the opioid crisis. We continue to be an ongoing advanced discussions with state attorneys-general and counsel for plaintiffs. And based on the substantial progress we have made toward a settlement, we determined it was appropriate to accrue for this liability. Although we're prepared to defend ourselves vigorously, we remain hopeful that a broad resolution can be achieved, which would accelerate relief efforts for the people and communities impacted by this public health crisis. 
Now let's get to the results. 
We're pleased to report third quarter total company revenues of $62.6 billion and an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.60, which is ahead of the prior year and the revised expectations we laid out in November. 
The third quarter was yet another example of the often unpredictable and dynamic nature of the recovery from the effects of the pandemic. While heightened demand persisted for products like COVID-19 tests and PPE, medical visits and prescription volume trends did show some signs of softness in the quarter. Despite those macro trends, we're pleased to have grown adjusted operating profit across each of our segments. And our third quarter results reflect the important role McKesson plays in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and abroad. 
Our fundamentals remain strong, and we continue to see success across the differentiated assets in our broad portfolio. 
Today, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance range to $16.95 to $17.25 per diluted share. This is up from our previous range of $16 to $16.50 per diluted share. This update reflects our solid performance in the quarter and improved outlook across the business, including the anticipated contribution from our work distributing COVID-19 vaccines and assembling and distributing ancillary supply kit. 
Before turning to the business, I do want to expand on the work being done across McKesson in support of the COVID-19 vaccination efforts in the U.S. 
In August of last year, the CDC selected McKesson to ramp up and distribute future COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., expanding our 14-year partnership. The CDC exercised its existing option within our Vaccines For Children contract, making McKesson the centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer vaccines, similar to the role we played in the H1N1 pandemic over 10 years ago. Our team immediately got to work, standing up the infrastructure needed to support an initiative of this scale. We quickly established new fit-for-purpose distribution centers separate from our normal business operations, so that when vaccines became available for distribution, McKesson would be ready to execute our part. We have added 4 new distribution centers that are highly specialized and capable of frozen and refrigerated cold chain COVID-19 vaccine distribution. And given our work also includes the assembly and storage of ancillary supplies, several more DCs were brought online to support this additional work. In total, we've added over 3.3 million square feet of dedicated space to support this initiative. 
A little over a month ago, on December 18, Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine became the second COVID-19 vaccine granted emergency use authorization by the FDA. And given this vaccine is within the scope of our contact with the CDC, McKesson began distributing the vaccine within 48 hours of its authorization. Through January, McKesson has successfully distributed over 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines to sites around the country. From a distribution perspective, we remain on target to meet the U.S. government's plans to distribute hundreds of millions of refrigerated and frozen vaccine. We are currently distributing vaccines from only 2 of the 4 DCs built for this program. I'd like to remind you that in this operation, McKesson is operating as a third-party logistics provider on behalf of the U.S. government, which is similar to our role during H1N1. The U.S. government administers this program, allocating vaccines to states, pharmacy chains, federal agencies, et cetera, and takes orders for the participating provider site. Ultimately, the U.S. government makes all allocation decisions and decide what product is distributed, to what sites and in what quantities. The orders are submitted to McKesson. And when the orders are received, we pick, pack and ship orders typically within one business day of receiving the order. 
We are using the depth and breadth of our experience to manage the safe distribution of hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines to the entire country. We believe this distribution approach is the safest and fastest way to get COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of Americans across our countries. This is a complex distribution program with several partners collaborating from end-to-end, and McKesson takes extensive measures to maintain the safety and efficacy of the vaccine supply chain. Our goal is that every shipment be received at the administration site in a timely manner and within the specified guidelines established by the manufacturer. 
As I've discussed, our work as a centralized distributor is now underway. So earnings from the COVID-19 vaccine distribution program are factored into our improved outlook for fiscal 2021. 
McKesson has also been hard at work preparing and distributing the ancillary kits needed to administer all of the COVID-19 vaccines, including for the Pfizer Ultra frozen vaccine, even though Pfizer's vaccine itself is not distributed by McKesson. Each week, we are producing enough kits to support 10 million to 15 million doses. And to date, we have assembled enough kits to support over 250 million doses. 
It's our great privilege to have been selected to serve the U.S. government for these roles. And we've been engaged with the new administration's transition team and stand ready to fulfill our commitment in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.
Now let's get to the business. I'll summarize the third quarter and then turn it over to Britt to provide more details. 
Let me start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Prescription volume trends in the third quarter were again reflective of the nonlinear trajectory of the recovery. After seeing stability in the market trends in the second quarter, we saw some volume declines in our third quarter as it progressed, driven in part by a light cold and flu season versus the prior year. Despite some softness in volume trends within the quarter, we continued to see stability in brand and generic pricing. Through the third quarter and into January, branded price inflation has tracked in line with our original expectation. For generics, we continued to be disciplined in our approach to pricing in the market. On the buy side, through the scale and strength of our sourcing operation with ClarusONE, we've leveraged our relationships with a diverse set of manufacturers to main stable levels of supply at low cost for our customers throughout the pandemic. Strong pricing discipline and effective sourcing continue to allow us to earn spread in the business. While total prescription volume trends fluctuated in the quarter, specialty volumes and particularly oncology have been more resilient throughout the pandemic, our provider solutions and U.S. Oncology businesses have performed well year-to-date and our key areas of investment as we look to further differentiate our capabilities in oncology. 
In the quarter, the U.S. Oncology network continued to expand its reach into local communities by welcoming 2 new practices, further strengthening the availability of advanced cancer care across the communities we serve. U.S. Oncology also reached a major milestone in its journey to provide high-quality value-based care by enrolling its 100,000th patient in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Oncology Care Model. 
Lastly, our Health Mart franchises are expanding the role they play in the fight against the pandemic. Health Mart pharmacies have performed more than 400,000 COVID-19 test collections through a partnership with Eteno T.H. and the HHS. Many of our health Mart franchise pharmacies are also preparing to serve as COVID-19 vaccine administration sites in local communities when the CDC moves into the next phase of the rollout. 
Let's transition to our international statement. Our businesses in Europe and Canada are continuing to play their part in the pandemic response, and as essential businesses, our pharmacies remain open. Through our owned and banner stores abroad, we're working with local governments to accelerate COVID-19 testing efforts. Our digital offerings like well.ca in Canada and Echo by Lloyd's pharmacy continue to grow quickly and expand their service offerings to meet the needs of patients. 
Also, as a reminder, on November 1, we completed the creation of a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, combining our German wholesale businesses. While it is still early days, we're excited about these teams coming together and the progress they are making. 
Let's turn to Medical. When we gave initial guidance for fiscal 2021, our alternate site customers were facing significant headwinds, with providers and surgery centers seeing sharp declines in office visits due to shelter-in-place guidelines. These dynamics were clearly reflected in our first quarter results, which were significantly down versus prior year. The pandemic continues to affect the needs of our customers in this market and how they operate today, who looks very different than it did 9 months ago. As our customers reopen and address COVID-19, the core business has recovered and returned to growth. Within one of the largest -- with one of the largest and most tenured sales forces in the industry, our primary and extended care teams work hard every day to ensure that our customers have the products and services they need to provide patient care, whether it's COVID-19 tests, PPE or pharmaceuticals. Investments we've made into our lab business over the last few years have given us additional expertise and reach around lab testing solutions. So as COVID testing emerged, we have been well positioned to expand our existing partnerships and quickly drive these products into the community provider channels. We strategically built this business to succeed at moments like this. We are the leader in distribution to the alternate site setting and offer a broad set of products and solutions to over 250,000 customers. The broad capabilities of this business position us well to quickly take advantage of new opportunities as they emerge and as customer demand evolve. I continue to be impressed at how our Medical business has responded to the rapid change in fiscal 2021. 
Turning now to Prescription Technology Solutions. We saw solid growth in the quarter, underpinned by the expansion of our brand support programs for our biopharma partners. We invest in innovation in this segment, and our results reflect positive contributions from our Prior Authorization Solutions and newer products like Access for More Patients, also known as AMP. AMP service offering is continuing to be recognized in the market, both by our biopharma customers and the industry. AMP recently signed on a full product portfolio for a top pharmaceutical company and was recognized as one of 2020's most innovative products in the health care and medical category according to Best In The Biz Awards, an honor voted on by top reporters and editors in North America. 
Taking a step back to reflect. It was over 2 years ago that we redefined our strategy, identifying the areas of oncology and biopharma services as key differentiators and areas of investment. We also set out to make the business simpler and more efficient, kicking off a comprehensive review of the company's operating and cost structure. Since then, we have been methodical in our actions as we work to build a connected ecosystem of assets across the enterprise, with the ultimate goal of creating innovative solutions that improve patient care delivery and drive incremental profit growth for the company. 
Through internal investments and M&A, we've built a powerful and scaled specialty business with deep oncology expertise. Today, we are the #1 distributor in community oncology. And the U.S. oncology network is the nation's largest network of its kind, with 1,400 independent physicians. 
Most recently, we launched Ontada, an internally developed technology and insights business dedicated to transforming the fight against cancer. Ontada builds off our existing capabilities and combines real-world data and research with the leading suite of technologies to help deliver innovative solutions that improve patient outcomes. Shortly after the launch of Ontada, Amgen and McKesson announced a strategic agreement to advance cancer care and improve outcomes by accelerating the development and access to life-changing medicine. 
Last quarter, I talked about the evolution of our Prescription Technology Solutions assets into the exciting business it is today. This business is a powerful biopharma commercial services business that enables over $5 billion in annual prescription savings for patients through innovation and next-generation patient access and adherence solutions. 
The strategic investments I've discussed have been powered in part by the successful efforts to streamline the business. We've centralized many back office functions in North America and Europe and have become smarter as an organization about how we spend and invest. We also continued to evaluate the portfolio and position the business for success. Last year, we successfully exited our position in Change Healthcare. And most recently, we created the joint venture in Germany with WBA. Further, we resegmented the business to better align us around our strategies and increased focus and speed throughout the organization. 
But underpinning everything we do is our continued focus on growing the core business, where fundamentals continue to be stable and execution has improved. Success in the core enables strong cash flow generation, which we can use to reinvest back into the business and return to our shareholders. 
While the pandemic has brought an unprecedented level of uncertainty, it has not paused our strategic priorities, and we will continue to invest to differentiate and innovate our service offerings to our customers. This has served us well throughout the pandemic as we responded to near-term demands from our customers, but it also positions the business to succeed in the long term. 
As we look forward to our fiscal 2022, I'd like to walk through some of the things we're thinking about. 
First and foremost, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present many unknowns. The trajectory of the virus can change quickly, accelerating in some communities and decelerating in others. The recovery from the pandemic is likely to continue to be nonlinear into fiscal 2022. But McKesson will continue to be part of the recovery, serving our customers and partners every step of the way. 
Secondly, our work distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies will ultimately be influenced by the number of vaccines that come to market, the percentage of the population that chooses to get vaccinated, the effectiveness of each vaccine and the duration of the centralized distribution model. These same dynamics are likely to have an impact on the levels of demand we see for products like COVID tests and PPE in fiscal 2022. 
And as I mentioned earlier, we have a new administration in Washington, and our teams have been working closely with the new administration's transition team and now emerging team to ensure that the proposed reforms support solutions to improve cost, quality and access. 
I'll reiterate that we continue to see stability in the core and strength in the underlying fundamentals of the business heading into fiscal 2022. We will continue to make strategic investments in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. 
So in summary. Through 9 months, each quarter of the current fiscal year has proven to be different one to the next, and the results we're sharing today reflect McKesson's ability to rise to the challenge and meet the evolving demands of our customers and partners. The pandemic has not put our strategy on hold, but has challenged us to continue to think differently and react more quickly against the dynamic macroeconomic backdrop. 
Before I close, I also want to touch on our commitment to our local and global communities. We're dedicated to doing our part to eliminate bias and promote equality. And we are proud to have been recently recognized as one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign for the eighth consecutive year. And we recently recruited Dr. Kelvin Baggett to newly created role of Chief Impact Officer, reporting to me, where he will be responsible for advancing our strategy and execution related to diversity, equity and inclusion, ESG and McKesson's overall social impact. We are excited to have Kelvin on the team. 
In the end, it all comes back to our people. The passion and the focus of our 80,000-plus employees are what make McKesson Special. And without them, the work we're doing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic would not be possible. My greatest thanks to them all. 
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Britt."

I'm pleased to speak to you about another solid quarter for McKesson. Against a dynamic and challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we continued to respond to the evolving demand brought on by the pandemic, leveraging the breadth and scale of our distribution and services capabilities. The underlying core business continues to be fundamentally sound. And we've built solid revenue, operating profit and cash flow momentum over the past several quarters, which continued in the December quarter. Our solid broad-based third quarter results reflect this momentum. 
Our demonstrated delivery of consistent and stable organic growth, combined with the execution of the vaccine and kidney programs with the U.S. government, are enabling us to further increase fiscal year 2021 guidance. As we mentioned during our first and second quarter earnings calls, we expected the nonlinear recovery from the effects of the pandemic to persist for the remainder of our fiscal year and likely into our fiscal 2022. We saw this uneven recovery play out in Q3. COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels. This led to some softening in recovery trends during the quarter. Prescription volumes were softer than the prior quarter. And primary care patient visits and elective procedures continued to remain below pre-COVID levels. 
Despite these challenges, in Q3, all segments delivered year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth. And year-to-date, adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 14% compared to the prior year. 
In the third quarter, we recognized a benefit from our work with the U.S. government for assembling and distributing ancillary supply kits needed to administer COVID-19 vaccine. And while not material to the quarter, we also began distributing the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in late December. 
Volumes for COVID related testing and personal protective equipment or PPE continued to remain high in our Medical segment, while the impacts of social distancing measures have resulted in a soft cold and flu season. According to IQVIA, U.S. adult food diagnoses were down approximately 10% compared to the prior year,, which resulted in a lower generic flu scripts. And similar to last quarter, in the third quarter, we recognized unplanned gains on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. 
Now on to our third quarter results, which can be found in the Investors section of our website.
And let me start by pointing out 2 items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. Based on the settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities is now probable and can be reasonably estimated. And as a result, we recorded a pretax charge of $8.1 billion, $6.7 billion after tax. Secondly, we recorded a pretax long-lived asset impairment charge of $115 million, primarily related to McKesson's retail pharmacy businesses in Canada and Europe. 
Let's move now to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the third quarter, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. 
Consolidated revenues of $62.6 billion were up 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to market growth, higher specialty volumes in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and COVID-related volumes in our Medical business, including COVID tests and PPE. This was partially offset by branded to generic conversions and the contribution of our German wholesale through a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Adjusted gross profit increased 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in our] growth in our Medical-Surgical segment, which once again benefited from the contribution of near-term opportunities, including distribution of COVID-19 tests and our work assembling ancillary supply kits for COVID-19 vaccine. 
Adjusted operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year. Turns across the business, partially offset by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, and a reduction in operating expenses due to the impact of COVID-19. 
Adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. When excluding the $51 million contributed by Change Healthcare in the prior year, which was previously recorded in Other, adjusted operating profit grew 18%, exceeding our expectations. Interest expense was $55 million in the quarter, a decline of 14% compared to the prior year, which was driven by lower commercial paper balances and the retirement of approximately $1 billion of debt. We now expect fiscal 2021 interest expense in the range of $210 million to $230 million. Our adjusted tax rate was 21.6% for the quarter, and we continue to assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%. 
Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.60, which was up 21% in the quarter compared to the prior year, driven by a lower share count in the prior year, driven by a lower share count and growth in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. These items were partially offset by a higher tax rate and the lapping of the prior year contribution from the company's investment in Change Healthcare. Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $30 million or $0.14 per diluted share, which is associated with McKesson's ventures equity investment. 
Wrapping up our consolidated results. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares were 161 million, a decrease of 10% year-over-year, driven by the successful tax-free exit of our investment in Change Healthcare at the end of fiscal 2020, which lowered our shares outstanding by approximately 15 point million shares and in addition to share repurchase activity in the current and prior year. We now expect diluted weighted shares outstanding for fiscal 2021 to be approximately 162 million. 
And next, I'll review our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 5 through 9, starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where revenues were $49.5 billion, up 7%, driven by market growth and higher specialty volumes, partially offset by branded generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 2% to $656 million, driven by growth in Specialty, partially offset by higher operating expenses in support of our strategic growth initiatives, including Ontada. These investments accounted for an approximate 2% headwind to year-over-year segment growth. Our segment results were also negatively impacted by the light cold flu season. Given the timing of FDA approval of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine in December, earnings related to the vaccines distribution were immaterial in the third quarter. I'll provide more detail on our outlook related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution later in my remarks. 
And for the third quarter, branded price activity trended in line with our expectations. Additionally, based on manufacturer price actions taken in January, we are maintaining our full year fiscal 2021 assumption of branded price increases to be in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
Next, International. Revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues decreased 10%, primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the newly formed joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was effective as of November 1, 2020. The segment also had lower volumes in the Canadian Pharmaceutical distribution business, largely due to the exit of an unprofitable customer at the beginning of the fiscal year. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 4% year-over-year and was flat on an FX-adjusted basis. Adjusted operating profit increased 9% year-over-year to $158 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $150 million, primarily driven by 2 additional sell days in the European business compared to the prior year. 
Now moving on to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Our Medical-Surgical segment continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced strong demand for COVID-19 tests throughout the quarter and often unpredictable and uneven levels of demand related to PPE. We're also pleased to have delivered solid growth in the core business despite patient mobility trailing pre-COVID levels. Our customers have been resilient throughout the pandemic. And we're supporting providers and their patients with the breadth of our primary and extended care capabilities, such as lab solutions, private brands and patient home delivery. Similar to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, Q3 results were also impacted by the light colder flu season, and we expect this to continue throughout the remainder of our fiscal year. Revenues were $3.1 billion in the quarter, up 43%, primarily driven by demand for COVID-19 tests in the primary and extended care businesses. As we discussed on the second quarter call, our Medical-Surgical business built supply quickly to meet demands from our customers for COVID-19 tests and elevated levels of demand for PPE. This elevated and uneven demand is reflected again in our third quarter results, as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels, impacting patient mobility and elective procedures, which were down 15% to 20% at times in the quarter according to IQVIA. Throughout the pandemic, and as always, our focus has been meeting the needs of our customers and their patients, providing access to the supplies, including PPE, that they need to continue to treat patients. Early on, we procured these products in a highly volatile market, with unpredictable supply and demand levels due to the impacts of the pandemic. Due to these dynamics, some PPE and related items experienced inventory charges. In our third quarter, we recorded $35 million of charges related to these products. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 52% to $279 million, driven by demand for COVID-19 tests and the contribution from the keeping and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by the inventory charges on certain PPE-related products. Excluding the impact of the incremental PPE and COVID-19 test, adjusted operating profit in the segment is up 29% year-over-year in the third quarter. 
Next, Prescription Technology Solutions. Revenues were $777 million, an increase of 9%, driven by new and higher volumes of existing brand support programs. Adjusted operating profit increased 27% to $131 million, driven by organic growth in the business. While we continue to invest in the expansion of our technology offerings for our biopharma customers, we are starting to recognize the benefits of these investments, such as our investment in AMP, which Brian discussed earlier. 
Moving on to Corporate. McKesson recorded $158 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the quarter, a decrease of 6% year-over-year, driven by gains of approximately $30 million on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. This was partially offset by an increase in employee expenses as well as lower interest income. This quarter, we had fair value adjustments related to several of our portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, it's difficult to predict when gains or losses on our venture portfolio companies may occur. And therefore, our practice has been and will continue to be not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our guidance. 
And finally, we reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $34 million in the quarter. And for fiscal 2021, we anticipate that opioid-related costs will be approximately $160 million. 
Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 11. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.6 billion. And for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we generated free cash flow of $745 million. Our working capital metrics can result in free cash flow vary from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. In fiscal '21, our cash flow dynamics have also been impacted by changing levels of customer demand. In Q3, we again saw higher levels of inventory, resulting primarily from increased quantities of COVID tests and PPE. As we work to meet the evolving needs of our customers and ramp up our work with the U.S. government, we may experience additional working capital volatility. 
Year-to-date, we made $427 million of capital expenditures, includes internal investments to support our COVID-19 vaccine and kitting efforts and technology, data and analytics investments to support our strategic initiatives of Oncology and Biopharma Services. 
For the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we returned $709 million of cash to our shareholders through $500 million of share repurchases and the payment of $209 million in dividends. 
Let me now turn to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2021. The COVID-19 virus and effects of the pandemic continue to impact our communities in different ways. The sharp declines across our businesses in the first quarter, followed by a more positive trajectory through our second quarter, indicated signs of stabilization. However, the third quarter was another good example of the nonlinear shape of the recovery that we've been talking about all year, as increased case counts and hospitalizations led to a softening of the trends in the third quarter. 
2 important assumptions have underpinned our guidance throughout fiscal 2021, and we're reiterating those today. First, we do not assume a new wave of COVID-19 which would lead to shelter at home and economic lockdown, which would preclude patient mobility and consumption of health care services. And second, we do not assume any systemic customer insolvency event. 
I'd also like to reiterate that we believe that the recovery will take longer than initially anticipated and will not be in a straight line as the impacts of the pandemic will persist into our fiscal 2022. Further, we do expect that there will continue to be significant volatility in the demand and ultimate volume levels for COVID-19 test kits and PPE. Through our third quarter, we've seen elevated levels of these product categories. However, we do expect these dynamic volumes will moderate. Also, given there is now an approved COVID-19 vaccine that is within the scope of McKesson's contract, our guidance now takes into account earnings related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution, in accordance with the distribution schedule provided to McKesson by the CDC. 
As a result of our solid third quarter performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, which now includes estimated earnings tied to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, we are increasing and narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $16.95 to $17.25 from our previous range of $16 to $16.50. We continue to anticipate consolidated revenues to increase between 2% to 4% for fiscal 2021. And we now expect the consolidated adjusted operating profit will grow 7% to 9% for the full year, excluding the results of Change Healthcare from the prior year, which is up from our prior guidance of an increase between 2% and 6%. 
Now moving to the segments. 
In our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we continue to expect revenue growth of 3% to 6% and now expect adjusted operating profit to grow 2% to 5% compared to the prior year. We've included in our guidance the net benefit to fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.25 to $0.35 related to our role as the centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccine. This range is dependent on a number of factors, which includes final vaccine distribution volumes and product mix as directed by the CDC. 
I would also remind you of our continued commitment to invest in and extend our leading position in Oncology, where we are making incremental investments in the second half of fiscal 2021, which equates to a headwind of approximately $0.05 to $0.10 of adjusted EPS for fiscal 2021. 
In our International segment, we now expect a revenue decline of 5% to 9% year-over-year and segment adjusted operating profit to be 1% to 3% growth. 
Let me now turn to Medical-Surgical The shifting pattern and recovery path of COVID-19 remains a pivotable variable within the Medical-Surgical supply market. As I referenced earlier, throughout the third quarter, we continued to see elevated levels of demand for COVID-19 test kits and PPE. We expect to see shift in volumes, which we anticipate will moderate. We expect these sales to be a near-term opportunity in the segment, and elevated levels of demand are factored into our guidance for the remainder of our fiscal year. During the quarter, we expanded our contract with HHS for the assembly and storage of COVID-19 ancillary supply kit and also contracted with Pfizer to distribute ancillary kits directed to administration sites on their behalf. Due to this expanded scope, we now expect a benefit of approximately $0.20 to $0.30 in FY '21 related to the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, we now expect fiscal 2021 Medical-Surgical segment revenue to increase between 27% and 32%. And as a result of our improved third quarter performance and outlook, including the increase in our expected contribution from the kitting and distribution of ancillary vaccine supplies, we now expect adjusted operating profit will grow in the range of 29% to 37%. 
In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we expect revenue to grow 5% to 8% and now expect adjusted operating profit to be approximately flat to the prior year. And finally, we now expect corporate expenses in the range of $645 million to $685 million. 
Let me wrap up our outlook with capital deployment. We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. As a reminder, we historically have generated the majority of our cash in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. This strong cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach, investing in our strategies of Oncology and Biopharma Services, positioning our business for long-term growth, while remaining committed to return capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Our investment-grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility. In Q3, we utilized a portion of our free cash flow to retire approximately $1 billion of debt, and we issued a $500 million bond at attractive market rates. These actions, which were in line with our stated intent to modestly delever, further strengthened our balance sheet and our financial position. 
In closing, we're pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter and we feel confident in our updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. I'm proud of our focus and execution across the business despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Investing in the strategies we've outlined remains a priority, as we drive further differentiation in our positions in Oncology and Biopharma Services, as evidenced by our continued investment in Ontada. As a proud partner of the U.S. government and the COVID-19 vaccine effort, we look forward to continuing our role in the pandemic response, working to get vaccines and ancillary supplies into the communities that need them. 
And with that, Holly, let me turn the call back over to you for Q&A."

We have built capacity to ramp up to provide hundreds of millions of doses. And we think it's the fastest, safest way. And by that, I mean it's the least time from the time an order is delivered to that vaccine arriving at a provider site. It's the least handoffs and handling and chances for temperature excursions or lost product or damaged product. So in essence, it's going to allow us to get the very -- the maximum amount of doses out of what is produced and available from the manufacturers in the fastest time. 
Now to the extent we can find ways to be faster, we're open for any idea. Make no mistake, our goal is to get this product to into patients' arms as quickly as we can so that we can get this country vaccinated and back to a more normal environment."

And then, Britt, I don't know if you want to start down your list -- our list of puts and takes?"

I mean I really start with what I think are some strengths and some tailwinds in the business, and we've talked about these really over the last several quarters now.

I mean I really start with what I think are some strengths and some tailwinds in the business, and we've talked about these really over the last several quarters now. We've had good momentum for several quarters now where we're seeing organic growth, and Q3 is a good example of that where each of our operating segments grew over the prior year. We would expect that our -- the fundamentals of our business are -- will continue to be solid and sound. And we're starting to see some benefits from some of the investments that we're making. Brian talked about AMP. And clearly, we've talked about the investments we're making in Ontada. So the strategies and the investments in Oncology and Biopharma Services, I would expect, will continue to be strengths of ours. Obviously, the breadth of our Medical business, as we talked about earlier, the breadth of our customers, the breadth of services and capabilities across private brand and lab will continue to be strong for us. So I think as you look across our operating segments, we have a lot of good momentum and strength. We have a very strong balance sheet. As Brian just mentioned, we've seen consistent cash flow. 
From a headwinds perspective, I think it will really be how long does the pandemic persist and the unevenness and unpredictability of that. I think that will be the thing that we will be challenged with. But as you've seen from our results this year, we've been able to manage through that quite well and take down some near-term opportunities at the same time."

288195,699656225,2188373,"McKesson Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Holly, and good morning, everybody.

Before I get to our third quarter results, I'd like to update you on the status of discussions related to a framework proposed by a group of attorneys general fo",2865,"Thank you, Holly, and good morning, everybody. Appreciate you joining us on our call today. 
Before I get to our third quarter results, I'd like to update you on the status of discussions related to a framework proposed by a group of attorneys general for a broad resolution of opioid-related claims. In the third quarter, we made an accrual of approximately $8.1 billion, reflecting the amount we would expect to pay over a period of 18 years for opioid-related claims of governmental entities, with more than 90% intended to remediate the opioid crisis. We continue to be on ongoing advanced discussions with state attorneys general and counsel for plaintiffs, and based on the substantial progress we have made toward a settlement, we determined it was appropriate to accrue for this liability. Although we're prepared to defend ourselves vigorously, we remain hopeful that a broad resolution can be achieved, which would accelerate relief efforts for the people and communities impacted by this public health crisis. 
Now let's get to the results. We're pleased to report third quarter total company revenues of $62.6 billion and an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.60, which is ahead of the prior year and the revised expectations we laid out in November. The third quarter was yet another example of the often unpredictable and dynamic nature of the recovery from the effects of the pandemic. 
While heightened demand persisted for products like COVID-19 tests and PPE, medical visits and prescription volume trends did show some signs of softness in the quarter. Despite those macro trends, we're pleased to have grown adjusted operating profit across each of our segments, and our third quarter results reflect the important role McKesson plays in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and abroad. Our fundamentals remain strong, and we continue to see success across the differentiated assets in our broad portfolio. 
Today, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance range to $16.95 to $17.25 per diluted share. This is up from our previous range of $16 to $16.50 per diluted share. This update reflects our solid performance in the quarter and improved outlook across the business, including the anticipated contribution from our work distributed -- distributing COVID-19 vaccines and assembling and distributing ancillary supply kits. 
Before turning to the business, I do want to expand on the work being done across McKesson in support of the COVID-19 vaccination efforts in the U.S. In August of last year, the CDC selected McKesson to ramp up and distribute future COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., expanding our 14-year partnership. The CDC exercised its existing option within our Vaccines For Children contract, making McKesson a centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer vaccines, similar to the role we played in the H1N1 pandemic over 10 years ago. 
Our team immediately got to work, standing up the infrastructure needed to support an initiative of this scale. We quickly established new fit-for-purpose distribution centers separate from our normal business operations so that when vaccines became available for distribution, McKesson would be ready to execute our part. We have added 4 new distribution centers that are highly specialized and capable of frozen and refrigerated cold chain COVID-19 vaccine distribution. And given our work also includes the assembly and storage of ancillary supplies, several more DCs were brought online to support this additional work. In total, we've added over 3.3 million square feet of dedicated space to support this initiative. 
A little over a month ago, on December 18, Moderna's  COVID-19 vaccine became the second COVID-19 vaccine granted emergency use authorization by the FDA. And given this vaccine is within the scope of our contract with the CDC, McKesson began distributing this vaccine within 48 hours of its authorization. Through January, McKesson has successfully distributed over 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines to sites around the country. 
From a distribution perspective, we remain on target to meet the U.S. government's plans to distribute hundreds of millions of refrigerated and frozen vaccine. We are currently distributing vaccines from only 2 of the 4 DCs built for this program. I'd like to remind you that in this operation, McKesson is operating as a third-party logistics provider on behalf of the U.S. government, which is similar to our role during H1N1. 
The U.S. government administers this program allocating vaccines to states, pharmacy chains, federal agencies, et cetera, and takes orders for the participating provider site. Ultimately, the U.S. government makes all allocation decisions and decides what product is distributed to what sites and in what quantities. The orders are submitted to McKesson, and when the orders are received, we pick, pack and ship orders typically within 1 business day of receiving the order.  We are using the depth and breadth of our experience to manage the safe distribution of hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines to the entire country. 
We believe this distribution approach is the safest and fastest way to get COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of Americans across our countries. This is a complex distribution program with several partners collaborating from end to end, and McKesson takes extensive measures to maintain the safety and efficacy of the vaccine supply chain. Our goal is that every shipment be received at the administration site in a timely manner and within the specified guidelines established by the manufacturer. As I've discussed, our work as a centralized distributor is now underway, so earnings from the COVID-19 vaccine distribution program are factored into our improved outlook for fiscal 2021. 
Mckesson has also been hard at work preparing and distributing the ancillary kits needed to administer all of the COVID-19 vaccines, including for the Pfizer ultra-frozen vaccine, even though Pfizer's vaccine itself is not distributed by McKesson. Each week, we are producing enough kits to support 10 million to 15 million doses. And to date, we have assembled enough kits to support over 250 million doses. It's our great privilege to have been selected to serve the U.S. government for these roles, and we've been engaged with the new administration's transition team and stand ready to fulfill our commitment in the ongoing battle against COVID-19. 
Now let's get to the business. I'll summarize the third quarter and then turn it over to Britt to provide more details.  
Let me start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Prescription volume trends in the third quarter were again reflective of the nonlinear trajectory of the recovery. After seeing stability in the market trends in the second quarter, we saw some volume declines in our third quarter as it progressed, driven in part by a light cold and flu season versus the prior year. 
Despite some softness in volume trends within the quarter, we continued to see stability in branded and generic pricing. Through the third quarter and into January, branded price inflation has tracked in line with our original expectation. For generics, we continue to be disciplined in our approach to pricing in the market. 
On the buy side, through the scale and strength of our sourcing operation with ClarusONE, we've leveraged our relationships with a diverse set of manufacturers to maintain stable levels of supply at low cost for our customers throughout the pandemic. 
Strong pricing discipline and effective sourcing continue to allow us to earn spread in the business. 
While total prescription volume trends fluctuated in the quarter, specialty volumes and particularly oncology have been more resilient throughout the pandemic. Our provider solutions and U.S. oncology businesses have performed well year-to-date and are key areas of investment as we look to further differentiate our capabilities in oncology.  
In the quarter, the U.S. Oncology Network continued to expand its reach into local communities by welcoming 2 new practices, further strengthening the availability of advanced cancer care across the communities we serve. U.S. Oncology also reached a major milestone in its journey to provide high-quality value-based care by enrolling its 100,000th patient in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Oncology Care Model.  
Lastly, our Health Mart franchises are expanding the role they play in the fight against the pandemic. Health Mart pharmacies have performed more than 400,000 COVID-19 test collections through a partnership with eTrueNorth and the HHS. Many of our Health Mart franchise pharmacies are also preparing to serve as COVID-19 vaccine administration sites in local communities when the CDC moves into the next phase of the rollout.  
Let's transition to our International segment. Our businesses in Europe and Canada are continuing to play their part in the pandemic response, and as essential businesses, our pharmacies remain open. Through our owned and banner stores abroad, we're working with local governments to accelerate COVID-19 testing efforts. 
Our digital offerings like Well.ca in Canada and Echo by LloydsPharmacy continue to grow quickly and expand their service offerings to meet the needs of patients. Also, as a reminder, on November 1, we completed the creation of a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, combining our German wholesale businesses. While it is still early days, we're excited about these teams coming together and the progress they are making.  
Let's turn to medical. When we gave initial guidance for fiscal 2021, our alternate-site customers were facing significant headwinds with providers and surgery centers seeing sharp declines in office visits due to shelter-in-place guidelines. These dynamics were clearly reflected in our first quarter results, which were significantly down versus prior year. The pandemic continues to affect the needs of our customers in this market, and how they operate today looks very different than it did 9 months ago. As our customers reopened and addressed COVID-19, the core business has recovered and returned to growth. 
Within one of the largest -- with one of the largest and most tenured sales forces in the industry, our primary and extended care teams work hard every day to ensure that our customers have the products and services they need to provide patient care, whether it's COVID-19 tests, PPE or pharmaceuticals. Investments we've made into our lab business over the last few years have given us additional expertise and reach around lab testing solutions. So as COVID testing emerged, we have been well positioned to expand our existing partnerships and quickly drive these products into the community provider channels. We strategically built this business to succeed at moments like this. 
We are the leader in distribution to the alternate-site setting and offer a broad set of products and solutions to over 250,000 customers. The broad capabilities of this business position us well to quickly take advantage of new opportunities as they emerge and as customer demand evolve. I continue to be impressed at how our medical business has responded to the rapid change in fiscal 2021.  
Turning now to Prescription Technology Solutions. We saw solid growth in the quarter underpinned by the expansion of our brand support programs for our biopharma partners. We invest in innovation in this segment, and our results reflect positive contributions from our prior authorization solutions and newer products like Access for More Patients, also known as AMP. AMP service offering is continuing to be recognized in the market, both by our biopharma customers and the industry. AMP recently signed on a full product portfolio for a top pharmaceutical company and was recognized as one of 2020's most innovative products in the health care and medical category according to Best in Biz Awards, an honor voted on by top reporters and editors in North America.  
Taking a step back to reflect. It was over 2 years ago that we redefined our strategy, identifying the areas of oncology and biopharma services as key differentiators and areas of investment. We also set out to make the business simpler and more efficient, kicking off a comprehensive review of the company's operating and cost structure. Since then, we have been methodical in our actions as we work to build a connected ecosystem of assets across the enterprise, with the ultimate goal of creating innovative solutions that improve patient care delivery and drive incremental profit growth for the company.  
Through internal investments and M&A, we've built a powerful and scaled specialty business with deep oncology expertise. Today, we are the #1 distributor in community oncology. And the U.S. Oncology Network is the nation's largest network of its kind, with 1,400 independent physicians. 
Most recently, we launched Ontada, an internally developed technology and insights business dedicated to transforming the fight against cancer. Ontada builds off our existing capabilities and combines real-world data and research with a leading suite of technologies to help deliver innovative solutions that improve patient outcomes. Shortly after the launch of Ontada, Amgen and McKesson announced a strategic agreement to advance cancer care and improve outcomes by accelerating the development and access to life-changing medicine.  
Last quarter, I talked about the evolution of our Prescription Technology Solutions assets into the exciting business it is today. This business is a powerful biopharma commercial services business that enables over $5 billion in annual prescription savings for patients through innovation and next-generation patient access and adherence solutions. The strategic investments I've discussed have been powered in part by the successful efforts to streamline the business. We've centralized many back-office functions in North America and Europe and have become smarter as an organization about how we spend and invest. 
We also continued to evaluate the portfolio and position the business for success. Last year, we successfully exited our position in Change Healthcare. And most recently, we created the joint venture in Germany with WBA. Further, we resegmented 
the business to better align us around our strategies and increase focus and speed throughout the organization.  
But underpinning everything we do is our continued focus on growing the core business, where fundamentals continue to be stable and execution has improved. Success in the core enables strong cash flow generation, which we can use to reinvest back into the business and return to our shareholders. While the pandemic has brought an unprecedented level of uncertainty, it has not paused our strategic priorities, and we will continue to invest to differentiate and innovate our service offerings to our customers. This has served us well throughout the pandemic as we responded to near-term demands from our customers, but it also positions the business to succeed in the long term.  
As we look forward to our fiscal 2022, I'd like to walk through some of the things we're thinking about. First and foremost, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present many unknowns. The trajectory of the virus can change quickly, accelerating in some communities and decelerating in others. The recovery from the pandemic is likely to continue to be nonlinear into fiscal 2022. But McKesson will continue to be part of the recovery, serving our customers and partners every step of the way.  
Secondly, our work distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies will ultimately be influenced by the number of vaccines that come to market, the percentage of the population that chooses to get vaccinated, the effectiveness of each vaccine and the duration of the centralized distribution model. These same dynamics are likely to have an impact on the levels of demand we see for products like COVID tests and PPE in fiscal 2022. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a new administration in Washington, and our teams have been working closely with the new administration's transition team and now emerging team to ensure that the proposed reforms support solutions to improve cost, quality and access.  
I'll reiterate that we continue to see stability in the core and strength in the underlying fundamentals of the business heading into fiscal 2022. We will continue to make strategic investments in the areas of oncology and biopharma services.  
So in summary, through 9 months, each quarter of the current fiscal year has proven to be different one to the next, and the results we're sharing today reflect McKesson's ability to rise to the challenge and meet the evolving demands of our customers and partners. The pandemic has not put our strategy on hold but has challenged us to continue to think differently and react more quickly against the dynamic macroeconomic backdrop.  
Before I close, I also want to touch on our commitment to our local and global communities. We're dedicated to doing our part to eliminate bias and promote equality, and we are proud to have been recently recognized as one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign for the eighth consecutive year. And we recently recruited Dr. Kelvin Baggett to the newly created role of Chief Impact Officer, reporting to me, where he will be responsible for advancing our strategy and execution related to diversity, equity and inclusion, ESG and McKesson's overall social impact. We are excited to have Kelvin on the team.  
In the end, it all comes back to our people. The passion and the focus of our 80,000-plus employees are what makes McKesson special. And without them, the work we're doing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic would not be possible. My greatest thanks to them all.  
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Britt."

I'm pleased to speak to you about another solid quarter for McKesson. Against a dynamic and challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we continued to respond to the evolving demand brought on by the pandemic, leveraging the breadth and scale of our distribution and services capabilities. 
The underlying core business continues to be fundamentally sound, and we've built solid revenue, operating profit and cash flow momentum over the past several quarters, which continued in the December quarter. Our solid broad-based third quarter results reflect this momentum. Our demonstrated delivery of consistent and stable organic growth, combined with the execution of the vaccine and kitting programs of the U.S. government, are enabling us to further increase fiscal year 2021 guidance. 
As we mentioned during our first and second quarter earnings calls, we expected the nonlinear recovery from the effects of the pandemic to persist for the remainder of our fiscal year and likely into our fiscal 2022. We saw this uneven recovery play out in Q3. COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels. This led to some softening in recovery trends during the quarter. 
Prescription volumes were softer than the prior quarter, and primary care patient visits and elective procedures continued to remain below pre-COVID levels. Despite these challenges, in Q3, all segments delivered year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth. And year-to-date, adjusted earnings per diluted share grew 14% compared to the prior year. 
In the third quarter, we recognized a benefit from our work with the U.S. government for assembling and distributing ancillary supply kits needed to administer COVID-19 vaccine. And while not material to the quarter, we also began distributing the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in late December. Volumes for COVID-related testing and personal protective equipment or PPE continued to remain high in our medical segment while the impacts of social distancing measures have resulted in a soft cold and flu season.  
According to IQVIA, U.S. adult flu diagnoses were down approximately 10% compared to the prior year, which resulted in lower generic flu scripts. And similar to last quarter, in the third quarter, we recognized unplanned gains on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. 
Now on to our third quarter results which can be found in the Investors section of our website. And let me start by pointing out 2 items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. Based on the substantial progress toward a settlement of our ongoing opioid-related claims, we've concluded that a broad settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities is now probable and can be reasonably estimated. And as a result, we recorded a pretax charge of $8.1 billion, $6.7 billion after tax. Secondly, we recorded a pretax long-lived asset impairment charge of $115 million, primarily related to McKesson's retail pharmacy businesses in Canada and Europe.  
Let's move now to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the third quarter, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4.  Consolidated revenues of $62.6 billion were up 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to market growth, higher specialty volumes in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and COVID-related volumes in our medical business, including COVID tests and PPE. This was partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions and the contribution of our German wholesale business through joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance.
Adjusted gross profit increased 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in our Medical-Surgical segment, which once again benefited from the contribution of near-term opportunities, including distribution of COVID-19 tests and our work assembling ancillary supply kits for COVID-19 vaccines. Adjusted operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year, led by higher operating expenses to support growth in strategic investments across the business partially offset by the contribution of our German wholesale business through the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance and a reduction in operating expenses due to the impact of COVID-19.  
Adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. When excluding the $51 million contributed by Change Healthcare in the prior year, which was previously recorded in other, adjusted operating profit grew 18%, exceeding our expectations. 
Interest expense was $55 million in the quarter, a decline of 14% compared to the prior year, which was driven by lower commercial paper balances and the retirement of approximately $1 billion of debt. We now expect fiscal 2021 interest expense in the range of $210 million to $230 million. Our adjusted tax rate was 21.6% for the quarter, and we continue to assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 20%. 
Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.60, which was up 21% in the quarter compared to the prior year, driven by a lower share count and growth in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. These items were partially offset by a higher tax rate and the lapping of the prior year contribution from the company's investment in Change Healthcare. Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $30 million or $0.14 per diluted share, which is associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investment.  
Wrapping up our consolidated results. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares were 161 million, a decrease of 10% year-over-year, driven by the successful tax-free exit of our investment in Change Healthcare at the end of fiscal 2020, which lowered our shares outstanding by approximately 15 million (sic) [ 15.4 million ] shares and in addition to share repurchase activity in the current and prior year. We now expect diluted weighted shares outstanding for fiscal 2021 to be approximately 162 million.  
And next, I'll review our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 5 through 9. Starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where revenues were $49.5 billion, up 7%, driven by market growth and higher specialty volumes, partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 2% to $656 million, driven by growth in specialty partially offset by higher operating expenses in support of our strategic growth initiatives, including Ontada. These investments accounted for an approximate 2% headwind to year-over-year segment growth. 
Our segment results were also negatively impacted by the light cold and flu season. Given the timing of FDA approval of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine in December, earnings related to the vaccine's distribution were immaterial in the third quarter. I'll provide more detail on our outlook related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution later in my remarks.  
And for the third quarter, branded price activity trended in line with our expectations. Additionally, based on manufacturer price actions taken in January, we are maintaining our full year fiscal 2021 assumption of branded price increases to be in the mid-single-digit percent range.  
Next, International. Revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues decreased 10%, primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business through the newly formed joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was effective as of November 1, 2020. The segment also had lower volumes in the Canadian pharmaceutical distribution business largely due to the exit of an unprofitable customer at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 4% year-over-year and was flat on an FX-adjusted basis. Adjusted operating profit increased 9% year-over-year to $158 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $150 million, primarily driven by 2 additional sell days in the European business compared to the prior year.  
Now moving on to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Our Medical-Surgical segment continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced strong demand for COVID-19 tests throughout the quarter and often unpredictable and uneven levels of demand related to PPE. We're also pleased to have delivered solid growth in the core business despite patient mobility trailing pre-COVID levels. 
Our customers have been resilient throughout the pandemic, and we're supporting providers and their patients with the breadth of our primary and extended care capabilities, such as lab solutions, private brands and patient home delivery. Similar to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, Q3 results were also impacted by the light cold and flu season, and we expect this to continue throughout the remainder of our fiscal year. Revenues were $3.1 billion in the quarter, up 43%, primarily driven by demand for COVID-19 tests in the primary and extended care businesses. 
As we discussed on the second quarter call, our Medical-Surgical business built supply quickly to meet demands from our customers for COVID-19 tests and elevated levels of demand for PPE. This elevated and uneven demand is reflected again in our third quarter results, as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels, impacting patient mobility and elective procedures, which were down 15% to 20% at times in the quarter according to IQVIA. Throughout the pandemic and as always, our focus has been meeting the needs of our customers and their patients, providing access to the supplies, including PPE, that they need to continue to treat patients. Early on, we procured these products in a highly volatile market, with unpredictable supply and demand levels due to the impacts of the pandemic. Due to these dynamics, some PPE and related items experienced inventory charges. In our third quarter, we recorded $35 million of charges related to these products. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 52% to $279 million, driven by demand for COVID-19 tests and the contribution from the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by the inventory charges on certain PPE-related products. Excluding the impact of the incremental PPE and COVID-19 tests, adjusted operating profit in the segment is up 29% year-over-year in the third quarter.  
Next, Prescription Technology Solutions. Revenues were $777 million, an increase of 9%, driven by new and higher volumes of existing brand support programs. Adjusted operating profit increased 27% to $131 million, driven by organic growth in the business. While we continue to invest in the expansion of our technology offerings for our biopharma customers, we are starting to recognize the benefits of these investments such as our investment in AMP, which Brian discussed earlier.  
Moving on to corporate. McKesson recorded $158 million in adjusted corporate expenses in the quarter, a decrease of 6% year-over-year, driven by gains of approximately $30 million on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. This was partially offset by an increase in employee expenses as well as lower interest income. 
This quarter, we had fair value adjustments related to several of our portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, it's difficult to predict when gains or losses on our venture portfolio companies may occur. And therefore, our practice has been and will continue to be not include ventures portfolio impacts in our guidance. And finally, we reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $34 million in the quarter, and for fiscal 2021, we anticipate that opioid-related costs will be approximately $160 million.  
Turning now to cash, which can be found on Slide 11. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.6 billion. And for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we generated free cash flow of $745 million. 
Our working capital metrics can result in free cash flow varying from quarter-to-quarter, impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. In fiscal '21, our cash flow dynamics have also been impacted by changing levels of customer demand. In Q3, we again saw higher levels of inventory, resulting primarily from increased quantities of COVID tests and PPE. As we work to meet the evolving needs of our customers and ramp up our work with the U.S. government, we may experience additional working capital volatility.  
Year-to-date, we made $427 million of capital expenditures, including internal investments to support our COVID-19 vaccine and kitting efforts and technology, data and analytics investments to support our strategic initiatives of oncology and biopharma services. For the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we returned $709 million of cash to our shareholders through $500 million of share repurchases and the payment of $209 million in dividends.  
Let me now turn to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2021. The COVID-19 virus and effects of the pandemic continue to impact our communities in different ways. The sharp declines across our businesses in the first quarter, followed by a more positive trajectory through our second quarter indicated signs of stabilization. However, the third quarter was another good example of the nonlinear shape of the recovery that we've been talking about all year as increased case counts and hospitalizations led to a softening of the trends in the third quarter.  
Two important assumptions have underpinned our guidance throughout fiscal 2021, and we're reiterating those today. First, we do not assume a new wave of COVID-19 which would lead to shelter at home and economic lockdown, which would preclude patient mobility and consumption of health care services. And second, we do not assume any systemic customer insolvency event. 
I'd also like to reiterate that we believe that the recovery will take longer than initially anticipated and will not be in a straight line as the impacts of the pandemic will persist into our fiscal 2022. Further, we do expect that there will continue to be significant volatility in the demand and ultimate volume levels for COVID-19 test kits and PPE. Through our third quarter, we've seen elevated levels of these product categories. However, we do expect these dynamic volumes will moderate. Also, given there is now an approved COVID-19 vaccine that is within the scope of McKesson's contract, our guidance now takes into account earnings related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution in accordance with the distribution schedule provided to McKesson by the CDC.  
As a result of our solid third quarter performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, which now includes estimated earnings tied to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, we are increasing and narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $16.95 to $17.25 from our previous range of $16 to $16.50. We continue to anticipate consolidated revenues to increase between 2% to 4% for fiscal 2021. And we now expect the consolidated adjusted operating profit will grow 7% to 9% for the full year, excluding the results of Change Healthcare from the prior year, which is up from our prior guidance of an increase between 2% and 6%.  
Now moving to the segments. In our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we continue to expect revenue growth of 3% to 6% and now expect adjusted operating profit to grow 2% to 5% compared to the prior year. We've included in our guidance the net benefit to fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.25 to $0.35 related to our role as the centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccine. This range is dependent on a number of factors, which includes final vaccine distribution volumes and product mix as directed by the CDC. 
I would also remind you of our continued commitment to invest in and extend our leading position in oncology, where we are making incremental investments in the second half of fiscal 2021, which equates to a headwind of approximately $0.05 to $0.10 of adjusted EPS for fiscal 2021. In our International segment, we now expect a revenue decline of 5% to 9% year-over-year and segment adjusted operating profit to be 1% to 3% growth.  
Let me now turn to Medical-Surgical. The shifting pattern and recovery path of COVID-19 remains a pivotable variable within the Medical-Surgical supply market. As I referenced earlier, throughout the third quarter, we continued to see elevated levels of demand for COVID-19 test kits and PPE. We expect to see shift in volumes, which we anticipate will moderate. We expect these sales to be a near-term opportunity in the segment, and elevated levels of demand are factored into our guidance for the remainder of our fiscal year. 
During the quarter, we expanded our contract with HHS for the assembly and storage of COVID-19 ancillary supply kits and also contracted with Pfizer to distribute ancillary kits directed by -- to administration sites on their behalf. Due to this expanded scope, we now expect a benefit of approximately $0.20 to $0.30 in FY '21 related to the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, we now expect fiscal 2021 Medical-Surgical segment revenue to increase between 27% and 32%. And as a result of our improved third quarter performance and outlook, including the increase in our expected contribution from the kitting and distribution of ancillary vaccine supplies, we now expect adjusted operating profit will grow in the range of 29% to 37%.  
In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we expect revenue to grow 5% to 8% and now expect adjusted operating profit to be approximately flat to the prior year. And finally, we now expect corporate expenses in the range of $645 million to $685 million.  
Let me wrap up our outlook with capital deployment. We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. As a reminder, we historically have generated the majority of our cash in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. This strong cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach, investing in our strategies of oncology and biopharma services, positioning our business for long-term growth while remaining committed to return capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. 
Our investment-grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility. In Q3, we utilized a portion of our free cash flow to retire approximately $1 billion of debt, and we issued a $500 million bond at attractive market rates. These actions, which were in line with our stated intent to modestly delever, further strengthened our balance sheet and our financial position.  
In closing, we're pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter, and we feel confident in our updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. I'm proud of our focus and execution across the business despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Investing in the strategies we've outlined remains a priority as we drive further differentiation in our positions in oncology and biopharma services, as evidenced by our continued investment in Ontada. As a proud partner of the U.S. government in the COVID-19 vaccine effort, we look forward to continuing our role in the pandemic response, working to get vaccines and ancillary supplies into the communities that need them.  
And with that, Holly, let me turn the call back over to you for Q&A."

I mean we are continuing to invest in this segment. And that investment in -- particularly in the area of oncology comes at the expense of a little bit of what could be operating profit growth, but we think that that's a very important investment to make for the long-term positioning and the long-term growth of the segment. So I think as a -- in general, everybody recognizes the cold and cough and flu season was a little bit lighter than what we would historically have seen, probably the result of the social responsibility, social distancing, mask-wearing measures.

So I think as this continues to persist, as our vaccine distribution begins to take hold, we feel comfortable that the business is stable and is showing good -- the fundamentals of it are strong and the growth is still there. And again, that allows us to continue to make investments for further growth going forward."

We have built capacity to ramp up to provide hundreds of millions of doses, and we think it's the fastest, safest way. And by that I mean it's the least time from the time an order is delivered to that vaccine arriving at a provider's site. It's the least handoffs and handling and chances for temperature excursions or lost product or damaged product. So in essence, it's going to allow us to get the very -- the maximum amount of doses out of what is produced and available from the manufacturers in the fastest time. 
Now to the extent we can find ways to be faster, we're open for any idea. Make no mistake, our goal is to get this product to -- into patients' arms as quickly as we can so that we can get this country vaccinated and back to a more normal environment."

And there's no question that as COVID test kits emerged on the scene -- remember, when we provided our guide at the beginning of this year, there wasn't such a thing as a COVID test. So as the scientific community, the lab community began to develop these tests, whether molecular, antigen, antibody, because of our existing business in the lab, we were really well positioned to help get those to market quickly and swiftly. And we have certainly benefited from the strong demand for COVID test kits."

We think we have a business that generates good cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet. We've had time to contemplate this. So I think, philosophically, our approach to capital deployment will not change. It will be a balance. 
We look to make internal investments that we think support growth in the business. We look to make growth investments in M&A where we can find targets that are aligned to our strategy and offer a financial return that makes sense vis-a-vis other ways we can deploy capital like buying back shares or paying a dividend.

Brian talked about AMP. And clearly, we've talked about the investments we're making in Ontada. 
So the strategies and the investments in oncology and biopharma services, I would expect, will continue to be strengths of ours. Obviously, the breadth of our medical business, as we talked about earlier, the breadth of our customers, the breadth of services and capabilities across private brand and lab will continue to be strong for us. So I think as you look across our operating segments, we have a lot of good momentum and strength. We have a very strong balance sheet, as Brian just mentioned. We've seen consistent cash flow. 
From a headwinds perspective, I think it will really be how long does the pandemic persist and the unevenness and unpredictability of that.

Thank you for joining us on our call this afternoon. On our fourth quarter call last year, I talked about how the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to impact our employees, our customers, our partners and the",2345,"Thank you, Holly, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us on our call this afternoon. On our fourth quarter call last year, I talked about how the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to impact our employees, our customers, our partners and the very communities in which we live. As one of the largest health care companies in the world, I said that McKesson would play an essential role in protecting the health and safety of the health care supply chain. 
While we were confident in our abilities to help our customers during challenging times, what played out over the course of the year proved to be more unpredictable than anyone could have imagined. The up and down trajectory of the recovery was certainly different than we had originally anticipated. And our role in the COVID-19 response efforts evolved and expanded quickly as a result. 
Fiscal 2021 was one of the most challenging yet fulfilling and inspiring years of my career, a year like no other in the 188-year history of our company. I want to thank the team McKesson and our innumerable public and private partners for their resilience, commitment to our values and service to our caregivers and patients. 
From the onset of the pandemic, our sourcing teams worked closely with manufacturers and various government entities to better forecast changing pharmaceutical and medical product demand in order to extend supply and channel inventory to critical areas of need. Whether it was working to secure higher volumes of PPE for caregivers and frontline workers early in the pandemic or leveraging our expertise and lab capabilities to ramp up distribution of COVID-19 tests as they came to market, McKesson moved quickly to support our customers, our partners and our communities. 
Our role in the COVID-19 response was also highlighted by our partnership with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort, having been selected as the centralized distributor of refrigerated and frozen COVID-19 vaccine and the ancillary kits used to administer those COVID-19 vaccines. 
We distributed our first COVID-19 vaccine in December, shortly after Moderna's vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. On February 27, Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine became the third COVID-19 vaccine granted EUA by the FDA and the second vaccine within the scope of our contract with the CDC. We began distributing the J&J vaccine within 48 hours of its authorization, and we're now distributing out of all 4 fit-for-purpose distribution centers we built for this program. We stand ready to support the distribution of additional vaccines as they come to market. 
Through April, we've successfully distributed over 150 million Moderna and J&J COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites in the U.S., and we remain on target with the U.S. government's distribution schedule. Also through April, we have assembled enough kits to support the administration of more than 550 million doses for all vaccine types. This work remains our company's top priority. And we are prepared to support the U.S. government for as long as they ask us to lead the centralized distribution model. 
In Europe and Canada, we are also partnering with the local governments in the COVID-19 vaccine effort through administration in our owned and banner pharmacies as well as distribution efforts in selected markets and countries. 
Let me turn now to our financial performance. Against the dynamic and challenging macroeconomic backdrop in fiscal 2021, we grew revenues 3%, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share result of $17.21 was up 15% over prior year. When pressed with challenges and uncertainties, our customers and government partners continued to choose McKesson to help ensure stability of supply for their patients. So while prescription volume and primary care patient visit trends negatively impacted the core business throughout the fiscal year, the strength of our business model and our differentiated capabilities help us to grow the business and deliver value to our shareholders. Our commitment to executing our strategy, transforming and simplifying the operating model contributed to these strong financial results. 
Looking forward into fiscal 2022. I'm confident that we operate in scaled and resilient markets with underlying trends that support long-term growth. We invest in our business to differentiate our solutions and create value for customers, patients and partners. The pandemic has not paused our progress on these strategic priorities. Targeted investments into our business over time have positioned us well to succeed and respond quickly to changing demands from our customers and government partners during these uncertain times. 
We've been focused on building out a connected ecosystem over the last several years in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. These are areas where we believe we have key differentiated capabilities. Through investments in technology, we've been able to develop more robust solutions that help connect patients, providers and manufacturers and support our growth. 
Starting first with our oncology assets, which have proven to be resilient throughout the pandemic. Through scaled distribution, GPO services in our U.S. Oncology business, we're positioned well as innovative therapies come to market. Biosimilars are just one example where McKesson has been able to combine the breadth and scale of our specialty capabilities to help give providers choice and lower costs for patients. 
We were pleased to add more practices and over 100 providers to the U.S. Oncology Network in fiscal 2021. Today, through U.S. Oncology and our nonaffiliated provider business, we're connected to over 10,000 specialty physicians. And our oncology technology platform has supported millions of patient journeys, providing us access to real-world outcomes, data and research. 
Our recently launched Technology and Real-World Insights business, which we call Ontada, is an extension of our oncology ecosystem and is a key area of investment for us going forward. We believe this business differentiates our value proposition to providers looking to drive better outcomes for their patients and to manufacturers focused on innovative therapies in the area of oncology. 
In terms of biopharma services, in fiscal 2021, we brought together our RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads businesses. Together, these businesses are focused on innovating and automating the ways in which biopharma connects with patients, pharmacies and providers with the ultimate goal of providing stronger access, affordability and better adherence outcomes. These assets embed us in the daily workflows of over 50,000 pharmacies and more than 750,000 providers. We're integrated into over 75% of EHRs today. And through our market-leading position and advanced solutions, we're able to automate and simplify otherwise very manual processes. 
Ultimately, our solutions help patients get on therapies quicker and stay on those therapies longer. This value proposition to our manufacturing partners is reflected by the over 500 brands we support today, covering nearly every therapeutic area. 
In fiscal 2022, we will remain focused on these growth areas, and we will continue to look for ways to streamline the business so that we can operate with added speed and increased focus. Part of our commitment to grow the business is to continually review and evaluate our portfolio. Sometimes we find assets we're not the natural owner of, as was the case with our German wholesale business, where we created a JV with Walgreens Boots Alliance in November. 
To further simplify the business, we continually evaluate and adapt the way in which we work. For McKesson, it's been over a year since we successfully transitioned all of our office-based employees to work from home seemingly overnight and without a loss of productivity. While we are quite anxious to see each other in person soon and at a time and place where it's appropriate and safe to do so, the success of our employees in this remote work environment and their desire for more work flexibility has challenged us to reevaluate the way we work and our real estate and existing office-based footprint. This is yet another example of how we're looking to simplify operations and grow the business and do the right thing for our teams. Britt will go into more detail about our thinking on these impacts going forward. 
Now let me turn to the business and touch on how we're positioned for success heading into fiscal 2022. I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where we again grew adjusted operating profit despite soft prescription volume trends throughout the fiscal year. Our priority in this business is to strengthen the core and deliver the world's highest-quality supply chain to our customers and manufacturing partners. Our focus on cost and working capital efficiencies underpin this growth and help fuel investments for growth across the business. 
For generics, the pricing environment continues to track in line with our expectations. On the buy side, we leverage our scale and our sourcing capabilities through ClarusONE to ensure stability of supply at low cost for our customers. On the sell side, McKesson has taken a disciplined approach to pricing, and the market continues to be competitive but has been stable for years. While generics volume remained below pre-COVID levels in the quarter, we expect volume improvement over the course of our fiscal year. 
I'm also pleased with the performance of our specialty business this past year. Our U.S. Oncology business, patient visits were at pre-COVID baselines in March, with many returning for in-person visits to their providers. In fiscal 2022, we'll look to grow both our U.S. Oncology and nonaffiliated businesses, which are just another part of our connected oncology ecosystem at McKesson. 
Let me talk about Prescription Technology Solutions. They performed well this year despite prescription volumes being down since the onset of the pandemic. We're continuing to invest in innovation in this business. And despite this year's challenges, we've been very successful in adding new brands to our platforms. 
In fiscal 2021, our access solutions helped over 50 million patients get on therapies after their original prescription was denied coverage. And our affordability solutions help patients save over $7 billion in out-of-pocket prescription costs. Under a single cohesive go-to-market strategy, this segment is positioned to return to growth in fiscal 2022 as patient mobility improves and prescription trends recover. 
In fiscal 2021, Medical-Surgical played a central role in providing supplies to our Primary and Extended Care customers at a critical time of need. Demand within this segment was volatile throughout the fiscal year for products such as PP&E and COVID-19 tests. And our procurement teams worked diligently to find the supplies our customers needed to treat their patients at a time when supply was constrained and pricing was volatile.
While we took measures to meet the needs of our customers for PPE-related products, demand has fluctuated and market dynamics for some of these products has changed since the onset of the pandemic. As a result, we took action to position the business for lower demand levels, which resulted in inventory charges on some PP&E and related products. 
Further adapting to the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, we leveraged our existing lab capabilities to quickly distribute over 50 million COVID-19 tests into the provider settings we serve, demonstrating the breadth and expertise we have in our market-leading lab business. Despite patient mobility trends below pre-COVID levels for much of fiscal 2021, I'm proud of the way the business responded to the needs of our customers, and I am confident that as patients return to consume health care and see their community-based providers, our core business is positioned well for growth heading into fiscal 2022. 
Finally, turning to International. The segment grew full year adjusted operating profit despite lower foot traffic in many of our retail pharmacies across Europe and Canada, where the pandemic still lags the recovery we're seeing in the U.S. Over the past several years, we've taken deliberate actions to address our cost structure and to evolve our retail footprint in these markets, and we saw benefits from those actions this fiscal year. We are also very disciplined in how we operate these businesses as evidenced by our thoughtful exit of unprofitable customers at the onset of the fiscal year in our Canadian business. These businesses play an important role in the pandemic response in their respective markets. And through our investments into digital assets, we're able to better reach patients who are increasingly choosing electronic means to access health care in those countries. Going forward, we'll continue to find ways to position these businesses for future growth. 
The pandemic still presents many unknowns, and the trajectory of the recovery will likely show signs of nonlinearity at times in our fiscal 2022. But we do expect a return to pre-COVID levels of prescription volumes and patient engagement levels in the second half of fiscal 2022. 
As utilization improves over the course of our fiscal year, we expect the stable fundamentals underlying our core business to serve as the foundation for the outlook we are providing you today. Our fiscal 2022 outlook of $18.85 to $19.45 of adjusted earnings per diluted share includes a return to solid growth in our core businesses, a continuation of our role in the COVID-19 vaccine efforts, investments in growth and a balanced approach to capital deployment. Britt will take you through additional detailed assumptions that make up this outlook. 
As I reflect back, fiscal 2021 has taught us a lot, and it showed us once again that our business model is positioned well to adapt and succeed in uncertain times. Time and time again, we've proven our resiliency during crisis, and I'm so proud of the way our employees rose to the challenges brought on by the pandemic and society more broadly. Our ability to be together, to stand together, focused on our values and purpose and service of the health care communities we serve makes me so proud. 
We will focus on building momentum on our fiscal 2021 accomplishments, and we will look to embrace the changes that have made us better to advance our growth strategy and grow the business. We will also continue to be front and center in the fight against COVID-19, helping to serve the communities in which we live and work. 
I thank you again for your time, and I'll turn it over to Britt."

Fiscal 2021 was an unprecedented year, as Brian talked about earlier. When we spoke a year ago, we just finished our fiscal 2020 as the COVID pandemic was beginning to take hold on our communities and economies. During that call, we provided our full year fiscal 2021 outlook with quite possibly the highest level of uncertainty in McKesson's 188-year history. 
As I've said since the outset of the pandemic, McKesson's operating momentum is the result of our strategic clarity, focus, execution and discipline. As a company, we've been operating in new ways for over a year. We're proud of the way our teams continue to execute and innovate. 
We're stronger than before the pandemic. And our fiscal 2021 financial results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future. Today, I'll provide an update on our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 results, including a detailed fiscal 2022 outlook, an overview which can be found in the Investors section of our website. 
We start now with our fiscal 2021 results. Our full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $17.21 grew 15% of fiscal 2020 and within our updated guidance range. Our fiscal year began with each of our segments experiencing volume decline due to the impact of COVID-19. Volume improvements in our first quarter were earlier than originally anticipated and on a nonlinear trajectory followed to the remainder of the fiscal year, correlating to the trajectory of the COVID virus. 
Our fiscal fourth quarter experienced a continuation of the volatility from COVID as well as a weak cold and flu season and winter storm that impacted portions of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. We also recognized benefits from our leadership role distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments, respectively. And similar to previous 2 quarters, in the fourth quarter, we recognized unplanned gains on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. 
Let me move now to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.05, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs of the U.S. government and the lower share count. These items were partially offset by a higher tax rate in the prior year contribution from the company's investment in Change Healthcare. This transition now to details of our consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 4. 
Consolidated revenues of $59.1 billion increased 1% compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by the prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the contribution of our German wholesale business through a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. 
Adjusted gross profit was approximately flat to prior year as inventory charges in our Medical-Surgical segment and the previously mentioned prior year demand increase driven by COVID largely offset the contribution of our COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs and the distribution of COVID-19 tests. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter decreased 6% year-over-year, led by a reduction in operating expenses due to the impact of COVID-19 and the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. This was partially offset by increased expenses related to our role distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits and higher operating expenses to support growth investments in oncology and biopharma services. 
Adjusted operating profit was $1.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. When excluding the $55 million contributed by Change Healthcare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which was previously recorded in Other, adjusted operating profit grew 19%. Interest expense was $52 million in the quarter, a decline of 20% compared to the prior year, driven by the retirement of approximately $1 billion of debt and lower commercial paper balances. Our adjusted tax rate was 22.9% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $44 million or $0.21 per diluted share associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments. 
In wrapping up our consolidated results, fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares were $161 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year, driven by the successful tax reexit of our investment in Change Healthcare at the end of fiscal 2020 and other open-market share repurchase activity. As a reminder, the exit of our Change Healthcare investment lowered our shares outstanding by approximately 15.4 million shares. 
Moving now to our fourth quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 5 through 9, starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $47 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers, partially offset by the prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and branded-to-generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 7% to $813 million driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, partially offset by the previously mentioned prior year COVID pandemic impact and higher operating costs in support of the company's oncology growth initiatives and the impact of a weak cold and flu season. 
Adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 3% to $2.7 billion driven by growth in specialty product distribution the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, offset by the previously mentioned prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the pandemic and by higher operating costs in support of the company's oncology growth initiatives. 
Next on to Prescription Technology Solutions. Revenues in the quarter were $789 million, an increase of 7%, driven by higher volumes of technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 11% to $146 million driven by organic growth from access and adherence programs supported by our Technology Solutions. Full year adjusted operating profit was $467 million, which was flat to the prior year, as organic growth from access and adherence solutions was offset by higher investment costs to support the growth of the company's biopharma strategy. We finished the year with strong momentum from these investments, including our new product, AMP, which contributed to profit growth in the fourth quarter. 
Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 23%, primarily driven by demand for COVID-19 tests. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 13% to $192 million and for the full year increased 19% to $805 million. 
We previously outlined that demand for COVID test kit and PPE products were closely associated with the rate of COVID case levels. Although COVID-19 test kit volume continued through the fourth quarter, these levels moderated significantly from Q3 levels as U.S. COVID cases trends lower throughout the quarter. As we discussed at various conferences during our fourth quarter, we anticipated that these elevated levels of demand would moderate. As we discussed in prior calls this year, early on in the pandemic, our Medical-Surgical business built supply quickly to meet demands from our customers for COVID-19 tests and elevated levels of demand for PPE. We procured these products in a market with unprecedented and unpredictable supply and demand levels, and the volatility associated with COVID case levels impacted the demand levels for PPE. 
The demand tapering occurred sooner than we had anticipated, and we took action to position the business for the lower demand levels. As a result, some PPE and related products experienced market-driven inventory charges. In our fourth quarter, we recorded $87 million of charges related to these products. 
Our underlying business was impacted by lower levels of elective procedures and patient visits, partially resulting from a continuation of a weaker cold and flu season. According to IQVIA, elective procedures trended approximately 20% below the prior year at times during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the incremental COVID-19 tests, PPE and distribution of ancillary supply kits for COVID-19 vaccine, adjusted operating profit in this segment increased approximately 1% in the quarter. 
Next, International, where revenues in the quarter were $8.6 billion, a decrease of 12% year-over-year. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues decreased 18% primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business to attention with Walgreens Boots Alliance effective November 1, 2020. Similar to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, the International segment was also impacted by the prior year increase in volumes, which corresponded with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 4% year-over-year and was down 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 1% year-over-year to $138 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit decreased 8% to $126 million due to the previously mentioned fiscal 2020 volume increase, again driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 5% to $485 million. And on an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 1% to $466 million. 
Moving on to corporate. For the quarter, adjusted corporate expenses were $125 million, a decrease of 42% year-over-year, driven by gains of approximately $44 million on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio and prior year onetime expenses. For the full year, adjusted corporate expenses were $584 million, a decrease of 9% compared to the prior year, driven by gains of approximately $133 million or $0.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio, partially offset by lower interest income. As in the previous 2 quarters, net fair value adjustments related to several of our portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. As we previously discussed, we can't predict when gains or losses within our Ventures portfolio of companies may occur. And therefore, our practice has and will continue to not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our earnings guidance. 
We reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $153 million for fiscal 2021. Until a settlement is reached and executed, we anticipate a similar level of spend. For fiscal 2022, we estimate opioid-related litigation to approximate $155 million. 
And finally, fiscal 2021 also marked the end of our previously announced 3-year program to transform our operating model and drive cost reductions across the enterprise. We are proud to have achieved our original 3-year target of $400 million to $500 million in savings by the end of fiscal 2021. A portion of the savings has been reinvested in our growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. 
Turning now to Slide 11. We continue to place a sharp focus on working capital efficiency and cash flow generation. For fiscal 2021, we generated free cash flow of $3.9 billion, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $6.3 billion, ahead of our expectations. In fiscal 2021, we continued our long track record of solid cash flow generation, resulting from another year of operating profit growth and our continued focus on working capital efficiency. In fiscal 2021, our cash flow was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including uneven levels of customer demand. Over the course of the year, the dynamics of the operating environment resulting from the early effects of COVID-19 introduced further volatility in our cash flow. 
We experienced higher levels of inventory primarily resulting from the increased quantities of COVID testing and PPE. We anticipated this additional working capital volatility, meeting the evolving needs of our customers, all while we're increasing our work with the U.S. government to distribute COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits. 
In Q3, we utilized a portion of our free cash flow to retire approximately $1 billion of debt, and we issued a $500 million bond at attractive market rates. These actions, which were in line with our stated intent to modestly delever, further strengthen our balance sheet and financial position. 
In fiscal 2021, we made $641 million of capital expenditures, which includes continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives of oncology and biopharma services as well as investments to support our COVID-19 vaccine and kitting efforts. We returned $1 billion of cash to our shareholders through $770 million of share repurchases and a payment of $276 million in dividends. 
Let me now spend a few minutes on our fiscal 2022 outlook. And I'll start by framing a couple of key macro-level assumptions that underpin our outlook for fiscal 2022. We do not assume a return wave of the virus, additional shelter-in-place or increased social distancing. As we've discussed throughout the year, volume trends in fiscal 2021 were nonlinear and varied over the course of the year. Our markets have not fully recovered, and we remain in a dynamic environment. We are, however, encouraged by recent signs that a broader recovery is forthcoming. We expect prescription volumes will continue to demonstrate steady improvement from volume levels at the end of our fiscal 2021 through the first half of our fiscal 2022, in line with the rate of increasing vaccinations and decreasing COVID cases. We anticipate a return to pre-COVID prescription and patient engagement levels in the second half of our fiscal 2022. 
For fiscal 2022, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $18.85 to $19.45, more heavily weighted towards the back half of the fiscal year. We also expect core growth across all of our segments. 
Rather than outlining each assumption, I'll instead walk you through the key items, starting with the segments. for a full list of our fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to Slides 13 through 16 in our supplemental slide presentation. 
In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we expect revenue to increase 4% to 7% driven by market growth and strong performance in our specialty business. Adjusted operating profit is expected to deliver 4% to 7% growth as volumes continue to improve compared to fiscal 2021. Our outlook also includes approximately $0.40 to $0.50 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2022, the majority expected to be realized in our first quarter. This compares with approximately $0.35 in fiscal 2021. 
We will also continue to invest in our leading and differentiated position in oncology and increase investments to support future growth. We expect these investments will represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. Normalizing for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and our continued growth investments, we expect approximately 5% to 8% core adjusted operating profit growth. 
Finally, we anticipate branded pharmaceutical pricing to approximate mid-single-digit increases, which is consistent with fiscal 2021. And the generic market remains competitive yet stable. We continue to be pleased with the performance of ClarusONE, which provides competitive costs and supply stability to our customers. This, combined with our disciplined approach to pricing and improving overall volume and utilization, gives us confidence in our ability to grow and generate positive spread. 
In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we expect revenue and adjusted operating profit growth of 12% to 17% driven by organic growth as we continue to recognize the benefits, the investments we've been making in technology offerings for our biopharma customers. 
Now transitioning Medical-Surgical. Fiscal 2021 saw notable impacts from the contribution of COVID test kits and personal protective equipment as well as impacts to the underlying business due to office closures, social distancing and reduced patient visits. Our Medical-Surgical business delivered strong results against these challenges, and we continue to position the business for long-term growth. 
In fiscal 2022, we expect demand for COVID test kits and PPE to moderate further as vaccinations increase and case counts decrease. As patients continue to return to their providers, we expect growth in our Primary and Extended Care segment of this business. Given these dynamics, we expect revenue to be down 5% to 1% growth, and we expect adjusted operating profit to be flat to 6% growth over the prior year as growth in our underlying business is offset by a lower contribution from COVID test kits. Included in this guidance is $0.10 to $0.20 of contribution related to the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines. Again, the majority will be realized in our first quarter. This compares to approximately $0.35 in fiscal 2021. Due to the timing of when we began executing our contract with HHS, a larger portion of kitting revenue was realized in fiscal 2021. 
Excluding the contribution of our COVID-19 kitting and distribution program, the contribution from COVID-19 test kits and the fiscal 2021 impairments for PPE and related products, we expect year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 10% to 16%. 
Finally, in the International segment, we expect revenues to decline 2% to grow 3% as compared to the prior year, and this reflects the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance in the third quarter of our fiscal 2021. We expect adjusted operating profit growth in the segment of 4% to 8%, led by core business improvement as our geographies continue their recovery from COVID-19. 
And now turning to the consolidated view. We expect 3% to 6% revenue and adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. We expect corporate expenses to be $670 million to $720 million. And as a reminder, our corporate expenses in fiscal 2021 were offset by net gains of approximately $133 million or $0.60 per diluted share from equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. 
We assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year. 
As Brian mentioned in his remarks, we continue to transform and evolve our operating models to drive efficiencies. As part of this evolution, we plan to make changes to our real estate strategy to increase efficiencies, supporting increased flexibility, including a transition to a partial remote work model for certain employees on a go-forward basis. This will result in reduction to our real estate footprint. In executing this plan, we will incur GAAP-only restructuring charges of approximately $180 million to $280 million over the next year. We expect these actions will result in the realization of annual savings of approximately $60 million to $80 million when fully implemented. These actions will get underway in this upcoming fiscal year, and therefore, we do not expect to see a material benefit in fiscal 2022. We're in the early stages of this planning, and we'll provide additional detail at a later time. 
Let me wrap up our fiscal 2022 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. The past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long term through a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment with a sharp focus on investments for innovation and growth to further enhance our competitive positioning and leverage our differentiated assets and capabilities. 
We expect free cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As we consider our capital deployment options, we first start with our commitment to maintain our current investment-grade credit rating. With respect to capital deployment, our priority is growth, and the use of capital continues to be focused on supporting organic growth of our oncology and biopharma services strategies, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions to accelerate these strategies. We complement these growth drivers with the return of capital to our shareholders, through a modest shift growing dividend and share repurchases. 
We continue to execute at a high level, and we have confidence in the business today and in the future. And we continue to believe that there's great value in our stock. 
As indicated on Slide 16, our fiscal 2022 outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $2 billion of stock, which we expect will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year. As a result of this activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of approximately 153.5 million to 155.5 million. 
We also anticipate use of cash to purchase shares in McKesson Europe through exercises of a put rate option available to noncontrolling shareholders. As a reminder, McKesson originally acquired 77% of Celesio, the remaining noncontrolling interest shareholders retained to put option for their shares. The put right option of the minority stakeholders expires in Q1 of fiscal 2022. We estimate that the remaining put rate options could result in cash payments up to approximately $1.3 billion, which will be reflected in the financing activities section of our cash flow statement. During fiscal 2021, McKesson used $49 million of cash for exercise of these put rate options. 
In fiscal 2021, we delivered strong performance in an unprecedented environment, and we capped off our 3-year operating model transformation, setting the stage for an acceleration of growth. We look forward to continuing our role in the pandemic response by distributing COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supply kits as we continue our leadership role in the pandemic response. Our outlook for fiscal 2022 reflects the continued confidence in our operating momentum with growth across all segments of the business, supported by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position. 
We will continue to invest in our strategies of oncology and biopharma services as we build out our connected ecosystems in these growth areas, delivering value to our customers and partners. We're confident in our ability to leverage our position and capabilities to accelerate growth. 
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge and thank all the McKesson associates across the world for their dedication, execution and unrelenting commitment to our customers and patients. The results we achieved this year could not have been possible if not for the dedication of team McKesson. We're pleased with our results in fiscal 2021 and confident in our outlook for fiscal 2022. 
And with that, Holly, let me turn the call back to you for Q&A."

And we did make those investments. 
We're increasing our investments next year. We've talked about our Ontada business publicly now, and we're making some good traction and having some good partnerships that we're -- that we've been announcing. 
And so we're going to continue to invest in our oncology ecosystem in FY '22. It's another investment year. But we do see that we're going to be turning profitability in years after. We feel very confident that these investments in the oncology business, and specifically in Ontada, will bear fruit. 
Now Brian, maybe you talk about specific investments?"

That's a bit of just infrastructure investment. 
Britt talked about Ontada, that's our technology and data insights business that we're investing in. That's a growth -- future growth area of opportunity for us. And then we did not have any M&A in oncology in this quarter. We've had some great partnerships. We had some great momentum on that front. This is an area that is strategically is aligned to our enterprise strategy, and we would certainly be open to doing M&A if it was on strategy and met our financial thresholds for good M&A."

Mid-part of the year, we start to see COVID test kits really come to market. And through our leading position as a lab distributor, I think our team did a fantastic job working with really a broad spectrum of those providers across all types of tests, molecular, antigen, antibody, to get those into the provider communities that we serve. And we had tremendous growth. That growth probably peaked in Q3. It was, frankly, fell away quicker than we had anticipated when we had our earnings call in that third quarter. We still -- there is still COVID test kit volume out there, but it certainly was -- if any -- of all of our businesses, I would say the medical business was the most dynamic in terms of the market dynamics this year."

I'm very pleased with our performance and the momentum that gives us, and I really do believe we are positioned for long-term success. I'm again so proud of how resilient our employees have been throughout the pandemic. And in fiscal 2022, we look forward to supporting our customers, partners and communities as we hopefully resolve these uncertain times. 
We wish you and your families, good health and wellness. Get vaccinated. And I want to wish everybody a Happy Nurses Day. Thanks to all those amazing nurses out there on the front line. Thanks, everybody. Have a great evening."

On our fourth quarter call last year, I talked about how the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to impact our employees, our customers, our partners and the",2347,"Thank you, Holly, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us on our call this afternoon. On our fourth quarter call last year, I talked about how the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to impact our employees, our customers, our partners and the very communities in which we live. As one of the largest health care companies in the world, I said that McKesson would play an essential role in protecting the health and safety of the health care supply chain.  
While we were confident in our abilities to help our customers during challenging times, what played out over the course of the year proved to be more unpredictable than anyone could have imagined. The up and down trajectory of the recovery was certainly different than we had originally anticipated. And our role in the COVID-19 response efforts evolved and expanded quickly as a result.  
Fiscal 2021 was one of the most challenging yet fulfilling and inspiring years of my career, a year like no other in the 188-year history of our company. I want to thank the team McKesson and our innumerable public and private partners for their resilience, commitment to our values and service to our caregivers and patients.  
From the onset of the pandemic, our sourcing teams worked closely with manufacturers and various government entities to better forecast changing pharmaceutical and medical product demand in order to extend supply and channel inventory to critical areas of need, whether it was working to secure higher volumes of PPE for caregivers and frontline workers early in the pandemic or leveraging our expertise and lab capabilities to ramp up distribution of COVID-19 tests as they came to market, McKesson moved quickly to support our customers, our partners and our communities.  
Our role in the COVID-19 response was also highlighted by our partnership with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort, having been selected as the centralized distributor of refrigerated and frozen COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary kits used to administer those COVID-19 vaccines. 
We distributed our first COVID-19 vaccine in December, shortly after Moderna's vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. On February 27, Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine became the third COVID-19 vaccine granted EUA by the FDA and the second vaccine within the scope of our contract with the CDC. We began distributing the J&J vaccine within 48 hours of its authorization, and we're now distributing out of all 4 fit-for-purpose distribution centers we built for this program. We stand ready to support the distribution of additional vaccines as they come to market.  
Through April, we've successfully distributed over 150 million Moderna and J&J COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites in the U.S., and we remain on target with the U.S. government's distribution schedule. Also through April, we have assembled enough kits to support the administration of more than 550 million doses for all vaccine types. This work remains our company's top priority, and we are prepared to support the U.S. government for as long as they ask us to lead the centralized distribution model.  
In Europe and Canada, we are also partnering with the local governments in the COVID-19 vaccine effort through administration in our owned and banner pharmacies as well as distribution efforts in selected markets and countries.  
Let me turn now to our financial performance. Against the dynamic and challenging macroeconomic backdrop in fiscal 2021, we grew revenues 3%, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share result of $17.21 was up 15% over prior year. When pressed with challenges and uncertainties, our customers and government partners continued to choose McKesson to help ensure stability of supply for their patients. So while prescription volume and primary care patient visit trends negatively impacted the core business throughout the fiscal year, the strength of our business model and our differentiated capabilities help us to grow the business and deliver value to our shareholders.  
Our commitment to executing our strategy, transforming and simplifying the operating model contributed to these strong financial results.  
Looking forward into fiscal 2022. I'm confident that we operate in scaled and resilient markets with underlying trends that support long-term growth. We invest in our business to differentiate our solutions and create value for customers, patients and partners. The pandemic has not paused our progress on these strategic priorities. Targeted investments into our business over time have positioned us well to succeed and respond quickly to changing demands from our customers and government partners during these uncertain times.  
We've been focused on building out a connected ecosystem over the last several years in the areas of oncology and biopharma services. These are areas where we believe we have key differentiated capabilities. Through investments in technology, we've been able to develop more robust solutions that help connect patients, providers and manufacturers and support our growth.  
Starting first with our oncology assets, which have proven to be resilient throughout the pandemic. Through scaled distribution, GPO services in our U.S. oncology business were positioned well as innovative therapies come to market. Biosimilars are just one example where McKesson has been able to combine the breadth and scale of our specialty capabilities to help give providers choice and lower cost for patients.  
We were pleased to add more practices and over 100 providers to the U.S. Oncology Network in fiscal 2021. Today, through U.S. Oncology and our nonaffiliated provider business, we're connected to over 10,000 specialty physicians. And our oncology technology platform has supported millions of patient journeys, providing us access to real-world outcomes data and research.  
Our recently launched technology and real-world insights business, which we call Ontada, is an extension of our oncology ecosystem and is a key area of investment for us going forward. We believe this business differentiates our value proposition to providers looking to drive better outcomes for their patients and to manufacturers focused on innovative therapies in the area of oncology.  
In terms of biopharma services, in fiscal 2021, we brought together our RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads businesses. Together, these businesses are focused on innovating and automating the ways in which biopharma connects with patients, pharmacies and providers with the ultimate goal of providing stronger access, affordability and better adherence outcomes. These assets embed us in the daily workflows of over 50,000 pharmacies and more than 750,000 providers. We're integrated into over 75% of EHRs today. And through our market-leading position and advanced solutions, we're able to automate and simplify otherwise very manual processes.  
Ultimately, our solutions help patients get on therapies quicker and stay on those therapies longer. This value proposition to our manufacturing partners is reflected by the over 500 brands we support today, covering nearly every therapeutic area.  
In fiscal 2022, we will remain focused on these growth areas, and we will continue to look for ways to streamline the business so that we can operate with added speed and increased focus. Part of our commitment to grow the business is to continually review and evaluate our portfolio. Sometimes we find assets we're not the natural owner of, as was the case with our German wholesale business, where we created a JV with Walgreens Boots Alliance in November.  
To further simplify the business, we continually evaluate and adapt the way in which we work. For McKesson, it's been over a year since we successfully transitioned all of our office-based employees to work from home seemingly overnight and without a loss of productivity. While we are quite anxious to see each other in person soon and at a time and place where it's appropriate and safe to do so, the success of our employees in this remote work environment and their desire for more work flexibility has challenged us to reevaluate the way we work and our real estate and existing office-based footprint. This is yet another example of how we're looking to simplify operations and grow the business and do the right thing for our teams. Britt will go into more detail about our thinking on these impacts going forward.  
Now let me turn to the business and touch on how we're positioned for success heading into fiscal 2022. I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where we again grew adjusted operating profit despite soft prescription volume trends throughout the fiscal year. Our priority in this business is to strengthen the core and deliver the world's highest-quality supply chain to our customers and manufacturing partners. Our focus on cost and working capital efficiencies underpin this growth and help fuel investments for growth across the business. 
For Generics, the pricing environment continues to track in line with our expectation. On the buy side, we leverage our scale and our sourcing capabilities through ClarusONE to ensure stability of supply at low cost for our customers. On the sell side, McKesson has taken a disciplined approach to pricing, and the market continues to be competitive but has been stable for years. While generic volume remained below pre-COVID levels in the quarter, we expect volume improvement over the course of our fiscal year. 
I'm also pleased with the performance of our Specialty business this past year. Our U.S. Oncology business, patient visits were at pre-COVID baselines in March, with many returning for in-person visits to their providers. In fiscal 2022, we'll look to grow both our U.S. Oncology and nonaffiliated businesses, which are just another part of our connected oncology ecosystem at McKesson.
Let me talk about Prescription Technology Solutions.  
They perform well this year despite prescription volumes being down since the onset of the pandemic. We're continuing to invest in innovation in this business, and despite this year's challenges, we've been very successful in adding new brands to our platforms. In fiscal 2021, our access solutions helped over 50 million patients get on therapies after their original prescription was denied coverage. And our affordability solutions helped patients save over $7 billion in out of pocket prescription cost. 
Under a single cohesive go-to-market strategy, this segment is positioned to return to growth in fiscal 2022 as patient mobility improves and prescription trends recover. 
In fiscal 2021, Medical-Surgical played a central role in providing supplies to our primary and extended care customers at a critical time of need. Demand within this segment was volatile throughout the fiscal year for products such as PP&E and COVID-19 tests, and our procurement teams worked diligently to find the supplies our customers needed to treat their patients at a time when supply was constrained and pricing was volatile. While we took measures to meet the needs of our customers for PPE-related products, demand has fluctuated and market dynamics for some of these products has changed since the onset of the pandemic. As a result, we took action to position the business for lower demand levels, which resulted in inventory charges on some PP&E and related products.  
Further adapting to the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, we leveraged our existing lab capabilities to quickly distribute over 50 million COVID-19 tests into the provider settings we serve, demonstrating the breadth and expertise we have in our market-leading lab business. Despite patient mobility trends below pre-COVID levels for much of fiscal 2021, I'm proud of the way the business responded to the needs of our customers, and I am confident that as patients return to consume health care and see their community-based providers, our core business is positioned well for growth heading into fiscal 2022.  
Finally, turning to International. The segment grew full year adjusted operating profit despite lower foot traffic in many of our retail pharmacies across Europe and Canada, where the pandemic still lags the recovery we're seeing in the U.S. Over the past several years, we've taken deliberate actions to address our cost structure and to evolve our retail footprint in these markets, and we saw benefits from those actions this fiscal year. 
We are also very disciplined in how we operate these businesses as evidenced by our thoughtful exit of unprofitable customers at the onset of the fiscal year in our Canadian business. These businesses play an important role in the pandemic response in their respective markets. And through our investments into digital assets, we're able to better reach patients who are increasingly choosing electronic means to access health care in those countries. Going forward, we'll continue to find ways to position these businesses for future growth.  
The pandemic still presents many unknowns, and the trajectory of the recovery will likely show signs of nonlinearity at times in our fiscal 2022. But we do expect a return to pre-COVID levels of prescription volumes and patient engagement levels in the second half of fiscal 2022.  
As utilization improves over the course of our fiscal year, we expect the stable fundamentals underlying our core business to serve as the foundation for the outlook we are providing you today. Our fiscal 2022 outlook of $18.85 to $19.45 of adjusted earnings per diluted share includes a return to solid growth in our core businesses, a continuation of our role in the COVID-19 vaccine efforts, investments in growth and a balanced approach to capital deployment. Britt will take you through additional detailed assumptions that make up this outlook.  
As I reflect back, fiscal 2021 has taught us a lot, and it showed us once again that our business model is positioned well to adapt and succeed in uncertain times. Time and time again, we've proven our resiliency during crisis, and I'm so proud of the way our employees rose to the challenges brought on by the pandemic and society more broadly. Our ability to be together, to stand together, focused on our values and purpose in service of the health care communities we serve makes me so proud.  
We will focus on building momentum on our fiscal 2021 accomplishments, and we will look to embrace the changes that have made us better to advance our growth strategy and grow the business. We will also continue to be front and center in the fight against COVID-19, helping to serve the communities in which we live and work.  
I thank you again for your time, and I'll turn it over to Britt."

Fiscal 2021 was an unprecedented year, as Brian talked about earlier. When we spoke a year ago, we just finished our fiscal 2020 as the COVID pandemic was beginning to take hold on our communities and economies. During that call, we provided our full year fiscal 2021 outlook with quite possibly the highest level of uncertainty in McKesson's 188-year history.  
As I've said since the outset of the pandemic, McKesson's operating momentum is the result of our strategic clarity, focus, execution and discipline. As a company, we've been operating in new ways for over a year. We're proud of the way our teams continue to execute and innovate.  
We're stronger than before the pandemic. And our fiscal 2021 financial results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future. Today, I'll provide an update on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, including a detailed fiscal 2022 outlook, an overview which can be found in the Investors section of our website.  
We start now with our fiscal 2021 results. Our full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $17.21 grew 15% above fiscal 2020 and within our updated guidance range. Our fiscal year began with each of our segments experiencing volume decline due to the impact of COVID-19. Volume improvements in our first quarter were earlier than originally anticipated and on a nonlinear trajectory followed to the remainder of the fiscal year, correlating to the trajectory of the COVID virus.  
Our fiscal fourth quarter experienced a continuation of the volatility from COVID as well as a weak cold and flu season and a winter storm that impacted portions of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. We also recognized benefits from our leadership role distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical segments, respectively. And similar to previous 2 quarters, in the fourth quarter, we recognized unplanned gains on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio.  
Let me move now to a discussion of our adjusted earnings results for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.05, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs of the U.S. government and the lower share count. These items were partially offset by a higher tax rate in the prior year contribution from the company's investment in Change Healthcare. Let's transition now to details of our consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 4.  
Consolidated revenues of $59.1 billion increased 1% compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by the prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the contribution of our German wholesale business through a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance.  
Adjusted gross profit was approximately flat to prior year as inventory charges in our Medical-Surgical segment and the previously mentioned prior year demand increase, driven by COVID, largely offset the contribution of our COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs and the distribution of COVID-19 tests. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter decreased 6% year-over-year, led by a reduction in operating expenses due to the impact of COVID-19 and the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. This was partially offset by increased expenses related to our role distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits and higher operating expenses to support growth investments in oncology and biopharma services.  
Adjusted operating profit was $1.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. When excluding the $55 million contributed by Change Healthcare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which was previously recorded in Other, adjusted operating profit grew 19%. Interest expense was $52 million in the quarter, a decline of 20% compared to the prior year, driven by the retirement of approximately $1 billion of debt and lower commercial paper balances. Our adjusted tax rate was 22.9% for the quarter, in line with our expectations.  
Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $44 million or $0.21 per diluted share associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments.  
In wrapping up our consolidated results. Fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares were 161 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year, driven by the successful tax-free exit of our investment in Change Healthcare at the end of fiscal 2020 and other open-market share repurchase activity. As a reminder, the exit of our Change Healthcare investment lowered our shares outstanding by approximately 15.4 million shares.  
Moving now to our fourth quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 5 through 9, starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $47 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers, partially offset by the prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and branded-to-generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 7% to $813 million, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, partially offset by the previously mentioned prior year COVID pandemic impact and higher operating costs in support of the company's oncology growth initiatives and the impact of a weak cold and flu season.  
Adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 3% to $2.7 billion, driven by growth in specialty product distribution the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, offset by the previously mentioned prior year increase in demand driven by the onset of the pandemic and by higher operating costs in support of the company's oncology growth initiatives.  
Next on to Prescription Technology Solutions. Revenues in the quarter were $789 million, an increase of 7%, driven by higher volumes of technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 11% to $146 million, driven by organic growth from access and adherence programs supported by our Technology Solutions. Full year adjusted operating profit was $467 million, which was flat to the prior year, as organic growth from access and adherence solutions was offset by higher investment costs to support the growth of the company's biopharma strategy.  
We finished the year with strong momentum from these investments, including our new product, AMP, which contributed to profit growth in the fourth quarter.  
Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 23%, primarily driven by demand for COVID-19 tests. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 13% to $192 million and for the full year increased 19% to $805 million.  
We previously outlined that demand for COVID test kit and PPE products were closely associated with the rate of COVID case levels. Although COVID-19 test kit volume continued through the fourth quarter, these levels moderated significantly from Q3 levels as U.S. COVID cases trended lower throughout the quarter. As we discussed at various conferences during our fourth quarter, we anticipated that these elevated levels of demand would moderate. 
As we discussed in prior calls this year, early on in the pandemic, our Medical-Surgical business built supply quickly to meet demands from our customers for COVID-19 tests and elevated levels of demand for PPE. We procured these products in a market with unprecedented and unpredictable supply and demand levels, and the volatility associated with COVID case levels impacted the demand levels for PPE.  
The demand tapering occurred sooner than we had anticipated, and we took action to position the business for the lower demand levels. As a result, some PPE and related products experienced market-driven inventory charges. In our fourth quarter, we recorded $87 million of charges related to these products.  
Our underlying business was impacted by lower levels of elective procedures and patient visits, partially resulting from a continuation of a weaker cold and flu season. According to IQVIA, elective procedures trended approximately 20% below the prior year at times during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the incremental COVID-19 tests, PPE and distribution of ancillary supply kits for COVID-19 vaccine, adjusted operating profit in this segment increased approximately 1% in the quarter.  
Next, International, where revenues in the quarter were $8.6 billion, a decrease of 12% year-over-year. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues decreased 18%, primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance effective November 1, 2020. Similar to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, the International segment was also impacted by the prior year increase in volumes, which corresponded with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 4% year-over-year and was down 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit increased 1% year-over-year to $138 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit decreased 8% to $126 million due to the previously mentioned fiscal 2020 volume increase, again driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Adjusted operating profit for the full year increased 5% to $485 million. And on an FX adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 1% to $466 million.  
Moving on to Corporate. For the quarter, adjusted corporate expenses were $125 million, a decrease of 42% year-over-year driven by gains of approximately $44 million on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio and prior year onetime expenses. For the full year, adjusted corporate expenses were $584 million, a decrease of 9% compared to the prior year, driven by gains of approximately $133 million or $0.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share on equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio, partially offset by lower interest income. 
As in the previous 2 quarters, net fair value adjustments related to several of our portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. As we previously discussed, we can't predict when gains or losses within our Ventures portfolio of companies may occur. And therefore, our practice has and will continue to not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our earnings guidance.  
We reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $153 million for fiscal 2021. Until a settlement is reached and executed, we anticipate a similar level of spend. For fiscal 2022, we estimate opioid-related litigation to approximate $155 million.  
And finally, fiscal 2021 also marked the end of our previously announced 3-year program to transform our operating model and drive cost reductions across the enterprise. We are proud to have achieved our original 3-year target of $400 million to $500 million in savings by the end of fiscal 2021. A portion of the savings has been reinvested in our growth areas of oncology and biopharma services.  
Turning now to Slide 11. We continue to place a sharp focus on working capital efficiency and cash flow generation. For fiscal 2021, we generated free cash flow of $3.9 billion, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $6.3 billion, ahead of our expectations. In fiscal 2021, we continued our long track record of solid cash flow generation, resulting from another year of operating profit growth and our continued focus on working capital efficiency. In fiscal 2021, our cash flow was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including uneven levels of customer demand. Over the course of the year, the dynamics of the operating environment resulting from the early effects of COVID-19 introduced further volatility in our cash flow.  
We experienced higher levels of inventory primarily resulting from the increased quantities of COVID testing and PPE. We anticipated this additional working capital volatility, meeting the evolving needs of our customers, all while we're increasing our work with the U.S. government to distribute COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits.  
In Q3, we utilized a portion of our free cash flow to retire approximately $1 billion of debt, and we issued a $500 million bond at attractive market rates. These actions, which were in line with our stated intent to modestly delever, further strengthen our balance sheet and financial position.  
In fiscal 2021, we made $641 million of capital expenditures, which includes continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives of oncology and biopharma services as well as investments to support our COVID-19 vaccine and kitting efforts. We returned $1 billion of cash to our shareholders through $770 million of share repurchases and a payment of $276 million in dividends.  
Let me now spend a few minutes on our fiscal 2022 outlook. And I'll start by framing a couple of key macro-level assumptions that underpin our outlook for fiscal 2022. We do not assume a return wave of the virus, additional shelter-in-place or increased social distancing. As we've discussed throughout the year, volume trends in fiscal 2021 were nonlinear and varied over the course of the year. Our markets have not fully recovered, and we remain in a dynamic environment. We are, however, encouraged by recent signs that a broader recovery is forthcoming. We expect prescription volumes will continue to demonstrate steady improvement from volume levels at the end of our fiscal 2021 through the first half of our fiscal 2022, in line with the rate of increasing vaccinations and decreasing COVID cases. We anticipate a return to pre-COVID prescription and patient engagement levels in the second half of our fiscal 2022.  
For fiscal 2022, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $18.85 to $19.45, more heavily weighted towards the back half of the fiscal year. We also expect core growth across all of our segments.  
Rather than outlining each assumption, I'll instead walk you through the key items, starting with the segments. For a full list of our fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to Slides 13 through 16 in our supplemental slide presentation.  
In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we expect revenue to increase 4% to 7% driven by market growth and strong performance in our specialty business. Adjusted operating profit is expected to deliver 4% to 7% growth as volumes continue to improve compared to fiscal 2021. Our outlook also includes approximately $0.40 to $0.50 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2022, the majority expected to be realized in our first quarter. This compares with approximately $0.35 in fiscal 2021.  
We will also continue to invest in our leading and differentiated position in oncology and increase investments to support future growth. We expect these investments will represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022.  
Normalizing for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and our continued growth investments, we expect approximately 5% to 8% core adjusted operating profit growth.  
Finally, we anticipate branded pharmaceutical pricing to approximate mid-single-digit increases, which is consistent with fiscal 2021. And the generic market remains competitive yet stable. We continue to be pleased with the performance of ClarusONE, which provides competitive costs and supply stability to our customers. This, combined with our disciplined approach to pricing and improving overall volume and utilization, gives us confidence in our ability to grow and generate positive spread.  
In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we expect revenue and adjusted operating profit growth of 12% to 17% driven by organic growth as we continue to recognize the benefits of the investments we've been making in technology offerings for our biopharma customers.  
Now transitioning to Medical-Surgical. Fiscal 2021 saw notable impacts from the contribution of COVID test kits and personal protective equipment as well as impacts to the underlying business due to office closures, social distancing and reduced patient visits. Our Medical-Surgical business delivered strong results against these challenges, and we continue to position the business for long-term growth.  
In fiscal 2022, we expect demand for COVID test kits and PPE to moderate further as vaccinations increase and case counts decrease. As patients continue to return to their providers, we expect growth in our Primary and Extended Care segments of this business. Given these dynamics, we expect revenue to be down 5% to 1% growth, and we expect adjusted operating profit to be flat to 6% growth over the prior year as growth in our underlying business is offset by a lower contribution from COVID test kits. Included in this guidance is $0.10 to $0.20 of contribution related to the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines. Again, the majority will be realized in our first quarter. This compares to approximately $0.35 in fiscal 2021.  
Due to the timing of when we began executing our contract with HHS, a larger portion of kitting revenue was realized in fiscal 2021.  
Excluding the contribution of our COVID-19 kitting and distribution program, the contribution from COVID-19 test kits and the fiscal 2021 impairments for PPE and related products, we expect year-over-year adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 10% to 16%.  
Finally, in the International segment, we expect revenues to decline 2% to grow 3% as compared to the prior year, and this reflects the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance in the third quarter of our fiscal 2021. We expect adjusted operating profit growth in the segment of 4% to 8%, led by core business improvement as our geographies continue the recovery from COVID-19.
And now turning to the consolidated view. We expect 3% to 6% revenue and adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. We expect corporate expenses to be $670 million to $720 million. And as a reminder, our corporate expenses in fiscal 2021 were offset by net gains of approximately $133 million or $0.60 per diluted share from equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. We assume a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%, which may vary from quarter to quarter and includes anticipated discrete tax items that we expect to realize during the course of the year.  
As Brian mentioned in his remarks, we continue to transform and evolve our operating models to drive efficiencies. As part of this evolution, we plan to make changes to our real estate strategy to increase efficiencies, supporting increased flexibility, including a transition to a partial remote work model for certain employees on a go-forward basis. This will result in reduction to our real estate footprint. In executing this plan, we will incur GAAP-only restructuring charges of approximately $180 million to $280 million over the next year. We expect these actions will result in the realization of annual savings of approximately $60 million to $80 million when fully implemented. These actions will get underway in this upcoming fiscal year, and therefore, we do not expect to see a material benefit in fiscal 2022. We're in the early stages of this planning, and we'll provide additional detail at a later time.  
Let me wrap up our fiscal 2022 outlook with a few comments on cash flow and capital deployment. The past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long term through a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment with a sharp focus on investments for innovation and growth to further enhance our competitive positioning and leverage our differentiated assets and capabilities.  
We expect free cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As we consider our capital deployment options, we first start with our commitment to maintain our current investment-grade credit rating. 
With respect to capital deployment, our priority is growth, and the use of capital continues to be focused on supporting organic growth of our oncology and biopharma services strategies, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions to accelerate these strategies. We complement these growth drivers with the return of capital to our shareholders through a modest share-growing dividend and share repurchases.  
We continue to execute at a high level, and we have confidence in the business today and in the future. And we continue to believe that there's great value in our stock. As indicated on Slide 16, our fiscal 2022 outlook incorporates plans to repurchase approximately $2 billion of stock, which we expect will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year. As a result of this activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of approximately 153.5 million to 155.5 million. 
We also anticipate use of cash to purchase shares in McKesson Europe through exercises of a put rate option available to noncontrolling shareholders. As a reminder, McKesson originally acquired 77% of Celesio, the remaining noncontrolling interest shareholders retained a put option for their shares. The put right option of the minority stakeholders expires in Q1 of fiscal 2022. We estimate that the remaining put rate options could result in cash payments up to approximately $1.3 billion, which will be reflected in the financing activities section of our cash flow statement. During fiscal 2021, McKesson used $49 million of cash for exercise of these put rate options.  
In fiscal 2021, we delivered strong performance in an unprecedented environment, and we capped off our 3-year operating model transformation, setting the stage for an acceleration of growth. We look forward to continuing our role in the pandemic response by distributing COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supply kits as we continue our leadership role in the pandemic response. Our outlook for fiscal 2022 reflects the continued confidence in our operating momentum with growth across all segments of the business, supported by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position.  
We will continue to invest in our strategies of oncology and biopharma services as we build out our connected ecosystems in these growth areas, delivering value to our customers and partners. We're confident in our ability to leverage our position and capabilities to accelerate growth.  
In closing, I'd like to acknowledge and thank all the McKesson associates across the world for their dedication, execution and unrelenting commitment to our customers and patients. The results we achieved this year could not have been possible if not for the dedication of team McKesson. We're pleased with our results in fiscal 2021 and confident in our outlook for fiscal 2022.  
And with that, Holly, let me turn the call back to you for Q&A."

And then we did not have any M&A in oncology in this quarter. We've had some great partnerships. We had some great momentum on that front.

And then number two, if the heavy weighting of your vaccine and kitting, $0.50 to $0.70, is in the first quarter, how do we true that up with earnings being weighted towards the back half?

Historically, our earnings have been generated primarily heavier in the second half of the year.

I think when you look at our guide and you look at the vaccine contribution of $0.40 to $0.50 on the range of $18.85 to $19.45, inside of that, the core business is still growing. And we would expect that as utilization continues to improve through the first half and gets back to pre-COVID in the second half, that those core earnings would reflect that. 
So again, I think, historically, we've had higher second half contribution than the first half. We expect that we'll have a slightly higher second half than first half contribution as well. We don't guide the quarter, so I'm really not going to comment on second quarter versus first quarter. I think you should take our thinking on how utilization comes back online."

So when we think about that core growth of 5% to 8%, and while it doesn't include some of the COVID impacts, it does include lower volumes in the first half of the year. Should we think about that as sort of the starting point or a baseline for longer-term growth and when volumes accelerate that, that starting point could be even higher? 
And then my follow-up question is just on the opioids litigation. Your guidance assumes sort of the same legal expenses in 2022 and in 2021. So if we can get any updates on where you are in the process."

The parameters of that have been pretty consistent over the last several quarters. I'm very encouraged. We're hopeful we can reach resolution. We think it will be great for patients and communities. 
But as we said last quarter, until we have a deal, we are going to continue to prepare to defend ourselves, and we've made significant investments in that defense.

And we view all of these things as kind of reinforcing each other, right? More scale in the network gives you a bigger distribution channel for the products and services that you develop, more impact back upstream to the biopharmas.

Thank you for joining us on our first quarter call today. We are pleased to be reporting a strong start to our fiscal 2022, which reflects continued operating momentum across our businesses despite the fact that our markets are still recovering from the impacts of COVID-19. We're also making significant progress against our strategic priorities and our commitment to do what's in the best interest of you, our shareholders. 
Before we get to our first quarter results, I want to provide an update on the progress made towards a broad resolution of governmental opioid-related claims. On July 21 we announced that McKesson, along with 2 other distributors, negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement, which, if all conditions are satisfied, would result in a settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. 
This broad resolution -- if this broad agreement becomes effective, the agreement reached between the distributors and the state of New York and its participating subdivisions to settle opioid-related claims will become part of this broader settlement agreement. Under the negotiated proposed settlement agreement and subject to final state territorial and political subdivision participation, McKesson will pay up to $7.9 billion over a period of 18 years. Over the next several months, we will monitor participation of the eligible governmental entities to determine if participation levels are sufficient to proceed. 
This is an important development, and I am pleased with the progress we've made after years of negotiations. If we're able to reach a final settlement, it would provide immediate relief to thousands of communities across the United States that have been impacted by this public health crisis. While we strongly dispute the allegations made in these lawsuits, we believe that bringing resolution to these outstanding claims is in the best interest of those impacted by this crisis. We also believe resolution is in the best interest of our shareholders, and will allow us to further focus on the business and our role in protecting the safety and the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain. 
We remain committed to doing our part to fight against the opioid epidemic, through efforts to continuously enhance our anti-diversion programs and to advocate for reform at the state and national level. If the settlement cannot be finalized or plaintiffs instead choose to pursue their claims in court, we are prepared to litigate against those claims, and we remain confident in our defenses. 
We also recently announced that we entered into an agreement to sell several of our McKesson Europe businesses to the PHOENIX Group, who we believe is the right and natural successor to McKesson and the ideal leader of these European businesses going forward. The agreement includes our McKesson Europe businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia, as well as our German AG headquarters in Stuttgart, our shared service center in Lithuania, our German wound care business and our equity stake in our joint venture in the Netherlands. This transaction is expected to close in fiscal 2023, subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. 
Our remaining European businesses in the U.K., Norway, Austria and Denmark were not included in this transaction and will continue to be operated by McKesson. However, we are exploring strategic alternatives for these remaining businesses as we align future investments to our growth strategies outside of Europe. We believe fully exiting Europe is another step towards becoming a more streamlined and efficient organization. 
Let me turn now to our performance in the quarter. We are continuing to see the operating momentum we discussed on our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, we're reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.56 ahead of our original expectations, resulting from the strength across our businesses and our roles in the COVID-19 response efforts across the geographies in which we operate. Our U.S. and international distribution businesses are playing an integral role in the pandemic response and our operational excellence and capabilities continue to be highlighted through our evolving partnership with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution efforts. 
Through July, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 185 million Moderna and J&J COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the United States, and our medical business has now assembled enough kits to support the administration of more than 785 million doses for all vaccine types. 
Also in the quarter, the U.S. government asked McKesson to support their mission of sending millions of COVID-19 vaccines to countries in need all around the globe. We are picking and packing Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines into temperature-controlled coolers and preparing these vaccines for pickup by international partners, all with the direction of the U.S. government. McKesson is not managing the actual shipments of vaccines to other countries. 
Through July, we successfully prepared over 65 million COVID-19 vaccines for shipment abroad. We are humbled and honored to serve the U.S. government in this expanded role. 
Our roles in Europe and Canada are also continuing to evolve, and we're partnering with local governments to distribute and administer COVID-19 vaccines there as well. Through July, we've distributed over 45 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across these geographies. Based on our first quarter results, our evolving roles in the COVID-19 response efforts and our confidence in our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal 2022, we are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to $19.80 to $20.40 from a previous range of $18.85 to $19.45. 
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're making significant progress against our strategic priorities. We're simplifying the portfolio and increasing our focus on areas where we have deep expertise and that are central to our long-term growth strategy. Our progress to date is underpinned by execution against our top company priorities. The first is a focus on the people and the culture. The second is our commitment to strengthen the core pharmaceutical and medical supply chain businesses. The third, our intentional efforts to simplify and streamline the business. And finally, we continue to invest, to advance our differentiated oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. Let me now touch briefly on the progress we're making across each of these priorities. 
First and foremost, we're prioritizing our people and advancing our company's culture as we strive to be recognized as an impact-driven organization and the best place to work in health care. We've been hard at work to transform and energize our company's culture. Our ICARE and ILEAD values serve as the foundation as we work toward our common goal, advancing health outcomes for all. 
As an organization, we're committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion. For the sixth consecutive year, McKesson was named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion. McKesson earned a top ranking score of 100 on the 2021 Disability Equality Index. In addition, we marked progress in diverse representation in the U.S. with female executive representation up 3% over the prior year and a 6% gain over the prior year in executive representation for persons of color. 
Our second company priority is to strengthen our core distribution businesses where we have market-leading scale and capabilities across North America. Success in the core enables strong cash flow generation, which we in turn use to reinvest in the business and to return capital to our shareholders. In addition to our work to help our customers and government partners and their pandemic response efforts, our pharmaceutical and medical surgical distribution businesses are continuing to improve, and the recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has been in line with our expectations. Elective procedures and primary care visits have improved throughout our first quarter and prescription volume trends are showing signs of improvement as well. 
Also positive are the trends we've seen across specialty and oncology patient visits, which were at or above pre-COVID baselines in the first quarter. And distribution volumes to our specialty provider customers continue to drive and support our growth. In our Canadian distribution business, our operational excellence and scale was recently recognized through a new partnership with one of Canada's largest retailers as a primary distribution customer. This is a testament to the strength of our supply chain in Canada. 
The renewed focus on growing the core has been enabled by our commitment to streamline the business over the past several years, efforts that go beyond our recent announcement to exit the European region, which I commented on in my opening remarks. Over the past several years, we've committed to transforming our operating model. We've centralized back-office functions across North America and Europe to further rationalize costs through a reduction of our owned retail pharmacy footprint and a commitment to lower spend across the organization. 
Throughout our enterprise, there's an initiative we called Spend Smart, which helped us achieve our 3-year cost reduction target of $400 million to $500 million of annual cost savings by the end of our fiscal 2021. Over time, we've identified businesses that are not central to McKesson's current strategic priorities or direction, as was the case in our exit of our position in Change Healthcare and the creation of a German wholesale joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. We will continually review our portfolio to ensure tight and focused alignment to our strategy. 
All of this work has enabled us to focus our time and investments on our strategic growth pillars, where we're working to build connected ecosystems in the growth areas of oncology and biopharma services, which serve to advance our already differentiated positions. We continue to be confident in the long-term outlook of businesses that operate in these high-growth markets. 
Starting with oncology, an ecosystem that McKesson has strategically built over a period of nearly 15 years, beginning with our acquisition of oncology therapeutics network all the way back in 2007, which added at that time, core specialty distribution capabilities. 10 years ago, we deepened the breadth and the depth of our offering with the acquisition of U.S. Oncology Network, which gave us practice management, site management for research and the iKnowMed EHR, which is one of the foundational pieces of Ontada.  
Fast forward to today, and we're now supporting over 14,000 specialty physicians through distribution and GPO services. We're also the leading distributor in community oncology space and have over 1,400 physicians in the U.S. oncology network spread over approximately 600 sites of care in the U.S. 
As innovative specialty therapies come to market, our leading position in oncology distribution enables us to grow our connected oncology ecosystem in parallel. As we grow our nonaffiliated and our U.S. oncology provider basis, we accelerate the growth of our oncology assets, such as GPO services, practice management, site management for clinical research, specialty pharmacy and our value proposition for Ontada, where we're providing real-world insight to both manufacturers and providers. 
Although in its infancy, Ontada's value is being recognized through expanded partnerships with manufacturers such as Amgen, and its leading role in a large-scale real-world research study known as Mylan, which aims to improve treatments and outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer. 
New therapies coming to market can also provide additional challenges for patients, providers and our biopharma partners. Our Prescription Technology Solutions business invests in innovation and aims to provide access, adherence and affordability solutions for over 500 brands across nearly every therapeutic area. Our connectivity to over 50,000 pharmacies, 750,000 providers and 75% of EHRs in the U.S. helps enable over 5 billion prescription -- $5 billion of prescription savings for patients each year. 
Prescription Technology Solutions ended fiscal 2021 with solid momentum. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we saw organic growth in the business and encouraging signs that patient engagement levels and prescription volume trends are continuing to improve. Our market-leading technology offerings are helping patients get access to therapies they need more quickly and efficiently and stay on those therapies longer to get better health outcomes. 
In closing, we believe that we've made significant strides against our strategic priorities of strengthening the core, simplifying the business and investing in our growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. Announcing the proposed opioid settlement agreement is an important development. In addition, our strategic intent to exit the European region positions us to become a more focused and agile company. We believe both are in the best interest of our employees, in the best interest of our customers and in the best interest of our shareholders. 
While it's early in the fiscal year and the pandemic continues to present unknowns, I'm confident in the fundamentals of the business and believe we are positioned well for long-term growth, and we'll look to build upon this momentum over the remainder of our fiscal 2022. Thank you for your time. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Britt, for a few additional comments."

I'm pleased to speak with you today about our strong first quarter results, which reflect the importance of the products and services McKesson delivers, the execution and momentum across our business, which",2901,"Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to speak with you today about our strong first quarter results, which reflect the importance of the products and services McKesson delivers, the execution and momentum across our business, which includes supporting the U.S. government's COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine and kitting efforts, and the recovery of prescription volumes and patient visits impacted by the COVID pandemic in the prior year. 
I'll begin my remarks today by sharing an update on our European businesses, followed by our first quarter results, and I'll close with an update to our fiscal 2022 outlook. The summary of our first quarter results and updated guidance assumptions can be found in our earnings slide presentation, which is posted on the Investors section of our website. 
In early July, we announced an agreement to sell our European businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia to the PHOENIX Group. This transaction includes our German AG headquarters in Stuttgart  and our European shared service center in Lithuania. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately USD 1.5 billion. The ultimate proceeds for this transaction are subject to certain adjustments under the agreement, therefore, the proceeds may differ from the purchase price. 
The assets involved in this transaction contributed approximately $12 billion in revenue and $75 million in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2021. We've determined that this transaction shall not qualify for discontinued operations. The net assets included in the transaction we've classified as held for sale. The held-for-sale accounting was effective at the start of our second quarter of this fiscal year. 
We will remeasure the net assets to the lower carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell, and we estimate that this will result in a GAAP-only charge of between $500 million to $700 million in our second quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to held-for-sale accounting treatment, we'll discontinue recording depreciation and amortization on the assets involved in the transaction. As a result of the held-for-sale accounting, we would guide to approximately $0.26 adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022. This will be included in our updated outlook, and I'll outline those later in my remarks. 
McKesson will operate these businesses and record revenue and income until the transaction is closed, which is expected to occur in fiscal 2023. We're committed to exploring strategic alternatives for our remaining European businesses, and we'll provide details on the plans for the remaining businesses as they become available. Exiting Europe at this time is the right course of action for McKesson and our shareholders, and it will sharpen the focus on our growth strategies of oncology and biopharma services as we develop and grow our connected ecosystem. 
Let me now turn to our first quarter results. Before I provide more details on our first quarter adjusted results, I want to point out 2 items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. 
First, during the June quarter, we committed to donate certain personal protective equipment and related products to charitable organizations to assist in COVID-19 recovery efforts. In the quarter, we recorded $155 million of pretax inventory charges within our Medical Surgical Solutions segment for inventory which we no longer intend to sell and will instead direct the previously mentioned charitable organizations. 
And secondly, on our May 6 earnings call, we outlined an initiative to rationalize office space in North America to increase efficiencies and support increased employee flexibility. These actions will result in the realization of annual operating expense savings of approximately $60 million to $80 million when fully implemented. Our guidance does not assume a material benefit in fiscal 2022. In the June quarter, we reported approximately $95 million of charges associated with this initiative. 
Moving now to our adjusted results for the first quarter, beginning with our consolidated results which can be found on Slide 7. First quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.56, an increase of 101% compared to the prior year. This result was driven by the recovery in prescription volumes in primary care patient visits from the COVID-19 pandemic as we lap the most significant pandemic impacts and lockdowns in Q1 of fiscal 2021. It also included a lower tax rate and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs with the U.S. government. 
Consolidated revenues of $62.7 billion increased 13% to the prior year, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from retail national account customers and price increases on branded and specialty pharmaceuticals, which is partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, up 19% compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 6% year-over-year, led by higher operating expenses to support growth in our core businesses and strategic investments, partially offset by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 55% compared to the prior year, which reflects double-digit growth in each segment. 
Interest expense was $49 million in the quarter, a decline of 18% compared to the prior year, driven by the retirement of approximately $1 billion of long-term debt in fiscal 2021. Our adjusted tax rate was 11.3% for the quarter due to discrete tax items that were recorded during the quarter. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged. And our first quarter diluted weighted average shares were 158 million, a decrease of 3% year-over-year driven by $1 [ billion ] of shares repurchased in the first quarter. 
Moving now to our first quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 8 through 12, and I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $50 billion, an increase of 12% and driven by higher volumes from retail national account customers and price increases on branded and specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 16% to $682 million, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and growth in specialty products distribution, to our providers and health care systems, which was partially offset by higher operating costs in support of the company's oncology growth initiative. 
Turning to Prescription Technology Solutions. We're very pleased with the strong growth and scale that we're building in this higher-margin segment. The drivers for our Prescription Technology Solutions businesses continue to move in the right direction. First, we're seeing expansion in many of our services businesses as we continue to add more manufacturing partners and programs for our existing solutions such as electronic prior authorization, our access and adherence services and 3PL. 
Second, our technology-based platforms, like Relay Health support, 19 billion clinical and financial transactions annually, from claims routing in the growing discount card market to alerts and [indiscernible] to make the practice of pharmacy clinically safer and administratively more efficient. 
And we continue to invest and innovate to build a connected ecosystem of biopharma services, our next-generation access and adherence solution, AMP, is showing accelerated adoption and growth with new brands. This year, AMP is bringing its network-enabled approach to hub services to support our oncology and specialty drugs covered under the medical benefit. 
We also continue to expand our clinical decision support capabilities in provider office workflow across every major EHR. Our technology network spans every touch point in the patient journey, from doctor's office to benefit verification to dispensing pharmacy, which allows us to address barriers in the patient journey by adding unique automation that accelerates time to therapy and lowers patients' out-of-pocket costs. 
In the June quarter, revenues were $881 million, an increase of 34%. And adjusted operating profit increased 62% to $139 million, driven by higher volumes of technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers, organic growth from access and adherence solutions and recovery of prescription volumes on the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 40%, driven by improvements in primary care patient visits and increased sales of COVID-19 tests. The contribution for our contract with U.S. government to prepare and distribute ancillary supplies related to the COVID-19 vaccine provided a benefit of approximately $0.25 in the quarter and were above our original expectations. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 107% to $257 million, driven by improvements in primary care patient visits and the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. 
Next, let me speak about International. Revenues in the quarter were $9.2 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, Segment revenue increased 28% year-over-year and was up 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. Revenue was primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, and the recovery of pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
First quarter adjusted operating profit increased 133% year-over-year to $170 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 107% to $151 million, led by the recovery of pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and test kits in Europe and Canada. 
Moving on to corporate. For the quarter, adjusted corporate expenses were $154 million, a decrease of 7% year-over-year, driven by decreased opioid litigation expenses. We reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $35 million for the first quarter. We continue to estimate fiscal 2022 opioid-related litigation expenses to approximate $155 million. 
I would remind you that while we've negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement, until we know the scope of participation in proposed settlement, we are not in a position to revise our opioid litigation expenses outlook. 
Let me now turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.8 billion. As a reminder, our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow vary from quarter-to-quarter and are impacted by timing, including the day and the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We made $159 million of capital expenditures in the quarter, which includes investments in technology, data and analytics to support our strategic initiatives on the -- of oncology and biopharma services. 
As our business performed at a very high level, we were also able to return $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders in the June quarter. This included $1 billion of share repurchases, pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program, which resulted in an initial delivery of 4.3 million shares in the quarter. Additionally, we paid $69 million in dividends. We have $1.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization, and we're updating our guidance for diluted weighted shares outstanding to range from $154 million to $156 million for fiscal 2022, which incorporates plans to repurchase an additional $1 billion of stock over the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Let me transition and speak to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2022. For a full list of fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to Slide 16 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation. I'll begin by reiterating a couple of key macro level assumptions that underpin our fiscal 2022 outlook. 
We expect prescription and patient engagement volumes will demonstrate steady improvement from the levels at the end of our fiscal 2021 through the first half of our fiscal 2022 and returned to pre-COVID levels in the second half of our fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2022, our updated guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share is a range of $19.80 to $20.40, up from our previous range of $18.85 to $19.45, approximately equally split between our first and second half of the fiscal year. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 15% to 18.5% growth from the prior year, and our guidance assumes core growth across all of our segments. 
In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we now expect revenue to increase 5% to 8% and adjusted operating profit to deliver 4.5% to 7.5% growth over the prior year. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment continues to exhibit stable fundamentals. Our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing remains consistent with the prior year from mid-single-digit increases in fiscal 2022. And the generics market remains competitive yet stable as volumes have shown signs of recovery. 
COVID-19 vaccine contribution contributed approximately $0.30 in the first quarter of fiscal '22. We are updating our full year outlook to approximately $0.45 to $0.55. The $0.45 to $0.55 range reflects anticipated contribution of earnings for the fair value of services performed as the U.S. government's centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines, including work preparing vaccines for international missions. Our current outlook remains aligned to the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the U.S. government, which excludes booster shots and vaccines for pediatrics, which have not been approved by the FDA. 
We will continue to invest in our leading and differentiated position in oncology. These investments will represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. Normalizing for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and our ongoing growth investments, we continue to expect approximately 5% to 8% core adjusted operating profit growth. 
In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we see revenue growth of 20% to 25% and adjusted operating profit growth of 17% to 22%. This growth reflects the opportunities we see to accelerate service and transaction contributions benefiting from our technology platforms. 
Now transitioning to Medical Surgical. We continue to partner with the U.S. government under our contract for the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies, and are updating our outlook to $0.35 to $0.45 of contribution in the segment related to kitting and distribution. This program's scope and duration is evolving, and our updated assumptions reflects the current outlook provided by the U.S. government. 
Our revenue outlook assumes a 3% decline to 3% growth, and adjusted operating profit to deliver 6% to 12% growth over the prior year. We continue to expect year-over-year core adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 10% to 16%. 
Finally, in the International segment, our revenue guidance was a 1% decline to 4% growth as compared to the prior year. And as a reminder, this reflects the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. For adjusted operating profit, our guidance has growth in the segment of 26% to 30% due to the previously mentioned benefit from the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization, which followed the announcement of our agreement to sell certain European assets. Our strong performance in the first quarter and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment. 
Turning now to the consolidated view. Our guidance assumes 4% to 7% revenue growth and 7% to 10% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. And we continue to expect corporate expenses in the range of $670 million to $720 million. 
Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We were pleased to recently announce the completion of a cash-funded upsized tender offer. This successful tender offer resulted in the early retirement of $922 million of our outstanding debt. Additionally, we announced the early retirement of a EUR 600 million note for a total reduction in debt of approximately $1.6 billion. These actions occurred during the beginning of our second quarter. It further strengthened our balance sheet and financial position and they are in line with our previously stated intent to modestly delever. And as a result of these actions, we're updating our interest expense guidance for fiscal 2022 to $180 million to $200 million. 
We're also reiterating our free cash flow guidance of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we anticipated a use of cash to purchase shares in McKesson Europe through exercises of a put rate option available to noncontrolling shareholders that expired in June of fiscal 2022. The remaining put rate options resulted in payments of approximately $1 billion in the quarter, which was generally in line with our expectations. As a reminder, this is reflected in the financing activity section of our cash flow statement. 
As a result of this activity, McKesson holds approximately 95% of McKesson Europe's outstanding common shares, and we anticipate income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the range of $175 million to $195 million in fiscal 2022. Our commitment to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was recently highlighted by our Board's approval of a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share. And our fiscal 2022 guidance continues to include share repurchases of approximately $2 billion for the full year. 
In closing, we're pleased with the strong results of our first quarter. We remain focused on driving growth as we invest against the strategic high-growth opportunities in oncology and biopharma services. This focus, combined with our commitment to further evolve the portfolio, will drive significant value to our customers, shareholders and patients. Our outlook for fiscal '22 reflects this focus and execution with healthy adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share growth and return of capital to our shareholders. 
And with that, Holly, let me turn it back to you for Q&A."

Now I'd remind you that this is our first quarter, and we had a very strong first quarter we're still in an evolving environment. We're very encouraged by the utilization trends and the improvement that we're seeing. 
As we think about our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, our growth, as I mentioned in my remarks, was driven in large part by the growth of our largest customers. So that does impact the mix and it certainly impacted the mix in the first quarter. 
And in our RxTS business, we have very healthy growth, as I mentioned, across all of our different capabilities. And some of the growth that we're seeing in that business, they're again, mix impacted by some of our 3PL growth. We're very encouraged by the growth of our access and adherence solutions, particularly our AMP product.

I think over the last years, we continue to invest in that capability. We have a very successful partnership in ClarusONE, and we're very confident that we have not just the scale but also the procurement expertise, that we have a very contemporary generic procurement operation that will continue to be a leading generic operation after the divestiture of the European assets that we've discussed.

With biosimilars, we think we are very well positioned given our strength in the specialty business and including the oncology elements of that. It's still, from our perspective, it's fairly early days. There's just under a dozen in the marketplace today. We think the pipeline does look good. And that given the assets we have in oncology and biopharma and our footprint in the specialty space, we will benefit from that. And we have seen a growing impact of biosimilars over the last several quarters. 
As it relates to oncology, we use the word ecosystem, and that's really just to try to introduce this notion that there are many assets that McKesson has related to our oncology businesses, whether it's distribution, specialty distribution, GPOs, health economic outcome, research. The latest addition to that portfolio of assets is the data and insights business that we call Ontada. 
And when we think of the oncology ecosystem, we think of these as all kind of self-reinforcing and adding momentum to each other. We add providers that add scale to GPO, that adds more customers and data to Ontada. As Ontada matures, as partnerships expand, we get more insights, we funnel that back to providers, which makes us a more attractive solution provider to them. 
So that's really how we're thinking about it. It's -- each into themselves is a good business we think. But together, we think there's real differentiation and strength."

Certainly, it's more profitable for us, and we'll see higher adoption rates. The adoption rates continue to build. And that, I think, is reflective of the growing operating profit contribution that we're seeing from biosimilars. But we do think longer term, there's a larger opportunity."

And so from -- just from a very macro utilization perspective, we're seeing the improvement that we expected to see. We're seeing it on the trajectory that we expected to see. And so we're very encouraged by that. 
Our businesses on each of our segments had very strong performance, and so we're very encouraged by that. It is our first quarter. Certainly, utilization will continue to evolve over the rest of the year. But we're very encouraged by that. The strong operating performance, the utilization that we're seeing, the patient activity that we're seeing, we expect that will continue, along the lines that we thought it would. 
Certainly, the vaccine distribution and kitting program continues to evolve, and it was a little bit higher than we had anticipated, and we've increased the guide for that. Generally speaking, utilization is strong. It's in line with what our expectations were, and we expect that will continue through the remainder of the year. 
And you had asked a question on tax. But the one thing that I would remind you on tax is we don't guide tax by quarter. We guide you on an annual basis. We did not change our guidance for the full year effective tax rate. And I think if you look over the last few years, the annual guidance around the tax rate that we've given has pretty much been in line with the original guide."

And so we're coming off a year of one of the most dynamic environments that we've ever operated in. And when we provided that guidance, we were very clear that our markets had not fully recovered. We expected that they would. But certainly, it was going to evolve over time. 
Our businesses continue to operate at a very high level. And I think you saw that in the performance this quarter. We're very encouraged by the utilization trends that we see. We're very encouraged by the performance that each of the businesses has shown. And we're seeing really good reaction and response to a lot of the products that we have, specifically in the RxTS business as an example.

Thank you for joining us on our first quarter call today. We are pleased to be reporting a strong start to our fiscal 2022, which reflects continued operating momentum across our businesses despite the fact that our markets are still recovering from the impacts of COVID-19. We're also making significant progress against our strategic priorities and our commitment to do what's in the best interest of you, our shareholders. 
Before we get to our first quarter results, I want to provide an update on the progress made towards the broad resolution of governmental opioid-related claims. On July 21 we announced that McKesson, along with 2 other distributors, negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement, which, if all conditions are satisfied, would result in a settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. 
This broad resolution -- if this broad agreement becomes effective, the agreement reached between the distributors and the state of New York and its participating subdivisions to settle opioid-related claims will become part of this broader settlement agreement. Under the negotiated proposed settlement agreement and subject to final state territorial and political subdivision participation, McKesson will pay up to $7.9 billion over a period of 18 years. Over the next several months, we will monitor participation of the eligible governmental entities to determine if participation levels are sufficient to proceed. 
This is an important development, and I am pleased with the progress we've made after years of negotiations. If we're able to reach a final settlement, it would provide immediate relief to thousands of communities across the United States that have been impacted by this public health crisis. While we strongly dispute the allegations made in these lawsuits, we believe that bringing resolution to these outstanding claims is in the best interest of those impacted by this crisis. We also believe resolution is in the best interest of our shareholders, and will allow us to further focus on the business and our role in protecting the safety and the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain. 
We remain committed to doing our part to fight against the opioid epidemic, through efforts to continuously enhance our anti-diversion programs and to advocate for reform at the state and national level. If the settlement cannot be finalized or plaintiffs instead choose to pursue their claims in court, we are prepared to litigate against those claims, and we remain confident in our defenses. 
We also recently announced that we entered into an agreement to sell several of our McKesson Europe businesses to the Phoenix Group, who we believe is the right and natural successor to McKesson and the ideal leader of these European businesses going forward. The agreement includes our McKesson Europe businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia, as well as our German AG headquarters in Stuttgart, our shared service center in Lithuania, our German wound care business and our equity stake in our joint venture in the Netherlands. This transaction is expected to close in fiscal 2023, subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. 
Our remaining European businesses in the U.K., Norway, Austria and Denmark were not included in this transaction and will continue to be operated by McKesson. However, we are exploring strategic alternatives for these remaining businesses as we align future investments to our growth strategies outside of Europe. We believe fully exiting Europe is another step towards becoming a more streamlined and efficient organization. 
Let me turn now to our performance in the quarter. We are continuing to see the operating momentum we discussed on our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, we're reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.56, ahead of our original expectations, resulting from the strength across our businesses and our roles in the COVID-19 response efforts across the geographies in which we operate. Our U.S. and international distribution businesses are playing an integral role in the pandemic response and our operational excellence and capabilities continue to be highlighted through our evolving partnership with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution efforts. 
 
Through July, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 185 million Moderna and J&J COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the United States, and our medical business has now assembled enough kits to support the administration of more than 785 million doses for all vaccine types. 
Also in the quarter, the U.S. government asked McKesson to support their mission of sending millions of COVID-19 vaccines to countries in need all around the globe. We are picking and packing Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines into temperature-controlled coolers and preparing these vaccines for pickup by international partners, all with the direction of the U.S. government. McKesson is not managing the actual shipments of vaccines to other countries. 
Through July, we successfully prepared over 65 million COVID-19 vaccines for shipment abroad. We are humbled and honored to serve the U.S. government in this expanded role. 
Our roles in Europe and Canada are also continuing to evolve, and we're partnering with local governments to distribute and administer COVID-19 vaccines there as well. Through July, we've distributed over 45 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across these geographies. Based on our first quarter results, our evolving roles in the COVID-19 response efforts and our confidence in our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal 2022, we are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to $19.80 to $20.40, from a previous range of $18.85 to $19.45. 
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're making significant progress against our strategic priorities. We're simplifying the portfolio and increasing our focus on areas where we have deep expertise and that are central to our long-term growth strategy. Our progress to date is underpinned by execution against our top company priorities. The first is a focus on the people and the culture. The second is our commitment to strengthen the core pharmaceutical and medical supply chain businesses. The third, our intentional efforts to simplify and streamline the business. And finally, we continue to invest, to advance our differentiated oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. Let me now touch briefly on the progress we're making across each of these priorities. 
First and foremost, we're prioritizing our people and advancing our company's culture as we strive to be recognized as an impact-driven organization and the best place to work in health care. We've been hard at work to transform and energize our company's culture. Our ICARE and ILEAD values serve as the foundation as we work toward our common goal, advancing health outcomes for all. 
As an organization, we're committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion. For the sixth consecutive year, McKesson was named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion. McKesson earned a top ranking score of 100 on the 2021 Disability Equality Index. In addition, we marked progress in diverse representation in the U.S. with female executive representation up 3% over the prior year and a 6% gain over the prior year in executive representation for persons of color. 
Our second company priority is to strengthen our core distribution businesses where we have market-leading scale and capabilities across North America. Success in the core enables strong cash flow generation, which we in turn use to reinvest in the business and to return capital to our shareholders. In addition to our work to help our customers and government partners in their pandemic response efforts, our pharmaceutical and medical surgical distribution businesses are continuing to improve, and the recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has been in line with our expectations. Elective procedures and primary care visits have improved throughout our first quarter and prescription volume trends are showing signs of improvement as well. 
Also positive are the trends we've seen across specialty and oncology patient visits, which were at or above pre-COVID baselines in the first quarter. And distribution volumes to our specialty provider customers continue to drive and support our growth. In our Canadian distribution business, our operational excellence and scale was recently recognized through a new partnership with one of Canada's largest retailers as a primary distribution customer. This is a testament to the strength of our supply chain in Canada. 
The renewed focus on growing the core has been enabled by our commitment to streamline the business over the past several years, efforts that go beyond our recent announcement to exit the European region, which I commented on in my opening remarks. Over the past several years, we've committed to transforming our operating model. We've centralized back-office functions across North America and Europe to further rationalize costs through a reduction of our owned retail pharmacy footprint and a commitment to lower spend across the organization. 
Throughout our enterprise, there's an initiative we called Spend Smart, which helped us achieve our 3-year cost reduction target of $400 million to $500 million of annual cost savings by the end of our fiscal 2021. Over time, we've identified businesses that are not central to McKesson's current strategic priorities or direction, as was the case in our exit of our position in Change Healthcare and the creation of a German wholesale joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. We will continually review our portfolio to ensure tight and focused alignment to our strategy. 
All of this work has enabled us to focus our time and investments on our strategic growth pillars, where we're working to build connected ecosystems in the growth areas of oncology and biopharma services, which serve to advance our already differentiated positions. We continue to be confident in the long-term outlook of businesses that operate in these high-growth markets. 
Starting with oncology, an ecosystem that McKesson has strategically built over a period of nearly 15 years, beginning with our acquisition of oncology therapeutics network all the way back in 2007, which added at that time, core specialty distribution capabilities. 10 years ago, we deepened the breadth and the depth of our offering with the acquisition of U.S. Oncology Network, which gave us practice management, site management for research and the iKnowMed EHR, which is one of the foundational pieces of Ontada.  
Fast forward to today, and we're now supporting over 14,000 specialty physicians through distribution and GPO services. We're also the leading distributor in community oncology space and have over 1,400 physicians in the U.S. oncology network spread over approximately 600 sites of care in the U.S. 
As innovative specialty therapies come to market, our leading position in oncology distribution enables us to grow our connected oncology ecosystem in parallel. As we grow our nonaffiliated and our U.S. oncology provider bases, we accelerate the growth of our oncology assets, such as GPO services, practice management, site management for clinical research, specialty pharmacy and our value proposition for Ontada, where we're providing real-world insight to both manufacturers and providers. 
Although in its infancy, Ontada's value is being recognized through expanded partnerships with manufacturers such as Amgen, and its leading role in a large-scale real-world research study known as MYLUNG, which aims to improve treatments and outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer. 
New therapies coming to market can also provide additional challenges for patients, providers and our biopharma partners. Our Prescription Technology Solutions business invests in innovation and aims to provide access, adherence and affordability solutions for over 500 brands across nearly every therapeutic area. Our connectivity to over 50,000 pharmacies, 750,000 providers and 75% of EHRs in the U.S. helps enable over 5 billion prescription -- $5 billion of prescription savings for patients each year. 
Prescription Technology Solutions ended fiscal 2021 with solid momentum. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we saw organic growth in the business and encouraging signs that patient engagement levels and prescription volume trends are continuing to improve. Our market-leading technology offerings are helping patients get access to therapies they need more quickly and efficiently and stay on those therapies longer to get better health outcomes. 
In closing, we believe that we've made significant strides against our strategic priorities of strengthening the core, simplifying the business and investing in our growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. Announcing the proposed opioid settlement agreement is an important development. In addition, our strategic intent to exit the European region positions us to become a more focused and agile company. We believe both are in the best interest of our employees, in the best interest of our customers and in the best interest of our shareholders. 
While it's early in the fiscal year and the pandemic continues to present unknowns, I'm confident in the fundamentals of the business and believe we are positioned well for long-term growth, and we'll look to build upon this momentum over the remainder of our fiscal 2022. Thank you for your time. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Britt, for a few additional comments."

I'm pleased to speak with you today about our strong first quarter results, which reflect the importance of the products and services McKesson delivers, the execution and momentum across our business, which includes supporting the U.S. government's COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine and kitting efforts, and the recovery of prescription volumes and patient visits impacted by the COVID pandemic in the prior year. 
I'll begin my remarks today by sharing an update on our European businesses, followed by our first quarter results, and I'll close with an update to our fiscal 2022 outlook. The summary of our first quarter results and updated guidance assumptions can be found in our earnings slide presentation, which is posted on the Investors section of our website. 
In early July, we announced an agreement to sell our European businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia to the Phoenix Group. This transaction includes our German AG headquarters in Stuttgart  and our European shared service center in Lithuania. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately USD 1.5 billion. The ultimate proceeds for this transaction are subject to certain adjustments under the agreement, therefore, the proceeds may differ from the purchase price. 
The assets involved in this transaction contributed approximately $12 billion in revenue and $75 million in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2021. We've determined that this transaction shall not qualify for discontinued operations. The net assets included in the transaction we've classified as held for sale. The held-for-sale accounting was effective at the start of our second quarter of this fiscal year. 
We will remeasure the net assets to the lower carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell, and we estimate that this will result in a GAAP-only charge of between $500 million to $700 million in our second quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to held-for-sale accounting treatment, we'll discontinue recording depreciation and amortization on the assets involved in the transaction. As a result of the held-for-sale accounting, we would guide to approximately $0.26 adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022. This will be included in our updated outlook, and I'll outline those later in my remarks. 
McKesson will operate these businesses and record revenue and income until the transaction is closed, which is expected to occur in fiscal 2023. We're committed to exploring strategic alternatives for our remaining European businesses, and we'll provide details on the plans for the remaining businesses as they become available. Exiting Europe at this time is the right course of action for McKesson and our shareholders, and it will sharpen the focus on our growth strategies of oncology and biopharma services as we develop and grow our connected ecosystem. 
Let me now turn to our first quarter results. Before I provide more details on our first quarter adjusted results, I want to point out 2 items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. 
First, during the June quarter, we committed to donate certain personal protective equipment and related products to charitable organizations to assist in COVID-19 recovery efforts. In the quarter, we recorded $155 million of pretax inventory charges within our Medical Surgical Solutions segment for inventory which we no longer intend to sell and will instead direct to previously mentioned charitable organizations. 
And secondly, on our May 6 earnings call, we outlined an initiative to rationalize office space in North America to increase efficiencies and support increased employee flexibility. These actions will result in the realization of annual operating expense savings of approximately $60 million to $80 million when fully implemented. Our guidance does not assume a material benefit in fiscal 2022. In the June quarter, we reported approximately $95 million of charges associated with this initiative. 
Moving now to our adjusted results for the first quarter, beginning with our consolidated results which can be found on Slide 7. First quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.56, an increase of 101% compared to the prior year. This result was driven by the recovery in prescription volumes in primary care patient visits from the COVID-19 pandemic as we lap the most significant pandemic impacts and lockdowns in Q1 of fiscal 2021. It also included a lower tax rate and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs with the U.S. government. 
Consolidated revenues of $62.7 billion increased 13% to the prior year, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from retail national account customers and price increases on branded and specialty pharmaceuticals, which is partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, up 19% compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 6% year-over-year, led by higher operating expenses to support growth in our core businesses and strategic investments, partially offset by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 55% compared to the prior year, which reflects double-digit growth in each segment. 
Interest expense was $49 million in the quarter, a decline of 18% compared to the prior year, driven by the retirement of approximately $1 billion of long-term debt in fiscal 2021. Our adjusted tax rate was 11.3% for the quarter due to discrete tax items that were recorded during the quarter. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged. And our first quarter diluted weighted average shares were 158 million, a decrease of 3% year-over-year driven by $1 billion of shares repurchased in the first quarter. 
Moving now to our first quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 8 through 12, and I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $50 billion, an increase of 12% and driven by higher volumes from retail national account customers and price increases on branded and specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 16% to $682 million, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and growth in specialty products distribution, to our providers and health care systems, which was partially offset by higher operating costs in support of the company's oncology growth initiative. 
Turning to Prescription Technology Solutions. We're very pleased with the strong growth and scale that we're building in this higher-margin segment. The drivers for our Prescription Technology Solutions businesses continue to move in the right direction. First, we're seeing expansion in many of our services businesses as we continue to add more manufacturing partners and programs for our existing solutions such as electronic prior authorization, our access and adherence services and 3PL. 
Second, our technology-based platforms, like Relay Health support, 19 billion clinical and financial transactions annually, from claims routing in the growing discount card market to alerts in addicts to make the practice of pharmacy clinically safer and administratively more efficient. 
And we continue to invest and innovate to build a connected ecosystem of biopharma services, our next-generation access and adherence solution, AMP, is showing accelerated adoption and growth with new brands. This year, AMP is bringing its network-enabled approach to hub services to support our oncology and specialty drugs covered under the medical benefit. 
We also continue to expand our clinical decision support capabilities in provider office workflow across every major EHR. Our technology network spans every touch point in the patient journey, from doctor's office to benefit verification to dispensing pharmacy, which allows us to address barriers in the patient journey by adding unique automation that accelerates time to therapy and lowers patients' out-of-pocket costs. 
In the June quarter, revenues were $881 million, an increase of 34%. And adjusted operating profit increased 62% to $139 million, driven by higher volumes of technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers, organic growth from access and adherence solutions and recovery of prescription volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 40%, driven by improvements in primary care patient visits and increased sales of COVID-19 tests. The contribution for our contract with U.S. government to prepare and distribute ancillary supplies related to the COVID-19 vaccine provided a benefit of approximately $0.25 in the quarter and were above our original expectations. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased 107% to $257 million, driven by improvements in primary care patient visits and the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. 
Next, let me speak about International. Revenues in the quarter were $9.2 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of our German wholesale business, segment revenue increased 28% year-over-year and was up 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. Revenue was primarily driven by the contribution of our German wholesale business to the joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, and the recovery of pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
First quarter adjusted operating profit increased 133% year-over-year to $170 million. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 107% to $151 million, led by the recovery of pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and test kits in Europe and Canada. 
Moving on to corporate. For the quarter, adjusted corporate expenses were $154 million, a decrease of 7% year-over-year, driven by decreased opioid litigation expenses. We reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $35 million for the first quarter. We continue to estimate fiscal 2022 opioid-related litigation expenses to approximate $155 million. 
I would remind you that while we've negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement, until we know the scope of participation in the proposed settlement, we are not in a position to revise our opioid litigation expenses outlook. 
Let me now turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion. During the quarter, we had negative free cash flow of $1.8 billion. As a reminder, our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow vary from quarter-to-quarter and are impacted by timing, including the day and the week that marks the close of a given quarter. We made $159 million of capital expenditures in the quarter, which includes investments in technology, data and analytics to support our strategic initiatives on the -- of oncology and biopharma services. 
As our business performed at a very high level, we were also able to return $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders in the June quarter. This included $1 billion of share repurchases, pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program, which resulted in an initial delivery of 4.3 million shares in the quarter. Additionally, we paid $69 million in dividends. We have $1.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization, and we're updating our guidance for diluted weighted shares outstanding to range from 154 million to 156 million for fiscal 2022, which incorporates plans to repurchase an additional $1 billion of stock over the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Let me transition and speak to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2022. For a full list of fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to Slide 16 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation. I'll begin by reiterating a couple of key macro level assumptions that underpin our fiscal 2022 outlook. 
We expect prescription and patient engagement volumes will demonstrate steady improvement from the levels at the end of our fiscal 2021 through the first half of our fiscal 2022 and return to pre-COVID levels in the second half of our fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2022, our updated guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share is a range of $19.80 to $20.40, up from our previous range of $18.85 to $19.45, approximately equally split between our first and second half of the fiscal year. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 15% to 18.5% growth from the prior year, and our guidance assumes core growth across all of our segments. 
In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we now expect revenue to increase 5% to 8% and adjusted operating profit to deliver 4.5% to 7.5% growth over the prior year. Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment continues to exhibit stable fundamentals. Our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing remains consistent with the prior year from mid-single-digit increases in fiscal 2022. And the generics market remains competitive yet stable as volumes have shown signs of recovery. 
COVID-19 vaccine contribution contributed approximately $0.30 in the first quarter of fiscal '22. We are updating our full year outlook to approximately $0.45 to $0.55. The $0.45 to $0.55 range reflects anticipated contribution of earnings for the fair value of services performed as the U.S. government's centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines, including work preparing vaccines for international missions. Our current outlook remains aligned to the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the U.S. government, which excludes booster shots and vaccines for pediatrics, which have not been approved by the FDA. 
We will continue to invest in our leading and differentiated position in oncology. These investments will represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. Normalizing for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and our ongoing growth investments, we continue to expect approximately 5% to 8% core adjusted operating profit growth. 
In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we see revenue growth of 20% to 25% and adjusted operating profit growth of 17% to 22%. This growth reflects the opportunities we see to accelerate service and transaction contributions benefiting from our technology platforms. 
Now transitioning to Medical Surgical. We continue to partner with the U.S. government under our contract for the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies, and are updating our outlook to $0.35 to $0.45 of contribution in the segment related to kitting and distribution. This program's scope and duration is evolving, and our updated assumptions reflects the current outlook provided by the U.S. government. 
Our revenue outlook assumes a 3% decline to 3% growth, and adjusted operating profit to deliver 6% to 12% growth over the prior year. We continue to expect year-over-year core adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 10% to 16%. 
Finally, in the International segment, our revenue guidance was a 1% decline to 4% growth as compared to the prior year. And as a reminder, this reflects the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. For adjusted operating profit, our guidance has growth in the segment of 26% to 30% due to the previously mentioned benefit from the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization, which followed the announcement of our agreement to sell certain European assets, our strong performance in the first quarter and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment. 
Turning now to the consolidated view. Our guidance assumes 4% to 7% revenue growth and 7% to 10% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. And we continue to expect corporate expenses in the range of $670 million to $720 million. 
Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We were pleased to recently announce the completion of a cash-funded upsized tender offer. This successful tender offer resulted in the early retirement of $922 million of our outstanding debt. Additionally, we announced the early retirement of a EUR 600 million note for a total reduction in debt of approximately $1.6 billion. These actions occurred during the beginning of our second quarter. It further strengthened our balance sheet and financial position and they are in line with our previously stated intent to modestly delever. And as a result of these actions, we're updating our interest expense guidance for fiscal 2022 to $180 million to $200 million. 
We're also reiterating our free cash flow guidance of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we anticipated a use of cash to purchase shares in McKesson Europe through exercises of a put rate option available to noncontrolling shareholders that expired in June of fiscal 2022. The remaining put rate options resulted in payments of approximately $1 billion in the quarter, which was generally in line with our expectations. As a reminder, this is reflected in the financing activity section of our cash flow statement. 
As a result of this activity, McKesson holds approximately 95% of McKesson Europe's outstanding common shares, and we anticipate income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the range of $175 million to $195 million in fiscal 2022. Our commitment to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was recently highlighted by our Board's approval of a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share. And our fiscal 2022 guidance continues to include share repurchases of approximately $2 billion for the full year. 
In closing, we're pleased with the strong results of our first quarter. We remain focused on driving growth as we invest against the strategic high-growth opportunities in oncology and biopharma services. This focus, combined with our commitment to further evolve the portfolio, will drive significant value to our customers, shareholders and patients. Our outlook for fiscal '22 reflects this focus and execution with healthy adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share growth and return of capital to our shareholders. 
And with that, Holly, let me turn it back to you for Q&A."

Now I'd remind you that this is our first quarter, and we had a very strong first quarter. We're still in an evolving environment. We're very encouraged by the utilization trends and the improvement that we're seeing. 
As we think about our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, our growth, as I mentioned in my remarks, was driven in large part by the growth of our largest customers. So that does impact the mix and it certainly impacted the mix in the first quarter. 
And in our RxTS business, we have very healthy growth, as I mentioned, across all of our different capabilities. And some of the growth that we're seeing in that business, they're again, mix impacted by some of our 3PL growth. We're very encouraged by the growth of our access and adherence solutions, particularly our AMP product.

I think over the last years, we continue to invest in that capability. We have a very successful partnership in ClarusONE, and we're very confident that we have not just the scale but also the procurement expertise, that we have a very contemporary generics procurement operation that will continue to be a leading generic operation after the divestiture of the European assets that we've discussed.

I'll maybe start with biosimilars and then round into the oncology question. 
In biosimilars, we think we are very well positioned given our strength in the specialty business and including the oncology elements of that. It's still, from our perspective, it's fairly early days. There's just under a dozen in the marketplace today. We think the pipeline does look good. And that given the assets we have in oncology and biopharma and our footprint in the specialty space, we will benefit from that. And we have seen a growing impact of biosimilars over the last several quarters. 
As it relates to oncology, we use the word ecosystem, and that's really just to try to introduce this notion that there are many assets that McKesson has that relate to our oncology businesses, whether it's distribution, specialty distribution, GPOs, health economic outcome, research. The latest addition to that portfolio of assets is the data and insights business that we call Ontada. 
And when we think of the oncology ecosystem, we think of these as all kind of self-reinforcing and adding momentum to each other. If we add providers that add scale to GPO, that adds more customers and data to Ontada. As Ontada matures, as partnerships expand, and we get more insights, we funnel that back to providers, which makes us a more attractive solution provider to them. 
So that's really how we're thinking about it. It's -- each into themselves is a good business, we think. But together, we think there's real differentiation and strength."

Certainly, it's more profitable for us, and we'll see higher adoption rates. The adoption rates continue to build. And that, I think, is reflective of the growing operating profit contribution that we're seeing from biosimilars. But we do think longer term, there's a larger opportunity."

We saw that. We saw that in the first quarter. And so that was in line with our expectations. We see that continuing to build and continuing to improve. 
And so from -- just from a very macro utilization perspective, we're seeing the improvement that we expected to see. We're seeing it on the trajectory that we expected to see. And so we're very encouraged by that. 
Our businesses, each of our segments had very strong performance, and so we're very encouraged by that. It is our first quarter. Certainly, utilization will continue to evolve over the rest of the year. But we're very encouraged by that. The strong operating performance, the utilization that we're seeing, the patient activity that we're seeing, we expect that will continue, along the lines that we thought it would. 
Certainly, the vaccine distribution and kitting program continues to evolve, and it was a little bit higher than we had anticipated, and we've increased the guide for that. Generally speaking, utilization is strong. It's in line with what our expectations were, and we expect that, that will continue through the remainder of the year. 
And you had asked a question on tax. But the one thing that I would remind you on tax is we don't guide tax by quarter. We guide you on an annual basis. We did not change our guidance for the full year effective tax rate. And I think if you look over the last few years, the annual guidance around the tax rate that we've given has pretty much been in line with the original guide."

And so we're coming off a year of one of the most dynamic environments that we've ever operated in. And when we provided that guidance, we were very clear that our markets had not fully recovered. We expected that they would. But certainly, it was going to evolve over time. 
Our businesses continue to operate at a very high level. And I think you saw that in the performance this quarter. We're very encouraged by the utilization trends that we see. We're very encouraged by the performance that each of the businesses has shown. And we're seeing really good reaction and response to a lot of the products that we have, specifically in the RxTS business as an example.

Thank you for joining us on our second quarter call today. We are happy to report another strong quarter for McKesson, driven by continued market improvements and underlying fundamentals of our businesses. We achieved double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all 4 segments, based on a strong operating performance and alignment across the enterprise. As a result of our second quarter performance, our confidence in the second half of the fiscal year and McKesson's continued role in the COVID-19 response efforts, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $19.80 to $20.40 to a new range of $21.95 to $22.55. 
We continue to believe we will see a return to pre-COVID pharmaceutical prescription and patient engagement levels in the second half of our current fiscal year. We're encouraged by the trends we continue to see across primary care, specialty and oncology patient visits in addition to overall prescription volumes. We are pleased to see our markets are recovering in line with our original expectations. 
Our enterprise-wide focus on our company priorities is driving operating performance and furthering the advancement of our long-term growth. I would like to take the time today to talk about each of our company's priorities.
First, we have a focus on our people and the culture, which is guided by our iCARE and iLEAD values. These values include a commitment to both our local and global communities, our customers and the health care industry to innovate and deliver opportunities that make our customers more successful, all for the better health of patients. 
Along with these values, we're committed to fostering an inclusive workplace that celebrates our differences and respects the diverse world in which we live and work. As an organization, we continue to be committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. Through a more diverse and inclusive workplace, we're a stronger, a more creative and a more productive team.
At McKesson, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and we're deeply committed to supporting our team members across the organization, which why I am incredibly pleased to have announced McKesson's first-ever day of wellness, which we call, Your Day, Your Way. This will take place this Friday, November 5. We understand that mental, physical and emotional well-being or the most importance to our team. So we made the decision to set aside a special day to help ensure our employees can rest, recharge and take time for themselves. We're so grateful for all contributions from the team over the last 19 months. McKesson employees continue to be in the center of the fight against COVID-19, and we want to make sure everyone gets a chance to take a well-deserved break.
Our second priority is to strengthen our core pharmaceutical and medical supply chain businesses. Across North America, we have a best-in-class pharmaceutical supply chain. As a reminder, in the U.S., we have a scale distribution presence that delivers roughly 1/3 of prescription medicines each day. Our operational excellence and our ability to leverage our scale with global suppliers is one of the many reasons why McKesson continues to be the partner of choice for hospitals, health systems and pharmacies of all size.
We strengthened our business when we strengthen our customers and partners. This past quarter, we held our annual McKesson Idea Share educational event, which brought together independent pharmacy operators to help them learn new skills, how to grow strategically and how to operate efficiently. The virtual experience helped 2,000 independent pharmacies prioritize education and networking, which we believe will shape the future of community pharmacy and strengthen the independent business for the better.
In Canada, we've been the leader in health care-related logistics and distribution for 100 years, and we support hospitals, community and retail pharmacies to ensure that medication is always available. We're a leader in medical distribution to alternate site markets, and our footprint in the U.S. health care is underpinned by our strong sourcing and supply chain capabilities. We deliver medical and surgical supplies and services to over 250,000 customers. Our pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses continue to play an integral role in the pandemic response efforts, and our capabilities have been highlighted through our evolving partnership with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs.
I'm glad to say that the fundamentals in our core business remains solid, and our execution has continued to improve as we accelerate our growth and work to deliver high quality, resilient supply chains to our customers. 
Our third company priority is to simplify and streamline the business. We're prioritizing the areas where we have deep expertise and are central to our long-term growth strategies, largely within the North American market. As a result, we made the decision to fully exit McKesson's businesses in the European region. In July, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our European businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia to the PHOENIX Group. Today, we're announcing that McKesson has made the decision to sell our U.K. retail and distribution businesses as a whole. The transaction is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. We believe this step toward a full exit of our European business is an important milestone in our strategy as a streamlined efficient, focused organization.
Building upon the foundation of a strong company culture and a stable business, the last company priority encompasses our 2 strategic growth pillars. We are investing to advance our oncology and biopharma services, which includes building integrated ecosystems that leverage our differentiated assets and capabilities and our strategic focus on these 2 pillars is important as both of these areas have good inherent growth opportunities. 
McKesson's oncology ecosystem supports over 14,000 specialty physicians through distribution and GPO services, and we are the leading distributor in the community oncology space. We have over 1,400 physicians in the U.S. oncology network spread over approximately 600 sites of care in the U.S. 
Within our oncology ecosystem, Ontada generates insights at the intersection of technology and data and supports community providers with precised cancer care by improving patient outcomes and delivering evidence and insights to help accelerate life sciences research. The ecosystem helps the clinicians to provide better care in an increasingly complicated oncology care landscape by helping them grow their businesses, attract more patients and produce better health outcomes. We can then leverage interconnected technology and real-world insights to feed data back upstream to manufacturers, which can help them think about identifying new products, innovations and new markets.
Within the biopharma ecosystem, the Prescription Technology Solutions businesses leverage technology networks and access to provider workflows to serve biopharma and life sciences partners and patients. We have built this ecosystem over many years as it includes assets like RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and Rx Crossroads. It allows us to connect providers, payers and patients together to focus on access, adherence and affordability solutions.
Our 2 strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services are not just businesses or products, but fundamentally, a suite of solutions that solve long-standing problems in ways that bring more speed, impact and efficiency. We will continue to invest and accelerate the execution against those strategies, which support the long-term growth for McKesson. I'm confident in the progress against our company's priorities that they will enable the advancement of our growth.
Before I turn to our second quarter results, just a brief update on our Board of Directors. In September, our Board of Directors welcomed Dr. Richard Carmona as a new independent Director. Dr. Carmona has a strong focus on improving public health care and extensive experience in clinical sciences, health care management and emergency preparedness, which led to his nomination and unanimous Senate confirmation as the 17th Surgeon General of the United States from 2002 until 2006. Currently, Dr. Carmona is Chief of Health Innovations at Canyon Ranch and a Professor of Public Health at the University of Arizona, His hands-on health care experience will be invaluable for McKesson's Board of Directors. 
Now I want to turn to the business performance within the second quarter. We are pleased with our strong second quarter performance, and we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals in our business. Let me start with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where our solid results for the second quarter reflected continued improvement of prescription trends, which were in line with our expectations.
Within specialty oncology visits, we saw an exit rate of pre-COVID levels, which, again, was in line with our expectations. The U.S. Pharmaceutical segment saw a 12% adjusted operating profit growth, which was underpinned by the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and the contribution from our successful COVID-19 vaccine distribution operations. We are in a strong position to continue to support the government and private enterprise in the future for distributing COVID and flu vaccines, and our investments in the distribution business continue to be showcased through our successful vaccine response.
Through October 28, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 311 million Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the United States and to support the U.S. government's international donation mission.
In Prescription Technology Solutions, the business continued to perform well this quarter as our technology and service offerings have accelerated the support and growth of our biopharma customers and we've been successful in adding new brands to our platforms. The segment had excellent momentum and delivered a 38% increase to adjusted operating profit growth during the second quarter. In addition to the operational strength, I'm proud to say that we are helping patients get access to the therapies through our market-leading technology offerings in this segment.
In Medical-Surgical, we saw an increase in COVID-19 tests, an improvement in patient care visits and we announced we are expanding our work with the U.S. government through a new kitting and storage contract. Our Medical-Surgical business remains well positioned to continue to support the government as needed. The growth in our Medical-Surgical segment is reflective of strong top line performance and underlying business improvement.
As it relates to international, the segment had solid adjusted operating profit growth, benefiting from both local COVID programs and a new partnership with one of Canada's largest retailers. We are partnering with local governments to distribute and administer COVID-19 vaccines. And through September, we've distributed over 58 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across our international geographies.
As a reminder, excluding our planned divestitures in Europe, we have businesses in Norway, Austria, Denmark and Canada in our International segment. For our remaining European businesses, we are exploring strategic alternatives as we align future investments to our growth strategies.
Before I close, I'd like to update you on the status of the proposed opioid settlement. Recently, we announced that enough states have agreed to settle to proceed to the next phase, which is the subdivision sign-on period. During this phase, each participating state will offer its political subdivisions, including those that have not sued, the opportunity to participate in the settlement for an additional 120-day period, which ends January 2, 2022. We are pleased with this important step, and we believe the settlement framework will allow us to focus our attention and resources on the safe and secure delivery of medications and therapies while expediting the delivery of meaningful relief to the affected communities.
In closing, I'm encouraged as we continue to make progress and accelerate growth as we advance our company priorities. Our underlying distribution business have stable fundamentals, great teams and strong execution. We're investing in what we believe are 2 good growth markets where we have differentiated capabilities, and we look forward to sharing more of those successes and proof points with you at our upcoming Investor Day.
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Britt for a few additional comments."

I'm pleased to be here today to discuss our fiscal second quarter results, which reflects strong performance and momentum across the business, driven by operational excellence and execution against our growth strategies. This momentum can be seen in each of our segments. A summary of our second quarter results and updated guidance assumptions can be found in our earnings slide presentation, which is posted on the Investors section of our website.
Let me start with an update on Europe. This morning, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to divest our retail and distribution businesses in the U.K. to Aurelius for approximately $438 million. The ultimate proceeds from this transaction are subject to certain adjustments under the agreement. Therefore, the proceeds may differ from the announced purchase price. 
McKesson will continue to operate these businesses and record revenue and income until the transaction is closed, which is expected to occur in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, pursuant to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. The assets involved in this transaction contributed approximately $7.8 billion in revenue and $64 million in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2021. The net assets included in the transaction will be classified as held-for-sale. The held-for-sale accounting will be effective beginning with our fiscal 2022 third quarter. We will remeasure the net assets to the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. And we estimate that this will result in a GAAP-only charge of between $700 million to $900 million in our third quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to held-for-sale accounting treatment, we will discontinue recording depreciation and amortization on the assets involved in the transaction. This impact is not included in the fiscal 2022 outlook provided today.
This transaction provides us the focus to pursue the growth strategies of oncology and biopharmaceutical services in North America. And as Brian mentioned, we remain committed to a full exit of our European businesses, which includes announced transactions to the PHOENIX Group and Aurelius as well as our remaining operations in Norway, Austria and Denmark.
Let me now turn to our second quarter results. Before I provide more details on our second quarter adjusted results, I want to point out 2 additional items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. First, we recorded a GAAP-only after-tax charge of $472 million related to our agreement to sell certain European businesses to the PHOENIX Group to account for the remeasurement of the net assets, to the lower of carrying amount of fair value less cost to sell. This transaction is expected to close within the next 12 months. Also during the quarter, we recorded an after-tax loss of $141 million on debt extinguishment related to the successful completion of a bond tender offer. 
Moving now to our adjusted results for the second quarter, beginning with our consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 7. Our second quarter results were highlighted by strong operating performance, which included record revenue and double-digit adjusted operating profit growth across all segments. We are encouraged by the ongoing market improvement in both prescription volumes and patient visits, which we observed in our second quarter. These improvements are supported by our strategic agenda, setting us on a path of disciplined growth.
In our work to support the U.S. government's COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine efforts continues to contribute to growth in addition to the momentum we have built across the business. Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.15, an increase of 28% compared to the prior year. This result was driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution and growth in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, partially offset by a higher tax rate. 
Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $97 million or $0.46 per diluted share associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments as compared to $49 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Consolidated revenues of $66.6 billion increased 9% above the prior year, principally driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to increased pharmaceutical volumes, including growth in specialty products and our largest retail national account customers and partially offset by branded to generic conversions.
Adjusted gross profit was $3.3 billion for the quarter, up 12% compared to the prior year. Comparable adjusted gross margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 4% year-over-year and adjusted operating profit of $1.3 billion for the quarter was an increase of 34% compared to the prior year and reflected double-digit growth in each segment.
Interest expense was $45 million in the quarter, a decline of 10% compared to the prior year, driven by the net reduction of debt in the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. In wrapping up our consolidated results, second quarter diluted weighted average shares were $155.8 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year.
Moving now to our second quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 8 through 13, and I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $53.4 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year as increased pharmaceutical volumes, including growth in specialty products and our largest retail national account customers, were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 12% to $735 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government related to the distribution of COVID-19 provided a benefit of approximately $0.28 per share in the quarter, which was above our original expectations.
In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $932 million, an increase of 40%, driven by higher biopharma service offerings, including third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. Adjusted operating profit increased 38% to $144 million, driven by organic growth from access and adherence solutions.
Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 23%, driven by increased sales of COVID-19 tests and growth in the primary care business. Adjusted operating profit increased 52% to $319 million, driven by growth in the primary care business, increased sales of COVID-19 tests and the contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.14 per share in the quarter, which was above our original expectations.
Next, let me address our international results. Revenues in the quarter were $9.1 billion, a decrease of 5% primarily driven by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, partially offset by volume increases in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses. Excluding the impact of the contribution of our German wholesale business, which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, segment revenue increased 13% year-over-year and was up 9% on an FX adjusted basis. Adjusted operating profit increased 41% year-over-year to $163 million.
On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 34% to $155 million, driven by the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization on certain European assets classified as held-for-sale beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The held-for-sale accounting in our international business contributed $0.13 to adjusted earnings in our second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Moving on to corporate. Adjusted corporate expenses were $83 million, a decrease of 39% year-over-year, driven by gains of approximately $97 million or $0.46 from equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. This quarter, we had fair value adjustments related to multiple portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. Compared to fiscal 2021, gains from McKesson Ventures contributed $0.24 year-over-year.
As previously discussed, it's difficult to predict when gains or losses on our ventures portfolio of companies may occur. And therefore, our practice has been and will continue to be to not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our guidance. We also reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $36 million for the second quarter and anticipate that fiscal 2022 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $155 million. Consistent with the proposed settlement announced in July, we also made the first annual payment into escrow of approximately $354 million during the quarter.
Let me now turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion. And for the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we had negative free cash flow of $109 million. In Q2, we completed several debt transactions. In July, we redeemed a 600 million euro-denominated note prior to maturity. In August, we completed a cash-funded upsized tender offer, which resulted in the redemption of $922 million principal outstanding debt. And finally, we completed a public offering of a note in the principal amount of $500 million at 1.3%. These actions align with our previously stated intent to modestly delever and to further strengthen our balance sheet and financial position.
Year-to-date, we made $279 million of capital expenditures which included investments to support our strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. For the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we returned $1.4 billion in cash to our shareholders through $1.3 billion of share repurchases and the payment of $134 million in dividends. We have $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization, and continue to expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to range from 154 million to 156 million for full 2022. 
Let me transition now and speak to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. For our full list of fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to Slide 16 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation. As a result of our strong first half performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance range for fiscal 2022 to $21.95 to $22.55, which is up from our previous range of $19.80 to $20.40. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 27.5% to 31% growth from the prior year, and our guidance assumes growth across all of our segments.
Additionally, fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance includes $2.30 to $3.05 of impacts attributable to the following items: $0.50 to $0.70 related to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, which is an increase from the previous range of $0.45 to $0.55; $0.80 to $1.10 related to the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, an increase from the previous range of $0.50 to $0.70 as discussed at a recent conference; $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests and impairments for PPE-related products; and approximately $0.49 from gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments within our Corporate segment year-to-date. Excluding the impacts of these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 20% to 29% forecasted growth.
Let me provide a few additional assumptions related to our guidance. We continue to expect prescription and patient engagement volumes will return to pre-COVID levels in the second half of fiscal 2022, which is in line with our original guidance. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we now expect revenue to increase 8% to 11% and adjusted operating profit to deliver 4.5% to 7.5% growth over the prior year.
We continue to see stable fundamentals. Specifically, our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing remains consistent with our original guidance and the prior year of mid-single-digit increases in fiscal 2022. And our view is that the generics market remains competitive, yet stable, as our volumes have continued to improve in the September quarter. Our guidance includes contribution related to our role as a centralized distributor for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution. This includes work preparing vaccines for international missions.
Our current outlook remains aligned to the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the U.S. government. The current guidance excludes Booster shots due to the timing of the recent approvals as well as vaccines for pediatrics, which have not been approved by the CDC. We will continue to update you on the progress and contribution from this program.
When excluding COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment, we expect approximately 3% to 6% adjusted operating profit growth. In addition, our investments in our leading and differentiated position in oncology will continue to represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022.
In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we see revenue growth of 31% to 37%, and adjusted operating profit growth of 23% to 29%. This growth reflects the strong service and transaction momentum in the business.
Now transitioning to Medical-Surgical. Our revenue outlook assumes 8% to 14% growth and adjusted operating profit to deliver 35% to 45% growth over the prior year. As mentioned previously, our outlook includes $0.80 to $1.10 related to the contribution from the U.S. government's distribution of ancillary supply kits and storage programs and $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests and PPE impairments-related. products. Excluding the impacts from these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 13% to 19% forecasted growth.
One additional note related to our U.S. distribution businesses. One of the pillars of our enterprise strategy is talent, the ability to attract and retain the best workforce in health care. The labor market remains competitive, and we have assumed a modest expense impact to ensure there is continued service continuity through the holiday season and the back half of our fiscal year. Therefore, the guidance that we're providing today includes approximately $0.10 to $0.20 of adjusted operating expense impact for labor investments in our U.S. distribution businesses in the second half of the year.
Finally, in the International segment, our revenue guidance is 1% decline to 4% growth as compared to the prior year. As a reminder, this reflects the impact of the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. For adjusted operating profit, our guidance reflects growth in the segment of 39% to 43%, which includes approximately $0.38 of expected adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022 as a result of the held-for-sale accounting related to our agreement to sell certain European assets to the PHOENIX Group. It also includes our strong performance in the second quarter and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment.
Turning now to the consolidated view. Our increased guidance assumes 8% to 11% revenue growth and 18% to 22% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged, and we anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $610 million to $660 million.
On our May 6 earnings call, we outlined an initiative to rationalize office space in North America, to increase efficiencies and to support employee flexibility. We've made good progress against this initiative. And based on this progress, we now expect earlier benefits from these actions, resulting in the realization of annual operating expense savings of approximately $15 million to $25 million in the second half of fiscal 2022, with annual savings of $50 million to $70 million when fully implemented. These savings will be realized across all of our segments.
Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We expect free cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion in fiscal 2022, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, historically, we generate the majority of our cash flows in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.
This strong cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach, investing in our strategies of oncology and biopharma services, positioning our business for long-term growth while remaining committed to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Our investment-grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility.
In closing, we are encouraged by our strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year. The momentum across the business, including our partnership with the U.S. government, positions us to deliver the updated fiscal 2022 outlook provided here today. Finally, we're looking forward to providing additional details on our strategies and the strength of our businesses at our upcoming Investor Day on December 8.

As it relates to your question, Mike, what we've really tried to do here is to provide you some clarity on those items that are related to our distribution of COVID vaccines and ancillary kits as well as the increase that we've seen in COVID test kits, which have varied quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter. Over the last year, we've tried to isolate those for you so that you can have a good view into the operations of our core business.
I would remind you that the first quarter this year was lapping a very low quarter from the prior year, which was really the first quarter post the COVID pandemic. So the growth that you're seeing this year, while strong, includes the first quarter, which lapped a very low quarter due to COVID in FY '21. So we'll provide more detail for you on sort of the core components of each of the segments at our Investor Day.

I mean I think one of the tenants we've always held through multiple changes and dynamics in the industry over my career here is that our services provide real value. And regardless of how what sort of mechanisms get changed in the marketplace, we will continue to be paid fair market value for those services.
As it relates to the public policy debate and it's a dynamic now as ever, I suppose, I think the main issues that we're discussing are issues that, frankly, have been long discussed. I mean we are active at the company with elected officials on both sides of the aisle on key policy priorities. We track these discussions very carefully. We're always advocating for the role of care being provided in the community.
We obviously have very strong presences in the community channels, but we believe that fundamentally, that's where you get the best access, the best care and equally good quality. We have been at the forefront in many of the experiments, I suppose you could call them, think about Usan and our value-based care. We've had robust participation in the oncology care model that's delivered substantial benefit to CMS. 
So I think the mix is -- it's really -- it's not exactly clear where this will go. I think we have a lot of assets. We're engaged in the discussion. We'll find a way to navigate through them as they unfold. I mean, right now, I think these issues have been long discussed and well discussed."

Thank you for joining us on our second quarter call today. We are happy to report another strong quarter for McKesson driven by continued market improvements and underlying fundamentals of our businesses. W",2004,"Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter call today. We are happy to report another strong quarter for McKesson driven by continued market improvements and underlying fundamentals of our businesses. We achieved double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all 4 segments based on a strong operating performance and alignment across the enterprise. As a result of our second quarter performance, our confidence in the second half of the fiscal year and McKesson's continued role in the COVID-19 response efforts, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $19.80 to $20.40 to a new range of $21.95 to $22.55.
We continue to believe we will see a return to pre-COVID pharmaceutical prescription and patient engagement levels in the second half of our current fiscal year. We're encouraged by the trends we continue to see across primary care, specialty and oncology patient visits, in addition to overall prescription volumes. We are pleased to see our markets are recovering in line with our original expectations. Our enterprise-wide focus on our company priorities is driving operating performance and furthering the advancement of our long-term growth. I would like to take the time today to talk about each of our company's priorities. 
First, we have a focus on our people and the culture, which is guided by our ICARE and ILEAD values. These values include a commitment to both our local and global communities, our customers and the health care industry to innovate and deliver opportunities that make our customers more successful, all for the better health of patients.
Along with these values, we're committed to fostering an inclusive workplace that celebrates our differences and respects the diverse world in which we live and work. As an organization, we continue to be committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. Through a more diverse and inclusive workplace, we're a stronger, a more creative and a more productive team.
At McKesson, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees, and we're deeply committed to supporting our team members across the organization, which is why I am incredibly pleased to have announced McKesson's first-ever day of wellness, which we call Your Day, Your Way. This will take place this Friday, November 5. We understand that mental, physical and emotional well-being are of the most importance to our team, so we made the decision to set aside a special day to help ensure our employees can rest, recharge and take time for themselves. We're so grateful for all the contributions from the team over the last 19 months. McKesson employees continue to be in the center of the fight against COVID-19, and we want to make sure everyone gets a chance to take a well-deserved break.
Our second priority is to strengthen our core pharmaceutical and medical supply chain businesses. Across North America, we have a best-in-class pharmaceutical supply chain. As a reminder, in the U.S., we have a scale distribution presence that delivers roughly 1/3 of prescription medicines each day. Our operational excellence and our ability to leverage our scale with global suppliers is one of the many reasons why McKesson continues to be the partner of choice for hospitals, health systems and pharmacies of all size.
We strengthen our business when we strengthen our customers and partners. This past quarter, we held our annual McKesson ideaShare educational event, which brought together independent pharmacy operators to help them learn new skills, how to grow strategically and how to operate efficiently. The virtual experience helped 2,000 independent pharmacies prioritize education and networking, which we believe will shape the future of community pharmacy and strengthen the independent business for the better.
In Canada, we've been the leader in health care-related logistics and distribution for 100 years, and we support hospitals, community and retail pharmacies to ensure that medication is always available. We're a leader in medical distribution to alternate site markets, and our footprint in the U.S. health care is underpinned by our strong sourcing and supply chain capabilities. We deliver medical and surgical supplies and services to over 250,000 customers. Our pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses continue to play an integral role in the pandemic response efforts, and our capabilities have been highlighted through our evolving partnership with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs.
I'm glad to say that the fundamentals in our core business remains solid, and our execution has continued to improve as we accelerate our growth and work to deliver high-quality, resilient supply chains to our customers.
Our third company priority is to simplify and streamline the business. We're prioritizing the areas where we have deep expertise and are central to our long-term growth strategies, largely within the North American market. As a result, we made the decision to fully exit McKesson's businesses in the European region. In July, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our European businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia to the PHOENIX Group. Today, we're announcing that McKesson has made the decision to sell our U.K. retail and distribution businesses as a whole. The transaction is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. We believe this step toward a full exit of our European business is an important milestone in our strategy as a streamlined, efficient, focused organization. 
Building upon the foundation of a strong company culture and a stable business, the last company priority encompasses our 2 strategic growth pillars. We are investing to advance our oncology and biopharma services, which includes building integrated ecosystems that leverage our differentiated assets and capabilities, and our strategic focus on these 2 pillars is important as both of these areas have good inherent growth opportunities. 
McKesson's oncology ecosystem supports over 14,000 specialty physicians through distribution and GPO services, and we are the leading distributor in the community oncology space. We have over 1,400 physicians in the U.S. oncology network spread over approximately 600 sites of care in the U.S.
Within our oncology ecosystem, Ontada generates insights at the intersection of technology and data and supports community providers with precise cancer care by improving patient outcomes and delivering evidence and insights to help accelerate life sciences research. The ecosystem helps the clinicians to provide better care in an increasingly complicated oncology care landscape by helping them grow their businesses, attract more patients and produce better health outcomes. We can then leverage interconnected technology and real-world insights to feed data back upstream to manufacturers which can help them think about identifying new products, innovations and new markets. 
Within the biopharma ecosystem, the Prescription Technology Solutions businesses leverage technology networks and access to provider workflows to serve biopharma and life sciences partners and patients. We have built this ecosystem over many years as it includes assets like RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads. It allows us to connect providers, payers and patients together to focus on access, adherence and affordability solutions.
Our 2 strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services are not just businesses or products, but fundamentally, a suite of solutions that solve long-standing problems in ways that bring more speed, impact and efficiency. We will continue to invest and accelerate the execution against those strategies which support the long-term growth for McKesson. I'm confident in the progress against our company's priorities that they will enable the advancement of our growth. 
Before I turn to our second quarter results, just a brief update on our Board of Directors. In September, our Board of Directors welcomed Dr. Richard Carmona as a new independent director. Dr. Carmona has a strong focus on improving public health care and extensive experience in clinical sciences, health care management and emergency preparedness, which led to his nomination and unanimous Senate confirmation as the 17th Surgeon General of the United States from 2002 until 2006. Currently, Dr. Carmona is Chief of Health Innovations at Canyon Ranch and a professor of public health at the University of Arizona. His hands-on health care experience will be invaluable for McKesson's Board of Directors.
Now I want to turn to the business performance within the second quarter. We are pleased with our strong second quarter performance, and we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals in our business. 
Let me start with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where our solid results for the second quarter reflected continued improvement of prescription trends, which were in line with our expectations. Within specialty oncology visits, we saw an exit rate of pre-COVID levels, which, again, was in line with our expectations. The U.S. Pharmaceutical segment saw a 12% adjusted operating profit growth, which was underpinned by the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and the contribution from our successful COVID-19 vaccine distribution operations. We are in a strong position to continue to support the government and private enterprise in the future for distributing COVID and flu vaccines, and our investments in the distribution business continue to be showcased through our successful vaccine response. Through October 28, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business has successfully distributed over 311 million Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to administration sites across the United States and to support the U.S. government's international donation mission. 
In Prescription Technology Solutions, the business continued to perform well this quarter as our technology and service offerings have accelerated the support and growth of our biopharma customers, and we've been successful in adding new brands to our platforms. The segment had excellent momentum and delivered a 38% increase to adjusted operating profit growth during the second quarter. In addition to the operational strength, I'm proud to say that we are helping patients get access to the therapies through our market-leading technology offerings in this segment. 
In Medical-Surgical, we saw an increase in COVID-19 tests, an improvement in patient care visits, and we announced we are expanding our work with the U.S. government through a new kitting and storage contract. Our Medical-Surgical business remains well positioned to continue to support the government as needed. The growth in our Medical-Surgical segment is reflective of strong top line performance and underlying business improvement. 
As it relates to International, the segment had solid adjusted operating profit growth, benefiting from both local COVID programs and a new partnership with one of Canada's largest retailers. We are partnering with local governments to distribute and administer COVID-19 vaccines. And through September, we've distributed over 58 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across our international geographies. As a reminder, excluding our planned divestitures in Europe, we have businesses in Norway, Austria, Denmark and Canada in our International segment. For our remaining European businesses, we are exploring strategic alternatives as we align future investments to our growth strategies. 
Before I close, I'd like to update you on the status of the proposed opioid settlement. Recently, we announced that enough states have agreed to settle to proceed to the next phase, which is the subdivision sign-on period. During this phase, each participating state will offer its political subdivisions, including those that have not sued, the opportunity to participate in the settlement for an additional 120-day period, which ends January 2, 2022. We are pleased with this important step, and we believe the settlement framework will allow us to focus our attention and resources on the safe and secure delivery of medications and therapies while expediting the delivery of meaningful relief to the affected communities. 
In closing, I'm encouraged as we continue to make progress and accelerate growth as we advance our company priorities. Our underlying distribution business have stable fundamentals, great teams and strong execution. We're investing in what we believe are 2 good growth markets where we have differentiated capabilities, and we look forward to sharing more of those successes and proof points with you at our upcoming Investor Day. 
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Britt for a few additional comments."
288195,1683169065,2420645,"McKesson Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2021",2021-11-01,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss our fiscal second quarter results, which reflects strong performance and momentum across the business driven by operational excellence and execution against our growth",2777,"Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to discuss our fiscal second quarter results, which reflects strong performance and momentum across the business driven by operational excellence and execution against our growth strategies. This momentum can be seen in each of our segments. 
A summary of our second quarter results and updated guidance assumptions can be found in our earnings slide presentation, which is posted on the Investors section of our website. 
Let me start with an update on Europe. This morning, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to divest our retail and distribution businesses in the U.K. to Aurelius for approximately $438 million. The ultimate proceeds from this transaction are subject to certain adjustments under the agreement. Therefore, the proceeds may differ from the announced purchase price. 
McKesson will continue to operate these businesses and record revenue and income until the transaction is closed, which is expected to occur in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, pursuant to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. The assets involved in this transaction contributed approximately $7.8 billion in revenue and $64 million in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2021. The net assets included in the transaction will be classified as held for sale. The held-for-sale accounting will be effective beginning with our fiscal 2022 third quarter. We will remeasure the net assets to the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell, and we estimate that this will result in a GAAP-only charge of between $700 million to $900 million in our third quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to held-for-sale accounting treatment, we will discontinue recording depreciation and amortization on the assets involved in the transaction. This impact is not included in the fiscal 2022 outlook provided today. 
This transaction provides us the focus to pursue the growth strategies of oncology and biopharmaceutical services in North America. And as Brian mentioned, we remain committed to a full exit of our European businesses, which includes announced transactions to the PHOENIX Group and Aurelius, as well as our remaining operations in Norway, Austria and Denmark. 
Let me now turn to our second quarter results. Before I provide more details on our second quarter adjusted results, I want to point out 2 additional items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. First, we recorded a GAAP-only after-tax charge of $472 million related to our agreement to sell certain European businesses to the PHOENIX Group to account for the remeasurement of the net assets to the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. This transaction is expected to close within the next 12 months. Also, during the quarter, we recorded an after-tax loss of $141 million on debt extinguishment related to the successful completion of a bond tender offer. 
Moving now to our adjusted results for the second quarter, beginning with our consolidated results, which can be found on Slide 7. Our second quarter results were highlighted by strong operating performance, which included record revenue and double-digit adjusted operating profit growth across all segments. We are encouraged by the ongoing market improvement in both prescription volumes and patient visits which we observed in our second quarter. These improvements are supported by our strategic agenda, setting us on a path of disciplined growth. 
In our work to support the U.S. government's COVID-19 domestic and international vaccine and kitting efforts continues to contribute to growth, in addition to the momentum we have built across the business. 
Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.15, an increase of 28% compared to the prior year. This result was driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine and kitting distribution and growth in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share also includes net pretax gains of approximately $97 million or $0.46 per diluted share associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments as compared to $49 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. 
Consolidated revenues of $66.6 billion increased 9% above the prior year, principally driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to increased pharmaceutical volumes, including growth in specialty products and our largest retail national account customers and partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
Adjusted gross profit was $3.3 billion for the quarter, up 12% compared to the prior year. Comparable adjusted gross margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 4% year-over-year, and adjusted operating profit of $1.3 billion for the quarter was an increase of 34% compared to the prior year and reflected double-digit growth in each segment.
Interest expense was $45 million in the quarter, a decline of 10% compared to the prior year, driven by the net reduction of debt in the quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. 
In wrapping up our consolidated results, second quarter diluted weighted average shares were $155.8 million, a decrease of 5% year-over-year. 
Moving now to our second quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 8 through 13, and I'll start with U.S. Pharmaceutical. Revenues were $53.4 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year as increased pharmaceutical volumes, including growth in specialty products and our largest retail national account customers, were partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Adjusted operating profit increased 12% to $735 million driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government related to the distribution of COVID-19 provided a benefit of approximately $0.28 per share in the quarter, which was above our original expectations. 
In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $932 million, an increase of 40%, driven by higher biopharma service offerings, including third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes. Adjusted operating profit increased 38% to $144 million driven by organic growth from access and adherence solutions. 
Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 23%, driven by increased sales of COVID-19 tests and growth in the Primary Care business. Adjusted operating profit increased 52% to $319 million driven by growth in the Primary Care business, increased sales of COVID-19 tests and the contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. The contribution from our contract with the U.S. government related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.14 per share in the quarter, which was above our original expectations. 
Next, let me address our International results. Revenues in the quarter were $9.1 billion, a decrease of 5%, primarily driven by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, partially offset by volume increases in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses. Excluding the impact of the contribution of our German wholesale business, which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, segment revenue increased 13% year-over-year and was up 9% on an FX-adjusted basis. Adjusted operating profit increased 41% year-over-year to $163 million.
On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit increased 34% to $155 million driven by the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization on certain European assets classified as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The held-for-sale accounting in our International business contributed $0.13 to adjusted earnings in our second quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Moving on to Corporate. Adjusted corporate expenses were $83 million, a decrease of 39% year-over-year, driven by gains of approximately $97 million or $0.46 from equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio. This quarter, we had fair value adjustments related to multiple portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures. Compared to fiscal 2021, gains from McKesson Ventures contributed $0.24 year-over-year. 
As previously discussed, it's difficult to predict when gains or losses on our Ventures portfolio of companies may occur. And therefore, our practice has been and will continue to be to not include Ventures portfolio impacts in our guidance. 
We also reported opioid-related litigation expenses of $36 million for the second quarter and anticipate that fiscal 2022 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $155 million. Consistent with the proposed settlement announced in July, we also made the first annual payment into escrow of approximately $354 million during the quarter. 
Let me now turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 14. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion. And for the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we had negative free cash flow of $109 million. In Q2, we completed several debt transactions. In July, we redeemed a 600 million euro-denominated note prior to maturity. In August, we completed a cash-funded upsized tender offer, which resulted in the redemption of $922 million principal outstanding debt. And finally, we completed a public offering of a note in the principal amount of $500 million at 1.3%. These actions align with our previously stated intent to modestly delever and to further strengthen our balance sheet and financial position. 
Year-to-date, we made $279 million of capital expenditures, which included investments to support our strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. For the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we returned $1.4 billion in cash to our shareholders through $1.3 billion of share repurchases and the payment of $134 million in dividends. We have $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization and continue to expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to range from 154 million to 156 million for fiscal 2022. 
Let me transition now and speak to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. For our full list of fiscal 2022 assumptions, please refer to Slides 16 through 19 in our supplemental slide presentation. As a result of our strong first half performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance range for fiscal 2022 to $21.95 to $22.55, which is up from our previous range of $19.80 to $20.40. Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 27.5% to 31% growth from the prior year, and our guidance assumes growth across all of our segments. 
Additionally, fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance includes $2.30 to $3.05 of impacts attributable to the following items: $0.50 to $0.70 related to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, which is an increase from the previous range of $0.45 to $0.55; $0.80 to $1.10 related to the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, an increase from the previous range of $0.50 to $0.70, as discussed at a recent conference; $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests and impairments for PPE-related products; and approximately $0.49 from gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments within our Corporate segment year-to-date. Excluding the impacts of these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 20% to 29% forecasted growth. 
Let me provide a few additional assumptions related to our guidance. We continue to expect prescription and patient engagement volumes will return to pre-COVID levels in the second half of our fiscal 2022, which is in line with our original guidance. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we now expect revenue to increase 8% to 11% and adjusted operating profit to deliver 4.5% to 7.5% growth over the prior year. 
We continue to see stable fundamentals. Specifically, our outlook for branded pharmaceutical pricing remains consistent with our original guidance and the prior year of mid-single-digit increases in fiscal 2022. And our view is that the generics market remains competitive, yet stable, as our volumes have continued to improve in the September quarter. 
Our guidance includes contribution related to our role as a centralized distributor for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution. This includes work preparing vaccines for international missions. Our current outlook remains aligned to the volume distribution schedule provided by the CDC and the U.S. government. The current guidance excludes booster shots due to the timing of the recent approvals, as well as vaccines for pediatrics, which have not been approved by the CDC. We will continue to update you on the progress and contribution from this program. When excluding COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment, we expect approximately 3% to 6% adjusted operating profit growth. In addition, our investments in our leading and differentiated position in oncology will continue to represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022. 
In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we see revenue growth of 31% to 37% and adjusted operating profit growth of 23% to 29%. This growth reflects the strong service and transaction momentum in the business. 
Now transitioning to Medical-Surgical. Our revenue outlook assumes 8% to 14% growth and adjusted operating profit to deliver 35% to 45% growth over the prior year. As mentioned previously, our outlook includes $0.80 to $1.10 related to the contribution from the U.S. government's distribution of ancillary supply kits and storage programs and $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests and PPE impairments-related products. Excluding the impacts from these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 13% to 19% forecasted growth. 
One additional note related to our U.S. distribution businesses. One of the pillars of our enterprise strategy is talent, the ability to attract and retain the best workforce in health care. The labor market remains competitive, and we have assumed a modest expense impact to ensure there is continued service continuity through the holiday season and the back half of our fiscal year. Therefore, the guidance that we're providing today includes approximately $0.10 to $0.20 of adjusted operating expense impact for labor investments in our U.S. distribution businesses in the second half of the year. 
Finally, in the International segment, our revenue guidance is 1% decline to 4% growth as compared to the prior year. As a reminder, this reflects the impact of the contribution of our German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. For adjusted operating profit, our guidance reflects growth in the segment of 39% to 43%, which includes approximately $0.38 of expected adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022 as a result of the held-for-sale accounting related to our agreement to sell certain European assets to the PHOENIX Group. It also includes our strong performance in the second quarter and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment. 
Turning now to the consolidated view. Our increased guidance assumes 8% to 11% revenue growth and 18% to 22% adjusted operating profit growth compared to fiscal 2021. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged, and we anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $610 million to $660 million. 
On our May 6 earnings call, we outlined an initiative to rationalize office space in North America, to increase efficiencies and to support employee flexibility. We've made good progress against this initiative. And based on this progress, we now expect earlier benefits from these actions, resulting in the realization of annual operating expense savings of approximately $15 million to $25 million in the second half of fiscal 2022 with annual savings of $50 million to $70 million when fully implemented. These savings will be realized across all of our segments. 
Let me now turn to cash flow and capital deployment. We expect free cash flow of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion in fiscal 2022, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. As a reminder, historically, we generate the majority of our cash flows in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. This strong cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility to execute a balanced capital allocation approach, investing in our strategies of oncology and biopharma services, positioning our business for long-term growth while remaining committed to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Our investment-grade credit rating remains a priority and underpins our financial flexibility.
In closing, we are encouraged by our strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year. The momentum across the business, including our partnership with the U.S. government, positions us to deliver the updated fiscal 2022 outlook provided here today. 
Finally, we're looking forward to providing additional details on our strategies and the strength of our businesses at our upcoming Investor Day on December 8.

I know one of the questions that I guess will come up is what that means into next year given that you outlined some of the benefits that you're seeing, specifically this year, that with all our states, we all hope that don't -- growth trajectory into next year. Is there any way to think about that $230 million to $305 million and how we have to think about that as a whole in terms of your overall growth versus what your core business will continue to do?"

So just to be clear on that, we did call out for you investments that we're making in labor in the back half of the year so that we can ensure the holiday season and the back half of the year for our customers has continuity.
As it relates to your question, Mike, what we've really tried to do here is to provide you some clarity on those items that are related to our distribution of COVID vaccines and ancillary kits, as well as the increase that we've seen in COVID test kits, which have varied quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter over the last year. We've tried to isolate those for you so that you can have a good view into the operations of our core business.
I would remind you that the first quarter this year was lapping a very low quarter from the prior year, which was really the first quarter post the COVID pandemic. So the growth that you're seeing this year, while strong, includes the first quarter, which lapped a very low quarter due to COVID in FY '21. So we'll provide more detail for you on sort of the core components of each of the segments at our Investor Day. We're very pleased with the performance that we've seen thus far. Our core businesses performed well. But again, I just would remind you that, in addition to that, we did have that low quarter lapping Q1 of last year."

There's a couple of things that we called out for you or I called out for you in my opening comments. First of all, the investments that we're continuing to make in our oncology business, in Ontada, called that out as a $0.20 headwind year-over-year. And then as I also talked about and you referenced, the labor investments that we made into our business, our U.S. distribution businesses. Those 2 things really had an impact on the growth of U.S. Pharma. 
And in our medical business, we're really pleased with not only the performance against the U.S. government program and the increase in COVID test kitting, which is really reflective of the strength of our lab solutions business, but we're pleased with the performance of our Primary Care business and the core business underneath our medical business, in addition to the labor investment that I called out.

We've continued to evolve our business over really the last several years in terms of tying the services that we provide to our customers and for our manufacturers to the pricing and the agreements that we have. And it is less -- the brand inflation is less impactful than it has been in the past. We've talked about that a lot over the last few years. 
As it relates to really the policy piece, Brian, I'll maybe let you talk about that."

And regardless of how, what sorts of mechanisms get changed in the marketplace, we will continue to be paid fair market value for those services.
As it relates to the public policy debate, and it's as dynamic now as ever, I suppose, I think the main issues that we're discussing are issues that, frankly, have been long discussed. I mean we are active at the company with elected officials on both sides of the aisle on key policy priorities. We track these discussions very carefully. We're always advocating for the role of care being provided in the community. We obviously have very strong presences in the community channels, but we believe that, fundamentally, that's where you get the best access, the best care and equally good quality. 
We have been at the forefront in many of the experiments, I suppose you could call them, think about USAN and our value-based care. We've had robust participation in the oncology care model that's delivered substantial benefit to CMS. 
So I think the mix is -- it's really -- it's not exactly clear where this will go. I think we have a lot of assets. We're engaged in the discussion. We'll find a way to navigate through them as they unfold. I mean, right now, I think these issues have been long discussed and well discussed."

And assuming the alignment to those strategies and assuming they meet our disciplined financial review, process and create value for our shareholders, we would love to be deploying capital against those strategies. 
We obviously always balance that against returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and our modestly growing dividend.

When we execute against, we'll deliver at the long-term growth that we're looking for. So a strategic alignment, financial discipline, that's really what drives capital deployment."
