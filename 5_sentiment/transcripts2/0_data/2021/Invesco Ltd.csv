I think we're all very ready to turn the page on what was a very challenging 2020. And while the global pandemic remains very pervasive, we do all see light at the end of the tunnel, and we look forward to 2021 with cautious optimism that conditions will improve. 
Throughout 2020, we focus on executing our long-term strategy of recognizing the necessity to focus on employee health and safety, finding new ways to work in serving and delivering expected outcomes to our clients. I would like to thank all our employees and our clients during what has been a challenging period. 
Over the past decade, we've been successful investing ahead of shifts in client demand, placing us in a strong position to take advantage of key industry tailwinds in the future. Our investments in these capabilities and our tremendous focus on our clients is now again producing good momentum in our business that became more visible as the year progressed. By working better to anticipate, understand and meet client needs during the challenging times, we've achieved 6 straight months of net long-term inflows totaling nearly $18 billion in the second half of 2020, with progress across channels, geographies and asset classes. 
Retail flows improved in the second half significantly. Our solutions enabled institutional pipeline remain near record levels. We saw net inflows in Asia Pacific totaling $17 billion in the second half of the year and improving flows in EMEA and the Americas over this time frame. 
And net long-term flows in the fixed income remained robust during that period. All of these factors combined, build a strong foundation as we head into 2021. And maybe a few highlights of the fourth quarter on Slide 4, if you happen to be following along. 
More specifically during the quarter, investment performance for a large portion of our high demand capabilities were in the upper quartiles. We had net long-term inflows of nearly $10 billion during the quarter. Long-term inflows and fixed income capabilities continued, while we saw client demand for equities within ETFs, quantitative and index strategies, in particular. We saw another quarter of strong inflows in Asia Pacific region and flows in the Americas turned positive. Allison will provide more information in a few minutes on the flows, strategic evaluation, more details of the quarter. But I would like to note that we also improved our operating leverage during the period, paid our credit facility to 0 and made progress improving our cash position. I would like to spend a few minutes on Slides 5 and 6 to talk about our competitive strength and key capabilities in areas with high client demand and our focus for 2021. 
Slide 5 illustrates the market opportunities we see for these key growth areas and demonstrates the majority of our investment capabilities are aligned with these opportunities. In these areas, our investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive and well positioned for growth. And as we move into 2021, we plan to further expand our market-leading position in ETFs in the U.S. and EMEA, in particular, and build our passive presence in Asia Pacific. 
We are the fourth largest ETF provider globally, and our capabilities span passive, active strategies and established and developing spectrum of ETF -- ESG ETFs. And building on our 15-year legacy of innovation, we continue to develop new products in this space as demonstrated by the launch of the QQQ Innovation suite and our first nontransparent ETFs that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Strong alternative platform, and our focus is growing our private markets business, led by our market-leading real estate and bank loan businesses [Audio Gap] 
Active fixed income and global equity remains areas of opportunity for us, and our offerings are well positioned with strong investment performance and high client demand. In addition, we are focused on our solutions efforts. And as we have seen by the contribution to the institutional pipeline, clients value the service, the ability to offer solutions that builds built on the full power of our competitive set of capability and services to clients continue to be a priority for us during 2021. 
We continue to invest in our leadership position in Greater China. We've been managing dedicated Chinese products for nearly 40 years. We have already seen the benefits of our early mover advantage in the China onshore market through our joint venture, which was the first sino-foreign joint venture in the industry established almost 20 years ago. 
Turning to Slide 6. As we noted in the third quarter, we see opportunities to invest in areas of growth aligned with our strategic plan. These areas include ETF, alternatives, active fixed income flow like base, which includes emerging markets. And we will build on our market-leading position in the fast-growing China market and further develop our lead solutions and asset allocation offerings. 
Given our investment in the business over the past decade, our most recent efforts to better align the organization with our strategy, I'm confident we have the talent, the capabilities and the resources and momentum to drive the future growth and success. We're optimistic about the new year and remain focused on helping our clients achieve their desired outcomes, regardless of where the markets take us. And with that, I will turn it over to Alison to get into further details in the financial. 
Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 7. We had 61% and 70% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, reflecting strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. 
Looking at our AUM on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $1.35 trillion in AUM. Of the $132 billion in AUM growth, approximately $95 billion is a function of increased market values. Turning to flows on Slide 9. Our diversified platform generated long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter of $9.8 billion, representing 3.9% annualized organic growth, which generated positive net inflows and active AUM of $400 million and passive AUM of $9.4 billion. Our ETFs experienced net inflows of $6.1 billion, including $4.7 billion in long-term ETFs and $1.4 billion in our Q2 Qs. 
Our U.S.-listed ETFS, excluding the Q2 QQQs, had their best quarter in their 15-year history. We saw net long-term ETF flows in the U.S.-focused on equities in the fourth quarter, including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which had $2.7 billion in net inflows in the quarter. 2 of our top 5 inflowing ETFs were ESG related. We continue to see momentum in our ETF business and demand for ESG funds. And as Marty highlighted, the market opportunity is significant for this key growth area in 2021. 
Retail net outflows were $800 million in the quarter, helped by the positive ETF flows. On the institutional side, we had net inflows of $10.6 billion. I'll provide a little more color on these flows on the next few slides, but importantly, the growth in our path of AUM and our institutional AUM is meaningful for the firm and contributed to the positive operating leverage we generated in the period. Also, as Marty noted earlier, we're seeing the mix of ETF inflows being weighted towards higher fee-generating products. 
Looking at flows by geography, you'll note that the Americas had net inflows of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $6.6 billion from the prior quarter. This improvement was driven by net infows to ETF, institutional inflows, various fixed income strategies and importantly, focused sales efforts and improvement in redemption rates. Our global equity products improved by over $1 billion or 37% from Q3, driven by our developing markets fund, which returned to positive net flows in the fourth quarter following negative net flows in the first 3 quarters of the year. 
The U.K. experienced net outflows of $100 million in the quarter as positive flows into our institutional quantitative equity capability were offset by net outflows in multi-asset and U.K. equities. EMEA net outflows were $1.4 billion, driven by institutional lumpiness and ETF outflows, largely in our S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100   uses   ETFs. 
And finally, I noted last quarter that Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever with net inflows of $8 billion. In the fourth quarter, net inflows were even higher at $9.1 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the Asia Pacific region. $4 billion of these net flows were from Japan, $3.8 billion arose from our China JV, and the remaining $1.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region. It's worth noting that we continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the fourth quarter, with net long-term inflows of $8.2 billion. This following net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion in the third quarter and $6 billion in the second quarter. It's also important to note that of the $26.1 billion in fixed income net inflows in 2020, $25 billion of these net inflows were from active fixed income capabilities. 
Active fixed income has been a growth area for us in 2020 and remains a key investment area in 2021. Now moving to Slide 10. Our institutional pipeline remains robust at $30.5 billion on the heels of strong pull-through in the institutional pipeline during the fourth quarter. This pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continued investment in this key capability in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our revenues increased $135 million or 12.4% from the third quarter, driven by higher average AUM in Q4 as well as a meaningful increase in performance fees. Net revenue yield ex performance fees was 36 basis points flat and flat at the third -- at the Q3 yield level. The impact of rising markets on our yield was offset by a modest fee rate decline from the mix shift we experienced across products in the quarter as well as the impact of nonmanagement fee earning AUM. 
We recorded performance fees of $78 million in the fourth quarter, $48 million of these performance fees arose from our real estate business and $21 million from our institutional business and our China JV, 2 of our key growth areas. Seasonally, we tend to see higher performance fees in the fourth quarter. 
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 8.3% in Q4. The $57 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of both market growth and compensation related to the performance fees in the quarter. Operating expenses remained at lower than historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations that persisted in the quarter. That being said, we did see a seasonal increase in marketing expenses as expected. 
Moving to Slide 12. We wanted to update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. As we noted previously, we conducted a strategic evaluation across 4 key areas of our expense base. Our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. While creating permanent net improvements of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base. As we noted, a large element of the savings will be generated from compensation, which includes realigning our non-client facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower-cost locations. 
In the fourth quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $7 million of these savings were related to compensation expense, as depicted on Slide 12. The remaining $500,000 in savings were related to facilities, which are shown in the property, office and technology category. The $7.5 million in cost savings were $30 million annualized, is 15% of our $200 million net savings expectation. Of the remaining $170 million in net savings, we anticipate we will realize roughly 50% of the savings through compensation expense. 
The remaining 50% was spread across occupancy, tech spend and G&A. As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder recognized by the end of '22. We estimate that we will realize roughly 75% of the anticipated compensation reductions in 2021, roughly 50% of the anticipated reduction in occupancy expense also in 2021 and all of the reduction in G&A this year. 
The majority of efficiencies identified in our tech spend will not be realized until 2022. In the fourth quarter, we incurred $104 million of our total estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs. We expect the remaining transaction cost for the realization of this program to be in a range of $150 million to $175 million over the next 2 years, with roughly 2/3 of this remaining amount occurring in 2021. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. With respect to Q1, after improved market performance and asset inflows in the fourth quarter, we start the year with over $1.3 trillion in AUM. 
Given the market improvement was more back-end weighted towards the end of the quarter, we expect both operating revenues, excluding performance fees, and the associated variable expenses to be modestly higher in the first quarter. This reflects the follow-through from the market and flow growth that occurred over the course of the fourth quarter, even as we assume no change in markets from year-end. 
On the expense side, this will include higher associated variable compensation and the seasonal increase in payroll taxes. Partially offset by lower compensation-related to the seasonal decline in performance fees and the execution of our targeted cost savings. 
Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted operating income improved $78 million to $485 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin included 230 basis points as compared to the third quarter to 39.5%, demonstrating the operating leverage in our model. This helped drive the $0.19 increase in adjusted EPS to $0.72 a share. 
In addition, we benefited from higher nonoperating income and lower nonoperating expenses in the quarter. Nonoperating income included $31.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $15.2 million in net gains last quarter. The increase was driven by unrealized gains primarily in our Seed Money Holdings. Interest expense of $24.4 million was 28% lower than the prior quarter. Q3 was the final quarter in which we paid dividends related to our forward purchase agreements, a portion of which we settled in January, with the remaining portion to be settled in April of 2021. 
Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%. The reduction in the rate reflects the lower taxes on unrealized gains in our Seed portfolio due to the jurisdiction of our holdings. We estimate our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. A few comments on Slide 14. As Marty mentioned, we reduced our revolver balance by $90 million to 0 in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile. 
In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility. To that end, our balance sheet cash position improved to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter from $1.1 billion at the end of Q3. $764 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. I will note, we paid   $117   million earlier in January to settle a portion of the forward share repurchase liability with the remaining liability of $177 million to be settled in April. We believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer-term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. In summary, Marty walked through our key capabilities, the organic growth opportunity each presents and our focus on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas. We also focused on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth, and we remain prudent and cautious in our approach to capital management. 
Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we have done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities, put Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions."

Let me just start with, obviously, we had pretty high performance fees in the fourth quarter. So excluding performance fees, as you saw, net revenue yield was flat at 36 basis points in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. I mean it's fairly straightforward in terms of what was driving that. You've got the impact of the rising markets on our yield. And then that's which was a positive, of course. And then we've got some offset there, given the modest pressure we continue to see just from the client demand and the mix shift that's there. We've got consistent with industry, high interest in our passive capabilities and some churn within our active, and that does put some downward pressure on net revenue yield. 
And this was a quarter where the impact of really strong market growth helped offset that. In terms of what does that mean for this year, I would say that trend right there, we would expect to continue. I do expect we will continue to see high interest in our passive capabilities and some continued churn within active. What does that mean for net revenue yield going forward? It's very difficult to predict, as you know. What I would point you to is that our focus is not simply on net revenue yield. We've really got the breadth of capabilities to serve our clients well. I think that's really starting to be demonstrated in the results over the last couple of quarters. And as we focus on that, we really are focusing on operating margin and making sure that we are managing our expense base to the top line of the firm and really driving profitable growth across our platform."

So yes, let me start with Q1, and there are a lot of puts and takes as you think about it, just given the really strong growth that we saw in the back half of the fourth quarter. That market growth excluding performance fee, really did come in the back half of the year, and we started the year with a very high level of AUM. 
And you see what I see in terms of the markets thus far that we enter with strong revenue growth as that maintains, and we hope that maintains. And then along with that, we've got the associated variable compensation, and that does drive compensation higher, all things being equal for the quarter. And then we have the seasonality of payroll taxes and some pension expenses that occur in the first quarter of the year. Now those are going to be offset by the -- what we're doing in terms of our targeted cost saves and of course, the lower compensation that we would have in this quarter, excluding performance fees. 
The net of all of that, the puts and takes, hard to say exactly, given the strong run-up in revenue and the associated expenses. But it's, I would say, flattish, and I'm talking total expenses fourth quarter. In terms of the cadence of the cost saves, I think it's reasonable to look at those as being spread relatively equally over the year. There may be a little bit of front-end loading into the first half of the year, but relatively equal."

The U.S. retail channel is really starting to make tremendous change in progress. We're not where we want to be, that's for sure. But the momentum there, the gross flows are there. We're seeing flows as you look into the year outside of ETFs in the traditional asset classes, munis, short-duration fixed income. Emerging markets is actually picking up, which is really good news. That's back in the flow. So cautiously optimistic. Within alternatives, it's largely been on GTR, and that was really the driver this past quarter.

It's very strong at as allocation, building anything from models to customize solutions for clients and also advisory to clients, whether it be in sort of the big corner office suites in the retail channel, but quite frankly, large pension plans around the world. 
And our approach has been to use our capabilities, whether it be our passive capabilities, our factor capabilities all the way through alternative capabilities. So it's not a duplicative set of skills. It's literally using what we've had in existence. We have built what is a very, very strong analytical tool that we use with clients as a way to help them analyze their portfolios. That's how the engagements happen. And any one of those outcomes can happen simply from an advice engagement to building a customized solution. During that journey, as you build it out, how you engage, how you face off with clients, there clearly modifications to how you do that. 
And we seem to have found ourselves in a situation where we seem to have the formula right based on the outcomes that were that we're seeing. And I come back to -- this really is is the fundamental topic that is driving the change in the industry is that clients are working with fewer money managers that are expecting more from money managers. So if you don't have that breadth of capability and if you don't have the ability to serve clients through these engagements, you're truly disadvantaged. 
And so it is really making a difference for us, and we expect that will be the case in the years ahead. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color."

I'll also just also remind everyone, we do have seasonality and comp expense that is seasonality and cash flow related comp expense in the first quarter.

There is strong cash flow, just given the AUM dynamics that we see right now. I don't know what that will look like exactly as we work through the quarter, and we do have the liability to settle in April. All that said, we're in a very strong position. And I continue -- I expect us to continue to build our cash balances longer-term and improved net leverage. 
And then as I think about just what does that mean for the financial flexibility that we're looking to achieve and returning capital to shareholders. We are committed to that financial flexibility. We do want to invest in the business, first and foremost, to support future growth in the business. We do remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet. And ultimately, we want to be in a position to return excess cash to shareholders.

I mean, I guess, that's not a number we would disclose or think about exactly. But if you think about what you're looking at is excluding market. And you surely look at the fee rate associated with where interest is as we point to every quarter, you continue to see a little bit of mix shift from some of the higher fee products to some of the lower fee products. 
So that is -- that does put pressure on your organic fee growth. No question without some market improvement in there, you would see downward pressure there. Our focus then really does shift to profitability. So I'll come to your second question. How do we think about the profitability given those dynamics because markets go up and markets go down, and we've seen the pressure that can put on the top line. As we think about the profitability, and I'm not sure I'm going to answer your question exactly. I'm not sure I caught all the different puts and takes you were thinking about there. But I guess I would answer it this way. 
While the absolute fee rate of some of our lower fee products would be lower, so take an ETF, for example, in the United States. The absolute fee rate there would be about half of a U.S.-based mutual fund. That said, the margin contribution is about the same, very similar because you have lower servicing costs. And so the margin on both are neutral to positive to our overall firm margins. And it really then becomes a function of volume because while the margin is the same, the absolute operating income yield would be lower. And so you have to drive more volume over a lower fee product to contribute the same dollar of operating income that you would over a higher fee product. 
And that's really how we think about it. I mean these are just the facts of our business and the fact of where demand is and making sure we're positioned to capture all of that demand and then making sure we're well positioned to maintain PAUSE our margins at a minimum even in markets where we could be under pressure."

And then in terms of what would be higher, the seasonality of payroll taxes and some benefits. So that's somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range. Then you've got the targeted cost saves that will be in there somewhere. We're not giving specific guidance around that any more so than what I've already provided.

The one thing that is not totally the same is the run-up in the fourth quarter is what -- we only had that for, kind of, call it, 6 weeks or so at the end of the quarter. 
If asset levels hold where they began the year, and we've certainly seen them hold through this -- thus far into the month, you can expect that revenue and the associated compensation expense with that would be higher than what you would see in the fourth quarter, and that's just thinking about the typical relationship between revenue and compensation expense."

I'd say in the United States, it is moving beyond what was a conversation, 12, 18 months ago, so being something very fair real, and you're seeing commercial implications of it.

I mean I know you're -- the company is large. And so the list isn't really long of who could buy you. But there are some large buyers out there talking pretty vocally about writing checks. So curious about how you would think about that. 
And I believe you have had -- there's been at least one board meeting since Nelson, Peltz and Ed Garden joined Board. So could you add maybe some color on what kind of impact that has had on the Board dynamic and any incremental details about plans or areas of focus for your new Board members?"

They value Invesco being an independent global asset manager. And again, the results are, as I said, you can see the momentum, and we anticipate -- we're on a good track. So that's the first point. 
And secondly, within any conversation around M&A, my comments would be very similar to somebody looking at any money manager. And if it's not strategic, if there's a lot of overlap, if it's inconsistent with what clients want, it is very hard to do. And so as you say, that would get you to even narrow set of options, if you consider something like that. So again, the criteria works both ways, and I think that's important to understand. And then with regard to the Board, again, we've had a very strong board. And Nelson, Ed and Tom Fink from Berrian have joined. All 3 are very, very talented. Tom was the former CEO of Bearings. Nelson and had been around the space for a very long time. They know the space. 
They've obviously are been very outspoken about the opportunities that they see within the asset management space. And the dynamic has been very good. I mean you brought 3 new experts on to the Board. And again, just making sure we as an organization are laser-focused on providing for clients and shareholders. And with the existing Board members, I think if anybody owns a stock, they should feel really good about it."

I think we're all very ready to turn the page on what was a very challenging 2020. And while the global pandemic remains very pervasive, we do all see light at the end of the tunnel, and we look forward to 2021 with cautious optimism that conditions will improve.
Throughout 2020, we focused on executing our long-term strategy of recognizing the necessity to focus on employee health and safety, finding new ways to work in serving and delivering expected outcomes to our clients. I would like to thank all our employees and our clients during what has been a challenging period.
Over the past decade, we've been successful investing ahead of shifts in client demand, placing us in a strong position to take advantage of key industry tailwinds in the future. Our investments in these capabilities and our tremendous focus on our clients is now again producing good momentum in our business that became more visible as the year progressed. By working better to anticipate, understand and meet client needs during the challenging times, we've achieved 6 straight months of net long-term inflows, totaling nearly $18 billion in the second half of 2020, with progress across channels, geographies and asset classes.
Retail flows improved in the second half significantly. Our solutions-enabled institutional pipeline remain near record levels. We saw net inflows in Asia Pacific totaling $17 billion in the second half of the year and improving flows in EMEA and the Americas over this time frame.
And net long-term flows in the fixed income remained robust during that period. All of these factors combined build a strong foundation as we head into 2021. And maybe a few highlights of the fourth quarter on Slide 4, if you happen to be following along.
More specifically during the quarter, investment performance for a large portion of our high demand capabilities were in the upper quartiles. We had net long-term inflows of nearly $10 billion during the quarter. Long-term inflows and fixed income capabilities continued, while we saw client demand for equities within ETFs, quantitative and index strategies, in particular. We saw another quarter of strong inflows in Asia Pacific region and flows in the Americas turned positive. Allison will provide more information in a few minutes on the flows, strategic evaluation, more details of the quarter. But I would like to note that we also improved our operating leverage during the period, paid our credit facility to 0 and made progress improving our cash position.
I would like to spend a few minutes on Slides 5 and 6 to talk about our competitive strength and key capabilities in areas with high client demand and our focus for 2021.
Slide 5 illustrates the market opportunities we see for these key growth areas and demonstrates the majority of our investment capabilities are aligned with these opportunities. In these areas, our investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive and well positioned for growth. And as we move into 2021, we plan to further expand our market-leading position in ETFs in the U.S. and EMEA, in particular, and build our passive presence in Asia Pacific.
We are the fourth largest ETF provider globally, and our capabilities span passive, active strategies and established and developing spectrum of ETF -- ESG ETFs. And building on our 15-year legacy of innovation, we continue to develop new products in this space as demonstrated by the launch of the QQQ innovation suite and our first nontransparent ETFs that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Strong alternative platform, and our focus is growing our private markets business, led by our market-leading real estate and bank loan businesses
[Audio Gap]
Active fixed income and global equity remains areas of opportunity for us, and our offerings are well positioned with strong investment performance and high client demand. In addition, we are focused on our solutions efforts. And as we have seen by the contribution to the institutional pipeline, clients value the service, the ability to offer solutions that builds -- that's built on the full power of our competitive set of capability and services to clients continue to be a priority for us during 2021.
We continue to invest in our leadership position in Greater China. We've been managing dedicated Chinese products for nearly 40 years. We have already seen the benefits of our early mover advantage in the China onshore market through our joint venture, which was the first sino-foreign joint venture in the industry established almost 20 years ago.
Turning to Slide 6. As we noted in the third quarter, we see opportunities to invest in areas of growth aligned with our strategic plan. These areas include ETF, alternatives, active fixed income, global equities, which includes emerging markets. And we will build on our market-leading position in the fast-growing China market and further develop our leading solutions and asset allocation offerings.
Given our investment in the business over the past decade, our most recent efforts to better align the organization with our strategy, I'm confident we have the talent, the capabilities and the resources and momentum to drive the future growth and success. We're optimistic about the new year and remain focused on helping our clients achieve their desired outcomes, regardless of where the markets take us.
And with that, I will turn it over to Allison to get into further details."

We had 61% and 70% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, reflecting strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.
Looking at our AUM on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $1.35 trillion in AUM. Of the $132 billion in AUM growth, approximately $95 billion is a function of increased market values.
Turning to flows on Slide 9. Our diversified platform generated long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter of $9.8 billion, representing 3.9% annualized organic growth, which generated positive net inflows and active AUM of $400 million and passive AUM of $9.4 billion. Our ETFs experienced net inflows of $6.1 billion, including $4.7 billion in long-term ETFs and $1.4 billion in our QQs.
Our U.S.-listed ETFS, excluding the QQQs, had their best quarter in their 15-year history. We saw net long-term ETF flows in the U.S.-focused on equities in the fourth quarter, including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which had $2.7 billion in net inflows in the quarter. 2 of our top 5 inflowing ETFs were ESG related. We continue to see momentum in our ETF business and demand for ESG funds. And as Marty highlighted, the market opportunity is significant for this key growth area in 2021.
Retail net outflows were $800 million in the quarter, helped by the positive ETF flows. On the institutional side, we had net inflows of $10.6 billion. I'll provide a little more color on these flows on the next few slides, but importantly, the growth in our passive AUM and our institutional AUM is meaningful for the firm and contributed to the positive operating leverage we generated in the period. Also, as Marty noted earlier, we're seeing the mix of ETF inflows being weighted towards higher fee-generating products.
Looking at flows by geography, you'll note that the Americas had net inflows of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $6.6 billion from the prior quarter. This improvement was driven by net inflows into ETF, institutional inflows, various fixed income strategies and importantly, focused sales efforts and improvement in redemption rates. Our global equity products improved by over $1 billion or 37% from Q3, driven by our developing markets fund, which returned to positive net flows in the fourth quarter following negative net flows in the first 3 quarters of the year.
The U.K. experienced net outflows of $100 million in the quarter as positive flows into our institutional quantitative equity capability were offset by net outflows in multi-asset and U.K. equities. EMEA net outflows were $1.4 billion, driven by institutional lumpiness and ETF outflows, largely in our S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 used ETFs.
And finally, I noted last quarter that Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever with net inflows of $8 billion. In the fourth quarter, net inflows were even higher at $9.1 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the Asia Pacific region. $4 billion of these net flows were from Japan, $3.8 billion arose from our China JV, and the remaining $1.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region. It's worth noting that we continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the fourth quarter, with net long-term inflows of $8.2 billion. This following net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion in the third quarter and $6 billion in the second quarter. It's also important to note that of the $26.1 billion in fixed income net inflows in 2020, $25 billion of these net inflows were from active fixed income capabilities. Active fixed income has been a growth area for us in 2020 and remains a key investment area in 2021.
Now moving to Slide 10. Our institutional pipeline remains robust at $30.5 billion on the heels of strong pull-through in the institutional pipeline during the fourth quarter. This pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continued investment in this key capability in 2021.
Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our revenues increased $135 million or 12.4% from the third quarter, driven by higher average AUM in Q4 as well as a meaningful increase in performance fees. Net revenue yield ex performance fees was 36 basis points flat and flat at the third -- at the Q3 yield level. The impact of rising markets on our yield was offset by a modest fee rate decline from the mix shift we experienced across products in the quarter as well as the impact of nonmanagement fee earning AUM.
We recorded performance fees of $78 million in the fourth quarter, $48 million of these performance fees arose from our real estate business and $21 million from our institutional business and our China JV, 2 of our key growth areas. Seasonally, we tend to see higher performance fees in the fourth quarter.
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 8.3% in Q4. The $57 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of both market growth and compensation related to the performance fees in the quarter. Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations that persisted in the quarter. That being said, we did see a seasonal increase in marketing expenses as expected.
Moving to Slide 12. We wanted to update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. As we noted previously, we conducted a strategic evaluation across 4 key areas of our expense base. Our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. While creating permanent net improvements of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base. As we noted, a large element of the savings will be generated from compensation, which includes realigning our non-client facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower-cost locations.
In the fourth quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $7 million of these savings were related to compensation expense, as depicted on Slide 12. The remaining $500,000 in savings were related to facilities, which are shown in the property, office and technology category. The $7.5 million in cost savings were $30 million annualized, is 15% of our $200 million net savings expectation. Of the remaining $170 million in net savings, we anticipate we will realize roughly 50% of the savings through compensation expense.
The remaining 50% was spread across occupancy, tech spend and G&A. As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder recognized by the end of '22. We estimate that we will realize roughly 75% of the anticipated compensation reductions in 2021, roughly 50% of the anticipated reduction in occupancy expense also in 2021 and all of the reduction in G&A this year.
The majority of efficiencies identified in our tech spend will not be realized until 2022. In the fourth quarter, we incurred $104 million of our total estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs. We expect the remaining transaction cost for the realization of this program to be in a range of $150 million to $175 million over the next 2 years, with roughly 2/3 of this remaining amount occurring in 2021. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.
With respect to Q1, after improved market performance and asset inflows in the fourth quarter, we start the year with over $1.3 trillion in AUM. Given the market improvement was more back-end weighted towards the end of the quarter, we expect both operating revenues, excluding performance fees, and the associated variable expenses to be modestly higher in the first quarter. This reflects the follow-through from the market and flow growth that occurred over the course of the fourth quarter, even as we assume no change in markets from year-end.
On the expense side, this will include higher associated variable compensation and the seasonal increase in payroll taxes. Partially offset by lower compensation-related to the seasonal decline in performance fees and the execution of our targeted cost savings.
Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted operating income improved $78 million to $485 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin include 230 basis points as compared to the third quarter to 39.5%, demonstrating the operating leverage in our model. This helped drive the $0.19 increase in adjusted EPS to $0.72 a share.
In addition, we benefited from higher nonoperating income and lower nonoperating expenses in the quarter. Nonoperating income included $31.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $15.2 million in net gains last quarter. The increase was driven by unrealized gains primarily in our seed money holdings. Interest expense of $24.4 million was 28% lower than the prior quarter. Q3 was the final quarter in which we paid dividends related to our forward purchase agreements, a portion of which we settled in January, with the remaining portion to be settled in April of 2021.
Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%. The reduction in the rate reflects the lower taxes on unrealized gains in our seed portfolio due to the jurisdiction of our holdings. We estimate our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.
A few comments on Slide 14. As Marty mentioned, we reduced our revolver balance by $90 million to 0 in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile.
In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility. To that end, our balance sheet cash position improved to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter from $1.1 billion at the end of Q3. $764 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. I will note, we paid $117 million earlier in January to settle a portion of the forward share repurchase liability with the remaining liability of $177 million to be settled in April. We believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer-term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases.
In summary, Marty walked through our key capabilities, the organic growth opportunity each presents and our focus on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas. We're also focused on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth, and we remain prudent and cautious in our approach to capital management. Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we have done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities put Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions."

Let me just start with, obviously, we had pretty high performance fees in the fourth quarter. So excluding performance fees, as you saw, net revenue yield was flat at 36 basis points in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. I mean it's fairly straightforward in terms of what was driving that. You've got the impact of the rising markets on our yield. And then that's which was a positive, of course. And then we've got some offset there, given the modest pressure we continue to see just from the client demand and the mix shift that's there. We've got, consistent with industry, high interest in our passive capabilities and some churn within our active, and that does put some downward pressure on net revenue yield. And this was a quarter where the impact of really strong market growth helped offset that.
In terms of what does that mean for this year, I would say that trend right there, we would expect to continue. I do expect we will continue to see high interest in our passive capabilities and some continued churn within active. What does that mean for net revenue yield going forward? It's very difficult to predict, as you know. What I would point you to is that our focus is not simply on net revenue yield. We've really got the breadth of capabilities to serve our clients well. I think that's really starting to be demonstrated in the results over the last couple of quarters. And as we focus on that, we really are focusing on operating margin and making sure that we are managing our expense base to the top line of the firm and really driving profitable growth across our platform."

That market growth, excluding performance fee, really did come in the back half of the year, and we started the year with a very high level of AUM.
And you see what I see in terms of the markets thus far that we enter with strong revenue growth as that maintains, and we hope that maintains. And then along with that, we've got the associated variable compensation, and that does drive compensation higher, all things being equal for the quarter. And then we have the seasonality of payroll taxes and some pension expenses that occur in the first quarter of the year. Now those are going to be offset by the -- what we're doing in terms of our targeted cost saves and of course, the lower compensation that we would have in this quarter, excluding performance fees.
The net of all of that, the puts and takes, hard to say exactly, given the strong run-up in revenue and the associated expenses. But it's, I would say, flattish, and I'm talking total expenses fourth quarter. In terms of the cadence of the cost saves, I think it's reasonable to look at those as being spread relatively equally over the year. There may be a little bit of front-end loading into the first half of the year, but relatively equal."

The U.S. retail channel is really starting to make tremendous change in progress. We're not where we want to be, that's for sure. But the momentum's there, the gross flows are there. We're seeing flows as you look into the year outside of ETFs in the traditional asset classes, munis, short-duration fixed income. Emerging markets is actually picking up, which is really good news. That's back in the flow. So cautiously optimistic.
Within alternatives, it's largely been on GTR, and that was really the driver this past quarter. Bank loans were also an area that were still in outflows.

And our approach has been to use our capabilities, whether it be our passive capabilities, our factor capabilities all the way through alternative capabilities. So it's not a duplicative set of skills. It's literally using what we've had in existence. We have built what is a very, very strong analytical tool that we use with clients as a way to help them analyze their portfolios. That's how the engagements happen. And any one of those outcomes can happen simply from an advice engagement to building a customized solution. During that journey, as you build it out, how you engage, how you face off with clients, there are clearly modifications to how you do that.
And we seem to have found ourselves in a situation where we seem to have the formula right based on the outcomes that we're seeing. And I come back to -- this really is the fundamental topic that is driving the change in the industry is that clients are working with fewer money managers that are expecting more from money managers. So if you don't have that breadth of capability and if you don't have the ability to serve clients through these engagements, you're truly disadvantaged.
And so it is really making a difference for us, and we expect that will be the case in the years ahead. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color."

I mean, I guess, that's not a number we would disclose or think about exactly. But if you think about what you're looking at is excluding market. And you surely look at the fee rate associated with where interest is, as we point to every quarter, you continue to see a little bit of mix shift from some of the higher fee products to some of the lower fee products.
So that is -- that does put pressure on your organic fee growth. No question, without some market improvement in there, you would see downward pressure there. Our focus then really does shift to profitability. So I'll come to your second question.
How do we think about the profitability given those dynamics because markets go up and markets go down, and we've seen the pressure that can put on the top line. As we think about the profitability, and I'm not sure I'm going to answer your question exactly, I'm not sure I caught all the different puts and takes you were thinking about there, but I guess I would answer it this way. While the absolute fee rate of some of our lower fee products would be lower, so take an ETF, for example, in the United States, the absolute fee rate there would be about half of a U.S.-based mutual fund. That said, the margin contribution is about the same, very similar because you have lower servicing costs. And so the margin on both are neutral to positive to our overall firm margins. And it really then becomes a function of volume because while the margin is the same, the absolute operating income yield would be lower. And so you have to drive more volume over a lower fee product to contribute the same dollar of operating income that you would over a higher fee product.
And that's really how we think about it. I mean these are just the facts of our business and the fact of where demand is and making sure we're positioned to capture all of that demand and then making sure we're well positioned to maintain our margins at a minimum even in markets where we could be under pressure."

I mean if you look at just the performance fees and the compensation expense that's associated with those, it's going to be kind of closer to 50%. So it comes at a higher rate than what you would see in terms of the compensation associated with other elements of revenue. So that's a roll off.
And then in terms of what would be higher, the seasonality of payroll taxes and some benefits. So that's somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range. Then you've got the targeted cost saves that will be in there somewhere. We're not giving specific guidance around that any more so than what I've already provided. And I think that's probably the best way to think about it.
The one thing that is not totally the same is the run-up in the fourth quarter is what -- we only have that for, kind of, call it, 6 weeks or so at the end of the quarter. If asset levels hold where they began the year, and we've certainly seen them hold through thus far into the month, you can expect that revenue and the associated compensation expense with that would be higher than what you would see in the fourth quarter, and that's just thinking about the typical relationship between revenue and compensation expense."

So look, let me start with the bigger question then specific. ESG is something that we're integrating throughout all our investment management teams, probably most advanced through our capabilities in EMEA, our fixed income teams, real estate. So we're pretty well into it right now. We're not done. But that is something that is absolutely a top focus of ours as an organization. The reality is, if you are not skilled at managing ESG capabilities, even within your traditional asset classes, you really are going to be challenged in EMEA. I'd say in the United States, it is moving beyond what was a conversation 12, 18 months ago, so being something very, very real, and you're seeing commercial implications of it. And that is the same thing in Asia Pacific.
Specifically using that more narrow definition that we have, so we have about $34 billion in ESG AUM, but it's really quite broad. We have about 90 ESG funds or mandates that comes through. And I think the other area where we're seeing outside of institutional is really picking up on a retail basis. And right now, we're the second largest provider of ESG ETFs in the United States, and there's about $9 billion in those assets. So again, more to go. As I said, we have a developed capability, but it's also developing, and we're really being quite aggressive in the area."

And again, I have to be careful that you're working up mine. What drives stock price is operating outcomes and business momentum and as Allison's been talking about today, you're just seeing a markedly different set of outcomes in the last couple of quarters. As you look into 2021, again, about getting into forward guidance, it is many more tailwinds behind the organization than I've seen since 2018. And it's quite broad, by region and by channel and also within various capabilities where we pointed out, there's very, very high demand.
Now that said, there's always areas we have where we have areas for improvement. We'll continue to do that. But again, the tailwinds are very different than what we've seen since the middle of 2018. So from my perspective, that's going to drive stock price.
With regard to adding a beta provider through M&A, again, I'll just answer the question as I have before, it all depends on facts and circumstances. It has to be additive to the organization. It can't be something that is a net negative through the combination. So again, just really depends on the situation."

So that's really the success is because we've been able to operate as really a single organization there. With regard to the 49%, it is a conversation we continue to have with one on -- it's obviously slowed down, I'd say the conversations between the U.S.-China were not helpful in advancing that.

So curious about how you would think about that.

And again, the results are, as I said, you can see the momentum, and we anticipate -- we're on a good track. So that's the first point.
And secondly, within any conversation around M&A, my comments would be very similar to somebody looking at any money manager. And if it's not strategic, if there's a lot of overlap, if it's inconsistent with what clients want, it is very hard to do. And so as you say, that would get you to even narrow set of options, if you consider something like that. So again, the criteria works both ways, and I think that's important to understand.
And then with regard to the Board, again, we've had a very strong board. And Nelson, Ed and Tom Finke from Barings have joined. All 3 are very, very talented. Tom was the former CEO of Barings. Nelson had been around the space for a very long time. They know the space. They obviously are -- been very outspoken about the opportunities that they see within the asset management space. The dynamic has been very good. I mean you brought 3 new experts on to the Board. And again, just making sure we as an organization are laser-focused on providing for clients and shareholders.

I think we're all very ready to turn the page on what was a very challenging 2020. And while the global pandemic remains very pervasive, we do all see light at the end of the tunnel, and we look forward to 2021 with cautious optimism that conditions will improve.
Throughout 2020, we focused on executing our long-term strategy of recognizing the necessity to focus on employee health and safety, finding new ways to work in serving and delivering expected outcomes to our clients. I would like to thank all our employees and our clients during what has been a challenging period.
Over the past decade, we've been successful investing ahead of shifts in client demand, placing us in a strong position to take advantage of key industry tailwinds in the future. Our investments in these capabilities and our tremendous focus on our clients is now again producing good momentum in our business that became more visible as the year progressed. By working better to anticipate, understand and meet client needs during the challenging times, we've achieved 6 straight months of net long-term inflows, totaling nearly $18 billion in the second half of 2020, with progress across channels, geographies and asset classes.
Retail flows improved in the second half significantly. Our solutions-enabled institutional pipeline remain near record levels. We saw net inflows in Asia Pacific totaling $17 billion in the second half of the year and improving flows in EMEA and the Americas over this time frame.
And net long-term flows in the fixed income remained robust during that period. All of these factors combined build a strong foundation as we head into 2021. And maybe a few highlights of the fourth quarter on Slide 4, if you happen to be following along.
More specifically during the quarter, investment performance for a large portion of our high demand capabilities were in the upper quartiles. We had net long-term inflows of nearly $10 billion during the quarter. Long-term inflows and fixed income capabilities continued, while we saw client demand for equities within ETFs, quantitative and index strategies, in particular. We saw another quarter of strong inflows in Asia Pacific region and flows in the Americas turned positive. Allison will provide more information in a few minutes on the flows, strategic evaluation, more details of the quarter. But I would like to note that we also improved our operating leverage during the period, paid our credit facility to 0 and made progress improving our cash position.
I would like to spend a few minutes on Slides 5 and 6 to talk about our competitive strength and key capabilities in areas with high client demand and our focus for 2021.
Slide 5 illustrates the market opportunities we see for these key growth areas and demonstrates the majority of our investment capabilities are aligned with these opportunities. In these areas, our investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive and well positioned for growth. And as we move into 2021, we plan to further expand our market-leading position in ETFs in the U.S. and EMEA, in particular, and build our passive presence in Asia Pacific.
We are the fourth largest ETF provider globally, and our capabilities span passive, active strategies and established and developing spectrum of ETF -- ESG ETFs. And building on our 15-year legacy of innovation, we continue to develop new products in this space as demonstrated by the launch of the QQQ innovation suite and our first nontransparent ETFs that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Strong alternative platform, and our focus is growing our private markets business, led by our market-leading real estate and bank loan businesses
[Audio Gap]
Active fixed income and global equity remains areas of opportunity for us, and our offerings are well positioned with strong investment performance and high client demand. In addition, we are focused on our solutions efforts. And as we have seen by the contribution to the institutional pipeline, clients value the service, the ability to offer solutions that builds -- that's built on the full power of our competitive set of capability and services to clients continue to be a priority for us during 2021.
We continue to invest in our leadership position in Greater China. We've been managing dedicated Chinese products for nearly 40 years. We have already seen the benefits of our early mover advantage in the China onshore market through our joint venture, which was the first sino-foreign joint venture in the industry established almost 20 years ago.
Turning to Slide 6. As we noted in the third quarter, we see opportunities to invest in areas of growth aligned with our strategic plan. These areas include ETF, alternatives, active fixed income, global equities, which includes emerging markets. And we will build on our market-leading position in the fast-growing China market and further develop our leading solutions and asset allocation offerings.
Given our investment in the business over the past decade, our most recent efforts to better align the organization with our strategy, I'm confident we have the talent, the capabilities and the resources and momentum to drive the future growth and success. We're optimistic about the new year and remain focused on helping our clients achieve their desired outcomes, regardless of where the markets take us.
And with that, I will turn it over to Allison to get into further details."

Good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 7. We had 61% and 70% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, reflecting strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.
Looking at our AUM on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $1.35 trillion in AUM. Of the $132 billion in AUM growth, approximately $95 billion is a function of increased market values.
Turning to flows on Slide 9. Our diversified platform generated long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter of $9.8 billion, representing 3.9% annualized organic growth, which generated positive net inflows and active AUM of $400 million and passive AUM of $9.4 billion. Our ETFs experienced net inflows of $6.1 billion, including $4.7 billion in long-term ETFs and $1.4 billion in our QQs.
Our U.S.-listed ETFS, excluding the QQQs, had their best quarter in their 15-year history. We saw net long-term ETF flows in the U.S.-focused on equities in the fourth quarter, including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which had $2.7 billion in net inflows in the quarter. 2 of our top 5 inflowing ETFs were ESG related. We continue to see momentum in our ETF business and demand for ESG funds. And as Marty highlighted, the market opportunity is significant for this key growth area in 2021.
Retail net outflows were $800 million in the quarter, helped by the positive ETF flows. On the institutional side, we had net inflows of $10.6 billion. I'll provide a little more color on these flows on the next few slides, but importantly, the growth in our passive AUM and our institutional AUM is meaningful for the firm and contributed to the positive operating leverage we generated in the period. Also, as Marty noted earlier, we're seeing the mix of ETF inflows being weighted towards higher fee-generating products.
Looking at flows by geography, you'll note that the Americas had net inflows of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $6.6 billion from the prior quarter. This improvement was driven by net inflows into ETF, institutional inflows, various fixed income strategies and importantly, focused sales efforts and improvement in redemption rates. Our global equity products improved by over $1 billion or 37% from Q3, driven by our developing markets fund, which returned to positive net flows in the fourth quarter following negative net flows in the first 3 quarters of the year.
The U.K. experienced net outflows of $100 million in the quarter as positive flows into our institutional quantitative equity capability were offset by net outflows in multi-asset and U.K. equities. EMEA net outflows were $1.4 billion, driven by institutional lumpiness and ETF outflows, largely in our S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 used ETFs.
And finally, I noted last quarter that Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever with net inflows of $8 billion. In the fourth quarter, net inflows were even higher at $9.1 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the Asia Pacific region. $4 billion of these net flows were from Japan, $3.8 billion arose from our China JV, and the remaining $1.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region. It's worth noting that we continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the fourth quarter, with net long-term inflows of $8.2 billion. This following net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion in the third quarter and $6 billion in the second quarter. It's also important to note that of the $26.1 billion in fixed income net inflows in 2020, $25 billion of these net inflows were from active fixed income capabilities. Active fixed income has been a growth area for us in 2020 and remains a key investment area in 2021.
Now moving to Slide 10. Our institutional pipeline remains robust at $30.5 billion on the heels of strong pull-through in the institutional pipeline during the fourth quarter. This pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continued investment in this key capability in 2021.
Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our revenues increased $135 million or 12.4% from the third quarter, driven by higher average AUM in Q4 as well as a meaningful increase in performance fees. Net revenue yield ex performance fees was 36 basis points flat and flat at the third -- at the Q3 yield level. The impact of rising markets on our yield was offset by a modest fee rate decline from the mix shift we experienced across products in the quarter as well as the impact of nonmanagement fee earning AUM.
We recorded performance fees of $78 million in the fourth quarter, $48 million of these performance fees arose from our real estate business and $21 million from our institutional business and our China JV, 2 of our key growth areas. Seasonally, we tend to see higher performance fees in the fourth quarter.
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 8.3% in Q4. The $57 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of both market growth and compensation related to the performance fees in the quarter. Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations that persisted in the quarter. That being said, we did see a seasonal increase in marketing expenses as expected.
Moving to Slide 12. We wanted to update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. As we noted previously, we conducted a strategic evaluation across 4 key areas of our expense base. Our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. While creating permanent net improvements of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base. As we noted, a large element of the savings will be generated from compensation, which includes realigning our non-client-facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower-cost locations.
In the fourth quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $7 million of these savings were related to compensation expense, as depicted on Slide 12. The remaining $500,000 in savings were related to facilities, which are shown in the property, office and technology category. The $7.5 million in cost savings were $30 million annualized, is 15% of our $200 million net savings expectation. Of the remaining $170 million in net savings, we anticipate we will realize roughly 50% of the savings through compensation expense.
The remaining 50% was spread across occupancy, tech spend and G&A. As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder recognized by the end of '22. We estimate that we will realize roughly 75% of the anticipated compensation reductions in 2021, roughly 50% of the anticipated reduction in occupancy expense also in 2021 and all of the reduction in G&A this year.
The majority of efficiencies identified in our tech spend will not be realized until 2022. In the fourth quarter, we incurred $104 million of our total estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs. We expect the remaining transaction cost for the realization of this program to be in a range of $150 million to $175 million over the next 2 years, with roughly 2/3 of this remaining amount occurring in 2021. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.
With respect to Q1, after improved market performance and asset inflows in the fourth quarter, we start the year with over $1.3 trillion in AUM. Given the market improvement was more back-end weighted towards the end of the quarter, we expect both operating revenues, excluding performance fees, and the associated variable expenses to be modestly higher in the first quarter. This reflects the follow-through from the market and flow growth that occurred over the course of the fourth quarter, even as we assume no change in markets from year-end.
On the expense side, this will include higher associated variable compensation and the seasonal increase in payroll taxes. Partially offset by lower compensation-related to the seasonal decline in performance fees and the execution of our targeted cost savings.
Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted operating income improved $78 million to $485 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin include 230 basis points as compared to the third quarter to 39.5%, demonstrating the operating leverage in our model. This helped drive the $0.19 increase in adjusted EPS to $0.72 a share.
In addition, we benefited from higher nonoperating income and lower nonoperating expenses in the quarter. Nonoperating income included $31.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $15.2 million in net gains last quarter. The increase was driven by unrealized gains primarily in our seed money holdings. Interest expense of $24.4 million was 28% lower than the prior quarter. Q3 was the final quarter in which we paid dividends related to our forward purchase agreements, a portion of which we settled in January, with the remaining portion to be settled in April of 2021.
Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%. The reduction in the rate reflects the lower taxes on unrealized gains in our seed portfolio due to the jurisdiction of our holdings. We estimate our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.
A few comments on Slide 14. As Marty mentioned, we reduced our revolver balance by $90 million to 0 in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile.
In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility. To that end, our balance sheet cash position improved to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter from $1.1 billion at the end of Q3. $764 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. I will note, we paid $117 million earlier in January to settle a portion of the forward share repurchase liability with the remaining liability of $177 million to be settled in April. We believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer-term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases.
In summary, Marty walked through our key capabilities, the organic growth opportunity each presents and our focus on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas. We're also focused on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth, and we remain prudent and cautious in our approach to capital management. Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we have done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities put Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions."

Let me just start with, obviously, we had pretty high performance fees in the fourth quarter. So excluding performance fees, as you saw, net revenue yield was flat at 36 basis points in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. I mean it's fairly straightforward in terms of what was driving that. You've got the impact of the rising markets on our yield. And then that's which was a positive, of course. And then we've got some offset there, given the modest pressure we continue to see just from the client demand and the mix shift that's there. We've got, consistent with industry, high interest in our passive capabilities and some churn within our active, and that does put some downward pressure on net revenue yield. And this was a quarter where the impact of really strong market growth helped offset that.
In terms of what does that mean for this year, I would say that trend right there, we would expect to continue. I do expect we will continue to see high interest in our passive capabilities and some continued churn within active. What does that mean for net revenue yield going forward? It's very difficult to predict, as you know. What I would point you to is that our focus is not simply on net revenue yield. We've really got the breadth of capabilities to serve our clients well. I think that's really starting to be demonstrated in the results over the last couple of quarters. And as we focus on that, we really are focusing on operating margin and making sure that we are managing our expense base to the top line of the firm and really driving profitable growth across our platform."

That market growth, excluding performance fee, really did come in the back half of the year, and we started the year with a very high level of AUM.
And you see what I see in terms of the markets thus far that we enter with strong revenue growth as that maintains, and we hope that maintains. And then along with that, we've got the associated variable compensation, and that does drive compensation higher, all things being equal for the quarter. And then we have the seasonality of payroll taxes and some pension expenses that occur in the first quarter of the year. Now those are going to be offset by the -- what we're doing in terms of our targeted cost saves and of course, the lower compensation that we would have in this quarter, excluding performance fees.
The net of all of that, the puts and takes, hard to say exactly, given the strong run-up in revenue and the associated expenses. But it's, I would say, flattish, and I'm talking total expenses fourth quarter. In terms of the cadence of the cost saves, I think it's reasonable to look at those as being spread relatively equally over the year. There may be a little bit of front-end loading into the first half of the year, but relatively equal."

The U.S. retail channel is really starting to make tremendous change in progress. We're not where we want to be, that's for sure. But the momentum's there, the gross flows are there. We're seeing flows as you look into the year outside of ETFs in the traditional asset classes, munis, short-duration fixed income. Emerging markets is actually picking up, which is really good news. That's back in the flow. So cautiously optimistic.
Within alternatives, it's largely been on GTR, and that was really the driver this past quarter. Bank loans were also an area that were still in outflows.

Our approach has been to have a very talented, quantitative solutions team. It's very strong at asset allocation, building anything from models to customize solutions for clients and also advisory to clients, whether it be in sort of the big corner office suites in the retail channel, but quite frankly, large pension plans around the world.
And our approach has been to use our capabilities, whether it be our passive capabilities, our factor capabilities all the way through alternative capabilities. So it's not a duplicative set of skills. It's literally using what we've had in existence. We have built what is a very, very strong analytical tool that we use with clients as a way to help them analyze their portfolios. That's how the engagements happen. And any one of those outcomes can happen simply from an advice engagement to building a customized solution. During that journey, as you build it out, how you engage, how you face off with clients, there are clearly modifications to how you do that.
And we seem to have found ourselves in a situation where we seem to have the formula right based on the outcomes that we're seeing. And I come back to -- this really is the fundamental topic that is driving the change in the industry is that clients are working with fewer money managers that are expecting more from money managers. So if you don't have that breadth of capability and if you don't have the ability to serve clients through these engagements, you're truly disadvantaged.
And so it is really making a difference for us, and we expect that will be the case in the years ahead. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color."

I'll also just remind everyone, we do have seasonality and comp expense that is -- seasonality and cash-flow-related comp expense in the first quarter. Historically, the company has drawn on the revolver in the first quarter. We've obviously managed our cash balances a little bit higher. There is strong cash flow, just given the AUM dynamics that we see right now. I don't know what that will look like exactly as we work through the quarter, and we do have the liability to settle in April. All that said, we're in a very strong position. And I continue -- I expect us to continue to build our cash balances longer-term and improved net leverage.
And then as I think about just what does that mean for the financial flexibility that we're looking to achieve and returning capital to shareholders. We are committed to that financial flexibility. We do want to invest in the business, first and foremost, to support future growth in the business. We do remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet. And ultimately, we want to be in a position to return excess cash to shareholders. And I do expect that we'll be doing that through a stable and modestly growing dividend and eventually share repurchases.
And so we are coming up soon here on the 1 year of having made some decisions around that. And we've got the opportunity to think about what our capital -- our return of capital to shareholders looks like, and we will be working through that in the coming months.

There's lots of cross-current inflows, outflows by different products and geographies.

I mean, I guess, that's not a number we would disclose or think about exactly. But if you think about what you're looking at is excluding market. And you surely look at the fee rate associated with where interest is, as we point to every quarter, you continue to see a little bit of mix shift from some of the higher fee products to some of the lower fee products.
So that is -- that does put pressure on your organic fee growth. No question, without some market improvement in there, you would see downward pressure there. Our focus then really does shift to profitability. So I'll come to your second question.
How do we think about the profitability given those dynamics because markets go up and markets go down, and we've seen the pressure that can put on the top line. As we think about the profitability, and I'm not sure I'm going to answer your question exactly, I'm not sure I caught all the different puts and takes you were thinking about there, but I guess I would answer it this way. While the absolute fee rate of some of our lower fee products would be lower, so take an ETF, for example, in the United States, the absolute fee rate there would be about half of a U.S.-based mutual fund. That said, the margin contribution is about the same, very similar because you have lower servicing costs. And so the margin on both are neutral to positive to our overall firm margins. And it really then becomes a function of volume because while the margin is the same, the absolute operating income yield would be lower. And so you have to drive more volume over a lower fee product to contribute the same dollar of operating income that you would over a higher fee product.
And that's really how we think about it. I mean these are just the facts of our business and the fact of where demand is and making sure we're positioned to capture all of that demand and then making sure we're well positioned to maintain our margins at a minimum even in markets where we could be under pressure."

The organic growth -- organic asset growth was like quite good this quarter, like 3.9%. Is that contributing to revenue?

Because it happens to be, EMEA was out, some alts were out, you've got high fee ETFs, but they're not quite high enough and even 3.9% asset growth isn't enough to boost revenue growth.

And then in terms of what would be higher, the seasonality of payroll taxes and some benefits. So that's somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range. Then you've got the targeted cost saves that will be in there somewhere. We're not giving specific guidance around that any more so than what I've already provided. And I think that's probably the best way to think about it.
The one thing that is not totally the same is the run-up in the fourth quarter is what -- we only have that for, kind of, call it, 6 weeks or so at the end of the quarter. If asset levels hold where they began the year, and we've certainly seen them hold through thus far into the month, you can expect that revenue and the associated compensation expense with that would be higher than what you would see in the fourth quarter, and that's just thinking about the typical relationship between revenue and compensation expense."

So we're pretty well into it right now. We're not done. But that is something that is absolutely a top focus of ours as an organization. The reality is, if you are not skilled at managing ESG capabilities, even within your traditional asset classes, you really are going to be challenged in EMEA. I'd say in the United States, it is moving beyond what was a conversation 12, 18 months ago, so being something very, very real, and you're seeing commercial implications of it. And that is the same thing in Asia Pacific.
Specifically using that more narrow definition that we have, so we have about $34 billion in ESG AUM, but it's really quite broad. We have about 90 ESG funds or mandates that comes through. And I think the other area where we're seeing outside of institutional is really picking up on a retail basis. And right now, we're the second largest provider of ESG ETFs in the United States, and there's about $9 billion in those assets. So again, more to go.

It's a good way to get 3 questions in that too, but very good, you've done this before. So look, with regard to let's be very, very clear, the Board is absolutely dedicated to drive the success of this organization. They value Invesco being an independent global asset manager. And again, the results are, as I said, you can see the momentum, and we anticipate -- we're on a good track. So that's the first point.
And secondly, within any conversation around M&A, my comments would be very similar to somebody looking at any money manager. And if it's not strategic, if there's a lot of overlap, if it's inconsistent with what clients want, it is very hard to do. And so as you say, that would get you to even narrow set of options, if you consider something like that. So again, the criteria works both ways, and I think that's important to understand.
And then with regard to the Board, again, we've had a very strong board. And Nelson, Ed and Tom Finke from Barings have joined. All 3 are very, very talented. Tom was the former CEO of Barings. Nelson had been around the space for a very long time. They know the space. They obviously are -- been very outspoken about the opportunities that they see within the asset management space. The dynamic has been very good. I mean you brought 3 new experts on to the Board. And again, just making sure we as an organization are laser-focused on providing for clients and shareholders. And with the existing Board members, I think if anybody owns a stock, they should feel really good about it."

I think we're all very ready to turn the page on what was a very challenging 2020. And while the global pandemic remains very pervasive, we do all see light at the end of the tunnel, and we look forward to 2021 with cautious optimism that conditions will improve.
Throughout 2020, we focused on executing our long-term strategy of recognizing the necessity to focus on employee health and safety, finding new ways to work in serving and delivering expected outcomes to our clients. I would like to thank all our employees and our clients during what has been a challenging period.
Over the past decade, we've been successful investing ahead of shifts in client demand, placing us in a strong position to take advantage of key industry tailwinds in the future. Our investments in these capabilities and our tremendous focus on our clients is now again producing good momentum in our business that became more visible as the year progressed. By working better to anticipate, understand and meet client needs during the challenging times, we've achieved 6 straight months of net long-term inflows, totaling nearly $18 billion in the second half of 2020, with progress across channels, geographies and asset classes.
Retail flows improved in the second half significantly. Our solutions-enabled institutional pipeline remain near record levels. We saw net inflows in Asia Pacific totaling $17 billion in the second half of the year and improving flows in EMEA and the Americas over this time frame.
And net long-term flows in the fixed income remained robust during that period. All of these factors combined build a strong foundation as we head into 2021. And maybe a few highlights of the fourth quarter on Slide 4, if you happen to be following along.
More specifically during the quarter, investment performance for a large portion of our high demand capabilities were in the upper quartiles. We had net long-term inflows of nearly $10 billion during the quarter. Long-term inflows and fixed income capabilities continued, while we saw client demand for equities within ETFs, quantitative and index strategies, in particular. We saw another quarter of strong inflows in Asia Pacific region and flows in the Americas turned positive. Allison will provide more information in a few minutes on the flows, strategic evaluation, more details of the quarter. But I would like to note that we also improved our operating leverage during the period, paid our credit facility to 0 and made progress improving our cash position.
I would like to spend a few minutes on Slides 5 and 6 to talk about our competitive strength and key capabilities in areas with high client demand and our focus for 2021.
Slide 5 illustrates the market opportunities we see for these key growth areas and demonstrates the majority of our investment capabilities are aligned with these opportunities. In these areas, our investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive and well positioned for growth. And as we move into 2021, we plan to further expand our market-leading position in ETFs in the U.S. and EMEA, in particular, and build our passive presence in Asia Pacific.
We are the fourth largest ETF provider globally, and our capabilities span passive, active strategies and established and developing spectrum of ETF -- ESG ETFs. And building on our 15-year legacy of innovation, we continue to develop new products in this space as demonstrated by the launch of the QQQ innovation suite and our first nontransparent ETFs that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Strong alternative platform, and our focus is growing our private markets business, led by our market-leading real estate and bank loan businesses
[Audio Gap]
Active fixed income and global equity remains areas of opportunity for us, and our offerings are well positioned with strong investment performance and high client demand. In addition, we are focused on our solutions efforts. And as we have seen by the contribution to the institutional pipeline, clients value the service, the ability to offer solutions that builds -- that's built on the full power of our competitive set of capability and services to clients continue to be a priority for us during 2021.
We continue to invest in our leadership position in Greater China. We've been managing dedicated Chinese products for nearly 40 years. We have already seen the benefits of our early mover advantage in the China onshore market through our joint venture, which was the first sino-foreign joint venture in the industry established almost 20 years ago.
Turning to Slide 6. As we noted in the third quarter, we see opportunities to invest in areas of growth aligned with our strategic plan. These areas include ETF, alternatives, active fixed income, global equities, which includes emerging markets. And we will build on our market-leading position in the fast-growing China market and further develop our leading solutions and asset allocation offerings.
Given our investment in the business over the past decade, our most recent efforts to better align the organization with our strategy, I'm confident we have the talent, the capabilities and the resources and momentum to drive the future growth and success. We're optimistic about the new year and remain focused on helping our clients achieve their desired outcomes, regardless of where the markets take us.
And with that, I will turn it over to Allison to get into further details."

We had 61% and 70% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, reflecting strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.
Looking at our AUM on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $1.35 trillion in AUM. Of the $132 billion in AUM growth, approximately $95 billion is a function of increased market values.
Turning to flows on Slide 9. Our diversified platform generated long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter of $9.8 billion, representing 3.9% annualized organic growth, which generated positive net inflows and active AUM of $400 million and passive AUM of $9.4 billion. Our ETFs experienced net inflows of $6.1 billion, including $4.7 billion in long-term ETFs and $1.4 billion in our QQs.
Our U.S.-listed ETFS, excluding the QQQs, had their best quarter in their 15-year history. We saw net long-term ETF flows in the U.S.-focused on equities in the fourth quarter, including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which had $2.7 billion in net inflows in the quarter. 2 of our top 5 inflowing ETFs were ESG related. We continue to see momentum in our ETF business and demand for ESG funds. And as Marty highlighted, the market opportunity is significant for this key growth area in 2021.
Retail net outflows were $800 million in the quarter, helped by the positive ETF flows. On the institutional side, we had net inflows of $10.6 billion. I'll provide a little more color on these flows on the next few slides, but importantly, the growth in our passive AUM and our institutional AUM is meaningful for the firm and contributed to the positive operating leverage we generated in the period. Also, as Marty noted earlier, we're seeing the mix of ETF inflows being weighted towards higher fee-generating products.
Looking at flows by geography, you'll note that the Americas had net inflows of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $6.6 billion from the prior quarter. This improvement was driven by net inflows into ETF, institutional inflows, various fixed income strategies and importantly, focused sales efforts and improvement in redemption rates. Our global equity products improved by over $1 billion or 37% from Q3, driven by our developing markets fund, which returned to positive net flows in the fourth quarter following negative net flows in the first 3 quarters of the year.
The U.K. experienced net outflows of $100 million in the quarter as positive flows into our institutional quantitative equity capability were offset by net outflows in multi-asset and U.K. equities. EMEA net outflows were $1.4 billion, driven by institutional lumpiness and ETF outflows, largely in our S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 used ETFs.
And finally, I noted last quarter that Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever with net inflows of $8 billion. In the fourth quarter, net inflows were even higher at $9.1 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the Asia Pacific region. $4 billion of these net flows were from Japan, $3.8 billion arose from our China JV, and the remaining $1.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region. It's worth noting that we continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the fourth quarter, with net long-term inflows of $8.2 billion. This following net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion in the third quarter and $6 billion in the second quarter. It's also important to note that of the $26.1 billion in fixed income net inflows in 2020, $25 billion of these net inflows were from active fixed income capabilities. Active fixed income has been a growth area for us in 2020 and remains a key investment area in 2021.
Now moving to Slide 10. Our institutional pipeline remains robust at $30.5 billion on the heels of strong pull-through in the institutional pipeline during the fourth quarter. This pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continued investment in this key capability in 2021.
Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our revenues increased $135 million or 12.4% from the third quarter, driven by higher average AUM in Q4 as well as a meaningful increase in performance fees. Net revenue yield ex performance fees was 36 basis points flat and flat at the third -- at the Q3 yield level. The impact of rising markets on our yield was offset by a modest fee rate decline from the mix shift we experienced across products in the quarter as well as the impact of nonmanagement fee earning AUM.
We recorded performance fees of $78 million in the fourth quarter, $48 million of these performance fees arose from our real estate business and $21 million from our institutional business and our China JV, 2 of our key growth areas. Seasonally, we tend to see higher performance fees in the fourth quarter.
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 8.3% in Q4. The $57 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of both market growth and compensation related to the performance fees in the quarter. Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations that persisted in the quarter. That being said, we did see a seasonal increase in marketing expenses as expected.
Moving to Slide 12. We wanted to update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. As we noted previously, we conducted a strategic evaluation across 4 key areas of our expense base. Our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. While creating permanent net improvements of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base. As we noted, a large element of the savings will be generated from compensation, which includes realigning our non-client-facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower-cost locations.
In the fourth quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $7 million of these savings were related to compensation expense, as depicted on Slide 12. The remaining $500,000 in savings were related to facilities, which are shown in the property, office and technology category. The $7.5 million in cost savings were $30 million annualized, is 15% of our $200 million net savings expectation. Of the remaining $170 million in net savings, we anticipate we will realize roughly 50% of the savings through compensation expense.
The remaining 50% was spread across occupancy, tech spend and G&A. As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder recognized by the end of '22. We estimate that we will realize roughly 75% of the anticipated compensation reductions in 2021, roughly 50% of the anticipated reduction in occupancy expense also in 2021 and all of the reduction in G&A this year.
The majority of efficiencies identified in our tech spend will not be realized until 2022. In the fourth quarter, we incurred $104 million of our total estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs. We expect the remaining transaction cost for the realization of this program to be in a range of $150 million to $175 million over the next 2 years, with roughly 2/3 of this remaining amount occurring in 2021. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.
With respect to Q1, after improved market performance and asset inflows in the fourth quarter, we start the year with over $1.3 trillion in AUM. Given the market improvement was more back-end weighted towards the end of the quarter, we expect both operating revenues, excluding performance fees, and the associated variable expenses to be modestly higher in the first quarter. This reflects the follow-through from the market and flow growth that occurred over the course of the fourth quarter, even as we assume no change in markets from year-end.
On the expense side, this will include higher associated variable compensation and the seasonal increase in payroll taxes. Partially offset by lower compensation-related to the seasonal decline in performance fees and the execution of our targeted cost savings.
Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted operating income improved $78 million to $485 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin include 230 basis points as compared to the third quarter to 39.5%, demonstrating the operating leverage in our model. This helped drive the $0.19 increase in adjusted EPS to $0.72 a share.
In addition, we benefited from higher nonoperating income and lower nonoperating expenses in the quarter. Nonoperating income included $31.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $15.2 million in net gains last quarter. The increase was driven by unrealized gains primarily in our seed money holdings. Interest expense of $24.4 million was 28% lower than the prior quarter. Q3 was the final quarter in which we paid dividends related to our forward purchase agreements, a portion of which we settled in January, with the remaining portion to be settled in April of 2021.
Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%. The reduction in the rate reflects the lower taxes on unrealized gains in our seed portfolio due to the jurisdiction of our holdings. We estimate our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.
A few comments on Slide 14. As Marty mentioned, we reduced our revolver balance by $90 million to 0 in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile.
In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility. To that end, our balance sheet cash position improved to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter from $1.1 billion at the end of Q3. $764 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. I will note, we paid $117 million earlier in January to settle a portion of the forward share repurchase liability with the remaining liability of $177 million to be settled in April. We believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer-term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases.
In summary, Marty walked through our key capabilities, the organic growth opportunity each presents and our focus on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas. We're also focused on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth, and we remain prudent and cautious in our approach to capital management. Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we have done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities put Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions."

First, just I guess, in terms of the fourth quarter, is there anything abnormal in this period? Obviously, mix and beta were positive. So I just want to clarify that this is a good exit kind of run rate for the fee rate.

So excluding performance fees, as you saw, net revenue yield was",303,"Sure. Dan. So I'd take first on the fourth quarter, your question around was anything abnormal. Let me just start with, obviously, we had pretty high performance fees in the fourth quarter. So excluding performance fees, as you saw, net revenue yield was flat at 36 basis points in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. I mean it's fairly straightforward in terms of what was driving that. You've got the impact of the rising markets on our yield. And then that's which was a positive, of course. And then we've got some offset there, given the modest pressure we continue to see just from the client demand and the mix shift that's there. We've got, consistent with industry, high interest in our passive capabilities and some churn within our active, and that does put some downward pressure on net revenue yield. And this was a quarter where the impact of really strong market growth helped offset that.
In terms of what does that mean for this year, I would say that trend right there, we would expect to continue. I do expect we will continue to see high interest in our passive capabilities and some continued churn within active. What does that mean for net revenue yield going forward? It's very difficult to predict, as you know. What I would point you to is that our focus is not simply on net revenue yield. We've really got the breadth of capabilities to serve our clients well. I think that's really starting to be demonstrated in the results over the last couple of quarters. And as we focus on that, we really are focusing on operating margin and making sure that we are managing our expense base to the top line of the firm and really driving profitable growth across our platform."

So yes, let me start with Q1, and there are a lot of puts and takes as you think about it, just given the really strong growth that we saw in the back half of the fourth quarter. That market growth, excluding performance fee, really did come in the back half of the year, and we started the year with a very high level of AUM.
And you see what I see in terms of the markets thus far that we enter with strong revenue growth as that maintains, and we hope that maintains. And then along with that, we've got the associated variable compensation, and that does drive compensation higher, all things being equal for the quarter. And then we have the seasonality of payroll taxes and some pension expenses that occur in the first quarter of the year. Now those are going to be offset by the -- what we're doing in terms of our targeted cost saves and of course, the lower compensation that we would have in this quarter, excluding performance fees.
The net of all of that, the puts and takes, hard to say exactly, given the strong run-up in revenue and the associated expenses. But it's, I would say, flattish, and I'm talking total expenses fourth quarter. In terms of the cadence of the cost saves, I think it's reasonable to look at those as being spread relatively equally over the year. There may be a little bit of front-end loading into the first half of the year, but relatively equal."

The U.S. retail channel is really starting to make tremendous change in progress. We're not where we want to be, that's for sure. But the momentum's there, the gross flows are there. We're seeing flows as you look into the year outside of ETFs in the traditional asset classes, munis, short-duration fixed income. Emerging markets is actually picking up, which is really good news. That's back in the flow. So cautiously optimistic.
Within alternatives, it's largely been on GTR, and that was really the driver this past quarter. Bank loans were also an area that were still in outflows.

And our approach has been to use our capabilities, whether it be our passive capabilities, our factor capabilities all the way through alternative capabilities. So it's not a duplicative set of skills. It's literally using what we've had in existence. We have built what is a very, very strong analytical tool that we use with clients as a way to help them analyze their portfolios. That's how the engagements happen. And any one of those outcomes can happen simply from an advice engagement to building a customized solution. During that journey, as you build it out, how you engage, how you face off with clients, there are clearly modifications to how you do that.
And we seem to have found ourselves in a situation where we seem to have the formula right based on the outcomes that we're seeing. And I come back to -- this really is the fundamental topic that is driving the change in the industry is that clients are working with fewer money managers that are expecting more from money managers. So if you don't have that breadth of capability and if you don't have the ability to serve clients through these engagements, you're truly disadvantaged.
And so it is really making a difference for us, and we expect that will be the case in the years ahead. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color."

I don't know what that will look like exactly as we work through the quarter, and we do have the liability to settle in April. All that said, we're in a very strong position.

We do want to invest in the business, first and foremost, to support future growth in the business. We do remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet.

I mean, I guess, that's not a number we would disclose or think about exactly. But if you think about what you're looking at is excluding market. And you surely look at the fee rate associated with where interest is, as we point to every quarter, you continue to see a little bit of mix shift from some of the higher fee products to some of the lower fee products.
So that is -- that does put pressure on your organic fee growth. No question, without some market improvement in there, you would see downward pressure there. Our focus then really does shift to profitability. So I'll come to your second question.
How do we think about the profitability given those dynamics because markets go up and markets go down, and we've seen the pressure that can put on the top line. As we think about the profitability, and I'm not sure I'm going to answer your question exactly, I'm not sure I caught all the different puts and takes you were thinking about there, but I guess I would answer it this way. While the absolute fee rate of some of our lower fee products would be lower, so take an ETF, for example, in the United States, the absolute fee rate there would be about half of a U.S.-based mutual fund. That said, the margin contribution is about the same, very similar because you have lower servicing costs. And so the margin on both are neutral to positive to our overall firm margins. And it really then becomes a function of volume because while the margin is the same, the absolute operating income yield would be lower. And so you have to drive more volume over a lower fee product to contribute the same dollar of operating income that you would over a higher fee product.
And that's really how we think about it. I mean these are just the facts of our business and the fact of where demand is and making sure we're positioned to capture all of that demand and then making sure we're well positioned to maintain our margins at a minimum even in markets where we could be under pressure."

The one thing that is not totally the same is the run-up in the fourth quarter is what -- we only have that for, kind of, call it, 6 weeks or so at the end of the quarter.

So look, let me start with the bigger question then specific. ESG is something that we're integrating throughout all our investment management teams, probably most advanced through our capabilities in EMEA, our fixed income teams, real estate. So we're pretty well into it right now. We're not done. But that is something that is absolutely a top focus of ours as an organization. The reality is, if you are not skilled at managing ESG capabilities, even within your traditional asset classes, you really are going to be challenged in EMEA. I'd say in the United States, it is moving beyond what was a conversation 12, 18 months ago, so being something very, very real, and you're seeing commercial implications of it. And that is the same thing in Asia Pacific.
Specifically using that more narrow definition that we have, so we have about $34 billion in ESG AUM, but it's really quite broad. We have about 90 ESG funds or mandates that comes through. And I think the other area where we're seeing outside of institutional is really picking up on a retail basis. And right now, we're the second largest provider of ESG ETFs in the United States, and there's about $9 billion in those assets. So again, more to go. As I said, we have a developed capability, but it's also developing, and we're really being quite aggressive in the area."

And again, I have to be careful that you're working up mine. What drives stock price is operating outcomes and business momentum and as Allison's been talking about today, you're just seeing a markedly different set of outcomes in the last couple of quarters. As you look into 2021, again, about getting into forward guidance, it is many more tailwinds behind the organization than I've seen since 2018. And it's quite broad, by region and by channel and also within various capabilities where we pointed out, there's very, very high demand.
Now that said, there's always areas we have where we have areas for improvement. We'll continue to do that. But again, the tailwinds are very different than what we've seen since the middle of 2018. So from my perspective, that's going to drive stock price.
With regard to adding a beta provider through M&A, again, I'll just answer the question as I have before, it all depends on facts and circumstances. It has to be additive to the organization. It can't be something that is a net negative through the combination. So again, just really depends on the situation."

So that's really the success is because we've been able to operate as really a single organization there. With regard to the 49%, it is a conversation we continue to have with one on -- it's obviously slowed down, I'd say the conversations between the U.S.-China were not helpful in advancing that.

I mean I know you're -- the company is large. And so the list isn't really long of who could buy you, but there are some large buyers out there talking pretty vocally about writing checks. So curious about how you would think about that.

And again, the results are, as I said, you can see the momentum, and we anticipate -- we're on a good track. So that's the first point.
And secondly, within any conversation around M&A, my comments would be very similar to somebody looking at any money manager. And if it's not strategic, if there's a lot of overlap, if it's inconsistent with what clients want, it is very hard to do. And so as you say, that would get you to even narrow set of options, if you consider something like that. So again, the criteria works both ways, and I think that's important to understand.
And then with regard to the Board, again, we've had a very strong board. And Nelson, Ed and Tom Finke from Barings have joined. All 3 are very, very talented. Tom was the former CEO of Barings. Nelson had been around the space for a very long time. They know the space. They obviously are -- been very outspoken about the opportunities that they see within the asset management space. The dynamic has been very good. I mean you brought 3 new experts on to the Board. And again, just making sure we as an organization are laser-focused on providing for clients and shareholders.

As we begin 2021, we remain cautiously optimistic with the vaccine rollout gaining traction that will emerge from the global pandemic this year. And I think it's only confirmed by the increased second economic activity we're all seeing. That said, risks do remain. The good news is Invesco is off to a great start this year and as you can see in the results that we reported this morning. 
And if you're so inclined to follow along, I'm going to be speaking to the Highlights slide, which is Slide 3. Our investment in key capabilities and the tremendous focus on our clients continues to produce good momentum in our business. We have now achieved 9 straight months of net long-term inflows. In the first quarter, net long-term inflows were $24.5 billion. This is a record level of inflows for the firm. Net -- this follows net long-term inflows of nearly $18 billion in the second half of last year, and this represents nearly a 9% annualized long-term organic growth rate, led by net flows into ETFs, continued strength in fixed income and net inflows into the balanced funds. 
And as you can see on Slide 3, the key areas that were highlighted in January: we have scale, investment readiness and competitive strength drove the growth in the quarter. These are areas where investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive, and we're well positioned for growth. 
Retail flows significantly improved in the quarter and were $21.2 billion out of $24.5 billion of the net long-term flows. Our ETFs, excluding the Qs, generated net long-term inflows of $16.8 billion. This is also a record for the firm, which contributed significantly to the $10 billion of net long-term inflows generated in the Americas. 
Invesco's U.S. ETFs, excluding the Qs, captured 6.7% of the U.S. industry net ETF inflows. This is more than 2x our 3% market share. Within private markets, we launched 2 CLOs, which raised $800 million. And we remain focused on our alternative capabilities of space, where we also see the benefits of our MassMutual. MassMutual has committed over $1 billion to various strategies, including providing a credit facility to one of our private market funds. 
We had net long-term inflows of $6.5 billion within active fixed income. And within active global equities, our nearly $50 billion developing markets fund, key capability acquired in the Oppenheimer transaction, saw $1.3 billion of inflows. That said, there's still areas of improvement within active equities, where we continue to work and remain focused on those opportunities. 
Net long-term inflows into Asia Pac were $16.7 billion in the first quarter, following $17 billion of net inflows in the second half of 2020. The China JV launched 9 new funds with $6.2 billion of net long-term inflows. In addition, our solutions-enabled institutional pipeline has grown meaningfully and accounts for over 60% of our pipeline at the end of the quarter. Allison will provide more information in a few minutes on the flows, the pipeline, the results for the quarter. But I would note, we generated positive operating leverage, producing an operating margin of 40.2% for the quarter. 
Strong cash flows being generated from our operations improved our cash position, resulting in no drawdown on our credit facility at quarter end, a quarter where we experienced seasonally higher demand on our cash flow. The Board also approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share. Given our historical investments in the business and our most recent efforts to further align our organization with our strategy, I'm confident, talent, capabilities, the resources and the momentum to drive -- to deliver for our clients and drive further growth and success. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Allison to walk through the results in greater detail."

Our investment performance improved in the first quarter, with 70% and 76% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, respectively. This reflected co",2468,"Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 4. Our investment performance improved in the first quarter, with 70% and 76% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, respectively. This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging markets equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. 
I'll also note that our published investment performance now reflects Morningstar peer rankings for composites where U.S.-domiciled mutual fund is the most representative AUM in the composite, whereas previously, we had relied on Lipper data. This transition more closely aligns our data to the investment performance data reviewed by our U.S. clients and is more consistent with how our peers reflect investment performance. Additionally, we've expanded the population of AUM included in performance disclosures by about $150 billion for each period presented through the addition of benchmark-relative performance data for institutional AUM, where pure rankings do not exist. This approach is used by certain of our peers, and we believe it more meaningfully represents the contribution of our institutional AUM to our performance metrics. 
Moving to Slide 5. You'll notice we reorganized our ending AUM and net long-term flow slides to group the ending AUM and net long-term flows together for each cut of our data by total, investment approach, channel, geography and asset class. We believe this will better illustrate our flows in the context of our overall AUM for each category. 
We ended the quarter with just over $1.4 trillion in AUM. Of the $54 billion in AUM growth, approximately $25 billion is a function of increased market values. Our diversified platform generated net long-term inflows in the first quarter of $24.5 billion, representing 8.8% annualized organic growth. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $7.5 billion or 3.4% annualized organic growth rate. In passive AUM, net long-term inflows were $17 billion or a 31.3% annualized organic growth rate. 
The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement from roughly flat performance in the fourth quarter, driven by the positive ETF flows. Institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $3.3 billion in the quarter. 
Regarding retail net inflows. Our ETFs, excluding the QQQ suite, generated net long-term inflows of $16.8 billion, including meaningful net inflows into our higher-fee ETFs. Net ETF inflows in the U.S. were focused on equities in the first quarter, including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which had $4 billion in net inflows in the quarter. In addition to the S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, we had 5 other ETFs that reported net inflows of over $1 billion each. These 6 ETFs represented $10 billion in net inflows for the quarter. It's also worth noting that our Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF, the QQQJ, surpassed the $1 billion AUM mark in the quarter following its inception in October of 2020. This is on the heels of our successful QQQ marketing campaign and sponsorship of the NCAA Championship in the first quarter. 
Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6. You'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $10 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $7.8 billion from the fourth quarter. The improvement was driven by net inflows into ETFs, institutional net inflows, various fixed income strategies, and importantly, focused sales efforts. 
Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever with net long-term inflows of $16.7 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region. $9.4 billion of these net inflows were from Greater China, including $8.5 billion in our China JV. The balance of the flows in Asia Pacific were comprised of $3 billion from Japan, $1.9 billion from Singapore, and the remaining $2.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region. 
Net long-term inflows for EMEA excluding the U.K. were $3.7 billion driven by retail flows, including particularly strong net inflows of $1.2 billion into our Global Consumer Trends Fund, the growth equities capability, which saw demand from across the EMEA region. Net inflows in EMEA were $1.6 billion in the quarter, including interest in a wide variety of U.S.- and EMEA-based ETFs. 
Notably, we saw net inflows of $0.5 billion into our blockchain ETF and $400 million into one of our newly launched ESG ETFs in the quarter, the Invesco MSCI USA ESG Universal-Screened ETF. And finally, the U.K. experienced net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion in the quarter driven by net outflows in multi-asset, institutional quantitative equities and U.K. equities. 
Turning to flows across asset class. Equity net long-term inflows of $9.8 billion reflect some of the capabilities I've mentioned, including the Developing Markets Fund, the Global Consumer Trends Fund and ETF, including our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF. 
We continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the first quarter with net long-term inflows of $7.6 billion, this following net inflows of $8.2 billion in fixed income in the fourth quarter. It's worth noting that the net inflows in the balanced asset class of $7.3 billion arose largely from China. 
In alternatives, net long-term inflows improved by $4.1 billion due to a combination of inflows in senior loan commodities and newly launched CLOs during the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline grew to $45.5 billion at March 31 from $30.5 billion at year-end. The growth in the pipeline this quarter includes a large lower-fee passive-indexing mandate in Asia Pacific, assisted by our Custom Solutions Advisory team. This is an opportunity for us to offer a solutions-based differentiated passive investment to meet the needs of a key strategic client with the potential to expand the relationship over time with access to higher-fee opportunities. We are also able to leverage our in-house indexing capabilities with this mandate. 
Excluding this large mandate in Asia Pacific, the pipeline remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of size, asset mix and fee composition. While there's always some uncertainty with large client funding, we're currently estimating that between 50% and 65% of the pipeline will fund in the second quarter, including the large indexing mandate. The funding of this mandate will also have a slight downward impact on our net revenue yield next quarter. 
Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability enables 61% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continuing investment and focus on this key capability. 
Turning to Slide 8. You'll notice that our net revenues increased $23 million or 1.8% from the fourth quarter as higher average AUM in the first quarter was partially offset by $71 million decrease in performance fees from the prior quarter. The net revenue yield excluding performance fees was 35.7 basis points, a decrease of 0.3 basis point from the fourth quarter yield level. This decrease was driven by lower day count in the first quarter that negatively impacted the yield by 0.8 basis point and higher discretionary money market fee waivers that negatively impacted the yield by 0.3 basis point. These negative impacts were partially offset by the positive impact of rising markets and net long-term inflows during the quarter. Going forward, we do expect money market fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. 
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 0.7% in the first quarter. The $5 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of higher revenue as well as the seasonal increase in payroll taxes and certain benefits, offset by the reduction in compensation related to performance fees recognized last quarter and savings that we realized in the quarter resulting from our strategic evaluation. Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations that have persisted in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 9, we update you on the progress we've made with our strategic evaluation. As we've noted previously, we're looking across 4 key areas of our expense base: our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China, solutions, alternatives and global equities while creating permanent net improvements of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base. 
A large element of the savings will be generated from compensation, which includes realigning our nonclient-facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower-cost locations. The remainder of the savings will come through property, office and technology and G&A expenses. In the first quarter, we realized $16 million in cost savings. $15 million of the savings was related to compensation expense. The remaining $1 million in savings was related to facilities, which is shown in the property office and technology category. 
The $16 million in cost savings were $65 million annualized, combined with the $30 million in annualized savings realized in 2020, brings us to $95 million or 48% of our $200 million net savings expectation. As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder realized by the end of 2022. Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate we will realize roughly 65% of the savings through compensation expense. The remaining 35% would be spread across occupancy, tax spend and G&A. The breakdown for the remaining $50 million in net cost saves in 2022 will be similar. 
With $95 million of the expected $150 million in net savings by the end of this year already in the quarterly run rate, the degree of net savings per quarter will moderate going forward. In the first quarter, we incurred $30 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $150 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with this program. We expect the remaining transaction cost for the realization of this program to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million over the next 2 years, with roughly 1/2 of this amount occurring in the remainder of 2021. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. 
Our expectations are for second quarter operating expenses to be relatively flat to the first quarter, assuming no change in markets and FX levels from March 31. We entered the second quarter with $1.4 trillion in AUM driven by net inflows and market tailwinds from the first quarter. These tailwinds will have a modest impact on both revenues and associated variable expenses. The impact on expenses will be offset by lower compensation expense related to seasonality in payroll taxes and benefits, plus incremental savings related to the strategic evaluation. We also expect a modest increase in marketing-related expenses as the first quarter is typically the low point in marketing spend annually. 
One area that is still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID-impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. With the rollout of vaccines, we believe we might begin to see a modest resumption of travel activity later in the second quarter and perhaps more in the third quarter. 
Moving to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income improved $18 million to $503 million for the quarter driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin improved 70 basis points to 40.2% as compared to the fourth quarter. Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 2x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform. 
Nonoperating income included $25.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $31.9 million in net gains last quarter as higher equity and earnings primarily from increased CLO marks were more than offset by lower market gains on our seed portfolio as compared to the prior quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24% compared to 21.7% in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate on net income was higher in the first quarter primarily due to an increase in income generated in higher-taxing jurisdictions relative to total income. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the second quarter. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.158 billion at March 31, and approximately $760 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. Cash balances are impacted by the typical seasonal increases in cash needs in the first quarter related to our compensation cycle. We also paid $117 million on a forward share repurchase liability in January. 
In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility. Despite the increased cash needs in the quarter, the revolver balance was 0 at the end of March, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile. Additionally, the remaining forward share repurchase liability of $177 million was settled in early April. 
We also renegotiated our $1.5 billion credit facility, extending the maturity date to April of 2026 with favorable terms. We believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility and as such, our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly common dividend to $0.17 per share. The share buybacks dating back to last year on Slide 11, which reflects $45 million in the first quarter of this year, are related to vesting of employee share awards. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. 
In summary, Marty highlighted the growth we've seen in our key capabilities and our continued focus on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas. We're also executing on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth. 
And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we've done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities, puts Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term. 
With that, Sue, I'll open it up to the line for questions."

That said, it doesn't -- when you look at the full year, it's going to continue to be an important contributor. And we're just looking for further growth in the years to come. So that's our perspective at the moment."

The only thing I'd add, obviously, sentiments maybe shifted just a little bit there in the recent months. Very strong sentiment fourth quarter, very strong sentiment in the first couple of months of the first quarter. We've definitely seen a little bit of a softening there. We'll pull back in March and into April. So it's going to be a place to watch. 
I will say that, broadly speaking for Asia Pacific, we are starting to see flows really start to come in, in a balanced profile across the region, China being very significant, as Marty said. In total, a little north of $9.5 billion of those flows came from IDW and Greater China. But we, as I mentioned, saw $3 billion inflows from Japan and couple of billion from Singapore, $2.3 billion from some of the other regions. And of course, as we noted in the pipeline, we're seeing very strong mandates coming in broadly from Asia Pacific. 
So I think it's -- I don't know that it's seasonality so much as maybe sentiment that we've got to keep an eye on there. I would note in the 9 funds that we launched in the first quarter in IGW, they generated $6 billion in flows in that first quarter. Most of those were balanced equity funds, and the fee rates there are very strong. They are better than the firm average and real meaningful contributors to our growth."

If I knew the answer, I wouldn't have this job probably. But the reality, as like, we're very, very focused on it. And I'd say where the firm has gotten to right now, even with the individual investors that you're talking about, the way that we have moved our business is, quite frankly, focused on a lot of high-net-worth individuals within the wealth management channels and really supported by the solutions capability that we've developed over the last number of years. In fact, that's where it started. 
And so if tax-managed was a focus before, it's surely going to be -- continue to be a focus now. The good news is things like municipal bonds are going to continue to be very, very important. We happen to have a very strong franchise there. But needless to say, people are going to want access to equity for growth. And we'll continue to see what we can work on, but I don't have anything very specifically on that."

So I'd say our capital priorities are consistent with what you've heard us say repeatedly for the last several quarters, and I'm very to say we're making good progress against those. And you can really see the evidence of that progress and some of what we've announced today. We remain committed to financial flexibility, which gives us the opportunity to really reinvest in the business and support our future growth. And that is our priority, first and foremost, is creating that financial flexibility to reinvest in the business and growth capabilities there. 
We also want to improve the strength of our balance sheet and continue to return excess cash to shareholders. So pleased we were able to announce the increase to the common dividend today. We are committed to stable and modestly increasing dividend in terms of a payout ratio. And we're being thoughtful about how we continue to improve the payout ratio. 
The decision we made a year ago to cut the dividend was not one that was made lightly, as you know. It was not an easy decision. But absolutely, I think we would reflect and say it was a good decision because it's given us the opportunity to continue to improve that financial flexibility through the more uncertain times last year. 
As we have made progress so far in some of those liabilities with the forward share repurchase liabilities both now completely paid out and our leverage well managed, it does give us the opportunity to continue to think about modestly increasing that dividend. We felt like 10% was the right level for where we are today and the earnings profile we have today, but we think we have an opportunity to continue to improve that over time. We just want to be thoughtful and measured in our pace there."

How would you characterize the exit rate, if you will, from the quarter versus the blended average through the quarter? Was it kind of trending upward, trending downward or what? And also in terms of the pipeline, ex the large low fee mandate, is the fee rate on that pipeline higher or lower than the current blend for the firm?"

Hard to decompose the trending of the fee rate exactly given the puts and takes of how the calculation is done throughout the quarter. But I would tell you, just generally speaking, it probably -- the puts and takes, I would say, were actually probably made the trending relatively stable. So if you think about what the fee rate, sort of the change in the first quarter fee rate net revenue yield ex performance fees relative to the fourth quarter, lower day count in the quarter, as I mentioned, impacted net revenue yield by 0.8 basis point. So that was meaningful. 
And then money market fee waivers were pretty consistent through the quarter, and that would have been about 0.3 of a downward impact overall in the quarter. Now I would say baked into that was what we were experiencing in money market fee waivers in prior quarters. So it's probably about a 0.6 basis point impact overall in terms of the fee waivers in the quarter. It was just 0.3 higher than the prior quarter. 
Those were largely offset, however, by the positive impact of rising markets and net long-term flows. So that's why I say I'm not sure the entry rate and the exit rate were that dissimilar given the nature of the puts and takes inside of the quarter. 
And so I think as you think about it going forward and getting to, I think, probably where you're going with the pipeline as well, there are going to be a couple of things that we think about as we think about the fee rate moving into the next quarter. One day count is less of a drag going to the second quarter. It's a very modest, and I'd say very modest, help with just an additional day. As I mentioned, I think money market fee waivers, I think that impact will be consistent through the quarter. And so I think that's going to be a bit of a neutral but negative impact on an absolute basis. 
And then looking at the pipeline and the pipeline being very significant, obviously, in absolute size. If I exclude this large significant Asia Pacific index mandate, the remaining pipeline actually looks pretty consistent with prior quarters, both in terms of absolute size and the fee composition. And as we've noted in the past, the fee -- the average fee rate on the institutional pipeline is below the firm average, not significantly below, but I'd say modestly below the firm average. And it's been -- it's held quite steady for the last 3 or 4 quarters. 
And so I don't expect that to be a different impact, but this very significant sizable win, which will fund sometime in the second quarter, will be a modest drag on net revenue yield in the second quarter, more so going into the third quarter when it is fully realized in the run rate."

The other thing I want to maybe connect the dots, so we sort of talk about some of the large institutional passive mandates that have come. And that's very consistent with what we've been talking about strategically, where every client that we deal with around the world and get that unique to us, they're dealing with fewer money managers. They want more from us. And so that also includes a range of asset classes to create the outcomes. 
So historically, we did not take our indexing capabilities to institutional clients. Needless to say, we've changed that recently. And it just creates a deeper, better relationship with the clients. The reality is large institutions around the world are going to use passive capabilities, and we want to be able to provide that along with the rest of ranged capabilities we have all the way to alternatives.

So I'm kidding. Just Look, our thoughts have not changed, right? I think it was really important for us to, obviously, complete what we did with Oppenheimer last year. Obviously, the pandemic didn't help getting off on to a great start after that. 
But if we look at the capabilities of the firm right now, we feel like we have most everything we need. And the things we probably pay attention to would be areas where there sort of be bolt-on capabilities, largely probably in areas that we want to continue to expand. That could be around credit. It could be around infrastructure. Does that help, Bill?"

But what we're looking to do is really make some changes that are discrete line items of cost that we can take out, and again, create more than $200 million, so that we do have some growth savings to be able to reinvest back into the business. 
And the way we're thinking about it is really about driving operating margin. I can let Marty comment on the past and some of how the thinking may differ prior to my time at Invesco. But I would tell you our focus now really is on delivering that profitable growth. And so as we think about reallocating, we're really thinking about how do we reallocate some of those savings into areas where we think we get the fastest growth and really drive that margin enhancement. And I think you see some of that margin enhancement and what we've been able to deliver over the last 2 or 3 quarters. I don't know that we can deliver that margin enhancement of that magnitude quarter after quarter into perpetuity. But again, it gives us the opportunity just to really leverage the scale that we think we are starting to create across a real diversified platform and making sure that our investments are in those key capabilities that really drop profitability to the bottom line."

And so as I think about it going forward, it is just inherently difficult to predict the level of performance fees given it varies by contract and by client relationships. So I really can't give you a lot of guidance there. 
I would point to the fact that fourth quarter performance fees were north of $70 billion, as you know. As I look at performance fees this quarter, pretty consistent to what we saw in the second and third quarter of last year. I wouldn't necessarily suggest that, that is what you should expect every quarter because it is so difficult to predict.

I think it's only confirmed by the increased economic activity we're all seeing. That said, risks do remain. The good news is Invesco is off to a great start this year and as you can see in the results that we reported this morning.
And if you're so inclined to follow along, I'm going to be speaking to the highlights slide, which is Slide 3. Our investment in key capabilities and the tremendous focus on our clients continues to produce good momentum in our business. We have now achieved 9 straight months of net long-term inflows. In the first quarter, net long-term inflows were $24.5 billion. This is a record level of inflows for the firm. Net -- this follows net long-term inflows of nearly $18 billion in the second half of last year, and this represents nearly a 9% annualized long-term organic growth rate, led by net flows into ETFs, continued strength in fixed income and net inflows into the balanced funds.
And as you can see on Slide 3, the key areas that were highlighted in January: we have scale, investment readiness and competitive strength drove the growth in the quarter. These are areas where investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive, and we're well positioned for growth.
Retail flows significantly improved in the quarter and were $21.2 billion out of $24.5 billion of the net long-term flows. Our ETFs, excluding the Qs, generated net long-term inflows of $16.8 billion. This is also a record for the firm, which contributed significantly to the $10 billion of net long-term inflows generated in the Americas.
Invesco's U.S. ETFs, excluding the Qs, captured 6.7% of the U.S. industry net ETF inflows. This is more than 2x our 3% market share. Within private markets, we launched 2 CLOs, which raised $800 million. And we remain focused on our alternative capabilities of space, where we also see the benefits of our MassMutual. MassMutual has committed over $1 billion to various strategies, including providing a credit facility to one of our private market funds.
We had net long-term inflows of $6.5 billion within active fixed income. And within active global equities, our nearly $50 billion developing markets fund, key capability acquired in the Oppenheimer transaction, saw $1.3 billion of inflows. That said, there's still areas of improvement within active equities, where we continue to work and remain focused on those opportunities.
Net long-term inflows into Asia Pac were $16.7 billion in the first quarter, following $17 billion of net inflows in the second half of 2020. The China JV launched 9 new funds with $6.2 billion of net long-term inflows. In addition, our solutions-enabled institutional pipeline has grown meaningfully and accounts for over 60% of our pipeline at the end of the quarter. Allison will provide more information in a few minutes on the flows, the pipeline, the results for the quarter. But I would note, we generated positive operating leverage, producing an operating margin of 40.2% for the quarter.
Strong cash flows being generated from our operations improved our cash position, resulting in no drawdown on our credit facility at quarter end, a quarter where we experienced seasonally higher demand on our cash flow. The Board also approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share. Given our historical investments in the business and our most recent efforts to further align our organization with our strategy, I'm confident, talent, capabilities, the resources and the momentum to drive -- to deliver for our clients and drive further growth and success.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Allison to walk through the results in greater detail."
384779,711123955,2259314,"Invesco Ltd., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 4.

This reflected co",2470,"Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 4. Our investment performance improved in the first quarter, with 70% and 76% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, respectively. This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging markets equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.
I'll also note that our published investment performance now reflects Morningstar peer rankings for composites where U.S.-domiciled mutual fund is the most representative AUM in the composite, whereas previously, we had relied on Lipper data. This transition more closely aligns our data to the investment performance data reviewed by our U.S. clients and is more consistent with how our peers reflect investment performance. Additionally, we've expanded the population of AUM included in performance disclosures by about $150 billion for each period presented through the addition of benchmark-relative performance data for institutional AUM, where pure rankings do not exist. This approach is used by certain of our peers, and we believe it more meaningfully represents the contribution of our institutional AUM to our performance metrics.
Moving to Slide 5. You'll notice we reorganized our ending AUM and net long-term flow slides to group the ending AUM and net long-term flows together for each cut of our data by total, investment approach, channel, geography and asset class. We believe this will better illustrate our flows in the context of our overall AUM for each category.
We ended the quarter with just over $1.4 trillion in AUM. Of the $54 billion in AUM growth, approximately $25 billion is a function of increased market values. Our diversified platform generated net long-term inflows in the first quarter of $24.5 billion, representing 8.8% annualized organic growth. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $7.5 billion or 3.4% annualized organic growth rate. In passive AUM, net long-term inflows were $17 billion or a 31.3% annualized organic growth rate.
The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement from roughly flat performance in the fourth quarter, driven by the positive ETF flows. Institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $3.3 billion in the quarter.
Regarding retail net inflows. Our ETFs, excluding the QQQ suite, generated net long-term inflows of $16.8 billion, including meaningful net inflows into our higher-fee ETFs. Net ETF inflows in the U.S. were focused on equities in the first quarter, including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which had $4 billion in net inflows in the quarter.
In addition to the S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, we had 5 other ETFs that reported net inflows of over $1 billion each. These 6 ETFs represented $10 billion in net inflows for the quarter. It's also worth noting that our Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF, the QQQJ, surpassed the $1 billion AUM mark in the quarter following its inception in October of 2020. This is on the heels of our successful QQQ marketing campaign and sponsorship of the NCAA Championship in the first quarter.
Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6. You'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $10 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $7.8 billion from the fourth quarter. The improvement was driven by net inflows into ETFs, institutional net inflows, various fixed income strategies, and importantly, focused sales efforts.
Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever with net long-term inflows of $16.7 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region. $9.4 billion of these net inflows were from Greater China, including $8.5 billion in our China JV. The balance of the flows in Asia Pacific were comprised of $3 billion from Japan, $1.9 billion from Singapore and the remaining $2.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region.
Net long-term inflows for EMEA excluding the U.K. were $3.7 billion driven by retail flows, including particularly strong net inflows of $1.2 billion into our Global Consumer Trends Fund, the growth equities capability, which saw demand from across the EMEA region. ETF net inflows in EMEA were $1.6 billion in the quarter, including interest in a wide variety of U.S.- and EMEA-based ETFs.
Notably, we saw net inflows of $0.5 billion into our blockchain ETF and $400 million into one of our newly launched ESG ETFs in the quarter, the Invesco MSCI USA ESG Universal-Screened ETF. And finally, the U.K. experienced net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion in the quarter driven by net outflows in multi-asset, institutional quantitative equities and U.K. equities.
Turning to flows across asset class. Equity net long-term inflows of $9.8 billion reflect some of the capabilities I've mentioned, including the Developing Markets Fund, the Global Consumer Trends Fund and ETFs, including our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF.
We continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the first quarter with net long-term inflows of $7.6 billion. This following net inflows of $8.2 billion in fixed income in the fourth quarter. It's worth noting that the net inflows in the balanced asset class of $7.3 billion arose largely from China. In alternatives, net long-term inflows improved by $4.1 billion due to a combination of inflows in senior loan, commodities and newly launched CLOs during the quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline grew to $45.5 billion at March 31 from $30.5 billion at year-end. The growth in the pipeline this quarter includes a large lower-fee passive-indexing mandate in Asia Pacific, assisted by our Custom Solutions Advisory team. This is an opportunity for us to offer solutions-based differentiated passive investment to meet the needs of a key strategic client with the potential to expand the relationship over time with access to higher-fee opportunities.
We are also able to leverage our in-house indexing capabilities with this mandate. Excluding this large mandate in Asia Pacific, the pipeline remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of size, asset mix and fee composition. While there's always some uncertainty with large client funding, we're currently estimating that between 50% and 65% of the pipeline will fund in the second quarter, including the large indexing mandate. The funding of this mandate will also have a slight downward impact on our net revenue yield next quarter.
Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability enables 61% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continuing investment and focus on this key capability.
Turning to Slide 8. You'll notice that our net revenues increased $23 million or 1.8% from the fourth quarter as higher average AUM in the first quarter was partially offset by $71 million decrease in performance fees from the prior quarter. The net revenue yield excluding performance fees was 35.7 basis points, a decrease of 0.3 basis point from the fourth quarter yield level. This decrease was driven by lower day count in the first quarter that negatively impacted the yield by 0.8 basis point and higher discretionary money market fee waivers that negatively impacted the yield by 0.3 basis point.
These negative impacts were partially offset by the positive impact of rising markets and net long-term inflows during the quarter. Going forward, we do expect money market fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels.
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 0.7% in the first quarter. The $5 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of higher revenue as well as the seasonal increase in payroll taxes and certain benefits, offset by the reduction in compensation related to performance fees recognized last quarter and savings that we realized in the quarter resulting from our strategic evaluation. Operating expenses remained at lower than historic activity levels due to pandemic impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations that have persisted in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 9, we update you on the progress we've made with our strategic evaluation. As we've noted previously, we're looking across 4 key areas of our expense base: our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China, solutions, alternatives and global equities while creating permanent net improvements of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base.
A large element of the savings will be generated from compensation, which includes realigning our nonclient-facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower-cost locations. The remainder of the savings will come through property, office and technology and G&A expenses. In the first quarter, we realized $16 million in cost savings. $15 million of the savings was related to compensation expense. The remaining $1 million in savings was related to facilities, which is shown in the property office and technology category.
The $16 million in cost savings were $65 million annualized, combined with the $30 million in annualized savings realized in 2020, brings us to $95 million or 48% of our $200 million net savings expectation. As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder realized by the end of 2022.
Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate we will realize roughly 65% of the savings through compensation expense. The remaining 35% would be spread across occupancy, tax spend and G&A. The breakdown for the remaining $50 million in net cost saves in 2022 will be similar.
With $95 million of the expected $150 million in net savings by the end of this year already in the quarterly run rate, the degree of net savings per quarter will moderate going forward. In the first quarter, we incurred $30 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $150 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with this program.
We expect the remaining transaction cost for the realization of this program to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million over the next 2 years, with roughly 1/2 of this amount occurring in the remainder of 2021. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.
Our expectations are for second quarter operating expenses to be relatively flat to the first quarter, assuming no change in markets and FX levels from March 31. We entered the second quarter with $1.4 trillion in AUM driven by net inflows and market tailwinds from the first quarter. These tailwinds will have a modest impact on both revenues and associated variable expenses. The impact on expenses will be offset by lower compensation expense related to seasonality in payroll taxes and benefits, plus incremental savings related to the strategic evaluation. We also expect a modest increase in marketing-related expenses as the first quarter is typically the low point in marketing spend annually.
One area that is still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID-impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. With the rollout of vaccines, we believe we might begin to see a modest resumption of travel activity later in the second quarter and perhaps more in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income improved $18 million to $503 million for the quarter driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin improved 70 basis points to 40.2% as compared to the fourth quarter. Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 2x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform.
Nonoperating income included $25.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $31.9 million in net gains last quarter as higher equity and earnings primarily from increased CLO marks were more than offset by lower market gains on our seed portfolio as compared to the prior quarter.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24% compared to 21.7% in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate on net income was higher in the first quarter primarily due to an increase in income generated in higher-taxing jurisdictions relative to total income. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the second quarter. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.
Turning to Slide 11. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.158 billion at March 31, and approximately $760 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. Cash balances are impacted by the typical seasonal increases in cash needs in the first quarter related to our compensation cycle. We also paid $117 million on a forward share repurchase liability in January.
In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility. Despite the increased cash needs in the quarter, the revolver balance was 0 at the end of March, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile. Additionally, the remaining forward share repurchase liability of $177 million was settled in early April.
We also renegotiated our $1.5 billion credit facility, extending the maturity date to April of 2026 with favorable terms. We believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility and as such, our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly common dividend to $0.17 per share. The share buybacks dating back to last year on Slide 11, which reflects $45 million in the first quarter of this year, are related to vesting of employee share awards. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases.
In summary, Marty highlighted the growth we've seen in our key capabilities and our continued focus on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas. We're also executing on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth.
And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we've done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities, puts Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term.
With that, Sue, I'll open it up to the line for questions."

Very strong sentiment in the fourth quarter, very strong sentiment in the first couple of months of the first quarter. We've definitely seen a little bit of a softening there. We'll pull back in March and into April. So it's going to be a place to watch.
I will say that, broadly speaking for Asia Pacific, we are starting to see flows really start to come in, in a balanced profile across the region, China being very significant, as Marty said. In total, a little north of $9.5 billion of those flows came from IGW and Greater China. But we, as I mentioned, saw $3 billion inflows from Japan and couple of billion from Singapore, $2.3 billion from some of the other regions. And of course, as we noted in the pipeline, we're seeing very strong mandates coming in broadly from Asia Pacific.
So I think it's -- I don't know that it's seasonality so much as maybe sentiment that we've got to keep an eye on there. I would note in the 9 funds that we launched in the first quarter in IGW, they generated $6 billion inflows in that first quarter. Most of those were balanced equity funds, and the fee rates there are very strong. They are better than the firm average and real meaningful contributors to our growth."

We also want to improve the strength of our balance sheet and continue to return excess cash to shareholders. So pleased we were able to announce the increase to the common dividend today. We are committed to stable and modestly increasing dividend in terms of a payout ratio. And we're being thoughtful about how we continue to improve the payout ratio.
The decision we made a year ago to cut the dividend was not one that was made lightly, as you know. It was not an easy decision. But absolutely, I think we would reflect and say it was a good decision because it's given us the opportunity to continue to improve that financial flexibility through the more uncertain times last year.
As we have made progress so far in some of those liabilities with the forward share repurchase liabilities both now completely paid out and our leverage well managed, it does give us the opportunity to continue to think about modestly increasing that dividend.

Obviously, our intent is to be 100%. Right now, that's up to 2023. Our goal is to pull it in closer.
If you look very specifically at ESG-specific mandates, assets under management are just about $40 billion. And so to be clear, that's excluding -- that's not counting ESG inclusion. I mean that's really the way of the world. This is really dedicated ESG product offerings where there has to be some ESG consideration within it. And the flows have been quite strong. It's really some of the historical things that within our ETF lineup.
That said, what we are seeing with institutional clients, in particular, working with our solutions group is really creating bespoke outcomes to meet their ESG goals. And we're also leveraging our self-indexing capabilities with a number of these institutions to meet their ESG goals.
So it's really no different to us, and it's quite pervasive. I'd say the strongest area right now is U.K., Europe. The U.S. is following. And quite frankly, in Asia, it's also very, very strong. So needless to say, if you don't have the wherewithal or the capabilities to be on your front foot with ESG, you're going to be at quite a disadvantage."

How would you characterize the exit rate, if you will, from the quarter versus the blended average through the quarter? Was it kind of trending upward, trending downward or what? And also in terms of the pipeline, ex the large low fee mandate, is the fee rate on that pipeline higher or lower than the current blend for the firm?"

Hard to decompose the trending of the fee rate exactly just given the puts and takes of how the calculation is done throughout the quarter. But I would tell you, just generally speaking, it probably -- the puts and takes, I would say, were actually probably made the trending relatively stable.
So if you think about what the fee rate, sort of the change in the first quarter fee rate net revenue yield ex performance fees relative to the fourth quarter, lower day count in the quarter, as I mentioned, impacted net revenue yield by 0.8 basis point. So that was meaningful.
And then money market fee waivers were pretty consistent through the quarter and that would have been about 0.3 of a downward impact overall in the quarter. Now I would say baked into that was what we were experiencing in money market fee waivers in prior quarters. So it's probably about a 0.6 basis point impact overall in terms of the fee waivers in the quarter. It was just 0.3 higher than the prior quarter.
Those were largely offset, however, by the positive impact of rising markets and net long-term flows. So that's why I say I'm not sure the entry rate and the exit rate were that dissimilar given the nature of the puts and takes inside of the quarter.
And so I think as you think about it going forward and getting to, I think, probably where you're going with the pipeline as well, there are going to be a couple of things that we think about as we think about the fee rate moving into the next quarter. One day count is less of a drag going to the second quarter. It's a very modest, and I'd say very modest, help with just an additional day. As I mentioned, I think money market fee waivers, I think that impact will be consistent through the quarter. And so I think that's going to be a bit of a neutral but negative impact on an absolute basis.
And then looking at the pipeline and the pipeline being very significant, obviously, in absolute size. If I exclude this large significant Asia Pacific index mandate, the remaining pipeline actually looks pretty consistent with prior quarters, both in terms of absolute size and the fee composition. And as we've noted in the past, the fee -- the average fee rate on the institutional pipeline is below the firm average, not significantly below, but I'd say modestly below the firm average. And it's been -- it's held quite steady for the last 3 or 4 quarters.
And so I don't expect that to be a different impact, but this very significant sizable win, which will fund sometime in the second quarter, will be a modest drag on net revenue yield in the second quarter, more so going into the third quarter when it is fully realized in the run rate."

But you need solutions, you need self-indexing, you need a range of capabilities, and you have to have deep relationships with the institutional clients. And that's all coming through.
The other thing I want to maybe connect the dots, so we sort of talk about some of the large institutional passive mandates that have come. And that's very consistent with what we've been talking about strategically, where every client that we deal with around the world and again not unique to us, they're dealing with fewer money managers. They want more from us. And so that also includes a range of asset classes to create the outcomes.
So historically, we did not take our indexing capabilities to institutional clients. Needless to say, we've changed that recently. And it just creates a deeper, better relationship with the clients. The reality is large institutions around the world are going to use passive capabilities, and we want to be able to provide that along with the rest of the ranging capabilities we have all the way to alternatives.

And so as I think about it going forward, it is just inherently difficult to predict the level of performance fees given it varies by contract and by client relationships. So I really can't give you a lot of guidance there.
I would point to the fact that fourth quarter performance fees were north of $70 billion, as you know. As I look at performance fees this quarter, pretty consistent to what we saw in the second and third quarter of last year. I wouldn't necessarily suggest that, that is what you should expect every quarter because it is so difficult to predict. But I do think looking at some of those historical trends is at least factual and somewhat helpful."

As we begin 2021, we remain cautiously optimistic with the vaccine rollout gaining traction that will emerge from the global pandemic this year. I think it's only confirmed by the increased economic activity we're all seeing. That said, risks do remain. The good news is Invesco is off to a great start this year and as you can see in the results that we reported this morning.
And if you're so inclined to follow along, I'm going to be speaking to the highlights slide, which is Slide 3. Our investment in key capabilities and the tremendous focus on our clients continues to produce good momentum in our business. We have now achieved 9 straight months of net long-term inflows. In the first quarter, net long-term inflows were $24.5 billion. This is a record level of inflows for the firm. Net -- this follows net long-term inflows of nearly $18 billion in the second half of last year, and this represents nearly a 9% annualized long-term organic growth rate, led by net flows into ETFs, continued strength in fixed income and net inflows into the balanced funds.
And as you can see on Slide 3, the key areas that were highlighted in January: we have scale, investment readiness and competitive strength drove the growth in the quarter. These are areas where investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive, and we're well positioned for growth.
Retail flows significantly improved in the quarter and were $21.2 billion out of $24.5 billion of the net long-term flows. Our ETFs, excluding the Qs, generated net long-term inflows of $16.8 billion. This is also a record for the firm, which contributed significantly to the $10 billion of net long-term inflows generated in the Americas.
Invesco's U.S. ETFs, excluding the Qs, captured 6.7% of the U.S. industry net ETF inflows. This is more than 2x our 3% market share. Within private markets, we launched 2 CLOs, which raised $800 million. And we remain focused on our alternative capabilities of space, where we also see the benefits of our MassMutual. MassMutual has committed over $1 billion to various strategies, including providing a credit facility to one of our private market funds.
We had net long-term inflows of $6.5 billion within active fixed income. And within active global equities, our nearly $50 billion developing markets fund, key capability acquired in the Oppenheimer transaction, saw $1.3 billion of inflows. That said, there's still areas of improvement within active equities, where we continue to work and remain focused on those opportunities.
Net long-term inflows into Asia Pac were $16.7 billion in the first quarter, following $17 billion of net inflows in the second half of 2020. The China JV launched 9 new funds with $6.2 billion of net long-term inflows. In addition, our solutions-enabled institutional pipeline has grown meaningfully and accounts for over 60% of our pipeline at the end of the quarter. Allison will provide more information in a few minutes on the flows, the pipeline, the results for the quarter. But I would note, we generated positive operating leverage, producing an operating margin of 40.2% for the quarter.
Strong cash flows being generated from our operations improved our cash position, resulting in no drawdown on our credit facility at quarter end, a quarter where we experienced seasonally higher demand on our cash flow. The Board also approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share. Given our historical investments in the business and our most recent efforts to further align our organization with our strategy, I'm confident, talent, capabilities, the resources and the momentum to drive -- to deliver for our clients and drive further growth and success.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Allison to walk through the results in greater detail."
384779,711123955,2259694,"Invesco Ltd., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 4. Our investment performance improved in the first quarter, with 70% and 76% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, respectively. This reflected co",2470,"Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 4. Our investment performance improved in the first quarter, with 70% and 76% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, respectively. This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging markets equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.
I'll also note that our published investment performance now reflects Morningstar peer rankings for composites where U.S.-domiciled mutual fund is the most representative AUM in the composite, whereas previously, we had relied on Lipper data. This transition more closely aligns our data to the investment performance data reviewed by our U.S. clients and is more consistent with how our peers reflect investment performance. Additionally, we've expanded the population of AUM included in performance disclosures by about $150 billion for each period presented through the addition of benchmark-relative performance data for institutional AUM, where pure rankings do not exist. This approach is used by certain of our peers, and we believe it more meaningfully represents the contribution of our institutional AUM to our performance metrics.
Moving to Slide 5. You'll notice we reorganized our ending AUM and net long-term flow slides to group the ending AUM and net long-term flows together for each cut of our data by total, investment approach, channel, geography and asset class. We believe this will better illustrate our flows in the context of our overall AUM for each category.
We ended the quarter with just over $1.4 trillion in AUM. Of the $54 billion in AUM growth, approximately $25 billion is a function of increased market values. Our diversified platform generated net long-term inflows in the first quarter of $24.5 billion, representing 8.8% annualized organic growth. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $7.5 billion or 3.4% annualized organic growth rate. In passive AUM, net long-term inflows were $17 billion or a 31.3% annualized organic growth rate.
The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement from roughly flat performance in the fourth quarter, driven by the positive ETF flows. Institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $3.3 billion in the quarter.
Regarding retail net inflows. Our ETFs, excluding the QQQ suite, generated net long-term inflows of $16.8 billion, including meaningful net inflows into our higher-fee ETFs. Net ETF inflows in the U.S. were focused on equities in the first quarter, including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which had $4 billion in net inflows in the quarter.
In addition to the S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, we had 5 other ETFs that reported net inflows of over $1 billion each. These 6 ETFs represented $10 billion in net inflows for the quarter. It's also worth noting that our Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF, the QQQJ, surpassed the $1 billion AUM mark in the quarter following its inception in October of 2020. This is on the heels of our successful QQQ marketing campaign and sponsorship of the NCAA Championship in the first quarter.
Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6. You'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $10 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $7.8 billion from the fourth quarter. The improvement was driven by net inflows into ETFs, institutional net inflows, various fixed income strategies, and importantly, focused sales efforts.
Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever with net long-term inflows of $16.7 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region. $9.4 billion of these net inflows were from Greater China, including $8.5 billion in our China JV. The balance of the flows in Asia Pacific were comprised of $3 billion from Japan, $1.9 billion from Singapore and the remaining $2.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region.
Net long-term inflows for EMEA excluding the U.K. were $3.7 billion driven by retail flows, including particularly strong net inflows of $1.2 billion into our Global Consumer Trends Fund, the growth equities capability, which saw demand from across the EMEA region. ETF net inflows in EMEA were $1.6 billion in the quarter, including interest in a wide variety of U.S.- and EMEA-based ETFs.
Notably, we saw net inflows of $0.5 billion into our blockchain ETF and $400 million into one of our newly launched ESG ETFs in the quarter, the Invesco MSCI USA ESG Universal-Screened ETF. And finally, the U.K. experienced net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion in the quarter driven by net outflows in multi-asset, institutional quantitative equities and U.K. equities.
Turning to flows across asset class. Equity net long-term inflows of $9.8 billion reflect some of the capabilities I've mentioned, including the Developing Markets Fund, the Global Consumer Trends Fund and ETFs, including our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF.
We continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the first quarter with net long-term inflows of $7.6 billion. This following net inflows of $8.2 billion in fixed income in the fourth quarter. It's worth noting that the net inflows in the balanced asset class of $7.3 billion arose largely from China. In alternatives, net long-term inflows improved by $4.1 billion due to a combination of inflows in senior loan, commodities and newly launched CLOs during the quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline grew to $45.5 billion at March 31 from $30.5 billion at year-end. The growth in the pipeline this quarter includes a large lower-fee passive-indexing mandate in Asia Pacific, assisted by our Custom Solutions Advisory team. This is an opportunity for us to offer solutions-based differentiated passive investment to meet the needs of a key strategic client with the potential to expand the relationship over time with access to higher-fee opportunities.
We are also able to leverage our in-house indexing capabilities with this mandate. Excluding this large mandate in Asia Pacific, the pipeline remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of size, asset mix and fee composition. While there's always some uncertainty with large client funding, we're currently estimating that between 50% and 65% of the pipeline will fund in the second quarter, including the large indexing mandate. The funding of this mandate will also have a slight downward impact on our net revenue yield next quarter.
Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability enables 61% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continuing investment and focus on this key capability.
Turning to Slide 8. You'll notice that our net revenues increased $23 million or 1.8% from the fourth quarter as higher average AUM in the first quarter was partially offset by $71 million decrease in performance fees from the prior quarter. The net revenue yield excluding performance fees was 35.7 basis points, a decrease of 0.3 basis point from the fourth quarter yield level. This decrease was driven by lower day count in the first quarter that negatively impacted the yield by 0.8 basis point and higher discretionary money market fee waivers that negatively impacted the yield by 0.3 basis point.
These negative impacts were partially offset by the positive impact of rising markets and net long-term inflows during the quarter. Going forward, we do expect money market fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels.
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 0.7% in the first quarter. The $5 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of higher revenue as well as the seasonal increase in payroll taxes and certain benefits, offset by the reduction in compensation related to performance fees recognized last quarter and savings that we realized in the quarter resulting from our strategic evaluation. Operating expenses remained at lower than historic activity levels due to pandemic impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations that have persisted in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 9, we update you on the progress we've made with our strategic evaluation. As we've noted previously, we're looking across 4 key areas of our expense base: our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China, solutions, alternatives and global equities while creating permanent net improvements of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base.
A large element of the savings will be generated from compensation, which includes realigning our nonclient-facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower-cost locations. The remainder of the savings will come through property, office and technology and G&A expenses. In the first quarter, we realized $16 million in cost savings. $15 million of the savings was related to compensation expense. The remaining $1 million in savings was related to facilities, which is shown in the property office and technology category.
The $16 million in cost savings were $65 million annualized, combined with the $30 million in annualized savings realized in 2020, brings us to $95 million or 48% of our $200 million net savings expectation. As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder realized by the end of 2022.
Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate we will realize roughly 65% of the savings through compensation expense. The remaining 35% would be spread across occupancy, tax spend and G&A. The breakdown for the remaining $50 million in net cost saves in 2022 will be similar.
With $95 million of the expected $150 million in net savings by the end of this year already in the quarterly run rate, the degree of net savings per quarter will moderate going forward. In the first quarter, we incurred $30 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $150 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with this program.
We expect the remaining transaction cost for the realization of this program to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million over the next 2 years, with roughly 1/2 of this amount occurring in the remainder of 2021. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.
Our expectations are for second quarter operating expenses to be relatively flat to the first quarter, assuming no change in markets and FX levels from March 31. We entered the second quarter with $1.4 trillion in AUM driven by net inflows and market tailwinds from the first quarter. These tailwinds will have a modest impact on both revenues and associated variable expenses. The impact on expenses will be offset by lower compensation expense related to seasonality in payroll taxes and benefits, plus incremental savings related to the strategic evaluation. We also expect a modest increase in marketing-related expenses as the first quarter is typically the low point in marketing spend annually.
One area that is still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID-impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. With the rollout of vaccines, we believe we might begin to see a modest resumption of travel activity later in the second quarter and perhaps more in the third quarter.
Moving to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income improved $18 million to $503 million for the quarter driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin improved 70 basis points to 40.2% as compared to the fourth quarter. Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 2x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform.
Nonoperating income included $25.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $31.9 million in net gains last quarter as higher equity and earnings primarily from increased CLO marks were more than offset by lower market gains on our seed portfolio as compared to the prior quarter.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24% compared to 21.7% in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate on net income was higher in the first quarter primarily due to an increase in income generated in higher-taxing jurisdictions relative to total income. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the second quarter. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.
Turning to Slide 11. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.158 billion at March 31, and approximately $760 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. Cash balances are impacted by the typical seasonal increases in cash needs in the first quarter related to our compensation cycle. We also paid $117 million on a forward share repurchase liability in January.
In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility. Despite the increased cash needs in the quarter, the revolver balance was 0 at the end of March, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile. Additionally, the remaining forward share repurchase liability of $177 million was settled in early April.
We also renegotiated our $1.5 billion credit facility, extending the maturity date to April of 2026 with favorable terms. We believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility and as such, our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly common dividend to $0.17 per share. The share buybacks dating back to last year on Slide 11, which reflects $45 million in the first quarter of this year, are related to vesting of employee share awards. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases.
In summary, Marty highlighted the growth we've seen in our key capabilities and our continued focus on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas. We're also executing on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth.
And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we've done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities, puts Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term.
With that, Sue, I'll open it up to the line for questions."

You've seen the recent growth over the last couple of years.
And you said the first quarter is really, really strong. There's no question. But the reality, you follow the market, it's had a pullback. You have to anticipate that that's going to slow down a little bit here. That said, it doesn't -- when you look at the full year, it's going to continue to be an important contributor. And we're just looking for further growth in the years to come. So that's our perspective at the moment."

The only thing I'd add, obviously, sentiments maybe shifted just a little bit there in the recent months. Very strong sentiment in the fourth quarter, very strong sentiment in the first couple of months of the first quarter. We've definitely seen a little bit of a softening there. We'll pull back in March and into April. So it's going to be a place to watch.
I will say that, broadly speaking for Asia Pacific, we are starting to see flows really start to come in, in a balanced profile across the region, China being very significant, as Marty said. In total, a little north of $9.5 billion of those flows came from IGW and Greater China. But we, as I mentioned, saw $3 billion inflows from Japan and couple of billion from Singapore, $2.3 billion from some of the other regions. And of course, as we noted in the pipeline, we're seeing very strong mandates coming in broadly from Asia Pacific.
So I think it's -- I don't know that it's seasonality so much as maybe sentiment that we've got to keep an eye on there. I would note in the 9 funds that we launched in the first quarter in IGW, they generated $6 billion inflows in that first quarter. Most of those were balanced equity funds, and the fee rates there are very strong. They are better than the firm average and real meaningful contributors to our growth."

So I'd say our capital priorities are consistent with what you've heard us say repeatedly for the last several quarters, and I'm very pleased to say we're making good progress against those. And you can really see the evidence of that progress and some of what we've announced today. We remain committed to financial flexibility, which gives us the opportunity to really reinvest in the business and support our future growth. And that is our priority, first and foremost, is creating that financial flexibility to reinvest in the business and growth capabilities there.
We also want to improve the strength of our balance sheet and continue to return excess cash to shareholders. So pleased we were able to announce the increase to the common dividend today. We are committed to stable and modestly increasing dividend in terms of a payout ratio. And we're being thoughtful about how we continue to improve the payout ratio.
The decision we made a year ago to cut the dividend was not one that was made lightly, as you know. It was not an easy decision. But absolutely, I think we would reflect and say it was a good decision because it's given us the opportunity to continue to improve that financial flexibility through the more uncertain times last year.
As we have made progress so far in some of those liabilities with the forward share repurchase liabilities both now completely paid out and our leverage well managed, it does give us the opportunity to continue to think about modestly increasing that dividend. We felt like 10% was the right level for where we are today and the earnings profile we have today. But we think we have an opportunity to continue to improve that over time.

How would you characterize the exit rate, if you will, from the quarter versus the blended average through the quarter? Was it kind of trending upward, trending downward or what? And also in terms of the pipeline, ex the large low fee mandate, is the fee rate on that pipeline higher or lower than the current blend for the firm?"

Hard to decompose the trending of the fee rate exactly just given the puts and takes of how the calculation is done throughout the quarter. But I would tell you, just generally speaking, it probably -- the puts and takes, I would say, w",492,"Yes. Thanks, Adam. Hard to decompose the trending of the fee rate exactly just given the puts and takes of how the calculation is done throughout the quarter. But I would tell you, just generally speaking, it probably -- the puts and takes, I would say, were actually probably made the trending relatively stable.
So if you think about what the fee rate, sort of the change in the first quarter fee rate net revenue yield ex performance fees relative to the fourth quarter, lower day count in the quarter, as I mentioned, impacted net revenue yield by 0.8 basis point. So that was meaningful.
And then money market fee waivers were pretty consistent through the quarter and that would have been about 0.3 of a downward impact overall in the quarter. Now I would say baked into that was what we were experiencing in money market fee waivers in prior quarters. So it's probably about a 0.6 basis point impact overall in terms of the fee waivers in the quarter. It was just 0.3 higher than the prior quarter.
Those were largely offset, however, by the positive impact of rising markets and net long-term flows. So that's why I say I'm not sure the entry rate and the exit rate were that dissimilar given the nature of the puts and takes inside of the quarter.
And so I think as you think about it going forward and getting to, I think, probably where you're going with the pipeline as well, there are going to be a couple of things that we think about as we think about the fee rate moving into the next quarter. One day count is less of a drag going to the second quarter. It's a very modest, and I'd say very modest, help with just an additional day. As I mentioned, I think money market fee waivers, I think that impact will be consistent through the quarter. And so I think that's going to be a bit of a neutral but negative impact on an absolute basis.
And then looking at the pipeline and the pipeline being very significant, obviously, in absolute size. If I exclude this large significant Asia Pacific index mandate, the remaining pipeline actually looks pretty consistent with prior quarters, both in terms of absolute size and the fee composition. And as we've noted in the past, the fee -- the average fee rate on the institutional pipeline is below the firm average, not significantly below, but I'd say modestly below the firm average. And it's been -- it's held quite steady for the last 3 or 4 quarters.
And so I don't expect that to be a different impact, but this very significant sizable win, which will fund sometime in the second quarter, will be a modest drag on net revenue yield in the second quarter, more so going into the third quarter when it is fully realized in the run rate."

And it really is a combination of the capabilities that we've had, I believe just how we're matching up against clients around the world. And really, the solutions capability is just really, really important. But you need solutions, you need self-indexing, you need a range of capabilities, and you have to have deep relationships with the institutional clients. And that's all coming through.
The other thing I want to maybe connect the dots, so we sort of talk about some of the large institutional passive mandates that have come. And that's very consistent with what we've been talking about strategically, where every client that we deal with around the world and again not unique to us, they're dealing with fewer money managers. They want more from us. And so that also includes a range of asset classes to create the outcomes.
So historically, we did not take our indexing capabilities to institutional clients. Needless to say, we've changed that recently. And it just creates a deeper, better relationship with the clients. The reality is large institutions around the world are going to use passive capabilities, and we want to be able to provide that along with the rest of the ranging capabilities we have all the way to alternatives.

And the way we're thinking about it is really about driving operating margin. I can let Marty comment on the past and some of how the thinking may differ prior to my time at Invesco. But I would tell you our focus now really is on delivering that profitable growth. And so as we think about reallocating, we're really thinking about how do we reallocate some of those savings into areas where we think we get the fastest growth and really drive that margin enhancement.
And I think you see some of that margin enhancement and what we've been able to deliver over the last 2 or 3 quarters. I don't know that we can deliver that margin enhancement of that magnitude quarter after quarter into perpetuity.

I would point to the fact that fourth quarter performance fees were north of $70 billion, as you know.

We've reached the halfway point in the year, and we're continuing to see strong momentum in our business, as you can see from the results that we reported this morning. But before I begin, I'd like to take a minute to recognize the hard work of our team at Invesco, like almost everybody, our employees have been working in a work-from-home or a hybrid environment for more than a year now and they've achieved these results in a very challenging environment. I'd like to thank the team for their dedicated focus and adaptability during this time. 
And with the success of the virus, many of us have been coming back to the office and working together over the last few months, and I can tell you it's going to see our colleagues once again. And we are in different stages of reopening around the globe. And 1 thing that I hear from everybody that as looking back to the office is how great it is to see 1 another report together. And I will say we're at our best when we're working together, collaborating and innovating. And I'm excited about the future as we continue to open our offices to more employees and welcome them back. And that, as always, we'll follow the status of COVID and local guidelines as the transition back to the office, meeting client needs, [indiscernible] sure the continued health and well being of our employees. 
So now let me turn to the results. And if you're so inclined to follow the presentation, I'm going to start Slide 3, which is the highlights for the quarter. We achieved a new record in the second quarter for long-term net inflows totaling $31 billion. This follows net inflows of $24.5 billion last quarter and [ up ] nearly $18 billion in the second half of last year. Growth was led by net inflows into institutional ETFs, fixed income and produce alternative capabilities. 
And as you can see on Slide 3, the key capability areas where we have scale, investment readiness, competitive strength drove growth again these are areas where our investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive and well positioned for growth. 
Looking at our EPS, excluding the Qs, that generated net long-term inflows of $12 billion during the quarter. Net long-term inflows from alternatives during the quarter were $4.3 billion, including strength in our private markets business. We launched 2 CLOs during the period, raising $1 billion and generated net inflows into our real estate business of $1 billion. We continue to focus and invest in our alternative capabilities of space where we also see the benefit of our partnership with MassMutual, which we highlighted last quarter. MassMutual has committed over $1 billion to various alternative strategies, materially increasing the speed which we can get to market for the benefit of our clients. 
We continue to innovate with strategies for retail investors through the launch of products such as in REIT and the partnership we announced with UBS in which we will provide bespoke global property investment services for [indiscernible] We also have $5 billion in direct real estate capital available for deployment. 
We had net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion into active fixed income and within active global equities, our $53 billion developed markets fund, a key capability that came with the Oppenheimer accommodation continue to see net inflows of nearly $1 billion during the quarter. 
Second quarter flows included net long-term inflows of $3 billion from Greater [indiscernible], and our Chinese joint venture continues to be a strength and differentiation for us as an organization. In addition, our Solutions-enabled institutional pipeline accounts for 35% of the pipeline at quarter end. This following the funding of a large passive mandate from Australia in the second quarter, which was enabled by our solutions team. Allison will provide more information in a moment on flows, the pipeline results in the quarter, including the continued progress towards our net savings target but I would note the growth we're experiencing is driving positive operating leverage, producing an adjusted operating margin of 41.5% for the quarter. 
Strong cash flows being generated from our business, improved our cash position, helping build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial [indiscernible] for the future. Invesco Scale, investment readiness, competitive strength position us well going forward, and we continue to focus on the person delivering positive clients while [indiscernible]. 
With that, I will turn it over to Allison to walk through the results in greater detail."

If you'll turn to Slide 4, our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. This ref",2380,"Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. If you'll turn to Slide 4, our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. [indiscernible] 2% improvement from 1 year ago. 
Net long-term inflows in the second quarter were $31.1 billion, representing 10.6% annualized organic growth. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $2.1 billion and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $29 billion. 
The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $9.5 billion in the quarter, driven by positive ETF flows. This represents a $24.1 billion improvement in net long-term inflows from 1 year ago, driven by significant improvement in equities in the Americas. The institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.6 billion in the quarter, augmented funding of a nearly $18 billion Australian passive mandate. 
Looking at retail net inflows, our ETFs, excluding the QQQ, generated net long-term inflows of $12.1 billion. Our global ETF platform, again, excluding QQQs, again captured flows in excess of its market share of AUM in the second quarter and for the first half of 2021. Net ETF inflows in the United States included a continued high level of interest in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which generated $2.6 billion in net inflows in the second quarter, following $4 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. 
Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6, you'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $5 billion in the quarter, driven by net inflows and ETF, various fixed income strategies, private market CLOs and the direct real estate net long-term inflows that Marty mentioned. 
Asia Pacific again delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $28.3 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region. Nearly $8 million was from the large passive Australian mandate that funded from our institutional pipeline in May. The balance reflects $4.8 billion of net long-term inflows from Japan, $3 billion in inflows from Greater China, of which the majority was from our China JV, $1.8 billion from Singapore and the remainder arising from other areas across the region. 
Long-term inflows for EMEA, excluding the U.K., were $1 billion, driven by retail flows, including net inflows into alternative particularly our U.S. and European senior loan funds. ETF net inflows in EMEA were $2.2 billion in the quarter. And finally, the [indiscernible] experienced net long-term outflows of $3.2 billion in the second quarter, driven largely by net institutional outflows in multi-asset and investment-grade capabilities. billion net long-term outflows relate to our global targeted return capability, which has $10.2 billion globally in AUM at the end of June. 
The overall U.K. net long-term outflows in the second quarter were an improvement of $2.7 billion as compared to the first quarter net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion. This improvement was driven by U.K. retail, primarily inflows into the European equity fund and lower net outflows during the quarter across a number of fixed income and U.K. equity capabilities. 
Turning to flows across asset classes. Equity net long-term inflows of $15 billion reflect a good portion of the Australian mandate and ETFs, including our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF that I mentioned. We continue to see broad strength and fix income in the first quarter with long-term inflows of [indiscernible]. Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into investment-grade strategy and retail net long-term inflows into various municipal funds and fixed maturity products in Asia. 
It's worth noting that although we did have [indiscernible] launches in China in the second quarter, they were not at the pace of what we experienced in the first quarter. You see this largely reflected in the $9.1 billion decrease in the net flows in the balanced asset class during the quarter to net outflows of $1.8 million. Our alternative asset class holds many different capabilities, and this is reflected in the flows we saw in the second quarter. 
Net long-term flows and alternatives improved by $4.5 billion over the first quarter, driven primarily by our private markets business, through a combination of inflows from the newly launched CLO, direct real estate, senior loan and commodities capabilities. Included in these alternative results is also the GTR net outflow that I just noted. If you do exclude the global GTR net outflows, alternative net long-term inflows were $7.2 billion, quite significant in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $33.3 billion at June 30, reflecting the funding of the large passive indexing mandate in Asia Pacific, assisted by our custom solution advisory team. Excluding the impact of the $18 billion path of mandate in the first quarter, the pipeline has increased in size and remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of asset and fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continuing investment and focus. 
Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our net revenues increased $52 million or 4.1% from the first quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the second quarter. The net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was 34.8 basis points, a decrease of 9 basis points from the first quarter yield level. The decrease was driven mainly by asset mix shift, including higher QQQ and money market average balances as well as the impact of the large passive Australian mandate that funded in May. 
This decrease was partially offset by the improvement in markets in the quarter. The incremental impact relative to Q1 of higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal in the second quarter but the full impact on the net revenue yield for the second quarter was $0.07 basis points. We do expect fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. 
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.9% in the second quarter, a $14.4 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensation and marketing. Higher variable compensation as a result of higher revenue, offset by the reduction in payroll taxes and certain benefits from the seasonally higher levels that we experienced in the first quarter. We also recognized -- we also further recognized savings in the quarter resulting from our strategic evaluation. 
Marketing expenses increased $9.8 million in the second quarter, mainly due to seasonally higher levels relative to the first quarter, which is typically the low point for marketing spend annually. We also evaluated the timing of various branding campaigns and launched targeted initiatives in the quarter across the globe. 
Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations. However, we did resume some client activity in business travel late in the second quarter which is reflected in both marketing and G&A expense. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, our expectations are for third quarter operating expenses to be modestly higher compared to the second quarter assuming no change in market and FX levels from June 30. We expect that the higher AUM levels driven by net inflows and market improvement in the second quarter, will have a modest carryover impact on both revenues and associated variable expenses in the third quarter. We also expect a modest seasonal increase in marketing-related expenses as spend typically increases in the third and fourth quarters. 
One area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. We are engaging in more domestic travel and in-person engagement, and we do expect to see continued modest resumption of these activities across the third quarter. Additionally, our U.S. mutual funds Board has approved certain changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provide to our funds. As a result, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs, which we reflect in property, office and technology expenses will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis. Offsetting this will be a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenues, resulting in a minimal impact to operating income. We expect this new pricing structure to go into effect in the third quarter and to be fully in place by the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 9. We update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. As we've noted before, we are looking across 4 key areas of our expense base. Our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will continue to invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. In the second quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $2 million of the savings was related to compensation expense and $5 million related to property, office and technology expenses. The $7.5 million in cost savings were $30 million annualized, combined with the $95 million in annualized savings realized through the first quarter of '21 brings us to $125 million in total or 63% of our $200 million net savings expectations. 
As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year with the remainder realized by the end of '22. Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate we will realize roughly 70% of savings through compensation expense. The remaining 30% would be spread across occupancy, tech spend and G&A. We expect the total program savings to be 65% in compensation of about 35% spread across the other categories. 
For the $125 million of the expected $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, already in the quarterly run rate, the degree of net savings per quarter will continue to moderate going forward. In the second quarter, we incurred $20 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $170 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with this program. We expect the remaining transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in a range of $85 million to $105 million through the end of 2022. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. 
Moving to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income improved $38 million to $541 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating and margin improved 130 basis points to 41.5% as compared to the first quarter. Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 1.8x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform. 
I'll also point out that our adjusted operating margin back in the third quarter of 2019, which was our first quarter following the Oppenheimer acquisition, was 40.9%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield excluding performance fees of 4.7 basis points. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield x performance fees was 34.8 basis points, yet, our adjusted operating margin was 41.5%. We have been building out our product suite to meet client demand and client demand has been in lower fee products. We're focused on aligning our expense base with changes in our business mix, enabling the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvement. 
Nonoperating income included $42 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $26 million in net gains last quarter, primarily from increased unrealized gains on seed money and co-investment portfolios. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.8% as compared to 24% in the first quarter. The effective tax rate on net income was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to a change in the mix of income across taxing jurisdictions. 
We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the third quarter. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. 
Few comments on Slide 11. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.3 billion at June 30 and approximately $750 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. Our cash position has improved considerably over the past year, increasing by nearly $350 million largely driven by the improvement in our operating income. Our debt profile has improved considerably as well with no draws on our revolver at quarter end. As a result, we've substantially improved our net leverage position. 
During the quarter, we repaid the remaining $177 million forward share repurchase liability in April, and there are no remaining share repurchase contract liabilities. In terms of future cash requirements, in the second quarter, we recorded an adjustment to the MLP liability associated with the Oppenheimer purchase, reducing this liability from our original estimate of nearly $385 million down to $300 million. We anticipate funding this liability in the fourth quarter of '21. While we do anticipate a degree of insurance recovery related to the matter, the insurance claims process is inherently complex, and we do not have an update at this stage of the timing or size of that recovery. Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility. 
In summary, we continue to see growth in capabilities. We remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas while completing our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth. And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. We're in a strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term. 
And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A."

That was -- also was funded by MassMutual for about $400 million, which is really important. 
We think that has great potential in the next year or so as it's in the marketplace based on the this historical performance of our real estate group. The other was really a venture with UBS and offering same thing, direct real estate with some listed real estate securities through Switzerland other parts of EMEA, Asia Pac. So those seem to be really immediate opportunities. And quite frankly, some of our private credit has more recently been gaining attention with institutional investors.

And I think we're a ways off from that, just given the international travel restrictions that look like they're going to be in place for a while. But I do think we are certainly starting to see a resumption of domestic travel within regions that are allowing it, and we're certainly seeing -- as we reopen offices, some pickup and just client activity overall. So I think probably a good estimate is to think about being maybe $15 million below what normal used to be. And some element of that will come back over time."

And that's really just a function of client demand and making sure -- and again, we feel like we have -- we're driving scale across a really well-diversified platform. So we're going to capture demand where demand exists. But that mix will certainly have an impact on that revenue yield. 
And the market impact, obviously, is going to be always impactful in any given quarter. And then money market waivers, as I noted, money market waivers right now this quarter accounted for about [ 7/10th ] of a basis point of a drag. And in terms of where do we see that going it's IOER would be helpful, movement in funds would certainly be more impactful, but it isn't perfectly correlated as just that because they're competitive dynamics as well. 
And so we're going to be thoughtful about where we're positioned vis-a-vis the competition and making sure we're being thoughtful and smart about these waivers, sharing in them with our distribution partners across the institutional element of our waivers. And I'd note our money market waivers are kind of 80% to the institutional all at about 20% to retail. So we are able to share in some of these waivers as we work with our partners and our clients really in the outcomes [indiscernible]. 
So coming back to net revenue yield, I do think we'll probably see a modest sort of grind down, but what I'd focus you on is some of the comments we were making as we look back at 2019 net revenue yields 6 basis points lower than it was a couple of years ago, and yet our operating margin is higher at 4.5%. So I recognize net revenue yield is something that we want to make sure we get into models. But really, we don't think about net revenue yield quarter-to-quarter. We think about revenue and driving positive operating leverage across our platform. And I think our performance over the last year especially really drives -- really underscores our ability to do that."

And I think it's that focus on our strategy and the continuity of that that we're -- the consistency is something I hope you'll pay up on because there's consistency in our focus and our approach. 
The key areas of investment, these key capabilities are things that we really do believe are the areas where we need to be invested ahead of client demand. We're seeing client demand in some of these capabilities today, but we expect there to be continued demand, and we're going to stay focused on those key capabilities. 
In terms of changes, I don't know that I would say there's anything specific that would cause us to change. We're always going to see sentiment may soften to China a little bit. I don't think that takes away from our focus or our belief that, that is a key growth area for us despite what market sentiment or political noise may be out there quarter-to-quarter. Our solutions capability, I think we're as convicted as ever that, that is a key capability for the future. And I think you really see how that is driving our growth, both in the institutional pipeline and overall. 
Our ETF capabilities continue to be real drivers of growth as we're capturing more than our market share in terms of flow. I think our capture of flows this past quarter was somewhere around 4.2%. Our market share is 2.7%. But even more important than that is our capture of the revenue pool. We captured about 8%, a little north of 8% of the revenue pool of flows and ETFs over the last quarter, which I think really points to the strength of our capabilities there, how they're positioned. They are some of the higher fee capabilities relative to the ETF universe, and there's real demand because they're differentiated in terms of performance and outcomes. 
So I don't know that we've had any surprises as I think back over the last year. It's been a supportive market in this past year, that's helpful. But that doesn't deter our focus on making sure we're aligning our cost base to deliver exactly what you've seen us deliver in this past year, which is real strength in our operating margins and operating income growth."

Importantly, what we did building a solutions team is it sits on top of the investment team. So it does not compete with the investment teams, it uses the investment in our existing capabilities. And that is somewhat unique as best we can tell in the marketplace. 
And so the client engagements are such that it's literally in engage with the clients to understand what are they trying to accomplish with the portfolios and delivering any range of capabilities along the lines. And that's what we've seen. The more recent one, though, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, was introducing index capabilities to institutions. And the totality of that is what creates the importance of relationship with clients and expanding your mandates per client in these relationships. So it does -- it's early days, but we're seeing it is persistent in time.

And so as we think about the funding of that matter and the fact that the liability at this moment does appear to be lower than what we were previously anticipating is good news. And we do look forward to the resolution of that in the fourth quarter. 
As we get through that, that does, in fact, clear out a lot of these, I'll call them, contingent liabilities that were -- I think we needed to be cognizant of and managed to slow for over the past year plus. And so as we look forward beyond the resolution of that, I mean, I'd say a couple of things. One, we continue to focus on just the improvement of our balance sheet overall. Our leverage profile, as I noted, continues to improve with the strength of EBITDA depending on how you think about our leverage, but looking at the nonpreferred element of the capital structure, I mean, we're below 1x now with the results in the second quarter and improvement. We're going to continue to be focused on opportunities that we have to improve our balance sheet. 
And I don't know what that means just yet, but we do have maturities, as you know, that come up in '22 and '24. And those remain areas of optionality for us as we think about balance sheet improvement. Beyond that, we are going to continue to be committed to that sustainable and modestly increasing dividend. We, as you noted, increased the dividend last quarter, and we will continue to look for opportunities to increase the common dividend concurrent with improvement in our performance and our results. 
And then longer term, resuming share buybacks. I don't know when that will be. As I said, we want to get through the MLP matter, and we continue to be focused on the leverage profile. But share buybacks certainly remain an opportunity for us to continue to return capital to shareholders."

And we are constantly thinking about the opportunity we have to invest in our own product launches, to invest in our own capabilities, and we think that drives longer-term growth that shareholders are really looking for. Buybacks aren't fourth and last by any means, but we've had a number of parallel paths we've been running over this past year and resolving some of these contingent liabilities as well as improving the balance sheet overall. We're making good progress there, and we're going to continue making progress as we think about all these opportunities we have."

I think many firms have tried to figure out how best to alter the firms in particular how to best access that channel. 
And it's very hard from the standpoint of those firms if you're an alternative form have the capability. But you really need that retail presence with distributors, wholesalers and the like to be successful. And so there are very few firms like us that can pull that off. And so we look at this as really important development for us. So again, just what we've done with UBS and now through multiple distributors here in the United States. So we don't think that -- we have the capabilities that are in demand within that channel, and it's early days as far as I'm concerned for what we're going to see move forward here."

And as I look at the fee rate of the pipeline at the end of the second quarter, it's the highest I've seen since I've been at Invesco. 
And so I'm quite bullish as I look at the pipeline, both in terms of the size, but it was replenished back to $33 billion following the $17 billion funding of the Australian mandate. And the composition of the pipeline itself in terms of average fee rate and the balance across the region asset classes, it's pretty balanced across the United States, Asia Pacific and EMEA. And in terms of asset classes, kind of coming back to your question is actually a little bit higher on the alternative side than it has been in the last few quarters. 
And that's really, I think, again points to our private markets capabilities, both our real estate capabilities as well as our senior loan capabilities. And I think, again, speaks to just the strength of the capability demand that exists in the institutional channel or performance overall."

But by the way, the benefit is, it just has helped us in other parts of the world as we think of those types of engagement as they continue to evolve in different marketplaces. 
So from the retail channel institutionally, same thing, some of the most sophisticated institutional investors in the world and it is -- you just have to bring the best and brightest within the organization, representing the full range of capabilities. And this is another example where some of the largest penetrations with those institutional clients, multiple mandates, is in China for us, and it just really reflects the necessity of the depth and breadth of an organization and to be able to serve the institutional clients at a very high level. So I don't know if that's insightful, but that's what's worked for us."

We've reached the halfway point in the year, and we're continuing to see strong momentum in our business, as you can see from the results that we reported this morning. But before I begin, I'd like to take a minute to recognize the hard work of our team at Invesco, like almost everybody, our employees have been working in a work-from-home or a hybrid environment for more than a year now and they've achieved these results in a very challenging environment. I'd like to thank the team for their dedicated focus and adaptability during this time.  
And with the success of the virus, many of us have been coming back to the office and working together over the last few months, and I can tell you it's good to see our colleagues once again. And we are in different stages of reopening around the globe. And one thing that I hear from everybody that is able to back to the office is how great it is to see one another and work together. And I will say we're at our best when we're working together, collaborating and innovating. And I'm excited about the future as we continue to open our offices to more employees and welcome them back. And as always we'll follow the status of COVID and local guidelines as we transition back to the office, meeting client needs, helping them ensure the continued health and well-being of our employees.  
So now let me turn to the results. And if you're so inclined to follow the presentation, I'm going to start on Slide 3, which is the highlights for the quarter. We achieved a new record in the second quarter for long-term net inflows totaling $31 billion. This follows net inflows of $24.5 billion last quarter and up yearly $18 billion in the second half of last year. Growth was led by net inflows into institutional ETFs, fixed income and to produce alternative capabilities.  
And as you can see on Slide 3, the key capability areas where we have scale, investment readiness, competitive strength drove growth again in the quarter. These are areas where our investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive and well positioned for growth.  
Looking at our EPS, excluding the Qs, that generated net long-term inflows of $12 billion during the quarter. Net long-term inflows from alternatives during the quarter were $4.3 billion, including strength in our private markets business. We launched 2 CLOs during the period, raising $1 billion and generated net inflows into our real estate business of $1 billion. We continue to focus and invest in our alternative capabilities of space where we also see the benefit of our partnership with MassMutual, which we highlighted last quarter. MassMutual has committed over $1 billion to various alternative strategies, materially increasing the speed with which we can get to market for the benefit of our clients.  
We continue to innovate with strategies for retail investors through the launch of products such as INREIT, and the partnership we announced with UBS in which we will provide bespoke global property investment services for management clients of UBS in Switzerland, other parts of EMEA and Asia. We also have $5 billion in direct real estate capital available for deployments.  
We had net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion into active fixed income and within active global equities, our $53 billion developing markets fund, a key capability that came with the Oppenheimer accommodation continue to see net inflows of nearly $1 billion during the quarter.  
Second quarter flows included net long-term inflows of $3 billion from Greater China and our Chinese joint venture continues to be a source of strength and differentiation for us as an organization. In addition, our Solutions-enabled institutional pipeline accounts for 35% of the pipeline at quarter end, this following the funding of a large passive mandate from Australia in the second quarter, which was enabled by our solutions team. Allison will provide more information in a moment on flows, the pipeline results in the quarter, including the continued progress towards our net savings target but I would note the growth we're experiencing is driving positive operating leverage, producing an adjusted operating margin of 41.5% for the quarter.  
Strong cash flows being generated from our business, improved our cash position, helping build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future. Invesco Scale, investment readiness, competitive strength position us well going forward, and we continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcome with clients while  driving future growth.
With that, I will turn it over to Allison to walk through the results in greater detail."

If you'll turn to Slide 4, our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. This ref",2437,"Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. If you'll turn to Slide 4, our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. 
Moving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with $1.525 trillion in AUM. Of the $121 billion in AUM growth approximately $66 billion is a function of increased market values. Our diversified platform generated gross inflows in the second quarter of $114.4 billion. This is an 82% improvement from 1 year ago. 
Net long-term inflows in the second quarter were $31.1 billion, representing 10.6% annualized organic growth. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $2.1 billion and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $29 billion.  
The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $9.5 billion in the quarter, driven by positive ETF flows. This represents a $24.1 billion improvement in net long-term inflows from 1 year ago, driven by significant improvement in equities in the Americas. The institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.6 billion in the quarter, augmented by the funding of a nearly $18 billion Australian passive mandate.  
Looking at retail net inflows, our ETFs, excluding the QQQs, generated net long-term inflows of $12.1 billion. Our global ETF platform, again, excluding QQQs, again captured flows in excess of its market share of AUM in the second quarter and for the first half of 2021. Net ETF inflows in the United States included a continued high level of interest in our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which generated $2.6 billion in net inflows in the second quarter, following $4 billion of net inflows in the first quarter.  
Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6, you'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $5 billion in the quarter, driven by net inflows in the ETF, various fixed income strategies, private market CLOs and the direct real estate net long-term inflows that Marty mentioned.  
Asia Pacific again delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $28.3 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region. Nearly $18 billion was from the large passive Australian mandate that funded from our institutional pipeline in May. The balance reflects $4.8 billion of net long-term inflows from Japan, $3 billion in inflows from Greater China, of which the majority was from our China JV, $1.8 billion from Singapore and the remainder arising from other areas across the region.  
Long-term inflows for EMEA, excluding the U.K., were $1 billion, driven by retail flows, including net inflows into alternative particularly our U.S. and European senior loan funds. ETF net inflows in EMEA were $2.2 billion in the quarter. And finally, the U.K. experienced net long-term outflows of $3.2 billion in the second quarter, driven largely by net institutional outflows in multi-asset and investment-grade capabilities, $2.4 billion of these net long-term outflows relate to our global targeted return capability, which has $10.2 billion globally in AUM at the end of June. 
The overall U.K. net long-term outflows in the second quarter were an improvement of $2.7 billion as compared to the first quarter net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion. This improvement was driven by U.K. retail, primarily inflows into the European equity fund and lower net outflows during the quarter across a number of fixed income and U.K. equity capabilities.  
Turning to flows across asset classes. Equity net long-term inflows of $15 billion reflect a good portion of the Australian mandate and ETFs, including our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF that I mentioned. We continue to see broad strength in fix income in the first quarter with long-term inflows of $13.6 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into investment-grade strategy and retail net long-term inflows into various municipal funds and fixed maturity products in Asia.  
It's worth noting that although we did have fund launches in China in the second quarter, they were not at the pace of what we experienced in the first quarter. You see this largely reflected in the $9.1 billion decrease in the net flows in the balanced asset class during the quarter to net outflows of $1.8 billion. Our alternative asset class holds many different capabilities, and this is reflected in the flows we saw in the second quarter.  
Net long-term flows and alternatives improved by $4.5 billion over the first quarter, driven primarily by our private markets business, through a combination of inflows from the newly launched CLO, direct real estate, senior loan and commodities capabilities. Included in these alternative flow results is also the GTR net outflow that I just noted. If you do exclude the global GTR net outflows, alternative net long-term inflows were $7.2 billion, quite significant in the quarter.  
Moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $33.3 billion at June 30, reflecting the funding of the large passive indexing mandate in Asia Pacific, assisted by our custom solution advisory team. Excluding the impact of the $18 billion passive mandate in the first quarter, the pipeline has increased in size and remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of asset and fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continuing investment and focus.  
Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our net revenues increased $52 million or 4.1% from the first quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the second quarter. The net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was 34.8 basis points, a decrease of 0.9 basis points from the first quarter yield level. The decrease was driven mainly by asset mix shift, including higher QQQ and money market average balances as well as the impact of the large passive Australian mandate that funded in May.  
This decrease was partially offset by the improvement in markets in the quarter. The incremental impact relative to Q1 of higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal in the second quarter but the full impact on the net revenue yield for the second quarter was 0.7 of a basis point. We do expect fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels.  
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.9% in the second quarter, a $14.4 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensation and marketing. Higher variable compensation as a result of higher revenue, offset by the reduction in payroll taxes and certain benefits from the seasonally higher levels that we experienced in the first quarter. We also recognized -- we also further recognized savings in the quarter resulting from our strategic evaluation.  
Marketing expenses increased $9.8 million in the second quarter, mainly due to seasonally higher levels relative to the first quarter, which is typically the low point for marketing spend annually. We also reevaluated the timing of various branding campaigns and launched targeted initiatives in the quarter across the globe.  
Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations. However, we did resume some client activity in business travel late in the second quarter which is reflected in both marketing and G&A expense.  
As we look ahead to the third quarter, our expectations are for third quarter operating expenses to be modestly higher compared to the second quarter assuming no change in market and FX levels from June 30. We expect that the higher AUM levels driven by net inflows and market improvement in the second quarter will have a modest carryover impact on both revenues and associated variable expenses in the third quarter. We also expect a modest seasonal increase in marketing-related expenses as spend typically increases in the third and fourth quarters.  
One area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. We are engaging in more domestic travel and in-person engagement, and we do expect to see continued modest resumption of these activities across the third quarter. Additionally, our U.S. mutual funds board has approved certain changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provide to our funds. As a result, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs, which we reflect in property, office and technology expenses will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis. Offsetting this will be a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenues, resulting in a minimal impact to operating income. We expect this new pricing structure to go into effect in the third quarter and to be fully in place by the fourth quarter.  
Moving to Slide 9. We update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. As we've noted before, we are looking across 4 key areas of our expense base. Our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will continue to invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. In the second quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $2 million of the savings was related to compensation expense and $5 million related to property, office and technology expenses. The $7.5 million in cost savings were $30 million annualized, combined with the $95 million in annualized savings realized through the first quarter of '21 brings us to $125 million in total or 63% of our $200 million net savings expectations.  
As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year with the remainder realized by the end of '22. Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate we will realize roughly 70% of the savings through compensation expense. The remaining 30% would be spread across occupancy, tech spend and G&A. We expect the total program savings to be 65% in compensation of about 35% spread across the other categories.  
For the $125 million of the expected $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, already in the quarterly run rate, the degree of net savings per quarter will continue to moderate going forward. In the second quarter, we incurred $20 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $170 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with this program. We expect the remaining transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in a range of $85 million to $105 million through the end of 2022. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.  
Moving to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income improved $38 million to $541 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating and margin improved 130 basis points to 41.5% as compared to the first quarter. Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 1.8x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform.  
I'll also point out that our adjusted operating margin back in the third quarter of 2019, which was our first full quarter following the Oppenheimer acquisition, was 40.9%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield excluding performance fees of 40.7 basis points. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield ex-performance fees was 34.8 basis points, yet, our adjusted operating margin was 41.5%. We have been building out our product suite to meet client demand and client demand has been in lower fee products. We're focused on aligning our expense base with changes in our business mix, enabling the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvement.  
Nonoperating income included $42 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $26 million in net gains last quarter, primarily from increased unrealized gains on seed money and co-investment portfolios. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.8% as compared to 24% in the first quarter. The effective tax rate on net income was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to a change in the mix of income across taxing jurisdictions.  
We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the third quarter. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.  
Few comments on Slide 11. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.3 billion at June 30 and approximately $750 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. Our cash position has improved considerably over the past year, increasing by nearly $350 million largely driven by the improvement in our operating income. Our debt profile has improved considerably as well with no draws on our revolver at quarter end. As a result, we've substantially improved our net leverage position.  
During the quarter, we repaid the remaining $177 million forward share repurchase liability in April, and there are no remaining share repurchase contract liabilities. In terms of future cash requirements, in the second quarter, we recorded an adjustment to the MLP liability associated with the Oppenheimer purchase, reducing this liability from our original estimate of nearly $385 million down to $300 million. We anticipate funding this liability in the fourth quarter of '21. While we do anticipate a degree of insurance recovery related to the matter, the insurance claims process is inherently complex, and we do not have an update at this stage of the timing or size of that recovery.  
Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility.  
In summary, we continue to see growth in our key capabilities. We remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas while completing our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth. And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. We're in a strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term.  
And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A."

That was -- also was funded by MassMutual for about $400 million, which is really important. 
We think that has great potential in the next year or so as it's in the marketplace based on the -- this historical performance of our real estate group. The other was really a venture with UBS and offering same thing, direct real estate with some listed real estate securities through Switzerland, other parts of EMEA, Asia Pac. So those seem to be really immediate opportunities. And quite frankly, some of our private credit has more recently been gaining attention with institutional investors.

And I think we're ways off from that, just given the international travel restrictions that look like they're going to be in place for a while. But I do think we are certainly starting to see a resumption of domestic travel within regions that are allowing it, and we're certainly seeing -- as we reopen offices, some pickup and just client activity overall. So I think probably a good estimate is to think about being maybe $15 million below what normal used to be. And some element of that will come back over time."

The other element is really how solutions has been embedded in almost all of our client engagements. Institutionally, we've called it out, you see that. But by the way, it was also true in retail engagements that were seen. And you mentioned factors. We talked about that 5 years ago. It's a huge part of our ETF business and frankly, our index business and is going to continue to be an important part of what we do. 
And as you do know, just recently in the last 2 years, we've taken that factor capability, indexing capability to institutional clients, and we did it with a very strategic view with recognition that clients are using fewer and fewer money managers, and they want the totality of the capabilities coming from money managers. And you've seen some of the impact most recently with the IFF win in Australia, but which you really do as you become very important to clients holistically. So those would be the biggest trends that I would point to. And I think the reality, it's actually happening right now. So that's my personal perspective."

And that's really just a function of client demand and making sure -- and again, we feel like we have -- we're driving scale across a really well-diversified platform. So we're going to capture demand where demand exists. But that mix will certainly have an impact on that revenue yield. 
And the market impact, obviously, is going to be always impactful in any given quarter. And then money market waivers, as I noted, money market waivers right now this quarter accounted for about 0.7 of a basis point of a drag. And in terms of where do we see that going it's IOER would be helpful, a movement in Fed funds would certainly be more impactful, but it isn't perfectly correlated as just that because there are competitive dynamics as well. 
And so we're going to be thoughtful about where we're positioned vis-a-vis the competition and making sure we're being thoughtful and smart about these waivers, sharing in them with our distribution partners across the institutional element of our waivers. And I'd note our money market waivers are kind of 80% to the institutional channel and at about 20% to retail. So we are able to share in some of these waivers as we work with our partners to ensure clients really getting the outcomes that they are expecting. 
So coming back to net revenue yield, I do think we'll probably see a modest sort of grind down, but what I'd focus you on is some of the comments we were making as we look back at 2019 net revenue yields 6 basis points lower than it was a couple of years ago, and yet our operating margin is higher at 41.5%. So I recognize net revenue yield is something that we want to make sure we get into models. But really, we don't think about net revenue yield quarter-to-quarter. We think about revenue and driving positive operating leverage across our platform. And I think our performance over the last year especially really drives -- really underscores our ability to do that."

We captured about 8%, a little north of 8% of the revenue pool of flows and ETFs over the last quarter, which I think really points to the strength of our capabilities there, how they're positioned. They are some of the higher fee capabilities relative to the ETF universe, and there's real demand because they're differentiated in terms of performance and outcomes. 
So I don't know that we've had any surprises as I think back over the last year. It's been a supportive market in this past year, that's helpful. But that doesn't deter our focus on making sure we're aligning our cost base to deliver exactly what you've seen us deliver in this past year, which is real strength in our operating margins and operating income growth."

Let me -- so it's a great question. And I can't describe what competitors are doing. But our approach was a little bit different from the standpoint of we started with recognition any number of years ago that clients wanted a broad range -- broad range of investment capabilities and that's what we've been building out, as we've talked about. Importantly, what we did building a solutions team is it sits on top of the investment team. So it does not compete with the investment teams, it uses the investment, our existing capabilities. And that is somewhat unique as best we can tell in the marketplace. 
And so the client engagements are such that it's literally an engagement with the clients to understand what are they trying to accomplish with the portfolios and delivering any range of capabilities along the lines. And that's what we've seen. The more recent one, though, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, was introducing index capabilities to institutions. And the totality of that is what creates the importance of relationship with clients and you end up expanding your mandates per client in these relationships. So it does -- it's early days, but we're seeing it is persistent in time. 
And again, as I said a few minutes ago, we're seeing -- it's very important institutionally. It's also quite important in the retail channel also. So we just look at it as quite frankly, it's the way that business has been done as we look to the future."

You laid out the idea that we're going to be having the MLP liability funding later this year. So still some calls on liquidity, but without question in a far better position and with those calls dramatically lower than they were a year ago. So with that in mind, what are your updated capital management priorities, how should we think about the likelihood of a step-up in buyback? I know we got the increase in the dividend recently. But how are all of those different calls on liquidity? How do they rank in your mind from here on?"

That's been out there for a while now. It's something we've been anticipating and reserving for. And so as we think about the funding of that matter and the fact that the liability at this moment does appear to be lower than what we were previously anticipating is good news. And we do look forward to the resolution of that in the fourth quarter. 
As we get through that, that does, in fact, clear out a lot of these, I'll call them, contingent liabilities that were things we needed to be cognizant of and manage our cash flow for over the past year plus. And so as we look forward beyond the resolution of that, I mean, I'd say a couple of things. One, we continue to focus on just the improvement of our balance sheet overall. Our leverage profile, as I noted, continues to improve with the strength of EBITDA depending on how you think about our leverage, but looking at the nonpreferred element of the capital structure, I mean, we're below 1x now with the results in the second quarter and that's strong improvement. We're going to continue to be focused on opportunities that we have to improve our balance sheet. 
And I don't know what that means just yet, but we do have maturities, as you know, that come up in '22 and '24. And those remain areas of optionality for us as we think about balance sheet improvement. Beyond that, we are going to continue to be committed to that sustainable and modestly increasing dividend. We, as you noted, increased the dividend last quarter, and we will continue to look for opportunities to increase the common dividend concurrent with improvement in our performance and our results. 
And then longer term, resuming share buybacks. I don't know when that will be. As I said, we want to get through the MLP matter, and we continue to be focused on the leverage profile. But share buybacks certainly remain an opportunity for us to continue to return capital to shareholders."

And so the retail channel is about, correct me Allison, about $10 billion on the retail platform right now where the number to flowing organization within that right now. And as you know, they've recently closed the acquisition of the REIT business that looks like it's going to be an opportunity for us as we move forward. So again, we just continue to work together on a very regular basis on various opportunities as we look to the future. 
With regard to M&A, not exactly sure what the question is, they understand our strategy very much as an organization. And if something made sense along the lines we've talked about in the past that it improves our strategic position. It's complementary to our business. There's sort of, if you want to call it, the necessity of cultural alignment, I'm sure they would be supportive of that."

Buybacks aren't fourth and last by any means, but we've had a number of parallel paths we've been running over this past year and resolving some of these contingent liabilities as well as improving the balance sheet overall.

And I said it was the INREIT, which is being introduced to the retail market right now to illustrate our capability. Our view is that the largest opportunity for growth for direct real estate capability is in the retail channel globally. And that's not unique to us. I think many firms have tried to figure out how best to alter the firms in particular how to best access that channel. 
And it's very hard from the standpoint of those firms if you're an alternative firm and have the capability. But you really need that retail presence with distributors, wholesalers and the like to be successful. And so there are very few firms like us that can pull that off. And so we look at this as really important development for us. So again, just what we've done with UBS and now through multiple distributors here in the United States. So we don't think that -- we have the capabilities that are in demand within that channel, and it's early days as far as I'm concerned for what we're going to see to move forward here."

And as I look at the fee rate of the pipeline at the end of the second quarter, it's the highest I've seen since I've been at Invesco. 
And so I'm quite bullish as I look at the pipeline, both in terms of the size, but it was replenished back to $33 billion following the $17 billion funding of the Australian mandate. And the composition of the pipeline itself in terms of average fee rate and the balance across those regions and asset classes, it's pretty balanced across the United States, Asia Pacific and EMEA. And in terms of asset classes, kind of coming back to the second part of your question it's actually a little bit higher on the alternative side than it has been in the last few quarters. 
And that's really, I think, again points to our private markets capabilities, both our real estate capabilities as well as our senior loan capabilities.

Thanks, Mike. Great question. So needless to say, it's a very, very competitive market and success is only going to come in retail channel if you are deeply embedded in China and have your business driven by the local Chinese, which is the case for us. And you have to be a little more typical that we might see in the United States where there are very important engagements with large banks, insurance companies, getting on platforms and service in that way. 
I'll say half of our retail flows right now on some type of digital platform. And it started with us with Ant Financial as we came in early, I think the first foreign money manager to their very large money fund, and it then expanded from that into other capabilities and then on to other platforms within the marketplace. 
What you'll also see is the digital engagement is at a level that is the most sophisticated in the world and how you engage with clients, the demands on the organization are quite extraordinary. But by the way, the benefit is, it just has helped us in other parts of the world as we think of those types of engagement as they continue to evolve in different marketplaces. 
So from the retail channel institutionally, same thing, some of the most sophisticated institutional investors in the world and it is -- you just have to bring the best and brightest within the organization, representing the full range of capabilities. And this is another example where some of the largest penetrations with those institutional clients, multiple mandates, is in China for us, and it just really reflects the necessity of the depth and breadth of an organization and to be able to serve the institutional clients at a very high level. So I don't know if that's insightful, but that's what's worked for us."

And we are in different stages of reopening around the globe. And one thing that I hear from everybody that is able to get back to the office is how great it is to see 1 or another and work together. And I will say we're at our best when we're working together, collaborating and innovating. And I'm excited about the future as we continue to open our offices to more employees and welcome them back. And as always, we'll follow the status of COVID and local guidelines as we transition back to the office meeting media client needs, helping them ensure the continued health and well-being of our employees. 
So now let me turn to the results. And if you're so inclined to follow the presentation, I'm going to start on Slide 3, which is the highlights for the quarter. We achieved a new record in the second quarter for long-term net inflows, totaling $31 billion. This follows net inflows of $24.5 billion last quarter and nearly $18 billion in the second half of last year. Growth was led by net inflows into institutional ETFs, fixed income and for this alternative capabilities. 
And as you can see on Slide 3, the key capability areas where we have scale, investment readiness, competitive strength drove growth again in the quarter. These are areas where our investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive and well positioned for growth. 
Looking at our ETFs, excluding the Qs, it generated net long-term inflows of $12 billion during the quarter. Net long-term inflows from alternatives during the quarter were $4.3 billion, including strength in our private markets business. 
We launched 2 CLOs during the period, raising $1 billion and generated net inflows into our real estate business of $1 billion. We continue to focus and invest in our alternative capabilities of space where we also see the benefit of our partnership with MassMutual, which we highlighted last quarter. MassMutual has committed over $1 billion to various alternative strategies, materially increasing the speed which we can get to market for the benefit of our clients. 
We continue to innovate with strategies for retail investors through the launch of products such as in REIT and the partnership we announced with UBS in which we will provide bespoke global property investment services for management clients of UBS in Switzerland, other parts of EMEA and Asia. We also have $5 billion in direct real estate that will available for deployment. 
We had net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion into active fixed income. And within active global equities are $52 billion development markets fund, a key capability that came with the Oppenheimer accommodation continue to see net inflows of nearly $1 billion during the quarter. 
Second quarter flows included net long-term inflows of $3 billion from Greater China, and our Chinese joint venture continues to be a source of strength and differentiation for us as an organization. In addition, our solutions enable institutional pipeline accounts for 35% of the pipeline at quarter end. This following the funding of a large passive mandate from Australia in the second quarter, which was enabled by our solutions team. 
Allison will provide more information in a moment on flows, the pipeline results in the quarter, including the continued progress towards our net savings target. But I would note that growth we're experiencing is driving positive operating leverage, producing an adjusted operating margin of 41.5% for the quarter. Strong cash flows being generated from our business, improved our cash position, helping build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future. Invesco scale, investment readiness, competitive strength position us well going forward, and we continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcomes clients while driving [Audio Gap]. 
With that, I will turn it over to Allison to walk through the results in greater detail."
384779,1675311650,2352233,"Invesco Ltd., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. If you'll turn to Slide 4, our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. This ref",2434,"Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. If you'll turn to Slide 4, our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. 
Moving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with $1.525 trillion in AUM. Of the $121 billion in AUM growth, approximately $66 billion is a function of increased market values. Our diversified platform generated gross inflows in the second quarter of $114.4 billion. This is an 82% improvement from 1 year ago. 
Net long-term inflows in the second quarter were $31.1 billion, representing 10.6% annualized organic growth. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $2.1 billion and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $29 billion. 
The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $9.5 billion in the quarter, driven by positive ETF flows. This represents a $24.1 billion improvement in net long-term inflows from 1 year ago, driven by significant improvement in equities in the Americas. The institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.6 billion in the quarter, augmented by the funding of the nearly $18 billion Australian passive mandate. 
Looking at retail net inflows. Our ETFs, excluding the QQQ, generated net long-term inflows of $12.1 billion. Our global ETF platform, again, excluding QQQs, again captured flows in excess of its market share of AUM in the second quarter and for the first half of 2021. The Net ETF inflows in the United States included a continued high level of interest in our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which generated $2.6 billion in net inflows in the second quarter, following $4 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. 
Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6, you'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $5 billion in the quarter, driven by net inflows into ETF, various fixed income strategies, private market CLOs and the direct real estate net long-term inflows that Marty mentioned. 
Asia Pacific again delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $28.3 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region. Nearly $18 billion was from the large passive Australian mandate that funded from our institutional pipeline in May. The balance reflects $4.8 billion of net long-term inflows from Japan; $3 billion in inflows from Greater China, of which the majority was from our China JV; $1.8 billion from Singapore; and the remainder arising from other areas across the region. 
Long-term inflows for EMEA, excluding the U.K., were $1 billion, driven by retail flows, including net inflows into alternatives, particularly our U.S. and European senior loan funds. ETFs net inflows in EMEA were $2.2 billion in the quarter. 
And finally, the U.K. experienced net long-term outflows of $3.2 billion in the second quarter, driven largely by net institutional outflows in multi-asset and investment-grade capabilities. $2.4 billion of these net long-term outflows relate to our global targeted return capability, which has $10.2 billion globally in AUM at the end of June. The overall U.K. net long-term outflows in the second quarter were an improvement of $2.7 billion as compared to the first quarter net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion. This improvement was driven by U.K. retail, primarily inflows into the European equity fund and lower net outflows during the quarter across a number of fixed income and U.K. equity capabilities. 
Turning to floods across asset classes. Equity net long-term inflows of $15 billion reflect a good portion of the Australian mandate and ETFs, including our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF that I mentioned. 
We continue to see broad strength in fixed income in the second quarter with net long-term inflows of $13.6 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into investment-grade strategies and retail net long-term inflows into various municipal funds and fixed maturity products in Asia. 
It's worth noting that although we did have fund launches in China in the second quarter, they were not at the pace of what we experienced in the first quarter. You see this largely reflected in the $9.1 billion decrease in the net flows in the balanced asset class during the quarter to net outflows of $1.8 billion. 
Our alternative asset class holds many different capabilities, and this is reflected in the flows we saw in the second quarter. Net long-term flows and alternatives improved by $4.5 billion over the first quarter, driven primarily by our private markets business, through a combination of inflows from the newly launched CLOs, direct real estate, senior loan and commodities capabilities. Included in these alternative flow results is also the GTR net outflow that I just noted. If you exclude the global GTR net outflows, alternative net long-term inflows were $7.2 billion, quite significant in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $33.3 billion at June 30, reflecting the funding of the large passive indexing mandate in Asia Pacific, assisted by our custom solution advisory team. Excluding the impact of the $18 billion passive mandate in the first quarter, the pipeline has increased in size and remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of asset and fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continuing investment and focus. 
Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our net revenues increased $52 million or 4.1% from the first quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the second quarter. The net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was 34.8 basis points, a decrease of 9 basis points from the first quarter yield level. The decrease was driven mainly by asset mix shift, including higher QQQ and money market average balances as well as the impact of the large passive Australian mandate that funded in May. This decrease was partially offset by the improvement in markets in the quarter. The incremental impact relative to Q1 of higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal in the second quarter, but the full impact on the net revenue yield for the second quarter was $0.07 on a basis point. We do expect fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. 
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.9% in the second quarter. The $14.4 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensation and marketing, higher variable compensation as a result of higher revenue, offset by the reduction in payroll taxes and certain benefits from the seasonally higher levels that we experienced in the first quarter. 
We also further recognized savings in the quarter resulting from our strategic evaluation. Marketing expenses increased $9.8 million in the second quarter, mainly due to seasonally higher levels relative to the first quarter. which is typically the low point for marketing spend annually. We also reevaluated the timing of various branding campaigns and launched targeted initiatives in the quarter across the globe. 
Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations. However, we did reduce some client activity in business travel late in the second quarter which is reflected in both marketing and G&A expense. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, our expectations are for third quarter operating expenses to be modestly higher compared to the second quarter assuming no change in market and FX levels from June 30. We expect that the higher AUM levels driven by net inflows and market improvement in the second quarter will have a modest carryover impact on both revenues and associated variable expenses in the third quarter. 
We also expect a modest seasonal increase in marketing-related expenses as spend typically increases in the third and fourth quarters. 
One area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impact of travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. We are engaging in more domestic travel and in-person engagement and we do expect to see continued modest resumption of these activities across the third quarter. 
Additionally, our U.S. mutual funds Board has approved certain changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provide to our funds. As a result, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs, which we reflect in property, office and technology expenses will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis. Offsetting this will be a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenues, resulting in a minimal impact to operating income. We expect this new pricing structure to go into effect in the third quarter and to be fully in place by the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 9. We update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. As we've noted before, we are looking across 4 key areas of our expense base: our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will continue to invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. 
In the second quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $2 million of the savings was related to compensation expense and $5 million related to property, office and technology expenses. The $7.5 million in cost savings or $30 million annualized, combined with the $95 million in annualized savings realized through the first quarter of '21, brings us to $125 million in total or 63% of our $200 million net savings expectations. 
As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year with the remainder realized by the end of '22. Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate we will realize roughly 70% of the savings through compensation expense. The remaining 30% would be spread across occupancy, tech spend and G&A. We expect the total program savings to be 65% in compensation of about 35% spread across the other categories. So the $125 million of the expected $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, already in the quarterly run rate, the degree of net savings per quarter will continue to moderate going forward. 
In the second quarter, we incurred $20 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $170 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with this program. We expect the remaining transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in a range of $85 million to $105 million through the end of 2022. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. 
Moving to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income improved $38 million to $541 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating and margin improved 130 basis points to 41.5% as compared to the first quarter. Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 1.8x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform. 
I'll also point out that our adjusted operating margin back in the third quarter of 2019, which was our first quarter following the Oppenheimer acquisition, was 40.9%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, of 40.7 basis points. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield ex performance fees was 34.8 basis points. Yet, our adjusted operating margin was 41.5%. 
We have been building out our product suite to meet client demand, and client demand has been a lower fee products. We're focused on aligning our expense base with changes in our business mix enabling the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvement. 
Nonoperating income included $42 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $26 million in net gains last quarter, primarily from increased unrealized gains on seed money and co-investment portfolios. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.8% as compared to 24% in the first quarter. The effective tax rate on net income was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to a change in the mix of income across taxing jurisdictions. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the third quarter. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. 
Few comments on Slide 11. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.3 billion at June 30, and approximately $750 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. Our cash position has improved considerably over the past year, increasing by nearly $350 million, largely driven by the improvement in our operating income. 
Our debt profile has improved considerably as well with no draws on our revolver at quarter end. As a result, we've substantially improved our net leverage position. During the quarter, we repaid the remaining $177 million forward share repurchase liability in April, and there are no remaining share repurchase contract liability. 
In terms of future cash requirements, in the second quarter, we recorded an adjustment for the MLP liability associated with the Oppenheimer purchase, reducing this liability from our original estimate of nearly $385 million down to $300 million. We anticipate funding this liability in the fourth quarter of '21. While we do anticipate a degree of insurance recovery related to the matter, the insurance claims process is inherently complex, and we do not have an update at this stage on the timing or size of that recovery. Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility. 
In summary, we continue to see growth in our key capabilities. We remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas while completing our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth. And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. We're in a strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term. 
And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A."

It's a very strong global real estate group, direct real estate. Some of the more recent developments, they've been trying to get that into the retail channel and in REIT, which is nonpublic is now available in the U.S. It's early days. That was -- also it was funded by MassMutual for about $400 million, which is really important. We think that has great potential in the next year or so as it's in the marketplace based on the historical performance of our real estate group. 
The other was really a venture with UBS and offering same thing direct real estate with some list of real estate securities through Switzerland, other parts of EMEA, Asia Pac. So those seem to be really immediate opportunities. And quite frankly, some of our private credit is more recently than gain attention with institutional investors. They have a very good track record. And with that track record, we are now seeing the follow-on. So we look at this as a very important part of our business as we [indiscernible]."

And I don't expect we'll see all of that come back just when we get back to whatever some permanent state is. And I think we're a ways off from that, just given the international travel restrictions that look like they're going to be in place for a while. 
But I do think we are certainly starting to see a resumption of domestic travel within regions that are allowing it, and we're certainly seeing, as we reopen offices, some pickup and just client activity overall. So I think probably a good estimate is to think about being maybe $15 million below what normal used to be. And some element of that will come back over time."

We've seen things, it could be explain half of all the flows within our industry in the next 5 years. Whether that's right or not? I don't know. But what I can say, it's a major factor. 
The other element is really, our solutions is embedded in almost all of our client engagements. Institutionally, we've called it out and you see that. But by the way, it is also true in retail engagements that we're seeing. 
And you mentioned factors. We talked about that 5 years ago. It's a huge part of our ETF business and frankly, our index business, and it's going to continue to be an important part of what we do. And as you do know, just recently in recently in the last 2 years, we've taken that factor capability indexing capability to institutional clients, and we did it with a very strategic view with recognition that clients are using fewer and fewer money managers, and they want the totality of the capabilities coming from money managers. And now you've seen some of the impact here most recently with the IFF in Australia, but what you really do is to become very important to clients holistically. 
So those would be the biggest trends that I would point to. And I think the reality is actually happening right now. So that's my personal perspective."

And that's really just a function of client demand and making sure. And again, we feel like we have -- we're driving scale across a really well-diversified platform. So we're going to capture demand where demand exists, but that mix will certainly have an impact on net revenue yield. And market impact, obviously, is going to be always impactful in any given quarter. And then money market waivers, as I noted, the money market waivers right now this quarter accounted for about [ 7\10 ] basis points of a drag. 
And in terms of where do we see that going? It's -- IOER would be helpful a movement in Fed funds would certainly be more impactful, but it isn't perfectly correlated as just that because they're competitive dynamics as well. And so we're going to be thoughtful about where we're positioned vis-a-vis the competition and making sure we're being thoughtful and smart about these waivers, sharing in them with our distribution partners across the institutional element of our waivers. And I'd note our money market waivers are kind of 80% to the institutional channel and about 20% to retail. So we are able to share in some of these waivers as we work with our partners to ensure clients are really getting the outcomes that they're expecting. 
So coming back to that revenue yield, I do think we'll probably see a modest sort of grind down, but what I'd focus you on is some of the comments we were making as we look back at 2019, net revenue yields 6 basis points lower than it was a couple of years ago, and yet our operating margin is higher at 41.5%. 
So I recognize net revenue yield is something that we want to make sure we get into models. But really, we don't think about net revenue yield quarter-to-quarter. We think about revenue and driving positive operating leverage across our platform. And I think our performance over the last year especially really drives really underscores our ability to do that."

And I think it's best focused on our strategy and the continuity of that that we're the consistency is something I hope you'll pick up on because there's consistency in our focus and our approach. 
The key areas of investment, these key capabilities are things that we really do believe are the areas where we need to be invested ahead of client demand. We're seeing client demand on some of these capabilities today, but we expect there to be continued demand, and we're going to stay focused on those key capabilities. 
In terms of changes, I don't know that I would say there's anything specific that would cause us to change. We're always going to see sentiment may soften in China a little bit. I don't think that takes away from our focus or our belief that, that is a key growth area for us despite what market sentiment or political noise may be out there quarter-to-quarter. Our solutions capability. I think we're as convicted as ever that, that is a key capability for the future. And I think you really see how that is driving our growth in the institutional pipeline. And overall, our ETF capabilities continue to be real drivers of growth as we're capturing more than our market share in terms of flows. I think our capture of flows this past quarter was somewhere around 4.2%. Our market share is 2.7%. But even more important than that is our capture of the revenue pool. We captured about 8%, a little north of 8% of the revenue pool of flows and ETFs over the last quarter, which I think really points to the strength of our capabilities there, how they're positioned. They are some of the higher fee capabilities relative to the ETF universe, and there's real demand because they're differentiated in terms of performance and outcomes. 
So I don't know that we've had any surprises as I think back over the last year, it's been a supportive market in this past year, and that's helpful. But that doesn't deter our focus on making sure we're aligning our cost base to deliver exactly what you've seen us deliver in this past year, which is real strength in our operating margins and operating income growth."

And I can describe what competitors are doing, but our approach was a little bit different from a standpoint of we started with recognition in a number of years ago that clients wanted a broader range range or investment capabilities that we've been building out, as we've talked about. Importantly, what we did building a solutions team is on top of the investment team. So it does not compete with the investment teams, it uses the investment -- our existing capabilities. And that is somewhat unique as best we can tell in the marketplace. And so the client engagements are such that it's literally engaged with the clients to understand what they're trying to accomplish with the portfolios and delivering a range of capabilities along the lines. And that's what we've seen. 
The more recent one, though, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, was introducing index capabilities to institutions. And the totality of that is what creates the importance of relationship with clients, and you end up expanding your mandates per client in these relationships. So it does -- it's early days, but we're seeing it is persistent in time.

That's been out there for a while now and something we've been anticipating and reserving for. And so as we think about the funding of that matter and the fact that the liability at this moment, does appear to be lower than what we were previously anticipating is good news. And we look forward to the resolution of that in the fourth quarter. 
As we get through that, that does, in fact, clear out a lot of these, I'll call them, contingent liabilities that we're -- I think we needed to be cognizant of and manage our cash flow for over the past year plus. And so as we look forward beyond the resolution of that, I mean, I'd say a couple of things. One, we continue to focus on just the improvement of our balance sheet overall. Our leverage profile, as I noted, continues to improve with the strength of EBITDA, depending on how you think about our leverage, but looking at the nonpreferred element of the capital structure. I mean we're below 1x now with the results in the second quarter and strong improvement. We're going to continue to be focused on opportunities that we have to improve our balance sheet. And I don't know what that means just yet, but we do have maturities, as you know, that come up in '22 and '24. And those remain areas of optionality for us as we think about balance sheet improvement. Beyond that, we are going to continue to be committed to that sustainable and modestly increasing dividend. 
We, as you noted, increased the dividend last quarter, and we will continue to look for opportunities to increase the common dividend concurrent with improvement in our performance and our results. And then longer term, resuming share buybacks. I don't know when that will be. As I said, we want to get through the MLP matter, and we continue to be focused on the leverage profile, but share buybacks certainly remain an opportunity for us to continue to return capital to shareholders."

And as I look at the fee rate of the pipeline at the end of the second quarter, it's the highest I've seen since I've been at Invesco. And so I'm quite bullish as I look at the pipeline, both in terms of the size that it was replenished back to $33 billion following the $1 billion funding of the Australian mandate and the composition of the pipeline itself in terms of average fee rate and the balance across both regions and asset classes. It's pretty balanced across the United States, Asia Pacific and EMEA. 
And in terms of asset classes, kind of coming back to the second part of your question, it's actually a little bit higher on the alternative side than it has been in the last few quarters. And that's really, I think, again, points to our private markets capabilities, both our real estate capabilities as well as our senior loan capabilities. And I think, again, speaks to just the strength of those capabilities, the demand that exists in the institutional channel and our performance overall."

So needless to say, it's a very, very competitive market, and success is only going to come the retail channel is more deeply embedded in China and have your business driven by local Chinese, which is the case for us. And you have a little more to go that we might see in the United States where they are very important engagements with large banks, insurance companies, getting on platforms and service on that. I will say half of our retail flows right now on some type of digital platform. It started with us with Ant Financial as we can in early I think the first foreign money manager to their very large money fund and it then expanded from that to other capabilities and then on to other platforms within the marketplace. 
And what you also see is the digital engagement is at a level that is the most sophisticated in the world. and how you engage with clients, the demands on the organization quite extraordinary. But by the way, the benefit is, it just has helped us in other parts of the world as we think of those types of engagement as they continue to evolve in different marketplaces. So the retail channel, institutionally same thing, some of the most sophisticated institutional investors in the world, and it is -- you just have to bring the best and brightest within the organization, representing the full range of capabilities. And this is another example where some of the largest penetrations with those institutional clients multiple mandates is in China for us. and it just really reflects the necessity of the depth and breadth of an organization and to be able to serve the clients at a very high level. So I don't know if that's insightful, but what's worked for us."

We've reached the halfway point in the year, and we're continuing to see strong momentum in our business, as you can see from the results that we reported this morning. But before",787,"Thank you. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. We've reached the halfway point in the year, and we're continuing to see strong momentum in our business, as you can see from the results that we reported this morning. 
But before I begin, I'd like to take a minute to recognize the hard work of our team at Invesco. Like most everybody, our employees have been working in a work-from-home or hybrid environment for more than a year now, and they've achieved these results in a very challenging environment. I'd like to thank the team for their dedicated focus and adaptability during this time. 
And with the success of the virus, many of us have been coming back to the office and working together over the last few months, and I can tell you it's good to see our colleagues once again. And we are in different stages of reopening around the globe. And one thing that I hear from everybody that is able to get back to the office is how great it is to see one another and work together. And I will say we're at our best when we're working together, collaborating and innovating. And I'm excited about the future as we continue to open our offices to more employees and welcome them back. And as always, we'll follow the status of COVID and local guidelines as we transition back to the office, meeting client needs, helping them ensure the continued health and well-being of our employees. 
So now let me turn to the results. And if you're so inclined to follow the presentation, I'm going to start on Slide 3, which is the highlights for the quarter. We achieved a new record in the second quarter for long-term net inflows totaling $31 billion. This follows net inflows of $24.5 billion last quarter and nearly $18 billion in the second half of last year. Growth was led by net inflows into institutional ETFs, fixed income and for this alternative capabilities. 
And as you can see on Slide 3, the key capability areas where we have scale, investment readiness, competitive strength drove growth again in the quarter. These are areas where our investment performance is strong, we're highly competitive and well positioned for growth. 
Looking at our ETFs. Excluding the Qs, it generated net long-term inflows of $12 billion during the quarter. Net long-term inflows from alternatives during the quarter were $4.3 billion, including strength in our private markets business. 
We launched 2 CLOs during the period, raising $1 billion and generated net inflows into our real estate business of $1 billion. We continue to focus and invest in our alternative capabilities of space, where we also see the benefit of our partnership with MassMutual, which we highlighted last quarter. MassMutual has committed over $1 billion to various alternative strategies, materially increasing the speed which we can get to market for the benefit of our clients. 
We continue to innovate with strategies for retail investors through the launch of products such as INREIT and the partnership we announced with UBS in which we will provide bespoke global property investment services for management clients of UBS in Switzerland, other parts of EMEA and Asia. We also have $5 billion in direct real estate that will be available for deployment. 
We had net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion into active fixed income. And within active global equities are $52 billion development markets fund, a key capability that kind of came with the Oppenheimer accommodation, continue to see net inflows of nearly $1 billion during the quarter. 
Second quarter flows included net long-term inflows of $3 billion from Greater China, and our Chinese joint venture continues to be a source of strength and differentiation for us as an organization. In addition, our solutions enable institutional pipeline accounts for 35% of the pipeline at quarter end. This following the funding of a large passive mandate from Australia in the second quarter, which was enabled by our solutions team. 
Allison will provide more information in a moment on flows, the pipeline results in the quarter, including the continued progress towards our net savings target. But I would note that growth we're experiencing is driving positive operating leverage, producing an adjusted operating margin of 41.5% for the quarter. Strong cash flows being generated from our business improved our cash position, helping build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future. Invesco scale, investment readiness, competitive strength position us well going forward, and we continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcome for clients while driving [indiscernible]. 
With that, I will turn it over to Allison to walk through the results in greater detail."

If you'll turn to Slide 4, our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. This ref",2430,"Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. If you'll turn to Slide 4, our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. 
Moving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with $1.525 trillion in AUM. Of the $121 billion in AUM growth, approximately $66 billion is a function of increased market values. Our diversified platform generated gross inflows in the second quarter of $114.4 billion. This is an 82% improvement from 1 year ago. 
Net long-term inflows in the second quarter were $31.1 billion, representing 10.6% annualized organic growth. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $2.1 billion, and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $29 billion. 
The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $9.5 billion in the quarter, driven by positive ETF flows. This represents a $24.1 billion improvement in net long-term inflows from 1 year ago, driven by significant improvement in equities in the Americas. The institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.6 billion in the quarter, augmented by the funding of the nearly $18 billion Australian passive mandate. 
Looking at retail net inflows. Our ETFs, excluding the QQQs, generated net long-term inflows of $12.1 billion. Our global ETF platform, again, excluding QQQs, again captured flows in excess of its market share of AUM in the second quarter and for the first half of 2021. The net ETF inflows in the United States included a continued high level of interest in our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which generated $2.6 billion in net inflows in the second quarter, following $4 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. 
Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6. You'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $5 billion in the quarter, driven by net inflows into ETF, various fixed income strategies, private market CLOs and the direct real estate net long-term inflows that Marty mentioned. 
Asia Pacific again delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $28.3 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region. Nearly $18 billion was from the large passive Australian mandate that funded from our institutional pipeline in May. The balance reflects $4.8 billion of net long-term inflows from Japan; $3 billion in inflows from Greater China, of which the majority was from our China JV; $1.8 billion from Singapore; and the remainder arising from other areas across the region. 
Long-term inflows for EMEA, excluding the U.K., were $1 billion, driven by retail flows, including net inflows into alternatives, particularly our U.S. and European senior loan funds. ETFs net inflows in EMEA were $2.2 billion in the quarter. 
And finally, the U.K. experienced net long-term outflows of $3.2 billion in the second quarter, driven largely by net institutional outflows in multi-asset and investment-grade capabilities. $2.4 billion of these net long-term outflows relate to our global targeted return capability, which has $10.2 billion globally in AUM at the end of June. The overall U.K. net long-term outflows in the second quarter were an improvement of $2.7 billion as compared to the first quarter net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion. This improvement was driven by U.K. retail, primarily inflows into the European equity fund and lower net outflows during the quarter across a number of fixed income and U.K. equity capabilities. 
Turning to flows across asset classes. Equity net long-term inflows of $15 billion reflect a good portion of the Australian mandate and ETFs, including our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF that I mentioned. 
We continue to see broad strength in fixed income in the second quarter with net long-term inflows of $13.6 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into investment-grade strategies and retail net long-term inflows into various municipal funds and fixed maturity products in Asia. 
It's worth noting that although we did have fund launches in China in the second quarter, they were not at the pace of what we experienced in the first quarter. You see this largely reflected in the $9.1 billion decrease in the net flows in the balanced asset class during the quarter to net outflows of $1.8 billion. 
Our alternative asset class holds many different capabilities, and this is reflected in the flows we saw in the second quarter. Net long-term flows and alternatives improved by $4.5 billion over the first quarter, driven primarily by our private markets business through a combination of inflows from the newly launched CLOs, direct real estate, senior loan and commodities capabilities. Included in these alternative flow results is also the GTR net outflow that I just noted. If you exclude the global GTR net outflows, alternative net long-term inflows were $7.2 billion, quite significant in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $33.3 billion at June 30, reflecting the funding of the large passive indexing mandate in Asia Pacific, assisted by our custom solution advisory team. Excluding the impact of the $18 billion passive mandate in the first quarter, the pipeline has increased in size and remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of asset and fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continuing investment and focus. 
Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our net revenues increased $52 million or 4.1% from the first quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the second quarter. The net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was 34.8 basis points, a decrease of 0.9 basis point from the first quarter yield level. The decrease was driven mainly by asset mix shift, including higher QQQ and money market average balances, as well as the impact of the large passive Australian mandate that funded in May. This decrease was partially offset by the improvement in markets in the quarter. The incremental impact relative to Q1 of higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal in the second quarter, but the full impact on the net revenue yield for the second quarter was 0.7 basis point. We do expect fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. 
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.9% in the second quarter. The $14.4 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensation and marketing, higher variable compensation as a result of higher revenue, offset by the reduction in payroll taxes and certain benefits from the seasonally higher levels that we experienced in the first quarter. 
We also further recognized savings in the quarter resulting from our strategic evaluation. Marketing expenses increased $9.8 million in the second quarter, mainly due to seasonally higher levels relative to the first quarter. which is typically the low point for marketing spend annually. We also reevaluated the timing of various branding campaigns and launched targeted initiatives in the quarter across the globe. 
Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations. However, we did reduce some client activity in business travel late in the second quarter, which is reflected in both marketing and G&A expense. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, our expectations are for third quarter operating expenses to be modestly higher compared to the second quarter assuming no change in market and FX levels from June 30. We expect that the higher AUM levels, driven by net inflows and market improvement in the second quarter, will have a modest carryover impact on both revenues and associated variable expenses in the third quarter. We also expect a modest seasonal increase in marketing-related expenses as spend typically increases in the third and fourth quarters. 
One area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impact of travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. We are engaging in more domestic travel and in-person engagement, and we do expect to see continued modest resumption of these activities across the third quarter. 
Additionally, our U.S. Mutual Funds Board has approved certain changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provide to our funds. As a result, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs, which we reflect in property, office and technology expenses, will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis. Offsetting this will be a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenues, resulting in a minimal impact to operating income. We expect this new pricing structure to go into effect in the third quarter and to be fully in place by the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 9. We update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. As we've noted before, we are looking across 4 key areas of our expense base: our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will continue to invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China, solutions, alternatives and global equities. 
In the second quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $2 million of the savings was related to compensation expense and $5 million related to property, office and technology expense. The $7.5 million in cost savings or $30 million annualized, combined with the $95 million in annualized savings realized through the first quarter of '21, brings us to $125 million in total or 63% of our $200 million net savings expectations. 
As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year with the remainder realized by the end of '22. Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate we will realize roughly 70% of the savings through compensation expense. The remaining 30% would be spread across occupancy, tech spend and G&A. We expect the total program savings to be 65% in compensation, with about 35% spread across the other categories. 
With $125 million of the expected $150 million in net savings by the end of this year already in the quarterly run rate, the degree of net savings per quarter will continue to moderate going forward. 
In the second quarter, we incurred $20 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $170 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with this program. We expect the remaining transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in a range of $85 million to $105 million through the end of 2022. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. 
Moving to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income improved $38 million to $541 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points to 41.5% as compared to the first quarter. Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 1.8x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform. 
I'll also point out that our adjusted operating margin back in the third quarter of 2019, which was our first quarter following the Oppenheimer acquisition, was 40.9%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, of 40.7 basis points. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield ex performance fees was 34.8 basis points, yet our adjusted operating margin was 41.5%. 
We have been building out our product suite to meet client demand, and client demand has been in lower fee products. We're focused on aligning our expense base with changes in our business mix, enabling the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvement. 
Nonoperating income included $42 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $26 million in net gains last quarter, primarily from increased unrealized gains on seed money and co-investment portfolios. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.8% as compared to 24% in the first quarter. The effective tax rate on net income was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to a change in the mix of income across taxing jurisdictions. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the third quarter. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. 
Few comments on Slide 11. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.3 billion at June 30, and approximately $750 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirement. Our cash position has improved considerably over the past year, increasing by nearly $350 million, largely driven by the improvement in our operating income. 
Our debt profile has improved considerably as well with no draws on our revolver at quarter end. As a result, we've substantially improved our net leverage position. During the quarter, we repaid the remaining $177 million forward share repurchase liability in April, and there are no remaining share repurchase contract liability. 
In terms of future cash requirements. In the second quarter, we recorded an adjustment for the MLP liability associated with the Oppenheimer purchase, reducing this liability from our original estimate of nearly $385 million down to $300 million. We anticipate funding this liability in the fourth quarter of '21. While we do anticipate a degree of insurance recovery related to the matter, the insurance claims process is inherently complex, and we do not have an update at this stage of the timing or size of that recovery. Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility. 
In summary, we continue to see growth in our key capabilities.

That was -- also, it was funded by MassMutual for about $400 million, which is really important. We think that has great potential in the next year or so as it's in the marketplace based on this historical performance of our real estate group. 
The other was really a venture with UBS and offering same thing, direct real estate with some list of real estate securities through Switzerland, other parts of EMEA, Asia Pac.

And I think we're a ways off from that, just given the international travel restrictions that look like they're going to be in place for a while. 
But I do think we are certainly starting to see a resumption of domestic travel within regions that are allowing it, and we're certainly seeing, as we reopen offices, some pickup and just client activity overall. So I think probably a good estimate is to think about being maybe $15 million below what normal used to be. And some element of that will come back over time."

And as you do know, just recently, recently in the last 2 years, we've taken that factor capability, indexing capability, to institutional clients, and we did it with a very strategic view with recognition that clients are using fewer and fewer money managers, and they want the totality of the capabilities coming from money managers.

And that's really just a function of client demand and making sure. And again, we feel like we have -- we're driving scale across a really well-diversified platform. So we're going to capture demand where demand exists, but that mix will certainly have an impact on net revenue yield. And market impact, obviously, is going to be always impactful in any given quarter. And then money market waivers, as I noted, money market waivers right now this quarter accounted for about 0.7 basis point of a drag. 
And in terms of where do we see that going. It's -- IOER would be helpful. A movement in Fed funds would certainly be more impactful, but it isn't as perfectly correlated as just that because they're competitive dynamics as well. And so we're going to be thoughtful about where we're positioned vis-a-vis the competition and making sure we're being thoughtful and smart about these waivers, sharing in them with our distribution partners across the institutional element of our waivers. And I'd note our money market waivers are kind of 80% to the institutional channel and about 20% to retail. So we are able to share in some of these waivers as we work with our partners to ensure clients are really getting the outcomes that they're expecting. 
So kind of coming back to net revenue yield. Yes, I do think we'll probably see a modest sort of grind down. But what I'd focus you on is some of the comments we were making as we look back at 2019. Net revenue yields 6 basis points lower than it was a couple of years ago, and yet our operating margin is higher at 41.5%. 
So I recognize net revenue yield is something that we want to make sure we get into models. But really, we don't think about net revenue yield quarter-to-quarter. We think about revenue and driving positive operating leverage across our platform. And I think our performance over the last year especially really drives -- really underscores our ability to do that."

The key areas of investment, these key capabilities are things that we really do believe are the areas where we need to be invested ahead of client demand. We're seeing client demand on some of these capabilities today, but we expect there to be continued demand, and we're going to stay focused on those key capabilities. 
In terms of changes, I don't know that I would say there's anything specific that would cause us to change. We're always going to see sentiment may soften in China a little bit. I don't think that takes away from our focus or our belief that, that is a key growth area for us despite what market sentiment or political noise may be out there quarter-to-quarter. Our solutions capability. I think we're as convicted as ever that, that is a key capability for the future. And I think you really see how that is driving our growth in the institutional pipeline and overall. 
Our ETF capabilities continue to be the real drivers of growth as we're capturing more than our market share in terms of flows. I think our capture of flows this past quarter was somewhere around 4.2%. Our market share is 2.7%. But even more important than that is our capture of the revenue pool. We captured about 8%, a little north of 8% of the revenue pool of flows and ETFs over the last quarter, which I think really points to the strength of our capabilities there, how they're positioned. They are some of the higher fee capabilities relative to the ETF universe, and there's real demand because they're differentiated in terms of performance and outcomes. 
So I don't know that we've had any surprises as I think back over the last year. It's been a supportive market in this past year, and that's helpful.

And I can't describe what the competitors are doing, but our approach was a little bit different from the standpoint of we started with recognition many number of years ago that our clients wanted a broader range -",257,"Yes. Let me -- so it's a great question. And I can't describe what the competitors are doing, but our approach was a little bit different from the standpoint of we started with recognition many number of years ago that our clients wanted a broader range -- broad range of investment capabilities. [ That's what we think, and I think Allison's recently talked about ]. 
Importantly, what we did, building a solutions team, is it sits on top of the investment team. So it does not compete with the investment teams. It uses the investment -- our existing capabilities and that is somewhat unique, as best we can tell, in the marketplace. And so the client engagements are such that it's literally an engagement, the clients understand what they're trying to accomplish with the portfolios and delivering a range of capabilities along the lines. And that's what we've seen. 
The more recent one, though, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, was introducing index capabilities to institutions. And the totality of that is what creates the importance of relationship with clients, and you end up expanding your mandates per client in these relationships. So it does -- it's early days but we're seeing it is persistent in time. 
And again, as I said a few minutes ago, we're seeing -- it's very important institutionally. It's also quite important in the retail channel also. So we just look at it as a, quite frankly, it's the way that business is being done as we look to the future."

You laid out the idea that we're going to be having the MLP liability funding later this year. So still some calls on liquidity, but without question, a far better position and with those calls dramatically lower than they were a year ago. So with that in mind, what are your updated capital management priorities? How should we think about the likelihood of a step-up in buyback? I know we got the increase in the dividend recently. But how are all of those different calls on liquidity? How do they rank in your mind from hereof?"

That's been out there for a while now and something we've been anticipating and reserving for. And so as we think about the funding of that matter and the fact that the liability at this moment does appear to be lower than what we were previously anticipating is good news. And we do look forward to the resolution of that in the fourth quarter. 
As we get through that, that does, in fact, clear out a lot of these, I'll call them, contingent liabilities that were -- I think we needed to be cognizant of and manage our cash flow for over the past year plus. And so as we look forward beyond the resolution of that, I mean, I'd say a couple of things. 
One, we continue to focus on just the improvement of our balance sheet overall. Our leverage profile, as I noted, continues to improve with the strength of EBITDA, depending on how you think about our leverage, but looking at the nonpreferred element of the capital structure. I mean we're below 1x now with the results in the second quarter and the strong improvement. We're going to continue to be focused on opportunities that we have to improve our balance sheet. 
And I don't know what that means just yet. But we do have maturities, as you know, that come up in '22 and '24, and those remain areas of optionality for us as we think about balance sheet improvement. Beyond that, we are going to continue to be committed to that sustainable and modestly increasing dividend. 
We, as you noted, increased the dividend last quarter, and we will continue to look for opportunities to increase the common dividend concurrent with improvement in our performance and our results. 
And then longer term, resuming share buybacks. I don't know when that will be. As I said, we want to get through the MLP matter, and we continue to be focused on the leverage profile. But share buybacks certainly remain an opportunity for us to continue to return capital to shareholders."

And as you know, they've recently closed acquisition [ of an annuity ] business. That looks like it's going to be an opportunity for us as we move forward. So again, we just continue to work together on a very regular basis on various opportunities as we look to the future. 
With regard to M&A, I'm not exactly sure what the question is. They understand our strategy very much as an organization.

And we are constantly thinking about the opportunity we have to invest in our own product launches and invest in our own capabilities. And we think that drives longer-term growth that shareholders are really looking for. 
Buybacks aren't fourth and last by any means, but we've had a number of parallel paths we've been running over this past year in resolving some of these contingent liabilities as well as improving the balance sheet overall.

And that's not unique to us. I think many firms have tried to figure out how best to -- alternative funds in particular how to best access that channel. and it's very hard from the standpoint of those firms. If you're an alternative firm, you have the capability, but you really need that detailed presence with distributors, wholesalers and the like to be successful. And so there are very few firms like us that can pull that off. And so we look at this as really important development for us. 
Again, just what we've done with UBS and now through multiple distributors here in the United States. So we don't think that -- we have the capabilities that are in demand within that channel, and it's early days as far as I'm concerned for what we're going to see moving forward here."

And as I look at the fee rate of the pipeline at the end of the second quarter, it's the highest I've seen since I've been at Invesco. And so I'm quite bullish as I look at the pipeline, both in terms of the size that it was replenished back to $33 billion following the $17 billion funding of the Australian mandate and the composition of the pipeline itself in terms of average fee rate and the balance across both regions and asset classes. It's pretty balanced across the United States, Asia Pacific and EMEA. 
And in terms of asset classes, kind of coming back to the second part of your question. It's actually a little bit higher on the alternative side than it has been in the last few quarters.

Thanks, Mike. Great questions. So needless to say, it's a very, very competitive market, and success is only going to come to the retail channel if we were deeply embedded in China and have your business driven by local Chinese, which is the case for us. And you have -- would be a little more typical that we might see in the United States where they are very important engagements with large banks, insurance companies, getting on platforms and service in that side. I will say half of our retail flows right now are on some type of digital platform. It started with us with Ant Financial as we can in the early, I think, the first foreign money manager to their very large money fund. And it then expanded from that to other capabilities and then on to other platforms within the marketplace. 
And what you also see is the digital engagement is at a level that is the most sophisticated in the world and how you engage with clients, the demands on the organization are quite extraordinary. But by the way, the benefit is it just has helped us in other parts of the world as we think of those types of engagement as they continue to evolve in different marketplaces. So in the retail channel, institutionally same thing. Some of the most sophisticated institutional investors in the world, and it is -- you just have to bring the best and brightest within the organization, representing the full range of capabilities. 
And this is another example where some of the largest penetrations with those institutional clients multiple mandates is in China for us. And it just really reflects the necessity of the depth and breadth of an organization and to be able to serve the institutional clients at a very high level.

And I'll make a few comments and turn it over to Allison so she can [indiscernible] the quarter in more depth, and then we'll open up to Q&A as we always do. 
And hoping everybody is staying safe and healthy as we continue to return to normalcy. And I know we're all looking for that peace to continue in the months ahead. Continue to have a high level of engagement with our clients, which is even more important as we navigate the market uncertainty brought about by the end of economic and market upside surprises we experienced from the depths of COVID. Helping our clients by providing insights and solutions, utilizing our broad range of capabilities. 
This approach has helped us deliver strong, consistent growth over the past 5 quarters. And as you can see on Slide 3, if you're following along on the deck, net long-term flows were $13.3 billion during the quarter. This represents over 4% annualized long-term organic growth for the quarter. 
Growth was driven by continued strength in a number of our key capabilities, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. Strategically, we continue to invest in areas where we see client demand were a competitive strength. And since the third quarter of last year, we generated $86 billion of long-term inflows and an average quarterly organic growth rate of 6%. 
5 consecutive quarters of strong growth as a direct result of the investments we've made over time to enhance and evolve our business to meet client needs. ETFs, excluding the Qs, generated long-term inflows of $3.7 billion in the quarter, with strong market share gains in our EMEA ETF range. 
In private markets, we generated net long-term inflows in our direct real estate business, $1.2 billion, and robust bank loan product demand resulted in net long-term inflows of $2 billion during the quarter. This included the launch of a new CLO. 
We generated net long-term inflows of $11 billion within active fixed income across the platform. And within active global equities, the developing markets fund, a key capability that came over when we combined with Oppenheimer, continued to see net long-term inflows of $700 million during the quarter. 
That said, we remain focused and continue to work on areas where there's opportunity for improvement. In addition, our solutions-enabled institutional pipeline accounts for 38% of the pipeline at quarter end. Third quarter flows included net long-term inflows of $6.8 billion from Greater China. Our China business continues to be a source of strength and differentiation for Invesco. We continue to expect the Chinese investment management industry to be the fastest growing market in the world for the foreseeable future. 
We were an early entrant 20 years ago, and we are benefiting from that commitment and investment, and we expect to see continued growth in the years ahead. Before I turn the call over to Allison, who will provide more information on the China business and the results, I'd like to note that the growth we are experiencing is driving positive operating leverage, reducing adjusted operating margin of 42% for the quarter. 
The strong cash flow being generated from our business improved our cash position and helping build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future. Invesco's depth and breadth of capabilities and competitive strengths position us well as we look forward. We continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcomes for our clients while driving future growth. And with that, let me turn it over to Allison."
384779,1684347121,2412635,"Invesco Ltd., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 4. Our investment performance was strong in the third quarter with 72% and 74% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers for being benchmarked on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. This refle",3073,"Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 4. Our investment performance was strong in the third quarter with 72% and 74% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers for being benchmarked on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. 
This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. 
Moving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with $1.529 trillion in AUM, a net increase of $3.6 billion. As Marty noted earlier, our diversified platform generated net long-term inflows in the third quarter of $13.3 billion, representing a 4.4% annualized organic growth rate. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $6.8 billion and passive AUM net long-term [ flows ] were $6.5 billion. 
Market declines in FX rate changes led to a decrease in AUM of $18.6 billion in the quarter. The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $1.8 billion, driven by positive ETF flows and inflows in Greater China. The institutional channel demonstrated the breadth of our platform and generated net long-term inflows of $11.5 billion in the quarter, with diverse mandates, both regionally and by capabilities funding in the period. 
Regarding retail net inflows, our ETF, excluding the QQQ, generated net long-term inflows of $3.7 billion. Year-to-date, we have captured global ETF market share. Our global ETF platform, again, excluding the QQQ, captured a 3.8% market share of flows, which exceeded our 2.7% market share of AUM.
We have also captured a higher share of the global ETF revenue pool over this period. Our market share of the revenue pool was 5.6%. The Net ETF inflows in the United States does include net long-term inflows of $900 million into our QQQ Innovation Suite, which crossed $3 billion in AUM, 1 year after its launch. Our EMEA-based ETF range generated $2.5 billion of net long-term inflows in the quarter, with particular strength from the IBC's S&P 500 UCITS ETF and the gold exchange traded commodity fund. 
Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6, you'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $4.8 billion in the quarter driven by net inflows into ETF, as mentioned, as well as our institutional flows. Asia Pacific again delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $9.3 billion. 
Net inflows were diversified across the region, reflecting $6.8 billion of net long-term inflows from Greater China, most of which arose in our JV and $3.1 billion from Japan. Turning to flows across asset classes. We continue to see broad strength in fixed income in the third quarter with net long-term flows of $11 billion. 
Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into various fixed income strategies through our China JV, global investment grade, stable value and municipal strategies. Our alternative asset class holds many different capabilities, and this is reflected in the flows that we saw in the third quarter. Net long-term flows and alternatives were $2.3 billion, driven primarily by our private markets business through a combination of inflows from direct real estate, the newly launched CLO that Marty mentioned and senior loan capabilities. 
When excluding global GTR net outflows of $1.7 billion, alternative net long-term inflows were $4 billion. The strength of our alternatives platform can be seen through the flow that is generated over the past 5 quarters with net long-term flows totaling $12 billion organic growth rate that's averaging nearly 6% per quarter over this time when excluding the impact of the GTR net outflows over this period. 
Turning to Slide 7. I wanted to spend a few minutes on our business in China, particularly given the level of flows we have seen from the region over the last several quarters and the high level of interest in our business there. Invesco launched the first, [ Sino ] U.S. JV in China in 2003 as Invesco Great Wall. We've been in the market for almost 2 decades with a unique JV structure and relationship with our partner. How we operate in China is differentiated from others that have joint ventures. While we have 49% ownership of the JV, our partner is a Chinese government-backed power company and has been a good partner. 
We've been leading the management of the JV, leveraging our global asset management expertise since the inception of this partnership. We run the business in China with Chinese management and our clients are Chinese investors. China's fund management industry is a very significant opportunity. In 20 years, it has grown from almost nothing to around $3.5 trillion. 
It's expected to become the second largest fund management market in the world by 2025 with assets of over $6 trillion. Also, China is estimated to account for over 40% of global net flows through 2024. Invesco, as an early entrant in China, has developed a strong and comprehensive platform covering all business activities, including robust domestic investment capabilities with good long-term performance track records. 
We have very strong relationships with banks and insurance companies and digital distribution has been a major contributor in recent years in terms of bringing in new onshore business. Key opportunities for Invesco in China include mutual funds, institutional clients and sovereign wealth funds. 
As China continues to open up and improve its capital markets, we also expect opportunities in pension reform, global investors increasing interest in investing in Chinese investments and cross-border investment opportunities. The relationships, the unique business model we established with our JV partner and the amount of AUM we have sourced from Chinese onshore investors really sets us apart from other global asset managers who are newer entrants in the Chinese market. 
Moving to Slide 8. We have built a diversified business in China with over $99 billion in AUM at the end of September. 60% of the AUM is from retail clients and 40% is institutional. We manage AUM in all asset classes and distribution is unique. Digital distribution to retail investors have become a mainstream channel, along with the traditional bank distribution channels, and this is not just for money market funds. 
With our market position in tenure in China, we are beneficiaries of this trend. Our long-term commitment and strong track record have put Invesco in an advantageous position and our strategic position and continued investment in China has resulted in a 42% annual growth rate over the last 3 years to date. In recognition of the strength of the business, Invesco was ranked the #1 China onshore business and the #3 for an asset management firm in overall China in 2020. 
Before we wrap up this discussion on China, in light of the recent developments around Ever grand, I want to note that our overall exposure of a direct equity or fixed income holding across the complex, including within our JV is de minimis. Market volatility in offshore markets, of course, does impact AUM levels and the market has been and could be volatile for future real estate developments. 
We remain positive towards the fundamentals of China's economy, and most of the flows in our China business come from domestic onshore clients. So if anything, we've seen a flight to quality as investors look to NAV-based products like the ones IGW offers. 
Now moving to Slide 9 to look at the institutional pipeline, which was $32 billion at the end of September. The pipeline remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of both asset and fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is well diversified across asset classes and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 38% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network. 
Turning to Slide 10. You'll note that net revenues increased $31 million or 2.3% from the second quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the third quarter. The net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was 34.4 basis points, a decrease of 4 basis points from the second quarter yield level. The decrease was mainly driven by asset mix shift, including higher QQQ and money market average balances. The incremental impact from higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal relative to the second quarter and the full impact on the net revenue yield for the third quarter was 0.6 of a basis point. 
Looking forward, we expect the dynamics impacting net revenue yield will continue, the degree of which will be influenced by market direction, especially if we see a divergence in performance in areas such as developing or emerging markets where fees tend to be higher than our firm average. 
We do expect the discretionary money market fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. One other area I want to note before moving to expenses are performance fees. 
Historically, we have realized meaningfully higher performance fees in the fourth quarter. These have been driven typically by a few funds each year that have reached the point in their life cycle where they generate performance fees usually in the fourth quarter. 
This year, we do not expect to see performance fee increase in the fourth quarter. We expect performance fees in the quarter will be more in line with our experience across the first 3 quarters of the year. This is due to vintages in our portfolio not being at the life cycle stage of recognizing performance fees, which is typically near the end of the life of the fund and is in no way related to the performance of the funds. 
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.2% in the third quarter. The $10 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensation and property office and technology expense. Higher variable compensation was driven by the revenue increase in the quarter, partially offset by savings resulting from our strategic evaluation. 
The increase in property, office and technology expenses was largely driven by changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provide to our funds as we noted last quarter. This change went into effect in the quarter and resulted in a $6 million expense increase, which was offset by a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenue. As a reminder, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs, which we reflect in property, office and technology expense, will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis or approximately $6 million per quarter. 
And offsetting this will be a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenues, resulting in a minimal impact to operating income. Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations. However, we did see a modest increase in client activity and business travel in the third quarter, which is reflected in both marketing and G&A expense. 
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, our expectations are for fourth quarter operating expenses to be relatively flat compared to the third quarter, assuming no change in market and FX levels from September 30. Consistent with prior years, we expect a modest seasonal increase in marketing-related expenses in the fourth quarter. And one area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. 
We are engaging in more domestic travel and in-person client activity, and we do expect to see continued modest resumption of these activities in the fourth quarter. Moving to Slide 11, we update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. In the third quarter, we realized $5.8 million in cost savings. $4 million of these savings is related to compensation expense associated with reorganization, and $2 million was related to property expense. 
$5.8 million in cost savings or $23 million annualized combined with $125 million in annualized savings realized for the second in quarter 2021 brings us to $148 million in total or 74% of our $200 million net savings expectation. 
As it relates to timing, we expect to modestly exceed the $150 million target we have set for 2021, with the remainder realized by the end of 2022. We expect the total program savings of $200 million through 2022, would be roughly 65% from compensation and 35% spread across the other categories. 
In the third quarter, we incurred $18 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $190 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with the program. We expect the remaining restructuring costs for the realization of this program to be in the range of $60 million to $85 million through the end of next year. 
As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. Now going to Slide 12. Adjusted operating income improved $21 million to $562 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin improved 60 basis points, 42.1% as compared to the second quarter. 
Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 1.7x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform. Nonoperating income was $29 million, driven primarily by unrealized gains in our co-investment portfolio. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.4% compared to 22.8% in the second quarter. The rate increase is primarily due to an increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the fourth quarter. 
The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. Looking at Slide 13. We illustrate our ability to drive adjusted operating margin performance against the backdrop of the client demand-driven change in our AUM mix and the resulting impact on our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees. 
Our operating margin in the third quarter of 2019, which was the first full quarter following the acquisition of Oppenheimer, was 40.9%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield of 40.7 basis points. In the third quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield have declined over 6 basis points to 34.4 basis points, yet our operating margin has improved to 42.1%. 
This chart starts at the third quarter of 2019, but in fact, our third quarter 2021 operating margin is the highest since Invesco became a U.S.-listed company in 2007. This is against the backdrop of a mix-driven decline in net revenue yield. We've been building out our product suite to meet client demand and client demand has been tilted towards lower fee products. 
In fact, the growth of the QQQ over this period is remarkable, almost tripling in size and going from 6% of our AUM mix in the third quarter of 2019 to 12% at the end of this quarter. Even though we do not earn a management fee, as a sponsor of the QQQ, we managed the over $100 million annual marketing budget generated by the product. The marketing budget has allowed Invesco to further raise awareness about the QQQ. 
That increased awareness has resulted in its ability to significantly increase our market share in the ETF space. Invesco is today the fourth largest ETF provider in the world. Growth in the QQQ accounts for 2 basis points of the net revenue yield decline over the period shown on this chart. And then as I noted earlier, discretionary money market fee waivers account for a 6 basis point decline in the net revenue yield. 
These 2 factors alone account for over 40% of the decline in the net revenue yield over this period. Realizing our business mix is shifting, we continue to be focused on aligning our expense base with the changes in our business mix, which has enabled the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvements. 
Now a few comments on Slide 14. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.8 billion on September 30 and approximately $725 million of this cash was held for regulatory requirements. The cash position has improved meaningfully over the past year, increasing by nearly $700 million, largely driven by the improvement in our operating income. 
Our debt profile has improved considerably as well with no draws on our revolver at quarter end. As a result, we have substantially improved our net leverage position as shown in the top right chart on this slide. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement declined from 1.43x a year ago to under 1x at 0.86 turns at the end of the third quarter. 
If you choose to include the preferred stock, the leverage ratio has declined from just over 4x to 2.67x at the end of the third quarter. Regarding future cash requirements, we recorded an additional downward adjustment to the MLP liability in the third quarter, reducing the liability from our previous estimate of nearly $300 million down to $254 million. 
We anticipate funding the liability this quarter, and we have ample cash resources to do so. While we anticipate a degree of insurance recovery related to this, the insurance claims process is inherently complex, and we do not have an update at this stage as to the exact timing or size of the recovery. Regarding our capital strategy, we are committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. 
As we look towards 2022 and beyond, we will be building towards a 30% to 50% total payout ratio over the next several years as we continue to modestly increase dividends and reinstate a share buyback program in the future. Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility. In summary, we continue to see growth in our key capabilities. We remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas while completing our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth. 
And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. We're in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A."

But let me back up and put it in context. As we look at our capital priorities and Allison and I just spoke a second ago about that, it's first, reinvesting in the business to sort of increase our competitive positioning. 
But then strategically, what we look at is we look at where client demand is. And if we can't fill the gap internally, we would look externally. So it has to make strategic sense. It has to be complementary to our business. It can't be duplicated to our business. That never works clients that like and employees don't like, and by the way shareholders don't either. 
And I'll come back to the point time and time again that you have to either wherewithal to ensure you're protecting what you bought while creating a better organization and also very importantly, the cultural alignment matters a lot. 
If there's misalignment, you're going to have a problem at some point. So as we look at it right now, a priority is, again, continuing to build out what we have, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, it is our private markets business where we're spending a specific amount of time as we're seeing client demand in credit, in particular, that's been an area in some extensions in our real estate area.

I wouldn't say there was an investment gap and the nature of just performance fees and how they are structured into various contracts just remains it's very bespoke and it can be somewhat chunky and difficult to predict. There wasn't an investment gap, but as we do look at just the ventages of what has performance fees in it, that would be eligible. There are -- it is not the typical year-end spike of what we would typically see. So no performance misses just the way these centages are kind of cycling through and what we see in the fourth quarter of this year. 
We continue to have about $58 billion of AUM overall that is performance fee eligible. We just don't have strike date, if you will, of 12/31 or at least the end of this year that would incur recognized performance fees in the fourth quarter. So our expectation is that fees in this quarter will be consistent with the experience we've had in the first 3 quarters of this year rather than a spike at year-end. 
And you shouldn't read anything into that in terms of what that means for 2022 or beyond. It's just simply a function of timing with the ventages this year."

If I look at the flows into the joint venture, in particular, it's about $7 billion, which of that product launches drove a couple of billion dollars, the remainder is really through existing products, particularly fixed income. There was a lot of strength in our fixed income capability. that's different than what we saw in the first quarter where it was new product launches that drove the majority of the flows. In this quarter, it was really from our existing products.

One, in terms of outlook for net revenue yield, just how we think about the fee rate from here, I mean, the biggest driver is always going to be the mix of flows that we see. That's going to have a huge impact. And as we continue to see client demand for all of our capabilities, but certainly increasing demand for our passive capability to see that downward pressure. At the same time, you can -- market impact can work in either direction. It doesn't work consistently across those different asset classes and capabilities. And so it's been inherently difficult to predict for that reason. In terms of, though, just bigger picture, how do we think about it, I mean, I do think we'll continue to see some modest downward pressure on it, just as we continue to grow our passive capabilities and we see demand for those capabilities. 
Hopefully, it was also helpful to kind of understand the impact of the QQQ has on that. And so while it's downward pressure on net revenue yield, it's a tremendous benefit for us. through the marketing support budget it provides us. And I think really most importantly, we are able to generate that positive operating leverage and really improve margins against us. And so where I think it goes from here? I'd say a couple of things. 
One, as we come towards the end of this expense management effort that we put in place last year, and we expect to complete that next year. I don't think we have to continue to do things like that in order to sustain these strong operating margins. We've got an expense base that's over $3 billion. It's a significant budget to work with. And so how we think about it is really how we deploy that expense base. How do we continue to reallocate where we invest against our areas of highest demand. And as we've built out the breadth of capabilities, that scale and the volume of flows is what continues to generate really positive operating leverage that we're looking for and it gives us the opportunity to sustain these 40% spot operating margins, even with some of that downward pressure in that net revenue yield. 
And I appreciate you asking the question because I think it's a really important point that we wanted to drive home and we wanted it to come through today because this didn't happen by accident. It really reflects a lot of deliberate work by the company over the last couple of years and an operating expense base that really gives us the leverage we need to continue to invest in the areas of growth that we see ahead."

And I'll make a few comments and turn it over to Allison so she can see the quarter in more depth, and then we'll open up to Q&A as we always do.  
And hoping everybody is staying safe and healthy as we continue to return to normalcy. And I know we're all looking for that pace to continue in the months ahead. We continue to have a high level of engagement with our clients, which is even more important as we navigate the market uncertainty brought about by the end of economic and market upside surprises we experienced from the depths of COVID. Helping our clients by providing insights and solutions, utilizing our broad range of capabilities.  
This approach has helped us deliver strong, consistent growth over the past 5 quarters. And as you can see on Slide 3, if you're following along on the deck, net long-term flows were $13.3 billion during the quarter. This represents over 4% annualized long-term organic growth for the quarter.  
Growth was driven by continued strength in a number of our key capabilities, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. Strategically, we continue to invest in areas where we see client demand were a competitive strength. And since the third quarter of last year, we generated $86 billion of long-term inflows and an average quarterly organic growth rate of 6%.  
Five consecutive quarters of strong growth have the direct result of the investments we've made over time to enhance and evolve our business to meet client needs. ETFs, excluding the Qs, generated long-term inflows of $3.7 billion in the quarter with strong market share gains in our EMEA ETF range.  
In private markets, we generated net long-term inflows in our direct real estate business, $1.2 billion, and robust bank loan product demand resulted in net long-term inflows of $2 billion during the quarter. This included the launch of a new CLO.  
We generated net long-term inflows of $11 billion within active fixed income across the platform. And within active global equities, the developing markets fund a key capability that came over when we combined with Oppenheimer, continue to see net long-term inflows of $700 million during the quarter.  
That said, we remain focused and continue to work on areas where there's opportunity for improvement. In addition, our solutions-enabled institutional pipeline, accounts for 38% of the pipeline at quarter end. Third quarter flows included net long-term inflows of $6.8 billion from Greater China. Our China business continues to be a source of strength and differentiation for Invesco. We continue to expect the Chinese investment management industry to be the fastest growing market in the world for the foreseeable future. We were an early entrant 20 years ago, and we are benefiting from that commitment and investment, and we expect to see continued growth in the years ahead. 
Before I turn the call over to Allison, who will provide more information on the China business and the results, I'd like to note that the growth we are experiencing is driving positive operating leverage, reducing adjusted operating margin of 42% for the quarter.  
The strong cash flow being generated from our business improved our cash position and helping build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future. Invesco's depth and breadth of capabilities and competitive strengths position us well as we look forward. We continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcomes for our clients while driving future growth. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Allison."

Our investment performance was strong in the third quarter with 72% and 74% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers for being benchmarked on a 5-year and a 10-year basis.  
This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.  
Moving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with $1.529 trillion in AUM, a net increase of $3.6 billion. As Marty noted earlier, our diversified platform generated net long-term inflows in the third quarter of $13.3 billion, representing a 4.4% annualized organic growth rate. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $6.8 billion and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $6.5 billion.  
Market declines in FX rate changes led to a decrease in AUM of $18.6 billion in the quarter. The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $1.8 billion, driven by positive ETF flows and inflows in Greater China. The institutional channel demonstrated the breadth of our platform and generated net long-term inflows of $11.5 billion in the quarter, with diverse mandates, both regionally and by capabilities funding in the period.  
Regarding retail net inflows, our ETF, excluding the QQQ, generated net long-term inflows of $3.7 billion. Year-to-date, we have captured global ETF market share. Our global ETF platform, again, excluding the QQQ, captured a 3.8% market share of flows, which exceeded our 2.7% market share of AUM. 
We have also captured a higher share of the global ETF revenue pool over this period. Our market share of the revenue pool was 5.6%. Net ETF inflows in the United States does include net long-term inflows of $900 million into our QQQ innovation suite, which crossed $3 billion in AUM, 1 year after its launch. Our EMEA-based ETF range generated $2.5 billion of net long-term inflows in the quarter, with particular strength from the IBC's S&P 500 UCITS ETF and the gold exchange traded commodity fund.  
Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6, you'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $4.8 billion in the quarter driven by net inflows into ETF, as mentioned, as well as our institutional flows. Asia Pacific, again, delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $9.3 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region, reflecting $6.8 billion of net long-term inflows from Greater China, most of which arose in our JV and $3.1 billion from Japan. 
Turning to flows across asset classes. We continue to see broad strength in fixed income in the third quarter with net long-term flows of $11 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into various fixed income strategies through our China JV, global investment grade, stable value and municipal strategies. 
Our alternative asset class holds many different capabilities, and this is reflected in the flows that we saw in the third quarter. Net long-term flows and alternatives were $2.3 billion, driven primarily by our private markets business through a combination of inflows from direct real estate, the newly launched CLO that Marty mentioned and senior loan capabilities.  
When excluding global GTR net outflows of $1.7 billion, alternative net long-term inflows were $4 billion. The strength of our alternatives platform can be seen through the flow that is generated over the past 5 quarters with net long-term flows totaling $12 billion and organic's growth rate that's averaging nearly 6% per quarter over this time when excluding the impact of the GTR net outflows over this period.  
Turning to Slide 7. I wanted to spend a few minutes on our business in China, particularly given the level of flows we have seen from the region over the last several quarters and the high level of interest in our business there. Invesco launched the first Sino U.S. JV in China in 2003 as Invesco Great Wall. We've been in the market for almost 2 decades with a unique JV structure and relationship with our partner. How we operate in China is differentiated from others that have joint ventures. While we have 49% ownership of the JV, our partner is a Chinese government-backed power company and has been a good partner.  
We've been leading the management of the JV, leveraging our global asset management expertise since the inception of this partnership. We run the business in China with Chinese management, and our clients are Chinese investors. China's fund management industry is a very significant opportunity. In 20 years, it has grown from almost nothing to around $3.5 trillion.  
It's expected to become the second largest fund management market in the world by 2025 with assets of over $6 trillion. Also, China is estimated to account for over 40% of global net flows through 2024. Invesco, as an early entrant in China, has developed a strong and comprehensive platform covering all business activities, including robust domestic investment capabilities with good long-term performance track records.  
We have very strong relationships with banks and insurance companies and digital distribution has been a major contributor in recent years in terms of bringing in new onshore business. Key opportunities for Invesco in China include mutual funds, institutional clients and sovereign wealth funds.  
As China continues to open up and improve its capital markets, we also expect opportunities in pension reform, global investors increasing interest in investing in Chinese investments and cross-border investment opportunities. The relationships, the unique business model we established with our JV partner and the amount of AUM we have sourced from Chinese onshore investors really sets us apart from other global asset managers who are newer entrants in the Chinese market.  
Moving to Slide 8. We have built a diversified business in China with over $99 billion in AUM at the end of September. 60% of the AUM is from retail clients and 40% is institutional. We manage AUM in all asset classes and distribution is unique. Digital distribution to retail investors have become a mainstream channel, along with the traditional bank distribution channels, and this is not just for money market funds.  
With our market position in tenure in China, we are beneficiaries of this trend. Our long-term commitment and strong track record have put Invesco in an advantageous position and our strategic position and continued investment in China has resulted in a 42% annual growth rate over the last 3 years to date. In recognition of the strength of the business, Invesco was ranked the #1 China onshore business and the #3 for an asset management firm in overall China in 2020.  
Before we wrap up this discussion on China, in light of the recent developments around Evergrande, I want to note that our overall exposure of a direct equity or fixed income holding across the complex, including within our JV is de minimis. Market volatility in offshore markets, of course, doesn't impact AUM levels and the market has been and could be volatile for future real estate developments.  
We remain positive towards the fundamentals of China's economy, and most of the flows in our China business come from domestic onshore clients. So if anything, we've seen a flight to quality as investors look to NAV-based products like the ones IGW offers.  
Now moving to Slide 9 to look at the institutional pipeline, which was $32 billion at the end of September. The pipeline remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of both asset and fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is well diversified across asset classes and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 38% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network.  
Turning to Slide 10. You'll note that net revenues increased $31 million, or 2.3%, from the second quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the third quarter. The net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was 34.4 basis points, a decrease of 0.4 on the basis points from the second quarter yield level. The decrease was mainly driven by asset mix shift, including higher QQQ and money market average balances. The incremental impact from higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal relative to the second quarter and the full impact on the net revenue yield for the third quarter was 0.6 of a basis point.  
Looking forward, we expect the dynamics impacting net revenue yield will continue, the degree of which will be influenced by market direction, especially if we see a divergence in performance in areas such as developing or emerging markets where fees tend to be higher than our firm average.  
We do expect the discretionary money market fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. 
One other area I want to note before moving to expenses are performance fees. Historically, we have realized meaningfully higher performance fees in the fourth quarter. These have been driven typically by a few funds each year that have reached the point in their life cycle where they generate performance fees usually in the fourth quarter.  
This year, we do not expect to see performance fee increase in the fourth quarter. We expect performance fees in the quarter will be more in line with our experience across the first 3 quarters of the year. This is due to vintages in our portfolio not being at the life cycle stage of recognizing performance fees, which is typically near the end of the life of the fund and is in no way related to the performance of the funds.  
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.2% in the third quarter. The $10 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensation and property, office and technology expense. Higher variable compensation was driven by the revenue increase in the quarter, partially offset by savings resulting from our strategic evaluation.  
The increase in property, office and technology expenses was largely driven by changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provide to our funds as we noted last quarter. This change went into effect in the third quarter and resulted in a $6 million expense increase, which was offset by a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenue. 
As a reminder, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs, which we reflect in property, office and technology expense, will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis or approximately $6 million per quarter.  And offsetting this will be a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenues, resulting in a minimal impact to operating income. 
Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations. However, we did see a modest increase in client activity and business travel in the third quarter, which is reflected in both marketing and G&A expense.  
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, our expectations are for fourth quarter operating expenses to be relatively flat compared to the third quarter, assuming no change in markets and FX levels from September 30. Consistent with prior years, we expect a modest seasonal increase in marketing-related expenses in the fourth quarter. And one area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. We are engaging in more domestic travel and in-person client activity, and we do expect to see continued modest resumption of these activities in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 11, we update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. In the third quarter, we realized $5.8 million in cost savings. $4 million of these savings is related to compensation expense associated with reorganization and $2 million was related to property expense. A $5.8 million in cost savings, or $23 million annualized, combined with $125 million in annualized savings realized for the second in quarter 2021 brings us to $148 million in total, or 74%, of our $200 million net savings expectation.  
As it relates to timing, we expect to modestly exceed the $150 million target we have set for 2021, with the remainder realized by the end of 2022. We expect the total program savings of $200 million through 2022 would be roughly 65% from compensation and 35% spread across the other categories.  
In the third quarter, we incurred $18 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $190 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with the program. We expect the remaining restructuring costs for the realization of this program to be in the range of $60 million to $85 million through the end of next year. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. 
Now going to Slide 12. Adjusted operating income improved $21 million to $562 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin improved 60 basis points, 42.1% as compared to the second quarter.  
Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 1.7x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform. Nonoperating income was $29 million, driven primarily by unrealized gains in our co-investment portfolio.  
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.4% compared to 22.8% in the second quarter. The rate increase is primarily due to an increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the fourth quarter. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. 
Looking at Slide 13. We illustrate our ability to drive adjusted operating margin performance against the backdrop of the client demand-driven change in our AUM mix and the resulting impact on our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees.  
Our operating margin in the third quarter of 2019, which was the first full quarter following the acquisition of Oppenheimer, was 40.9%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield of 40.7 basis points. In the third quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield had declined over 6 basis points to 34.4 basis points, yet our operating margin has improved to 42.1%.  
This chart starts at the third quarter of 2019, but in fact, our third quarter 2021 operating margin is the highest since Invesco became a U.S.-listed company in 2007. This is against the backdrop of a mix-driven decline in net revenue yield. We've been building out our product suite to meet client demand and client demand has been tilted towards lower fee products.  
In fact, the growth of the QQQ over this period is remarkable, almost tripling in size and going from 6% of our AUM mix in the third quarter of 2019 to 12% at the end of this quarter. Even though we do not earn a management fee, as a sponsor of the QQQ, we managed the over $100 million annual marketing budget generated by the product. The marketing budget has allowed Invesco to further raise awareness about the QQQ.  
That increased awareness has resulted in its ability to significantly increase our market share in the ETF space. Invesco is today the fourth largest ETF provider in the world. Growth in the QQQ accounts for 2 basis points of the net revenue yield decline over the period shown on this chart. And then as I noted earlier, discretionary money market fee waivers account for a 6 basis point decline in the net revenue yield. These 2 factors alone account for over 40% of the decline in the net revenue yield over this period. 
Realizing our business mix is shifting, we continue to be focused on aligning our expense base with the changes in our business mix, which has enabled the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvements.  
Now a few comments on Slide 14. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.8 billion on September 30 and approximately $725 million of this cash was held for regulatory requirements. The cash position has improved meaningfully over the past year, increasing by nearly $700 million, largely driven by the improvement in our operating income.  
Our debt profile has improved considerably as well with no draws on our revolver at quarter end. As a result, we have substantially improved our net leverage position as shown in the top right chart on this slide. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement, declined from 1.43x a year ago to under 1x at 0.86 turns at the end of the third quarter.  
If you choose to include the preferred stock, the leverage ratio has declined from just over 4x to 2.67x at the end of the third quarter. Regarding future cash requirements, we recorded an additional downward adjustment to the MLP liability in the third quarter, reducing the liability from our previous estimate of nearly $300 million down to $254 million.  
We anticipate funding the liability this quarter, and we have ample cash resources to do so. While we anticipate a degree of insurance recovery related to this, the insurance claims process is inherently complex, and we do not have an update at this stage as to the exact timing or size of the recovery. Regarding our capital strategy, we are committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases.  
As we look towards 2022 and beyond, we will be building towards a 30% to 50% total payout ratio over the next several years as we continue to modestly increase dividends and reinstate a share buyback program in the future. Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility. 
In summary, we continue to see growth in our key capabilities. We remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas while completing our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth.  
And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. We're in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term. 
And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A."

As we look at our capital priorities, and Allison and I just spoke a second ago about that, it's first, reinvesting in the business to sort of increase our competitive positioning.  
But then strategically, what we look at is we look at where client demand is. And if we can't fill the gap internally, we would look externally. So it has to make strategic sense. It has to be complementary to our business. It can't be duplicative to our business. That never works clients that like it, and employees don't like it and by the way shareholders don't either.  
And I'll come back to the point time and time again that you have to either wherewithal to ensure you're protecting what you bought while creating a better organization and also very importantly, the cultural alignment matters a lot. If there's misalignment, you're going to have a problem at some point. 
So as we look at it right now, a priority is, again, continuing to build out what we have, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, it is our private markets business where we're spending a specific amount of time as we're seeing client demand in credit, in particular, that's been an area in some extensions in our real estate area.

There are -- it is not the typical year-end spike of what we would typically see. So no performance misses just the way these ventages are kind of cycling through and what we see in the fourth quarter of this year.  
We continue to have about $58 billion of AUM overall that is performance fee eligible. We just don't have strike dates, if you will, of 12/31 or at least the end of this year that would incur recognized performance fees in the fourth quarter. So our expectation is that fees in this quarter will be consistent with the experience we've had in the first 3 quarters of this year rather than a spike at year-end.  
And you shouldn't read anything into that in terms of what that means for 2022 or beyond. It's just simply a function of timing with the ventages this year."

If I look at the flows into the joint venture, in particular, it's about $7 billion, which, of that product launches, drove a couple of billion dollars, the remainder is really through existing products, particularly fixed income. There was a lot of strength in our fixed income capability. That's different than what we saw in the first quarter where it was new product launches that drove the majority of the flows.

One, in terms of outlook for net revenue yield, just how we think about the fee rates from here, I mean, the biggest driver is always going to be the mix of flows that we see. That's going to have a huge impact.",466,"Yes. I mean I would say a couple of things. One, in terms of outlook for net revenue yield, just how we think about the fee rates from here, I mean, the biggest driver is always going to be the mix of flows that we see. That's going to have a huge impact. And as we continue to see client demand for all of our capabilities, but certainly increasing demand for our passive capability to see that downward pressure. 
At the same time, you can -- market impact can work in either direction. And it doesn't work consistently across those different asset classes and capabilities. And so it's been inherently difficult to predict for that reason. In terms of, though, just bigger picture, how do we think about it, I mean, I do think we'll continue to see some modest downward pressure on it, just as we continue to grow our passive capabilities and we see demand for those capabilities.  
Hopefully, it was also helpful to kind of understand the impact of the QQQ has on that. And so while it puts downward pressure on net revenue yield, it's a tremendous benefit for us through the marketing support budget it provides us. And I think really most importantly, we are able to generate that positive operating leverage and really improve margins against us. And so where do I think it goes from here? I'd say a couple of things.  
One, as we come towards the end of this expense management effort that we put in place last year, and we expect to complete that next year, I don't think we have to continue to do things like that in order to sustain these strong operating margins. We've got an expense base that's over $3 billion. It's a significant budget to work with. And so how we think about it is really how do we deploy that expense base. How do we continue to reallocate where we invest against our areas of highest demand? And as we've built out the breadth of capabilities, that scale and the volume of flows is what continues to generate really the positive operating leverage that we're looking for and it gives us the opportunity to sustain these 40% spot operating margins, even with some of that downward pressure in that net revenue yield.  
And I appreciate you asking the question because I think it's a really important point that we wanted to drive home and we wanted it to come through today because this didn't happen by accident. It really reflects a lot of deliberate work by the company over the last couple of years and an operating expense base that really gives us the leverage we need to continue to invest in the areas of growth that we see ahead."

And hoping everybody is staying safe and healthy as we continue to return to normalcy. And I know we're all looking for that pace to continue in the months ahead. We continue to have a high level of engagement with our clients, which is even more important as we navigate the market uncertainty brought about by the end of economic and market upside surprises we experienced from the depths of COVID. Helping our clients by providing insights and solutions, utilizing our broad range of capabilities.  
This approach has helped us deliver strong, consistent growth over the past 5 quarters. And as you can see on Slide 3, if you're following along on the deck, net long-term flows were $13.3 billion during the quarter. This represents over 4% annualized long-term organic growth for the quarter.  
Growth was driven by continued strength in a number of our key capabilities, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. Strategically, we continue to invest in areas where we see client demand were a competitive strength. And since the third quarter of last year, we generated $86 billion of long-term inflows and an average quarterly organic growth rate of 6%.  
Five consecutive quarters of strong growth have the direct result of the investments we've made over time to enhance and evolve our business to meet client needs. ETFs, excluding the Qs, generated long-term inflows of $3.7 billion in the quarter with strong market share gains in our EMEA ETF range.  
In private markets, we generated net long-term inflows in our direct real estate business, $1.2 billion, and robust bank loan product demand resulted in net long-term inflows of $2 billion during the quarter. This included the launch of a new CLO.  
We generated net long-term inflows of $11 billion within active fixed income across the platform. And within active global equities, the developing markets fund a key capability that came over when we combined with Oppenheimer, continue to see net long-term inflows of $700 million during the quarter.  
That said, we remain focused and continue to work on areas where there's opportunity for improvement. In addition, our solutions-enabled institutional pipeline, accounts for 38% of the pipeline at quarter end. Third quarter flows included net long-term inflows of $6.8 billion from Greater China. Our China business continues to be a source of strength and differentiation for Invesco. We continue to expect the Chinese investment management industry to be the fastest growing market in the world for the foreseeable future. We were an early entrant 20 years ago, and we are benefiting from that commitment and investment, and we expect to see continued growth in the years ahead. 
Before I turn the call over to Allison, who will provide more information on the China business and the results, I'd like to note that the growth we are experiencing is driving positive operating leverage, reducing adjusted operating margin of 42% for the quarter.  
The strong cash flow being generated from our business improved our cash position and helping build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future. Invesco's depth and breadth of capabilities and competitive strengths position us well as we look forward. We continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcomes for our clients while driving future growth. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Allison."

Our investment performance was strong in the third quarter with 72% and 74% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers for being benchmarked on a 5-year and a 10-year basis.  
This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.  
Moving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with $1.529 trillion in AUM, a net increase of $3.6 billion. As Marty noted earlier, our diversified platform generated net long-term inflows in the third quarter of $13.3 billion, representing a 4.4% annualized organic growth rate. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $6.8 billion and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $6.5 billion.  
Market declines in FX rate changes led to a decrease in AUM of $18.6 billion in the quarter. The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $1.8 billion, driven by positive ETF flows and inflows in Greater China. The institutional channel demonstrated the breadth of our platform and generated net long-term inflows of $11.5 billion in the quarter, with diverse mandates, both regionally and by capabilities funding in the period.  
Regarding retail net inflows, our ETF, excluding the QQQ, generated net long-term inflows of $3.7 billion. Year-to-date, we have captured global ETF market share. Our global ETF platform, again, excluding the QQQ, captured a 3.8% market share of flows, which exceeded our 2.7% market share of AUM. 
We have also captured a higher share of the global ETF revenue pool over this period. Our market share of the revenue pool was 5.6%. Net ETF inflows in the United States does include net long-term inflows of $900 million into our QQQ innovation suite, which crossed $3 billion in AUM, 1 year after its launch. Our EMEA-based ETF range generated $2.5 billion of net long-term inflows in the quarter, with particular strength from the IBC's S&P 500 UCITS ETF and the gold exchange traded commodity fund.  
Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6, you'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $4.8 billion in the quarter driven by net inflows into ETF, as mentioned, as well as our institutional flows. Asia Pacific, again, delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $9.3 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region, reflecting $6.8 billion of net long-term inflows from Greater China, most of which arose in our JV and $3.1 billion from Japan. 
Turning to flows across asset classes. We continue to see broad strength in fixed income in the third quarter with net long-term flows of $11 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into various fixed income strategies through our China JV, global investment grade, stable value and municipal strategies. 
Our alternative asset class holds many different capabilities, and this is reflected in the flows that we saw in the third quarter. Net long-term flows and alternatives were $2.3 billion, driven primarily by our private markets business through a combination of inflows from direct real estate, the newly launched CLO that Marty mentioned and senior loan capabilities.  
When excluding global GTR net outflows of $1.7 billion, alternative net long-term inflows were $4 billion. The strength of our alternatives platform can be seen through the flow that is generated over the past 5 quarters with net long-term flows totaling $12 billion and organic's growth rate that's averaging nearly 6% per quarter over this time when excluding the impact of the GTR net outflows over this period.  
Turning to Slide 7. I wanted to spend a few minutes on our business in China, particularly given the level of flows we have seen from the region over the last several quarters and the high level of interest in our business there. Invesco launched the first Sino U.S. JV in China in 2003 as Invesco Great Wall. We've been in the market for almost 2 decades with a unique JV structure and relationship with our partner. How we operate in China is differentiated from others that have joint ventures. While we have 49% ownership of the JV, our partner is a Chinese government-backed power company and has been a good partner.  
We've been leading the management of the JV, leveraging our global asset management expertise since the inception of this partnership. We run the business in China with Chinese management, and our clients are Chinese investors. China's fund management industry is a very significant opportunity. In 20 years, it has grown from almost nothing to around $3.5 trillion.  
It's expected to become the second largest fund management market in the world by 2025 with assets of over $6 trillion. Also, China is estimated to account for over 40% of global net flows through 2024. Invesco, as an early entrant in China, has developed a strong and comprehensive platform covering all business activities, including robust domestic investment capabilities with good long-term performance track records.  
We have very strong relationships with banks and insurance companies and digital distribution has been a major contributor in recent years in terms of bringing in new onshore business. Key opportunities for Invesco in China include mutual funds, institutional clients and sovereign wealth funds.  
As China continues to open up and improve its capital markets, we also expect opportunities in pension reform, global investors increasing interest in investing in Chinese investments and cross-border investment opportunities. The relationships, the unique business model we established with our JV partner and the amount of AUM we have sourced from Chinese onshore investors really sets us apart from other global asset managers who are newer entrants in the Chinese market.  
Moving to Slide 8. We have built a diversified business in China with over $99 billion in AUM at the end of September. 60% of the AUM is from retail clients and 40% is institutional. We manage AUM in all asset classes and distribution is unique. Digital distribution to retail investors have become a mainstream channel, along with the traditional bank distribution channels, and this is not just for money market funds.  
With our market position in tenure in China, we are beneficiaries of this trend. Our long-term commitment and strong track record have put Invesco in an advantageous position and our strategic position and continued investment in China has resulted in a 42% annual growth rate over the last 3 years to date. In recognition of the strength of the business, Invesco was ranked the #1 China onshore business and the #3 for an asset management firm in overall China in 2020.  
Before we wrap up this discussion on China, in light of the recent developments around Evergrande, I want to note that our overall exposure of a direct equity or fixed income holding across the complex, including within our JV is de minimis. Market volatility in offshore markets, of course, doesn't impact AUM levels and the market has been and could be volatile for future real estate developments.  
We remain positive towards the fundamentals of China's economy, and most of the flows in our China business come from domestic onshore clients. So if anything, we've seen a flight to quality as investors look to NAV-based products like the ones IGW offers.  
Now moving to Slide 9 to look at the institutional pipeline, which was $32 billion at the end of September. The pipeline remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of both asset and fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is well diversified across asset classes and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 38% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network.  
Turning to Slide 10. You'll note that net revenues increased $31 million, or 2.3%, from the second quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the third quarter. The net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was 34.4 basis points, a decrease of 0.4 on the basis points from the second quarter yield level. The decrease was mainly driven by asset mix shift, including higher QQQ and money market average balances. The incremental impact from higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal relative to the second quarter and the full impact on the net revenue yield for the third quarter was 0.6 of a basis point.  
Looking forward, we expect the dynamics impacting net revenue yield will continue, the degree of which will be influenced by market direction, especially if we see a divergence in performance in areas such as developing or emerging markets where fees tend to be higher than our firm average.  
We do expect the discretionary money market fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. 
One other area I want to note before moving to expenses are performance fees. Historically, we have realized meaningfully higher performance fees in the fourth quarter. These have been driven typically by a few funds each year that have reached the point in their life cycle where they generate performance fees usually in the fourth quarter.  
This year, we do not expect to see performance fee increase in the fourth quarter. We expect performance fees in the quarter will be more in line with our experience across the first 3 quarters of the year. This is due to vintages in our portfolio not being at the life cycle stage of recognizing performance fees, which is typically near the end of the life of the fund and is in no way related to the performance of the funds.  
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.2% in the third quarter. The $10 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensation and property, office and technology expense. Higher variable compensation was driven by the revenue increase in the quarter, partially offset by savings resulting from our strategic evaluation.  
The increase in property, office and technology expenses was largely driven by changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provide to our funds as we noted last quarter. This change went into effect in the third quarter and resulted in a $6 million expense increase, which was offset by a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenue. 
As a reminder, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs, which we reflect in property, office and technology expense, will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis or approximately $6 million per quarter.  And offsetting this will be a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenues, resulting in a minimal impact to operating income. 
Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations. However, we did see a modest increase in client activity and business travel in the third quarter, which is reflected in both marketing and G&A expense.  
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, our expectations are for fourth quarter operating expenses to be relatively flat compared to the third quarter, assuming no change in markets and FX levels from September 30. Consistent with prior years, we expect a modest seasonal increase in marketing-related expenses in the fourth quarter. And one area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. We are engaging in more domestic travel and in-person client activity, and we do expect to see continued modest resumption of these activities in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 11, we update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. In the third quarter, we realized $5.8 million in cost savings. $4 million of these savings is related to compensation expense associated with reorganization and $2 million was related to property expense. A $5.8 million in cost savings, or $23 million annualized, combined with $125 million in annualized savings realized for the second in quarter 2021 brings us to $148 million in total, or 74%, of our $200 million net savings expectation.  
As it relates to timing, we expect to modestly exceed the $150 million target we have set for 2021, with the remainder realized by the end of 2022. We expect the total program savings of $200 million through 2022 would be roughly 65% from compensation and 35% spread across the other categories.  
In the third quarter, we incurred $18 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $190 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with the program. We expect the remaining restructuring costs for the realization of this program to be in the range of $60 million to $85 million through the end of next year. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. 
Now going to Slide 12. Adjusted operating income improved $21 million to $562 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin improved 60 basis points, 42.1% as compared to the second quarter.  
Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 1.7x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform. Nonoperating income was $29 million, driven primarily by unrealized gains in our co-investment portfolio.  
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.4% compared to 22.8% in the second quarter. The rate increase is primarily due to an increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the fourth quarter. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. 
Looking at Slide 13. We illustrate our ability to drive adjusted operating margin performance against the backdrop of the client demand-driven change in our AUM mix and the resulting impact on our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees.  
Our operating margin in the third quarter of 2019, which was the first full quarter following the acquisition of Oppenheimer, was 40.9%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield of 40.7 basis points. In the third quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield had declined over 6 basis points to 34.4 basis points, yet our operating margin has improved to 42.1%.  
This chart starts at the third quarter of 2019, but in fact, our third quarter 2021 operating margin is the highest since Invesco became a U.S.-listed company in 2007. This is against the backdrop of a mix-driven decline in net revenue yield. We've been building out our product suite to meet client demand and client demand has been tilted towards lower fee products.  
In fact, the growth of the QQQ over this period is remarkable, almost tripling in size and going from 6% of our AUM mix in the third quarter of 2019 to 12% at the end of this quarter. Even though we do not earn a management fee, as a sponsor of the QQQ, we managed the over $100 million annual marketing budget generated by the product. The marketing budget has allowed Invesco to further raise awareness about the QQQ.  
That increased awareness has resulted in its ability to significantly increase our market share in the ETF space. Invesco is today the fourth largest ETF provider in the world. Growth in the QQQ accounts for 2 basis points of the net revenue yield decline over the period shown on this chart. And then as I noted earlier, discretionary money market fee waivers account for a 6 basis point decline in the net revenue yield. These 2 factors alone account for over 40% of the decline in the net revenue yield over this period. 
Realizing our business mix is shifting, we continue to be focused on aligning our expense base with the changes in our business mix, which has enabled the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvements.  
Now a few comments on Slide 14. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.8 billion on September 30 and approximately $725 million of this cash was held for regulatory requirements. The cash position has improved meaningfully over the past year, increasing by nearly $700 million, largely driven by the improvement in our operating income.  
Our debt profile has improved considerably as well with no draws on our revolver at quarter end. As a result, we have substantially improved our net leverage position as shown in the top right chart on this slide. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement, declined from 1.43x a year ago to under 1x at 0.86 turns at the end of the third quarter.  
If you choose to include the preferred stock, the leverage ratio has declined from just over 4x to 2.67x at the end of the third quarter. Regarding future cash requirements, we recorded an additional downward adjustment to the MLP liability in the third quarter, reducing the liability from our previous estimate of nearly $300 million down to $254 million.  
We anticipate funding the liability this quarter, and we have ample cash resources to do so. While we anticipate a degree of insurance recovery related to this, the insurance claims process is inherently complex, and we do not have an update at this stage as to the exact timing or size of the recovery. Regarding our capital strategy, we are committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases.  
As we look towards 2022 and beyond, we will be building towards a 30% to 50% total payout ratio over the next several years as we continue to modestly increase dividends and reinstate a share buyback program in the future. Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility. 
In summary, we continue to see growth in our key capabilities. We remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas while completing our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth.  
And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. We're in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term. 
And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A."

But let me back up and put it in context. As we look at our capital priorities, and Allison and I just spoke a second ago about that, it's first, reinvesting in the business to sort of increase our competitive positioning.  
But then strategically, what we look at is we look at where client demand is. And if we can't fill the gap internally, we would look externally. So it has to make strategic sense. It has to be complementary to our business. It can't be duplicative to our business. That never works clients that like it, and employees don't like it and by the way shareholders don't either.  
And I'll come back to the point time and time again that you have to either wherewithal to ensure you're protecting what you bought while creating a better organization and also very importantly, the cultural alignment matters a lot. If there's misalignment, you're going to have a problem at some point. 
So as we look at it right now, a priority is, again, continuing to build out what we have, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, it is our private markets business where we're spending a specific amount of time as we're seeing client demand in credit, in particular, that's been an area in some extensions in our real estate area.

So no performance misses just the way these ventages are kind of cycling through and what we see in the fourth quarter of this year.  
We continue to have about $58 billion of AUM overall that is performance fee eligible. We just don't have strike dates, if you will, of 12/31 or at least the end of this year that would incur recognized performance fees in the fourth quarter.

And again, we're now just, frankly, turning our attention to it after really the consolidation last year.  
And so look, we still think there's -- if you just look at the way digital technologies are being used in a place like China, that's really what gave us the impetus to spend time and energy there. It has proven to be stunningly successful in China. There's different regulatory barriers here in the United States and structures and the like, but we still think there's an opportunity for success there.

One, in terms of outlook for net revenue yield, just how we think about the fee rates from here, I mean, the biggest driver is always going to be the mix of flows that we see. That's going to have a huge impact. And as we continue to see client demand for all of our capabilities, but certainly increasing demand for our passive capability to see that downward pressure. 
At the same time, you can -- market impact can work in either direction. And it doesn't work consistently across those different asset classes and capabilities. And so it's been inherently difficult to predict for that reason. In terms of, though, just bigger picture, how do we think about it, I mean, I do think we'll continue to see some modest downward pressure on it, just as we continue to grow our passive capabilities and we see demand for those capabilities.  
Hopefully, it was also helpful to kind of understand the impact of the QQQ has on that. And so while it puts downward pressure on net revenue yield, it's a tremendous benefit for us through the marketing support budget it provides us. And I think really most importantly, we are able to generate that positive operating leverage and really improve margins against us. And so where do I think it goes from here? I'd say a couple of things.  
One, as we come towards the end of this expense management effort that we put in place last year, and we expect to complete that next year, I don't think we have to continue to do things like that in order to sustain these strong operating margins. We've got an expense base that's over $3 billion. It's a significant budget to work with. And so how we think about it is really how do we deploy that expense base. How do we continue to reallocate where we invest against our areas of highest demand? And as we've built out the breadth of capabilities, that scale and the volume of flows is what continues to generate really the positive operating leverage that we're looking for and it gives us the opportunity to sustain these 40% spot operating margins, even with some of that downward pressure in that net revenue yield.  
And I appreciate you asking the question because I think it's a really important point that we wanted to drive home and we wanted it to come through today because this didn't happen by accident. It really reflects a lot of deliberate work by the company over the last couple of years and an operating expense base that really gives us the leverage we need to continue to invest in the areas of growth that we see ahead."
