It was also another successful year of growth and solid operations for Alliant Energy. We continue to consistently deliver on our purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities. I'm proud of what our team accomplished and how we delivered on our purpose. An year with many challenges from the ongoing global pandemic to racial injustice and a disruptive derecho windstorm. 
In the face of these challenges, we finished near the top of our original earnings guidance range with the 2020 consolidated earnings per share of $2.47. Our non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings grew more than 7% over 2019. This was the tenth year in a row of achieving our 5% to 7% growth objective. This consistent growth, solid execution and operational results showcases the resiliency and flexibility of our company. 
I'll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements from the year, then I'll turn it over to Robert, who will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes. I'd like to start by mentioning a few of our recognitions from 2020. I mentioned earlier the August derecho windstorm. I'm proud that our efforts to restore electricity to our customers was recognized by receiving the Edison Electric Institute's emergency response award. Alliant Energy was also included in Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index, highlighting just 380 companies from around the world who are committed to supporting gender equality in the workplace. And we were recently named to Newsweek's Most Responsible Companies list, where we rank 12 overall for our social responsibility efforts. And to top it off, for the fourth year in a row, Alliant Energy has earned a perfect score in the Corporate Equality Index issued by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. 
As I reflect on these achievements, they each showcases how we live our values as we care for others, do the right thing and act for tomorrow. I'm proud of our Alliant Energy team and thankful for all they do. 
From an ESG perspective, we made incredible progress on our goals and objectives. We ended 2020 with 42% less carbon emissions than our 2005 levels, well on our way to our goal of a 50% reduction by 2030. This result is largely driven by the completion of our major wind expansion, making us the third largest owner-operator of regulated wind in the U.S. It was also achieved by building our highly efficient West Riverside generating station. 
To further support our efforts to advance our clean energy future, we joined the low carbon resource initiative through the Electric Power Research Institute. This initiative is designed to identify, test and develop technologies to enable a low carbon future. The results of this important work will help guide our company and our industry as we look towards our aspirational goal of net 0 carbon dioxide emissions through the electricity we generate by 2050. 
2020 was another great year in advancing our clean energy blueprints, which serve as our guide to create a cleaner energy future for our customers and communities. Last fall, we advanced our Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint with our announcement to add approximately 400 megawatts of new solar energy by 2023. This follows our very successful 1 gigawatt wind energy expansion in Iowa, all delivered on time and on budget. 
When the 400 megawatts of planned new solar is combined with our 1,300 megawatts of own wind, our existing solar farms and purchase renewable resources, we're on a path to have more than 50% of Alliant Energy's Iowa generation to come from renewables by 2030. We also continue to advance battery storage in the state, with plans to add 100 megawatts of distributed energy resources in the next several years. The additional distributed energy resources follows the successful completion of battery storage systems near Marshalltown in Welman, Iowa, and a storage facility in Decora, Iowa, that includes a partnership with the United States Department of Energy and the Iowa Economic Development Authority. 
Turning to Wisconsin. Our clean energy blueprint helps advance the badger state to a clean energy future. Our plans to add at least 1,000 megawatts of new solar power is on schedule. Last spring, we announced our first phase of this effort, identifying 6 future solar sites totaling 675 megawatts. That's enough to power 175,000 homes. Later this spring, we plan to announce the second phase of our solar expansion, which will include 3 projects we purchased in the last 5 months as well as our self-developed sites. As we carefully plan the closure of our remaining coal powered units in Wisconsin, our plans will include ways to support our employees and our communities. 
Our clean energy blueprints are comprehensive and transparent and designed to follow our proven track record of a thoughtful energy transition. Our solar story in Wisconsin doesn't stop there. We recently announced a community solar project in Fonda La County, where a portion of the energy generated from the 1 megawatt site will be donated to have a tap for humanity to reduce electric bills of residents. We're also partnering with Dane County on a 17-megawatt solar development, which will help bring the county to 100% renewable offset to the electricity consumed at their own facilities. And we're partnering with the city of Sheboygan to install a 1 megawatt solar facility in the Sheboygan business center. 
As we advance our clean energy blueprints, we'll continue to seek solutions that serve our customers' growing demand for sustainable solutions to help build stronger communities. We also remain focused on our continued investments in our connected energy network across Iowa and Wisconsin. By advancing the deployment of an advanced distribution management system, a fiber optic network, and expanding the use of smart energy systems and automated metering. In addition, our customer-focused investments in the energy grid will result in more of our electric lines placed underground. A major part of our efforts to improve grid resiliency, energy efficiency and reliability. 
Speaking of reliability, I'm proud of the efforts by our team during the extended polar vortex that gripped much of the country these past 2 weeks. Our customer-focused investments are designed to ensure that we will continue to provide our customers with safe, reliable and affordable energy for decades to come. We remain committed to advancing our clean energy vision through this balanced approach. 
In summary, 2020 was an excellent year for our company, and we look forward to building on that momentum in 2021 as we focus on continuing our role as a leader in advancing renewable energy completing customer-focused investments on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors and living our values. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,703472173,2216986,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2021",2021-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2020 GAAP earnings of $2.47 per share compared to $2.33 per share in 2019. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings per share were up more than 7% year-over-year, driv",1436,"Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2020 GAAP earnings of $2.47 per share compared to $2.33 per share in 2019. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings per share were up more than 7% year-over-year, driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, partially offset by the higher depreciation and financing expenses from these rate base additions. 
As John noted earlier, our dedicated employees rose to the challenge in 2020 by reducing O&M expenses to offset the impact of lower sales caused by the pandemic and Derecho storm. These efforts allowed us to finish the year in the upper half of our earnings guidance range. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers on Slides 4 and 5. 
Our temperature normalized retail electric sales declined 2% in 2020 when compared to 2019, primarily driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the August Derecho storm in our Iowa service territory. While the pandemic related sales impacts were heaviest in the second quarter, sales recovered quickly and were roughly flat to 2019 levels in the second half of the year. The sales recovery we experience is a direct result of the strength and resiliency of the economies and the states we serve. 
Wisconsin unemployment rate is a 4% less than the U.S. unemployment rate, and the stage of experiencing population growth as neighboring states residents are moving to Wisconsin. And in Iowa, the economy has been recovering even faster with an unemployment rate that is second lowest in the country as well as strengthening grain prices due to increasing demand from foreign countries. 
Turning to our future year's earnings. We see a solid path to delivering our earnings guidance for 2021. And as we look further into the future, we believe our strong capital investment plan will allow us to continue to deliver solid returns for our shareowners, including an expected 5% to 7% annual EPS growth rate to at least 2024. The key drivers of the 6% growth in our 2021 EPS guidance over 2020 are related to investments in our core utility business, including our recently completed wind projects for Iowa and Wisconsin customers. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2021 and IPL's renewable energy rider approved with its test year 2020 rate review. 
Currently, renewables make up approximately 20% of our total rate base, which is one of the highest percentages of renewable rate base among all U.S. utilities. We expect renewables will make up an even larger portion of our rate base as we invest in solar projects for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers over the next 3 years. A walk from our 2020 non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings to the midpoint of our 2021 earnings guidance range is provided on Slide 6. 
The 2021 earnings guidance assumes a 1% growth in retail electric sales over 2020 levels. This forecast assumes continued economic improvement and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our employees have been working to add new customers and load to our system. One recent example of success is our new wholesale customer in Wisconsin, consolidated water power company. This new customer came online at the beginning of this year and brings up to 60 megawatts of new load to our system. Alliant Energy's strategy focused on providing affordable energy to our customers while continuing our decade-long track record of growing earnings 5% to 7%. 
As a reminder, we reached settlements in our Wisconsin jurisdiction to hold rates flat in 2021 by using excess deferred taxes and fuel savings to offset a higher revenue requirement due to growth in rate base. This settlement enables us to earn a return on our investments we've made on behalf of our Wisconsin customers without increasing their base rates in 2021. 
In our Iowa jurisdiction, we expect to manage our business to allow us to stay out of rate cases for the next couple of years. This has been made possible through collaboration with our regulators and stakeholders in Iowa, on key items such as deferring costs associated with the August Derecho storm and the addition of the renewable energy driver. Renewable any driver will allow IPL to recover costs of the incremental rate base from our recently completed 1 gigawatt of wind, while also passing on significant incremental production tax credits and fuel cost savings to our customers. 
Additionally, our Iowa customers began seeing savings in the fall of 2020 as a result of our decision to terminate the purchase power agreement related to the Duane Arnold energy center 5 years early. I feel is forecasting to get recovery of and return on the buyout payment associated with this termination through a rider over the next 5 years, while customers benefit from tens of millions of dollars in energy savings each year. 
Slide 7 has been provided to assist in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 20% for 2021. The primary drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional production tax credits from the new wind projects that were placed in service throughout 2020 and the return of excess deferred taxes for federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins. 
Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. Turning to our financing plans. In November 2020, we accelerated a $200 million debt offering at our Alliant Energy Finance subsidiary, originally planned for 2021 to capture historically low interest rates. As a result, our 2021 financing plan is currently limited to 1 long-term debt issuance of up to $300 million in our Wisconsin utility. And the only common equity activity we are expecting in 2021 is approximately $25 million to be issued ratably during the year through our share in or direct plan. 
And lastly, some key regulatory developments in our key states. In Iowa, current Chair, Geri Huser, was recently appointed for additional 6 year term. And Josh Burns was recently appointed as a new member to the Iowa Utilities Board. We welcome board member Burns, and congratulate Geri Huser or her additional term. 
And in Wisconsin, the PSCW recently issued its final written order approving WPL's rate stabilization plan in December. The PSCW also issued a procedural schedule for our first solar certificate authority filing in late 2020, as shown on Slide 8. The docket for our solar CA filing is proceeding as expected, including the constructive public hearing held yesterday. We anticipate a decision on this first 675 megawatts of solar from the PSCW in April. Our 2021 key regulatory initiatives are listed on Slide 9. In the first half of this year, we expect to make an advanced remaking principles filing in Iowa for our planned 400 megawatts of solar generation for IPL. As a reminder, the key benefit to the advanced free making principles process in Iowa is a certainty it provides for the afferent transfer on these assets. 
In our 3 most recent advanced remaking filings, we were authorizing an 11% ROE for new generation assets. The ROE decided with each filing are fixed for the life of the assets. In Wisconsin, we expect to file our second certificate of authority request in the first half of this year, for the remainder of our announced solar generation at WPL. In addition, we expect to file a retail electric and gas rate review in Wisconsin in the second quarter for either 1, 2 or 3 years, beginning in 2022. We are thankful for the privilege to work in 2 states that are well-known for constructive regulatory outcomes and plan to continue our long-standing practice of working collaboratively to stakeholders towards constructive regulatory outcomes on these key regulatory initiatives in 2021. 
As we conclude another successful year, I'm excited about our flexible and thoughtful strategy of Alliant Energy. As John described earlier, we are a leading utility in renewal energy and environmental stewardship, and we look forward to maintaining that leadership status into the future. We will continue to deliver on a clean energy vision that will best serve our customers and shareowners as well as our environment. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. I look forward to meeting with many of you virtually in the coming months. As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials available on our website. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And we're currently targeting sustainable reductions of approximately 3% to 5% on an annual basis off of a 2019 baseline. We that our affordability. Our employees did an excellent job in 2020. And we captured some additional savings largely to offset the COVID and Derecho impacts. And I'd say it's a pretty even mix between sustainable savings and temporary savings that we saw in 2020. Some of the temporary items with things like travel, health care and insurance. But we also saw some great progress with sustainable savings largely I put it probably into 3 main areas. One is technology. We continue to advance technology, including things like the AMI that we put into service in early 2020 that really helped reduce some of the meter reading costs. Saw great improvements with automation and self-service to helped us reduce some of our call center costs. And then we also obviously have some enhanced connectivity through the pandemic here that we think we'll be able to leverage into the future. So that's 1 category. Second is probably on the generation side, really we see some pretty strong efficiency gains. And so more existing coal plants that allows us to operate with your employees. And then lastly, on the distribution side, as we talked about with our strategy, we continue to focus on trying to move from overhead to underground, and that's really going to position us well there if you were O&M costs in the future. So back to your specific question, I'd say it's probably a pretty even mix between the 2. But think of it on a longer-term basis, we're really trying to achieve maybe a 3% to 5% reduction in sustainable savings over the long term."

So I don't think it will be anything that will be controversial with the case itself. And then as John indicated, the other key component is the solar projects that will be advancing. So we'll have more insight to that when we get the decision back from the PSCW in that April time frame for inclusion of that most likely, like we talked about a second quarter filing. So but the third and probably the last piece of that rate filing is willing to address the anticipated recovery for the Edgewater facility that were retired by the end of 2022.

But there's no question there'll be some additional need. We don't have the details of the size and timing of that quite yet. That's probably an area for later in the year. But we do have an opportunity for additional renewables likely to be coupled with storage. We've been working on our development plans, anticipating that we'll need additional renewables. So as you know, we've got lot of development efforts in place for what we did in wind and Iowa and then our solar efforts plus storage in Wisconsin. So we're going to lean heavily on a lot of the great work we've done over the last few years on that. As it relates to securitization, there is a provision that currently exists. And I'm sure there's going to be discussion about the securitization and the potential for that to be another tool, if you will, in the process. But as we think about it, Julian, it's really about having the right balance between investor outcomes and customer cost and affordability. Our path forward with our tax equity, we see our solar projects to be perhaps the lowest, if not among the very lowest cost projects that you're going to see on solar and renewables. So we feel very good about having that right balance with our tax equity. Certainly, the process going forward, I'm sure all of that will be in discussion relative to what's the best path for that balance between customers and share owners. So we expect reasonable outcomes, we have for many, many years. We're very confident in the filings we put forward, but certainly, more work to come on that.

So there's some various other benefits that we've been accumulating over time, whether it was from excess earnings above our alternate returns.

But if you think about the clean energy future, it's really got to make sure that we think about how that fits transmission, generation, and it really doesn't happen unless the distribution grid is also moving that way. So we've got, as I noted, opportunities for resiliency to put our systems for more overhead underground. We're starting that out, and there's opportunity to grow that area as well as having a stronger distribution grid at a voltage that allows for more distributed energy resources to connect. So that's also an opportunity for us. It's in our current, but there's certainly an opportunity as we get more efficient for that those 2 areas to grow. So we do see the distribution areas having plenty of growth potential for us.

And maybe just to add a couple more categories to the information John shared. We still have repowering opportunities on our insights that I'd say is probably more in the second half of this decade. And then we really don't have much of any storage built into our CapEx at this point. We do have some smaller, I would say, pilot programs that we're using, but there's also some further opportunities there. And then lastly is we have got a series of coal plants still in Iowa that we haven't announced the timing of any potential retirements. So if we think of that over the next 10 or 15 years, that will likely create some capacity needs for us that could provide some additional growth for us."

But as we're putting larger scale wind and solar out there, we also have development plans to look at adding larger scale storage to help with the front and back-end of how those units introduce into the market.

And as we look for areas that have higher growth, for some of those DER penetration. The cost per per unit and CapEx, I don't have those readily available, but that would refer back to our opportunities for additional distribution grid spend as we think about getting more and more efficient in that space.

I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation.  
Joining me on this call are John Larsen, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Robert Durian, Executive Vice President and CFO.  
Following prepared remarks by John and Robert, we will take time for questions from the investment community. We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's fourth quarter and year-end 2020 financial results and affirmed our 2021 earnings guidance. This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our website at alliantenergy.com.  
Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

It was also another successful year of growth and solid operations for Alliant Energy. We continue to consistently deliver on our purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities. I'm proud of what our team accomplished and how we delivered on our purpose. An year with many challenges from the ongoing global pandemic to racial injustice and a disruptive derecho windstorm.  
In the face of these challenges, we finished near the top of our original earnings guidance range with the 2020 consolidated earnings per share of $2.47. Our non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings grew more than 7% over 2019. This was the tenth year in a row of achieving our 5% to 7% growth objective. This consistent growth, solid execution and operational results showcases the resiliency and flexibility of our company.  
I'll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements from the year, then I'll turn it over to Robert, who will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes. I'd like to start by mentioning a few of our recognitions from 2020. I mentioned earlier the August derecho windstorm. I'm proud that our efforts to restore electricity to our customers was recognized by receiving the Edison Electric Institute's Emergency Response Award. Alliant Energy was also included in Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index, highlighting just 380 companies from around the world who are committed to supporting gender equality in the workplace. And we were recently named to Newsweek's Most Responsible Companies list, where we rank 12 overall for our social responsibility efforts. And to top it off, for the fourth year in a row, Alliant Energy has earned a perfect score in the Corporate Equality Index issued by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.  
As I reflect on these achievements, they each showcase how we live our values as we care for others, do the right thing and act for tomorrow. I'm proud of our Alliant Energy team and thankful for all they do.  
From an ESG perspective, we made incredible progress on our goals and objectives. We ended 2020 with 42% less carbon emissions than our 2005 levels, well on our way to our goal of a 50% reduction by 2030. This result is largely driven by the completion of our major wind expansion, making us the third largest owner-operator of regulated wind in the U.S. It was also achieved by building our highly efficient West Riverside generating station.  
To further support our efforts to advance a clean energy future, we joined the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative through the Electric Power Research Institute. This initiative is designed to identify, test and develop technologies to enable a low carbon future. The results of this important work will help guide our company and our industry as we look towards our aspirational goal of net 0 carbon dioxide emissions through the electricity we generate by 2050.  
2020 was another great year in advancing our clean energy blueprints, which serve as our guide to create a cleaner energy future for our customers and communities. Last fall, we advanced our Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint with our announcement to add approximately 400 megawatts of new solar energy by 2023. This follows our very successful 1 gigawatt wind energy expansion in Iowa, all delivered on time and on budget.  
When the 400 megawatts of planned new solar is combined with our 1,300 megawatts of own wind, our existing solar farms and purchased renewable resources, we're on a path to have more than 50% of Alliant Energy's Iowa generation to come from renewables by 2030. We also continue to advance battery storage in the state, with plans to add 100 megawatts of distributed energy resources in the next several years. The additional distributed energy resources follows the successful completion of battery storage systems near Marshalltown in Wellman, Iowa, and a storage facility in Decorah, Iowa, that includes a partnership with the United States Department of Energy and the Iowa Economic Development Authority.  
Turning to Wisconsin. Our clean energy blueprint helps advance the badger state to a clean energy future. Our plans to add at least 1,000 megawatts of new solar power is on schedule. Last spring, we announced our first phase of this effort, identifying 6 future solar sites totaling 675 megawatts. That's enough to power 175,000 homes. Later this spring, we plan to announce the second phase of our solar expansion, which will include 3 projects we purchased in the last 5 months as well as our self-developed sites. As we carefully plan the closure of our remaining coal powered units in Wisconsin, our plans will include ways to support our employees and our communities.  
Our clean energy blueprints are comprehensive and transparent and designed to follow our proven track record of a thoughtful energy transition. Our solar story in Wisconsin doesn't stop there. We recently announced a community solar project in Fond du Lac County, where a portion of the energy generated from the 1 megawatt site will be donated to have a tap for humanity to reduce electric bills of residents. We're also partnering with Dane County on a 17-megawatt solar development, which will help bring the county to 100% renewable offset to the electricity consumed at their own facilities. And we're partnering with the city of Sheboygan to install a 1 megawatt solar facility in the Sheboygan business center.  
As we advance our clean energy blueprints, we'll continue to seek solutions that serve our customers' growing demand for sustainable solutions to help build stronger communities. We also remain focused on our continued investments in our connected energy network across Iowa and Wisconsin. By advancing the deployment of an advanced distribution management system, a fiber optic network, and expanding the use of smart energy systems and automated metering. In addition, our customer-focused investments in the energy grid will result in more of our electric lines placed underground, a major part of our efforts to improve grid resiliency, energy efficiency and reliability.  
Speaking of reliability, I'm proud of the efforts by our team during the extended polar vortex that gripped much of the country these past 2 weeks. Our customer-focused investments are designed to ensure that we will continue to provide our customers with safe, reliable and affordable energy for decades to come. We remain committed to advancing our clean energy vision through this balanced approach.  
In summary, 2020 was an excellent year for our company, and we look forward to building on that momentum in 2021 as we focus on continuing our role as a leader in advancing renewable energy, completing customer-focused investments on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors and living our values.  
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,703472173,2217035,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2021",2021-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2020 GAAP earnings of $2.47 per share compared to $2.33 per share in 2019. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings per share were up more than 7% year-over-year, driv",1433,"Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2020 GAAP earnings of $2.47 per share compared to $2.33 per share in 2019. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings per share were up more than 7% year-over-year, driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, partially offset by the higher depreciation and financing expenses from these rate base additions.  
As John noted earlier, our dedicated employees rose to the challenge in 2020 by reducing O&M expenses to offset the impact of lower sales caused by the pandemic and Derecho storm. These efforts allowed us to finish the year in the upper half of our earnings guidance range. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers on Slides 4 and 5.  
Our temperature normalized retail electric sales declined 2% in 2020 when compared to 2019, primarily driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the August Derecho storm in our Iowa service territory. While the pandemic related sales impacts were heaviest in the second quarter, sales recovered quickly and were roughly flat to 2019 levels in the second half of the year. The sales recovery we experienced is a direct result of the strength and resiliency of the economies in the states we serve.  
Wisconsin's unemployment rate is 4% less than the U.S. unemployment rate, and the state is experiencing population growth as neighboring states residents are moving to Wisconsin. And in Iowa, the economy has been recovering even faster with an unemployment rate that is second lowest in the country as well as strengthening grain prices due to increasing demand from foreign countries.  
Turning to our future year's earnings. We see a solid path to delivering our earnings guidance for 2021. And as we look further into the future, we believe our strong capital investment plan will allow us to continue to deliver solid returns for our shareowners, including an expected 5% to 7% annual EPS growth rate to at least 2024. The key drivers of the 6% growth in our 2021 EPS guidance over 2020 are related to investments in our core utility business, including our recently completed wind projects for Iowa and Wisconsin customers. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2021 and IPL's Renewable Energy Rider approved with its test year 2020 rate review.  
Currently, renewables make up approximately 20% of our total rate base, which is one of the highest percentages of renewable rate base among all U.S. utilities. We expect renewables will make up an even larger portion of our rate base as we invest in solar projects for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers over the next 3 years. A walk from our 2020 non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings to the midpoint of our 2021 earnings guidance range is provided on Slide 6.  
The 2021 earnings guidance assumed a 1% growth in retail electric sales over 2020 levels. This forecast assumes continued economic improvement and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our employees have been working to add new customers and load to our system. One recent example of success is our new wholesale customer in Wisconsin, Consolidated Water Power Company. This new customer came online at the beginning of this year and brings up to 60 megawatts of new load to our system. Alliant Energy's strategy focused on providing affordable energy to our customers while continuing our decade-long track record of growing earnings 5% to 7%.  
As a reminder, we reached settlements in our Wisconsin jurisdiction to hold rates flat in 2021 by using excess deferred taxes and fuel savings to offset a higher revenue requirement due to growth in rate base. This settlement enables us to earn a return on our investments we've made on behalf of our Wisconsin customers without increasing their base rates in 2021.  
In our Iowa jurisdiction, we expect to manage our business to allow us to stay out of rate cases for the next couple of years. This has been made possible through collaboration with our regulators and stakeholders in Iowa, on key items such as deferring costs associated with the August Derecho storm and the addition of the Renewable Energy Rider. Renewable Energy Rider will allow IPL to recover costs of the incremental rate base from our recently completed 1 gigawatt of wind, while also passing on significant incremental production tax credits and fuel cost savings to our customers.  
Additionally, our Iowa customers began seeing savings in the fall of 2020 as a result of our decision to terminate the purchase power agreement related to the Duane Arnold Energy Center 5 years early. IPL forecasting to get recovery of and return on the buyout payment associated with this termination through a rider over the next 5 years, while customers benefit from tens of millions of dollars in energy savings each year.  
Slide 7 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 20% for 2021. The primary drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional production tax credits from the new wind projects that were placed in service throughout 2020 and the return of excess deferred taxes for federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins.  Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Turning to our financing plans. In November 2020, we accelerated a $200 million debt offering at our Alliant Energy Finance subsidiary, originally planned for 2021 to capture historically low interest rates. As a result, our 2021 financing plan is currently limited to 1 long-term debt issuance of up to $300 million in our Wisconsin utility. And the only common equity activity we are expecting in 2021 is approximately $25 million to be issued ratably during the year through our Shareowner Direct Plan.  
And lastly, some key regulatory developments in our key states. In Iowa, current Chair, Geri Huser, was recently appointed for additional 6 year term. And Josh Byrnes was recently appointed as a new member to the Iowa Utilities Board. We welcome board member Byrnes, and congratulate Geri Huser on her additional term.  
And in Wisconsin, the PSCW recently issued its final written order approving WPL's rate stabilization plan in December. The PSCW also issued a procedural schedule for our first solar certificate authority filing in late 2020, as shown on Slide 8. The docket for our solar CA filing is proceeding as expected, including the constructive public hearing held yesterday. We anticipate a decision on this first 675 megawatts of solar from the PSCW in April. Our 2021 key regulatory initiatives are listed on Slide 9. In the first half of this year, we expect to make an advanced rate-making principles filing in Iowa for our planned 400 megawatts of solar generation for IPL. As a reminder, the key benefit for the advanced rate-making principles process in Iowa is the certainty it provides for the authorized returns of earnings on these assets.  
In our 3 most recent advanced rate-making filings, we were authorizing an 11% ROE for new generation assets. The ROE decided with each filing are fixed for the life of the assets. In Wisconsin, we expect to file our second certificate of authority request in the first half of this year, for the remainder of our announced solar generation at WPL. In addition, we expect to file a retail electric and gas rate review in Wisconsin in the second quarter for either 1, 2 or 3 years, beginning in 2022. We are thankful for the privilege to work in 2 states that are well-known for constructive regulatory outcomes and plan to continue our long-standing practice of working collaboratively with stakeholders towards constructive regulatory outcomes on these key regulatory initiatives in 2021.  
As we conclude another successful year, I'm excited about our flexible and thoughtful strategy of Alliant Energy. As John described earlier, we are a leading utility in renewable energy and environmental stewardship, and we look forward to maintaining that leadership status into the future. We will continue to deliver on a clean energy vision that will best serve our customers and shareowners as well as our environment. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company. I look forward to meeting with many of you virtually in the coming months. As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials available on our website.  
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

First off, it's a key component to providing affordable energy for our customers. So we're very focused on that. And we're currently targeting sustainable O&M reductions of approximately 3% to 5% on an annual basis off of a 2019 baseline. We need to support that just for affordability. Our employees did an excellent job in 2020 as we captured some additional savings largely to offset the COVID and the Derecho impacts. And I'd say it's a pretty even mix between sustainable savings and temporary savings that we saw in 2020. Some of the temporary items with things like travel, health care and insurance. But we also saw some great progress with sustainable savings, largely I'll put it probably into 3 main areas. One is technology. We continue to advance technology, including things like the AMI that we put into service in early 2020 that really helped reduce some of the meter reading costs. Saw great improvements with automation and self-service that helped us reduce some of our call center costs. And then we also obviously had some enhanced connectivity through the pandemic here that we think we'll be able to leverage into the future. So that's one category. 
Second is probably on the generation side, where we received some pretty strong efficiency gains with some more existing coal plants that allows us to operate with fewer employees. And then lastly, on the distribution side, as we talked about with our strategy, we continue to focus on trying to move from overhead to underground, and that's really going to position us well there with fewer O&M costs in the future. So back to your specific question, I'd say it's probably a pretty even mix between the 2. But think of it on a longer-term basis, we're really trying to achieve maybe a 3% to 5% reduction in sustainable savings over the long term."

So I don't think it will be anything that will be controversial with the case itself. 
And then as John indicated, the other key component is the solar projects that we will be advancing. So we'll have more insight to that when we get the decision back from the PSCW in that April time frame for inclusion of that most likely, like we talked about in second quarter filing. So -- but the third and probably the last piece of that rate filing is willing to address the anticipated recovery for the Edgewater coal facility that will be retired by the end of 2022.

So that's -- clearly with the announced retirement, we look at the flexibility that we have in our CapEx plan. So we do have some opportunity as we think about between distribution and generation. But there's no question there'll be some additional need. We don't have the details of the size and timing of that quite yet. That's probably an area for later in the year. But we do have an opportunity for additional renewables likely to be coupled with storage. 
We've been working on our development plans, anticipating that we'll need additional renewables. So as you know, we've got lot of development efforts in place for what we did on wind in Iowa and then our solar efforts plus storage in Wisconsin. So we're going to lean heavily on a lot of the great work we've done over the last few years on that. 
As it relates to securitization, there is a provision that currently exists. And I'm sure there's going to be discussion about the securitization and the potential for that to be another tool, if you will, in the process. But as we think about it, Julien, it's really about having the right balance between investor outcomes and customer cost and affordability. Our path forward with our tax equity, we see our solar projects to be perhaps the lowest, if not among the very lowest cost projects that you're going to see on solar and renewables. So we feel very good about having that right balance with our tax equity. 
Certainly, the process going forward, I'm sure all of that will be in discussion relative to what's the best path for that balance between customers and share owners. So we expect reasonable outcomes, we have for many, many years. We're very confident in the filings we put forward, but certainly, more work to come on that.

One more notable one was some liquidated damages that we received as part of the West Riverside facility. I think that is roughly $35 million to $40 million. So there are some various other benefits that we've been accumulating over time, whether it was from excess earnings above our authorized returns. So we have a sharing mechanism for it, but think of it, is probably in the neighborhood of somewhere between probably $60 million and $80 million of total regulatory liabilities that are available to us to be able to use over the next several years to help offset some of the rate implications."

We don't expect any refunds or any potential changes in the future. And it's largely going to be based on where our earned ROEs came out for the end of 2020. We actually under-earned in 2020 below the 10% authorized level. So we don't expect any impacts of that.

But if you think about the clean energy future, it's really got to make sure that we think about how that fits transmission, generation, and it really doesn't happen unless the distribution grid is also moving that way. So we've got, as I noted, opportunities for resiliency to put our systems for more overhead to underground. We're starting that out, and there's opportunity to grow that area as well as having a stronger distribution grid at a voltage that allows for more distributed energy resources to connect. So that's also an opportunity for us. It's in our current, but there's certainly an opportunity as we get more efficient for that, those 2 areas to grow. So we do see the distribution areas having plenty of growth potential for us.

So we think we can manage the business appropriately to achieve our 5% to 7% EPS targets without having much of an impact on customer bills over the long run. And maybe just to add a couple more categories to the information John shared. We still have repowering opportunities on our sites that I'd say is probably more in the second half of this decade. And then we really don't have much of any storage built into our CapEx plans at this point. We do have some smaller, I would say, pilot programs that we're using, but there's also some further opportunities there. And then lastly is we have got a series of coal plants still in Iowa that we haven't announced the timing of any potential retirements. So if we think of that over the next 10 or 15 years, that will likely create some capacity needs for us that could provide some additional growth for us."

We do have development work going on right now to size that up. And so that -- think of that as grid deferral. But as we're putting larger scale wind and solar out there, we also have development plans to look at adding larger scale storage to help with the front and back-end of how those units introduce into the market. So completely agree. We're making sure that it always got to make sense to our customers.

And as we look for areas that have higher growth, for some of those DER penetration. The cost per unit and CapEx, I don't have those readily available, but that would refer back to our opportunities for additional distribution grid spend as we think about getting more and more efficient in that space.

It was also another successful year of growth and solid operations for Alliant Energy. We continue to consistently deliver on our purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities. I'm proud of what our team accomplished and how we delivered on our purpose. An year with many challenges from the ongoing global pandemic to racial injustice and a destructive derecho windstorm.  
In the face of these challenges, we finished near the top of our original earnings guidance range with the 2020 consolidated earnings per share of $2.47. Our non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings grew more than 7% over 2019. This was the tenth year in a row of achieving our 5% to 7% growth objective. This consistent growth, solid execution and operational results showcases the resiliency and flexibility of our company.  
I'll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements from the year, then I'll turn it over to Robert, who will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes. I'd like to start by mentioning a few of our recognitions from 2020. I mentioned earlier the August derecho windstorm. I'm proud that our efforts to restore electricity to our customers was recognized by receiving the Edison Electric Institute's Emergency Response Award. Alliant Energy was also included in Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index, highlighting just 380 companies from around the world who are committed to supporting gender equality in the workplace. And we were recently named to Newsweek's Most Responsible Companies list, where we rank 12th overall for our social responsibility efforts. And to top it off, for the fourth year in a row, Alliant Energy has earned a perfect score in the Corporate Equality Index issued by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.  
As I reflect on these achievements, they each showcase how we live our values as we care for others, do the right thing and act for tomorrow. I'm proud of our Alliant Energy team and thankful for all they do.  
From an ESG perspective, we made incredible progress on our goals and objectives. We ended 2020 with 42% less carbon emissions than our 2005 levels, well on our way to our goal of a 50% reduction by 2030. This result is largely driven by the completion of our major wind expansion, making us the third largest owner-operator of regulated wind in the U.S. It was also achieved by building our highly efficient West Riverside generating station.  
To further support our efforts to advance a clean energy future, we joined the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative through the Electric Power Research Institute. This initiative is designed to identify, test and develop technologies to enable a low carbon future. The results of this important work will help guide our company and our industry as we work towards our aspirational goal of net zero carbon dioxide emissions through the electricity we generate by 2050.  
2020 was another great year in advancing our clean energy blueprints, which serve as our guide to create a cleaner energy future for our customers and communities. Last fall, we advanced our Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint with our announcement to add approximately 400 megawatts of new solar energy by 2023. This follows our very successful 1 gigawatt wind energy expansion in Iowa, all delivered on time and on budget.  
When the 400 megawatts of planned new solar is combined with our 1,300 megawatts of own wind, our existing solar farms and purchased renewable resources, we're on a path to have more than 50% of Alliant Energy's Iowa generation to come from renewables by 2030. We also continue to advance battery storage in the state, with plans to add 100 megawatts of distributed energy resources in the next several years. The additional distributed energy resources follows the successful completion of battery storage systems near Marshalltown in Wellman, Iowa, and a storage facility in Decorah, Iowa, that includes a partnership with the United States Department of Energy and the Iowa Economic Development Authority.  
Turning to Wisconsin. Our clean energy blueprint helps advance the Badger State to a clean energy future. Our plans to add at least 1,000 megawatts of new solar power is on schedule. Last spring, we announced our first phase of this effort, identifying 6 future solar sites totaling 675 megawatts. That's enough to power 175,000 homes. Later this spring, we plan to announce the second phase of our solar expansion, which will include 3 projects we purchased in the last 5 months as well as our self-developed sites. As we carefully plan the closure of our remaining coal powered units in Wisconsin, our plans will include ways to support our employees and our communities.  
Our clean energy blueprints are comprehensive and transparent and designed to follow our proven track record of a thoughtful energy transition. Our solar story in Wisconsin doesn't stop there. We recently announced a community solar project in Fond du Lac County, where a portion of the energy generated from the 1 megawatt site will be donated to Habitat for Humanity to reduce electric bills of residents. We're also partnering with Dane County on a 17-megawatt solar development, which will help bring the county to 100% renewable offset to the electricity consumed at their own facilities. And we're partnering with the city of Sheboygan to install a 1 megawatt solar facility in the Sheboygan business center.  
As we advance our clean energy blueprints, we'll continue to seek solutions that serve our customers' growing demand for sustainable solutions to help build stronger communities. We also remain focused on our continued investments in our connected energy network across Iowa and Wisconsin. By advancing the deployment of an advanced distribution management system, a fiber optic network, and expanding the use of smart energy systems and automated metering. In addition, our customer-focused investments in the energy grid will result in more of our electric lines placed underground, a major part of our efforts to improve grid resiliency, energy efficiency and reliability.  
Speaking of reliability, I'm proud of the efforts by our team during the extended polar vortex that gripped much of the country these past 2 weeks. Our customer-focused investments are designed to ensure that we will continue to provide our customers with safe, reliable and affordable energy for decades to come. We remain committed to advancing our clean energy vision through this balanced approach.  
In summary, 2020 was an excellent year for our company, and we look forward to building on that momentum in 2021 as we focus on continuing our role as a leader in advancing renewable energy, completing customer-focused investments on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors and living our values.  
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,703472173,2262566,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2021",2021-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2020 GAAP earnings of $2.47 per share compared to $2.33 per share in 2019. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings per share were up more than 7% year-over-year, driv",1438,"Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2020 GAAP earnings of $2.47 per share compared to $2.33 per share in 2019. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings per share were up more than 7% year-over-year, driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, partially offset by the higher depreciation and financing expenses from these rate base additions.  
As John noted earlier, our dedicated employees rose to the challenge in 2020 by reducing O&M expenses to offset the impact of lower sales caused by the pandemic and derecho storm. These efforts allowed us to finish the year in the upper half of our earnings guidance range. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers on Slides 4 and 5.  
Our temperature normalized retail electric sales declined 2% in 2020 when compared to 2019, primarily driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the August derecho storm in our Iowa service territory. While the pandemic related sales impacts were heaviest in the second quarter, sales recovered quickly and were roughly flat to 2019 levels in the second half of the year. The sales recovery we experienced is a direct result of the strength and resiliency of the economies in the states we serve.  
Wisconsin's unemployment rate is a full percent less than the U.S. unemployment rate, and the state is experiencing population growth as neighboring states residents are moving to Wisconsin. And in Iowa, the economy has been recovering even faster with an unemployment rate that is second lowest in the country as well as strengthening grain prices due to increasing demand from foreign countries.  
Turning to our future year's earnings. We see a solid path to delivering our earnings guidance for 2021. And as we look further into the future, we believe our strong capital investment plan will allow us to continue to deliver solid returns for our shareowners, including an expected 5% to 7% annual EPS growth rate through at least 2024. The key drivers of the 6% growth in our 2021 EPS guidance over 2020 are related to investments in our core utility business, including our recently completed wind projects for Iowa and Wisconsin customers. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2021 and IPL's Renewable Energy Rider approved with its test year 2020 rate review.  
Currently, renewables make up approximately 20% of our total rate base, which is one of the highest percentages of renewable rate base among all U.S. utilities. We expect renewables will make up an even larger portion of our rate base as we invest in solar projects for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers over the next 3 years. A walk from our 2020 non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings to the midpoint of our 2021 earnings guidance range is provided on Slide 6.  
The 2021 earnings guidance assumed a 1% growth in retail electric sales over 2020 levels. This forecast assumes continued economic improvement and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our employees have been working to add new customers and load to our system. One recent example of success is our new wholesale customer in Wisconsin, Consolidated Water Power Company. This new customer came online at the beginning of this year and brings up to 60 megawatts of new load to our system. Alliant Energy's strategy focused on providing affordable energy to our customers while continuing our decade-long track record of growing earnings 5% to 7%.  
As a reminder, we reached settlements in our Wisconsin jurisdiction to hold rates flat in 2021 by using excess deferred taxes and fuel savings to offset a higher revenue requirement due to growth in rate base. This settlement enables us to earn a return on our investments we've made on behalf of our Wisconsin customers without increasing their base rates in 2021.  
In our Iowa jurisdiction, we expect to manage our business to allow us to stay out of rate cases for the next couple of years. This has been made possible through collaboration with our regulators and stakeholders in Iowa, on key items such as deferring costs associated with the August derecho storm and the addition of the Renewable Energy Rider. The Renewable Energy Rider will allow IPL to recover costs of the incremental rate base from our recently completed 1 gigawatt of wind, while also passing on significant incremental production tax credits and fuel cost savings to our customers.  
Additionally, our Iowa customers began seeing savings in the fall of 2020 as a result of our decision to terminate the purchase power agreement related to the Duane Arnold Energy Center 5 years early. IPL is forecasting to get recovery of and return on the buyout payment associated with this termination through a rider over the next 5 years, while customers benefit from tens of millions of dollars in energy savings each year.  
Slide 7 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 20% for 2021. The primary drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional production tax credits from the new wind projects that were placed in service throughout 2020 and the return of excess deferred taxes for federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins.  Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Turning to our financing plans. In November 2020, we accelerated a $200 million debt offering at our Alliant Energy Finance subsidiary, originally planned for 2021 to capture historically low interest rates. As a result, our 2021 financing plan is currently limited to 1 long-term debt issuance of up to $300 million in our Wisconsin utility. And the only common equity activity we are expecting in 2021 is approximately $25 million to be issued ratably during the year through our Shareowner Direct Plan.  
And lastly, some key regulatory developments in our two states. In Iowa, current Chair, Geri Huser, was recently appointed for additional 6 year term. And Josh Byrnes was recently appointed as a new member to the Iowa Utilities Board. We welcome board member Byrnes, and congratulate Geri Huser on her additional term.  
And in Wisconsin, the PSCW recently issued its final written order approving WPL's rate stabilization plan in December. The PSCW also issued a procedural schedule for our first solar certificate authority filing in late 2020, as shown on Slide 8. The docket for our solar CA filing is proceeding as expected, including the constructive public hearing held yesterday. We anticipate a decision on this first 675 megawatts of solar from the PSCW in April. Our 2021 key regulatory initiatives are listed on Slide 9. In the first half of this year, we expect to make an advanced rate-making principles filing in Iowa for our planned 400 megawatts of solar generation for IPL. As a reminder, the key benefit for the advanced rate-making principles process in Iowa is the certainty it provides for the authorized returns of earnings on these assets.  
In our 3 most recent advanced rate-making filings, we were authorizing an 11% ROE for new generation assets. The ROE decided with each filing are fixed for the life of the assets. In Wisconsin, we expect to file our second certificate of authority request in the first half of this year, for the remainder of our announced solar generation at WPL. In addition, we expect to file a retail electric and gas rate review in Wisconsin in the second quarter for either 1, 2 or 3 years, beginning in 2022. We are thankful for the privilege to work in 2 states that are well-known for constructive regulatory outcomes and plan to continue our long-standing practice of working collaboratively with stakeholders towards constructive regulatory outcomes on these key regulatory initiatives in 2021.  
As we conclude another successful year, I'm excited about our flexible and thoughtful strategy of Alliant Energy. As John described earlier, we are a leading utility in renewable energy and environmental stewardship, and we look forward to maintaining that leadership status into the future. We will continue to deliver on a clean energy vision that will best serve our customers and shareowners as well as our environment. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company, and I look forward to meeting with many of you virtually in the coming months. As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials available on our website.  
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

First off, it's a key component to providing affordable energy for our customers. So we're very focused on that. And we're currently targeting sustainable O&M reductions of approximately 3% to 5% on an annual basis off of a 2019 baseline. We need to support that just for affordability. Our employees did an excellent job in 2020 as we captured some additional savings largely to offset the COVID and the derecho impacts. And I'd say it's a pretty even mix between sustainable savings and temporary savings that we saw in 2020. Some of the temporary items were things like travel, health care and insurance. But we also saw some great progress with sustainable savings, largely I'll put it probably into 3 main areas. One is technology. We continue to advance technology, including things like the AMI that we put into service in early 2020 that really helped reduce some of the meter reading costs. Saw great improvements with automation and self-service that helped us reduce some of our call center costs. And then we also obviously had some enhanced connectivity through the pandemic here that we think we'll be able to leverage into the future. So that's one category. 
Second is probably on the generation side, where we'll be seeing some pretty strong efficiency gains at some more existing coal plants that allows us to operate with fewer employees. And then lastly, on the distribution side, as we talked about with our strategy, we continue to focus on trying to move from overhead to underground, and that's really going to position us well there with fewer O&M costs in the future. So back to your specific question, I'd say it's probably a pretty even mix between the 2. But think of it on a longer-term basis, we're really trying to achieve maybe a 3% to 5% reduction in sustainable savings over the long term."

And those are pretty well set in stone. So we don't have a lot of flexibility with those and fairly straightforward. So I don't think it will be anything that will be controversial with the case itself. 
And then as John indicated, the other key component is the solar projects that we will be advancing. So we'll have more insight to that when we get the decision back from the PSCW in that April time frame for inclusion of that most likely, like we talked about in second quarter filing. So -- but the third and probably the last piece of that rate filing is willing to address the anticipated recovery for the Edgewater coal facility that will be retired by the end of 2022. So we think this is the appropriate time for us to come in for a rate filing, and we'll give you some more indication of the 1, 2 or 3 years, most likely when we get to the next earnings call in May."

So that's -- clearly with the announced retirement, we look at the flexibility that we have in our CapEx plan. So we do have some opportunity as we think about between distribution and generation. But there's no question there'll be some additional need. We don't have the details of the size and timing of that quite yet. That's probably an area for later in the year. But we do have an opportunity for additional renewables likely to be coupled with storage. 
We've been working on our development plans, anticipating that we'll need additional renewables. So as you know, we've got lot of development efforts in place for what we did on wind in Iowa and then our solar efforts plus storage in Wisconsin. So we're going to lean heavily on a lot of the great work we've done over the last few years on that. 
As it relates to securitization, there is a provision that currently exists. And I'm sure there's going to be discussion about the securitization and the potential for that to be another tool, if you will, in the process. But as we think about it, Julien, it's really about having the right balance between investor outcomes and customer cost and affordability. Our path forward with our tax equity, we see our solar projects to be perhaps the lowest, if not among the very lowest cost projects that you're going to see on solar and renewables. So we feel very good about having that right balance with our tax equity. 
Certainly, the process going forward, I'm sure all of that will be in discussion relative to what's the best path for that balance between customers and share owners. So we expect reasonable outcomes, we have for many, many years. We're very confident in the filings we put forward, but certainly, more work to come on that.

We do have some other, I'll call them regulatory liabilities that were actually approved as part of the rate stabilization plan that we received approval from the WPL jurisdiction in December. One more notable one was some liquidated damages that we received as part of the West Riverside facility. Think of that as roughly $35 million to $40 million. So there are some various other benefits that we've been accumulating over time, whether it was from excess earnings above our authorized returns that we have a sharing mechanism for.  But think of it, it's probably in the neighborhood of somewhere between probably $60 million and $80 million of total regulatory liabilities that are available to us to be able to use over the next several years to help offset some of the rate implications."

But if you think about the clean energy future, it's really got to make sure that we think about how that fits transmission, generation, and it really doesn't happen unless the distribution grid is also moving that way. So we've got, as I noted, opportunities for resiliency to put our systems for more overhead to underground. We're starting that out, and there's opportunity to grow that area as well as having a stronger distribution grid at a voltage that allows for more distributed energy resources to connect. So that's also an opportunity for us. It's in our current, but there's certainly an opportunity as we get more efficient for that, those 2 areas to grow. So we do see the distribution areas having plenty of growth potential for us. But as we do, in many cases, we start kind of walk before we run and make sure that we get very efficient as we deploy capital.

We're not expecting any new common equity for the foreseeable future. So we think we can manage the business appropriately to achieve our 5% to 7% EPS targets without having much of an impact on customer bills over the long run. And maybe just to add a couple more categories to the information John shared. We still have repowering opportunities on our wind sites that I'd say is probably more in the second half of this decade. And then we really don't have much of any storage built into our CapEx plans at this point. We do have some smaller, I would say, pilot programs that we're using, but there's also some further opportunities there. And then lastly is we have got a series of coal plants still in Iowa that we haven't announced the timing of any potential retirements. So if we think of that over the next 10 or 15 years, that will likely create some capacity needs for us that could provide some additional growth for us."

We do have development work going on right now to size that up. And so that -- think of that as grid deferral. But as we're putting larger scale wind and solar out there, we also have development plans to look at adding larger scale storage to help with the front and back-end of how those units introduce into the market. So completely agree. We're making sure that it -- it's always got to make sense to our customers.

I think we're roughly up. I'll use numbers around 5% of our system, but think of it as that's something you want to have condensed to certain areas where you convert smartly in certain areas as you're doing other work, it makes sense. And as we look for areas that have higher growth, for some of those DER penetration. The cost per unit and CapEx, I don't have those readily available, but that would refer back to our opportunities for additional distribution grid spend as we think about getting more and more efficient in that space.

So when you think about costs, including stuff, example, underground, you're probably talking a couple of hundred thousand dollars a mile, at least depending on whether it's in town or in the country. So a lot of opportunity for us. We don't have specific quantification of the exact dollars that you'll see in the future, but that's really part of the functional plan that we have.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our solid first quarter results were as expected, continuing our long track record of delivering value for our customers, communities and [indiscernible] during the call, Robert will share more details on our results. But let me jump to the headline. 
We are reaffirming our consolidated 2021 earnings guidance of $2.50 to $2.64. We remain committed to delivering on our 5% to 7% [indiscernible] target and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio. 
At Alliant Energy, we take pride in our long track record of delivering consistent growth for our investors. And what makes this even more meaningful is in how we have delivered that growth, by living our values to care for others and act for tomorrow. We continuously raise the bar when it comes to our environmental, social and governance commitments. We're proud to be recognized for our efforts. We're a AA rated company by MSCI, ranked in the top quartile for global utilities by Sustainalytics, and achieved Envision Platinum Certification on major generation projects. 
With our customers in mind, we continue to accelerate our purpose-driven clean energy transition. We call it the clean energy Blueprint and recently highlighted our progress towards our sustainability goals during Earth Week. We ended the year 2020 with 42% less carbon emissions than 2005 levels, nearly 70% reduction in water compared to our 2005 levels, and nearly 70% of our coal generation is either retired or planned for retirement by 2024. We'll be sharing more of our progress and highlighting new initiatives with the release of our updated corporate responsibility report this summer. 
Equally important to our environmental efforts, are the commitments to our employees, customers and the communities we serve. We know that when we embrace the diversity of our employees and continue to build upon the strong culture, we create a sense of belonging and inclusion 
[Audio Gap] 
 
in the first quarter of 2020, we recognized $0.06 of favorability due to the timing of income taxes, which arose from the large amount of wind generation placed in service in 2020. We had additional tax favorability in the third quarter of 2020 before a full reversal in the fourth quarter of last year. You can expect to see the inverse of that in '21 with unfavorable variances related to the timing of income tax expense for the sum of the first 3 quarters, followed by a favorable reversal [ fourth ] quarter of this year. 
We continue to see improving economic conditions in our service territories, with more businesses returning to normal operations following the lifting of many of the COVID-19 mitigation restrictions and increasing levels of economic development activities in both states. Of note, our temperature normalized retail electric sales in the first quarter of 2021 were better-than-expected and represented an approximate 1% increase over the first quarter of 2020, which was largely pre pandemic for our service territories. 
We are also very encouraged by the fact that the number of our customers in arrears or on payment plans today is lower than it was before the pandemic began. This is a testament to the great work of our employees, connecting customers having difficulty making payments with available federal and state resources. 
I'm also very proud of donations by our company and our customers to the Hometown Care Energy Fund, which provides confidential financial support for Alliant Energy customers faced with financial challenges. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, it was necessary for us to accelerate our cost transformation efforts to reduce -- to offset reduced sales, while holding rates flat for our customers last year. Thanks to our employees' continued focus on cost reductions, we achieved another quarter of solid operating expense reductions in the first quarter of 2021. Over the longer term, we are targeting to reduce O&M by approximately 3% to 5% per year for the next several years off of 2019 levels. We will achieve these savings through efforts that fall under 3 pillars all of which are enabled by our customer-focused capital investments. The first and most immediately impactful are investments in generation transformation. This includes our expansion of wind and solar energy, and the sunsetting of coal generation in our portfolio. The second pillar involves investments in electric distribution, particularly in the areas of undergrounding and converting larger portions of our system to 25 kv which will enable lower maintenance expense. The third and final pillar include investments in technology across our company, which will enhance productivity and efficiency through automation, customer self-service and telework. 
Slide 4 of our supplemental slides has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 19% for 2021. The primary drivers of the lower tax rate are the additional tax credits from new wind projects placed into service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral.
Turning to our financing plans. We continue to maintain strong balance sheets that are 2 utilities and the parent company with minimal financing needs in 2021. As a reminder, our financing plans for 2021 include up to $300 million of long-term debt to be issued by our Wisconsin Utility and no material debt maturities this year. 
In addition, the only new common equity forecast to be issued this year is approximately $25 million through the shareholder direct plan. 
We've included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 5. Starting in our Wisconsin jurisdiction, as John mentioned earlier this week, we filed a notice of intent to settle with key intervening parties in Wisconsin and WPL's next electric and gas rate review filing. The agreement in principle resulted from collaboration and alignment with the settling parties on total revenue requirements for 2022 and 2023. The agreement would enable key financial terms impacting such revenue requirements, including maintaining a 10% return on equity, achieving an effective regulatory equity layer of 54% and utilizing an innovative recovery mechanism for WPL's retiring Edgewater coal plant. WPL is working with the stakeholders to finalize the terms of the settlement, which will be subject to review and approval by the PSCW. 
We anticipate a decision from the PSCW on this filing later this year. More details on the terms of the agreement in principle can be found on Slide 6. Additionally in Wisconsin, we received verbal approval from the PSCW in April for our certificate of authority filing for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. This verbal approval is another example of our continued track record of constructive State Regulatory decisions, approving renewable projects that support our transition to cleaner sources of energy for our customers. 
In the discussion of this decision, all 3 commissioners were complementary of the resource planning process and stakeholder engagement that we conducted as part of our Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. The commission commended our modeling efforts in this process and the consideration paid to affordability and stability of rates, reliability of service and our path to sustainability for our customers. We'd expect a written decision in the coming weeks. 
We also filed our second certificate authority application for an additional 414 megawatts of Wisconsin Solar in March. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW on this filing in the first half of next year. 
Moving to Iowa. We expect to file for advanced remaking principles in the third quarter for a proposed approximately 400 megawatts of solar, included in our Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint. The advance remaking principles process in Iowa includes approval of the return on equity for the life of the asset, depreciation rates and a cost cap for the project. We anticipate a decision from the Iowa Utilities Board on this filing by the middle of next year. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with many of you virtually over the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Probably the best way I've heard it described, Andrew, is I think of it like a mortgage. So it's got a consistent recovery level over the kind of the remaining asset recovery period of roughly 23 years, I think it is once it hits retirement. But just like a mortgage, we would recover a lower principal balance and a higher interest rate earlier in those years. And then the flip or reverse of that with a higher principal recovery and a lower interest later in the years. 
So as part of that process, what it ends up doing is we recover less in the earlier years, and that effectively then converts to 9.8% that we agreed upon to calculate the revenue requirement, down to a 9.2% effective ROE. So I still think that's a very effective tool for us. What it does help us to do is lower customer costs in the earlier years, what gives us that rate stability over the remaining life of that asset. And so we felt like that was a good balance between shareowner interest and customer interest, and we're very pleased with the outcome there."

Some modest impacts on our EPS and then actually some positive cash flows, given our NOL position and tax credit carryforwards. But we think we can manage through that and some of the latest thinking I've read about things that, that might be in maybe 24%, 25%. So that would even probably be less impact to our customers, which would be good from our perspective. 
The minimum tax, we actually have seen more recently where they may set a threshold related to that and not really apply that to any companies that have less than, I think, $2 billion of annual income, and that would exclude us or exempt us for that. So we would be comfortable with that and obviously supportive of that. So we wouldn't be put into that position. 
As John indicated, we're actually more interested in the widen plan right now because we see some opportunities for us to utilize some of those benefits to support a lot of the future capital growth that we may be pursuing things like Direct Pay and potentially refundability of tax credits. We think would give us a good set of cash flows that we can reinvest in future renewables going forward. The stand-alone credit for storage. We think that would really improve the economics of those opportunities for us in the future and could build out some further capital opportunities for us. 
And then we're also watching the potential to be able to use PTCs instead of ITCs for solar projects that could make what we think are very favorable economic turns for our current solar even better. So pretty excited about some of those opportunities on the widened plan and what they might do to our capital investment opportunities going forward here."

[Audio Gap]
in the call, Robert will share more details on our results. But let me jump to the headline. 
We are reaffirming our consolidated 2021 earnings guidance of $2.50 to $2.64. We remain committed to delivering on our 5% to 7% growth target and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio.
At Alliant Energy, we take pride in our long track record of delivering consistent growth for our investors. And what makes this even more meaningful is in how we have delivered that growth, by living our values to care for others and act for tomorrow. We continuously raise the bar when it comes to our environmental, social and governance commitments. We're proud to be recognized for our efforts. We're a AA rated company by MSCI, ranked in the top quartile for global utilities by Sustainalytics, and achieved Envision Platinum Certification on major generation projects. 
With our customers in mind, we continue to accelerate our purpose-driven clean energy transition. We call it the clean energy Blueprint and recently highlighted our progress towards our sustainability goals during Earth Week. We ended the year 2020 with 42% less carbon emissions than 2005 levels, nearly 70% reduction in water compared to our 2005 levels, and nearly 70% of our coal generation is either retired or planned for retirement by 2024. We'll be sharing more of our progress and highlighting new initiatives with the release of our updated corporate responsibility report this summer. 
Equally important to our environmental efforts, are the commitments to our employees, customers and the communities we serve. We know that when we embrace the diversity of our employees and continue to build upon the strong culture, we create a sense of belonging and inclusion at least to great things for our customers. I'm very proud of the recognition of our efforts in this space by organizations such as the human rights campaign, and to be included in Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index.
[Audio Gap]
including the Citizen's Utility Board, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and the Sierra Club. The key terms with stakeholders continues to manage customer costs and enables our thoughtful transition to a clean energy future, adding certainty and flexibility for our business. 
Just prior to this development, we reached another successful milestone, announcing our plans to add 414 megawatts of solar in Wisconsin, rounding our previously announced plan to accelerate our clean energy transition by adding nearly 1,100 megawatts of solar in the Badger state. Upon completion of this planned expansion, Alliant Energy will own and operate the most solar energy in the state of Wisconsin. These investments are another part of our clean energy Blueprint, developed through an extensive and transparent planning process and utilizing our industry best project execution. 
In our communities, we are partnering with businesses and community leaders to develop hometown solar projects. These local projects benefit communities through lease payments, supplying clean energy to the local energy grid, empowering homes and businesses. Some of our newest projects include a 1 megawatt community solar project located in Perry, Iowa; a customer-hosted project in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, located on the rooftop of IO County's new law enforcement center; and solar generation near our West Riverside Energy Center near Beloit, Wisconsin. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize our amazing employees. They came together to serve customers during winter storm Uri. As a result of their efforts, coupled with smart investments we've made to ensure reliability, resiliency and the proactive planning by our energy markets team, we not only weathered the storm, our teams continued providing safe, reliable and affordable energy during this extreme weather event. And our customers will not see the significant increases experienced by others around the country. 
In summary, 2021 is off to a solid start for our company, and we look forward to building on that momentum throughout the year as we focus on continuing our role as a leader in advancing renewable energy, completing customer-focused investments on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors and living our values as we fulfill our purpose of serving customers and building stronger communities. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.68 per share compared to $0.70 per share in 2020. Similar to last year, the first quarter's earnings are more than 25% of our 2021 earnings target and rep",1197,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.68 per share compared to $0.70 per share in 2020. Similar to last year, the first quarter's earnings are more than 25% of our 2021 earnings target and represent a strong start to the year. Our earnings were slightly lower on a year-over-year basis, largely due to the timing of tax expense impacts, which will reverse later this year. For the full year, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $2.50 per share to $2.64 per share, an increase at the midpoint of more than 6% over 2020 temperature normalized earnings per share of $2.42. 
To assist you in modeling our quarterly earnings this year, I wanted to provide some additional context to one of the larger variances shown in our earnings release. As summary recall, in the first quarter of 2020, we recognized $0.06 of favorability due to the timing of income taxes, which arose from the large amount of wind generation placed in service in 2020. We had additional tax favorability in the third quarter of 2020 before a full reversal in the fourth quarter of last year. You can expect to see the inverse of that in '21 with unfavorable variances related to the timing of income tax expense for the sum of the first 3 quarters, followed by a favorable reversal in the fourth quarter of this year. 
We continue to see improving economic conditions in our service territories, with more businesses returning to normal operations following the lifting of many of the COVID-19 mitigation restrictions and increasing levels of economic development activities in both states. Of note, our temperature normalized retail electric sales in the first quarter of 2021 were better-than-expected and represented an approximate 1% increase over the first quarter of 2020, which was largely pre pandemic for our service territories. 
We are also very encouraged by the fact that the number of our customers in arrears or on payment plans today is lower than it was before the pandemic began. This is a testament to the great work of our employees, connecting customers having difficulty making payments with available federal and state resources. 
I'm also very proud of donations by our company and our customers to the Hometown Care Energy Fund, which provides confidential financial support for Alliant Energy customers faced with financial challenges. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, it was necessary for us to accelerate our cost transformation efforts to reduce -- to offset reduced sales, while holding rates flat for our customers last year. Thanks to our employees' continued focus on cost reductions, we achieved another quarter of solid operating expense reductions in the first quarter of 2021. Over the longer term, we are targeting to reduce O&M by approximately 3% to 5% per year for the next several years off of 2019 levels. We will achieve these savings through efforts that fall under 3 pillars all of which are enabled by our customer-focused capital investments. The first and most immediately impactful are investments in generation transformation. This includes our expansion of wind and solar energy, and the sunsetting of coal generation in our portfolio. The second pillar involves investments in electric distribution, particularly in the areas of undergrounding and converting larger portions of our system to 25 kv which will enable lower maintenance expense. The third and final pillar include investments in technology across our company, which will enhance productivity and efficiency through automation, customer self-service and telework. 
Slide 4 of our supplemental slides has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 19% for 2021. The primary drivers of the lower tax rate are the additional tax credits from new wind projects placed into service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral.
Turning to our financing plans. We continue to maintain strong balance sheets that are 2 utilities and the parent company with minimal financing needs in 2021. As a reminder, our financing plans for 2021 include up to $300 million of long-term debt to be issued by our Wisconsin Utility and no material debt maturities this year. 
In addition, the only new common equity forecast to be issued this year is approximately $25 million through the shareholder direct plan. 
We've included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 5. Starting in our Wisconsin jurisdiction, as John mentioned earlier this week, we filed a notice of intent to settle with key intervening parties in Wisconsin and WPL's next electric and gas rate review filing. The agreement in principle resulted from collaboration and alignment with the settling parties on total revenue requirements for 2022 and 2023. The agreement would enable key financial terms impacting such revenue requirements, including maintaining a 10% return on equity, achieving an effective regulatory equity layer of 54% and utilizing an innovative recovery mechanism for WPL's retiring Edgewater coal plant. WPL is working with the stakeholders to finalize the terms of the settlement, which will be subject to review and approval by the PSCW. 
We anticipate a decision from the PSCW on this filing later this year. More details on the terms of the agreement in principle can be found on Slide 6. Additionally in Wisconsin, we received verbal approval from the PSCW in April for our certificate of authority filing for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. This verbal approval is another example of our continued track record of constructive State Regulatory decisions, approving renewable projects that support our transition to cleaner sources of energy for our customers. 
In the discussion of this decision, all 3 commissioners were complementary of the resource planning process and stakeholder engagement that we conducted as part of our Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. The commission commended our modeling efforts in this process and the consideration paid to affordability and stability of rates, reliability of service and our path to sustainability for our customers. We'd expect a written decision in the coming weeks. 
We also filed our second certificate authority application for an additional 414 megawatts of Wisconsin Solar in March. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW on this filing in the first half of next year. 
Moving to Iowa. We expect to file for advanced remaking principles in the third quarter for a proposed approximately 400 megawatts of solar, included in our Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint. The advance remaking principles process in Iowa includes approval of the return on equity for the life of the asset, depreciation rates and a cost cap for the project. We anticipate a decision from the Iowa Utilities Board on this filing by the middle of next year. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with many of you virtually over the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Probably the best way I've heard it described, Andrew, is I think of it like a mortgage. So it's got a consistent recovery level over the kind of the remaining asset recovery period of roughly 23 years, I think it is once it hits retirement. But just like a mortgage, we would recover a lower principal balance and a higher interest rate earlier in those years. And then the flip or reverse of that with a higher principal recovery and a lower interest later in the years. 
So as part of that process, what it ends up doing is we recover less in the earlier years, and that effectively then converts to 9.8% that we agreed upon to calculate the revenue requirement, down to a 9.2% effective ROE. So I still think that's a very effective tool for us. What it does help us to do is lower customer costs in the earlier years, what gives us that rate stability over the remaining life of that asset. And so we felt like that was a good balance between shareowner interest and customer interest, and we're very pleased with the outcome there."

For the Biden plan, too, the provisions we're watching closely right now is obviously the corporate tax rate going from 21% to something potentially higher. That -- we've modeled that out at the -- think with the top end of a reasonable range is at 28%. And we think that would equate to roughly about a 2% increase in our customer bills. Some modest impacts on our EPS and then actually some positive cash flows, given our NOL position and tax credit carryforwards. But we think we can manage through that and some of the latest thinking I've read about things that, that might be in maybe 24%, 25%. So that would even probably be less impact to our customers, which would be good from our perspective. 
The minimum tax, we actually have seen more recently where they may set a threshold related to that and not really apply that to any companies that have less than, I think, $2 billion of annual income, and that would exclude us or exempt us for that. So we would be comfortable with that and obviously supportive of that. So we wouldn't be put into that position. 
As John indicated, we're actually more interested in the widen plan right now because we see some opportunities for us to utilize some of those benefits to support a lot of the future capital growth that we may be pursuing things like Direct Pay and potentially refundability of tax credits. We think would give us a good set of cash flows that we can reinvest in future renewables going forward. The stand-alone credit for storage. We think that would really improve the economics of those opportunities for us in the future and could build out some further capital opportunities for us. 
And then we're also watching the potential to be able to use PTCs instead of ITCs for solar projects that could make what we think are very favorable economic turns for our current solar even better. So pretty excited about some of those opportunities on the widened plan and what they might do to our capital investment opportunities going forward here."

I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation.
Joining me on this call are John Larsen, Chair, President and CEO; and Robert Durian, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following prepared remarks by John and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community.
We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's first quarter 2021 financial results. This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.
Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and our 10-Q, which will be available on our website.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to John."

Our solid first quarter results were as expected, continuing our long track record of delivering value for our customers, communities and investors. We do this by innovating new approaches and delivering important energy solutions for our customers and the communities we proudly serve. Our purpose-driven strategy is thoughtful, flexible and well executed. The results speak for themselves. Later in the call Robert will share more details on our results. But let me jump to the headline.
We are reaffirming our consolidated 2021 earnings guidance of $2.50 to $2.64. We remain committed to delivering on our 5% to 7% growth target and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio.
At Alliant Energy, we take pride in our long track record of delivering consistent growth for our investors. And what makes this even more meaningful is in how we have delivered that growth, by living our values, to care for others and act for tomorrow. We continuously raise the bar when it comes to our environmental, social and governance commitments. We're proud to be recognized for our efforts. We're a AA rated company by MSCI, ranked in the top quartile for global utilities by Sustainalytics, and achieved Envision Platinum certification on major generation projects.
With our customers in mind, we continue to accelerate our purpose-driven clean energy transition. We call it the clean energy blueprint and recently highlighted our progress towards our sustainability goals during Earth Week. We ended the year 2020 with 42% less carbon emissions than our 2005 levels, nearly 70% reduction in water compared to our 2005 levels, and nearly 70% of our coal generation is either retired or planned for retirement by 2024. We'll be sharing more of our progress and highlighting new initiatives with the release of our updated corporate responsibility report this summer.
Equally important to our environmental efforts, are the commitments to our employees, customers and the communities we serve. We know that when we embrace the diversity of our employees and continue to build upon the strong culture, we create a sense of belonging and inclusion, that leads to great things for our customers. I'm very proud of the recognition of our efforts in this space by organization such as the human rights campaign and to be included in Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index.
In 2020, we were named one of America's most responsible companies by Newsweek, ranking 12 on the list for our social responsibility efforts. Turning to our recent updates, this week we announced an intent to enter into a settlement agreement for our rate filing in Wisconsin.
We continued our open and transparent practices into our rate review process and are very pleased to have reached the settlement in principle with several stakeholder organizations, including the Citizens Utility Board, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and the Sierra Club. The key terms with stakeholders continues to manage customer costs and enables our thoughtful transition to a clean energy future, adding certainty and flexibility for our business.
Just prior to this development, we reached another successful milestone, announcing our plans to add 414 megawatts of solar in Wisconsin, rounding our previously announced plan to accelerate our clean energy transition by adding nearly 1,100 megawatts of solar in the Badger state. Upon completion of this planned expansion, Alliant Energy will own and operate the most solar energy in the state of Wisconsin. These investments are another part of our clean energy blueprint, developed through an extensive and transparent planning process and utilizing our industry best project execution.
In our communities, we are partnering with businesses and community leaders to develop hometown solar projects. These local projects benefit communities through lease payments, supplying clean energy to the local energy grid, empowering homes and businesses. Some of our newest projects include a 1-megawatt community solar project located in Perry, Iowa; a customer-hosted project in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, located on the rooftop of IO County's new law enforcement center; and solar generation near our West Riverside Energy Center near Beloit, Wisconsin. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize our amazing employees. They came together to serve customers during Winter Storm Uri. As a result of their efforts, coupled with smart investments we've made to ensure reliability, resiliency and the proactive planning by our energy markets team, we not only weathered the storm, our teams continued providing safe, reliable and affordable energy during this extreme weather event. And our customers will not see the significant increases experienced by others around the country.
In summary, 2021 is off to a solid start for our company, and we look forward to building on that momentum throughout the year as we focus on continuing our role as a leader in advancing renewable energy, completing customer-focused investments on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors and living our values as we fulfill our purpose of serving customers and building stronger communities.
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.68 per share compared to $0.70 per share in 2020. Similar to last year, the first quarter's earnings are more than 25% of our 2021 earnings target and rep",1197,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.68 per share compared to $0.70 per share in 2020. Similar to last year, the first quarter's earnings are more than 25% of our 2021 earnings target and represent a strong start to the year. Our earnings were slightly lower on a year-over-year basis, largely due to the timing of tax expense impacts, which will reverse later this year. For the full year, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $2.50 per share to $2.64 per share, an increase at the midpoint of more than 6% over 2020 temperature-normalized earnings per share of $2.42.
To assist you in modeling our quarterly earnings this year, I wanted to provide some additional context to one of the larger variances shown in our earnings release.
As some may recall, in the first quarter of 2020, we recognized $0.06 of favorability due to the timing of income taxes, which arose from the large amount of wind generation placed in service in 2020. We had additional tax favorability in the third quarter of 2020 before a full reversal in the fourth quarter of last year. You can expect to see the inverse of that in 2021, with unfavorable variances related to the timing of income tax expense for the sum of the first 3 quarters, followed by a favorable reversal in the fourth quarter of this year.
We continue to see improving economic conditions in our service territories, with more businesses returning to normal operations following the lifting of many of the COVID-19 mitigation restrictions and increasing levels of economic development activities in both states. Of note, our temperature-normalized retail electric sales in the first quarter of 2021 were better than expected and represented an approximate 1% increase over the first quarter of 2020, which was largely pre-pandemic for our service territories.
We are also very encouraged by the fact that the number of our customers in arrears or on payment plans today is lower than it was before the pandemic began. This is a testament to the great work of our employees, connecting customers having difficulty making payments with available federal and state resources.
I'm also very proud of donations by our company and our customers to the Hometown Care Energy Fund, which provides confidential financial support for Alliant Energy customers faced with financial challenges.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, it was necessary for us to accelerate our cost transformation efforts to reduce -- to offset reduced sales, while holding rates flat for our customers last year. Thanks to our employees' continued focus on cost reductions, we achieved another quarter of solid operating expense reductions in the first quarter of 2021. Over the longer term, we are targeting to reduce O&M by approximately 3% to 5% per year for the next several years off of 2019 levels.
We will achieve these savings through efforts that fall under 3 pillars, all of which are enabled by our customer-focused capital investments. The first and most immediately impactful are investments in generation transformation. This includes our expansion of wind and solar energy, and the sunsetting of coal generation in our portfolio. The second pillar involves investments in electric distribution, particularly in the areas of undergrounding and converting larger portions of our system to 25 kv, which will enable lower maintenance expense. The third and final pillar include investments in technology across our company, which will enhance productivity and efficiency through automation, customer self-service and telework.
Slide 4 of our supplemental slides has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 19% for 2021. The primary drivers of the lower tax rate are the additional tax credits from new wind projects placed into service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral.
Turning to our financing plans. We continue to maintain strong balance sheets at our 2 utilities and the parent company with minimal financing needs in 2021. As a reminder, our financing plans for 2021 include up to $300 million of long-term debt to be issued by our Wisconsin utility and no material debt maturities this year.
In addition, the only new common equity forecast to be issued this year is approximately $25 million through the shareholder direct plan.
We've included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 5. Starting in our Wisconsin jurisdiction, as John mentioned earlier this week, we filed a notice of intent to settle with key intervening parties in Wisconsin and WPL's next electric and gas rate review filing. The agreement in principle resulted from collaboration and alignment with the settling parties on total revenue requirements for 2022 and 2023. The agreement would enable key financial terms impacting such revenue requirements, including maintaining a 10% return on equity, achieving an effective regulatory equity layer of 54% and utilizing an innovative recovery mechanism for WPL's retiring Edgewater coal plant. WPL is working with the stakeholders to finalize the terms of the settlement, which will be subject to review and approval by the PSCW.
We anticipate a decision from the PSCW on this filing later this year. More details on the terms of the agreement in principle can be found on Slide 6. Additionally in Wisconsin, we received verbal approval from the PSCW in April for our certificate of authority filing for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. This verbal approval is another example of our continued track record of constructive State Regulatory decisions, approving renewable projects that support our transition to cleaner sources of energy for our customers.
In the discussion of this decision, all 3 commissioners were complementary of the resource planning process and stakeholder engagement that we conducted as part of our Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. The commission commended our modeling efforts in this process and the consideration paid to affordability and stability of rates, reliability of service and our path to sustainability for our customers. We'd expect a written decision in the coming weeks.
We also filed our second certificate authority application for an additional 414 megawatts of Wisconsin Solar in March. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW on this filing in the first half of next year.
Moving to Iowa. We expect to file for advanced remaking principles in the third quarter for a proposed approximately 400 megawatts of solar, included in our Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint. The advance remaking principles process in Iowa includes approval of the return on equity for the life of the asset, depreciation rates and a cost cap for the project. We anticipate a decision from the Iowa Utilities Board on this filing by the middle of next year.
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with many of you virtually over the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Probably the best way I've heard it described, Andrew, is think of it like a mortgage. So it's got a consistent recovery level over the kind of the remaining asset recovery period of roughly 23 years, I think it is once it hits retirement. But just like a mortgage, we would recover a lower principal balance and a higher interest rate earlier in those years. And then the flip or reverse of that with a higher principal recovery and a lower interest later in the years.
So as part of that process, what it ends up doing is we recover less in the earlier years, and that effectively then converts to 9.8% that we agreed upon to calculate the revenue requirement down to a 9.2% effective ROE. So I still think that's a very effective tool for us. What it does help us to do is lower customer costs in the earlier years, but gives us that rate stability over the remaining life of that asset.

For the Biden plan, too, the provisions we're watching closely right now is obviously the corporate tax rate going from 21% to something potentially higher, that we've modeled that out at, I think, with the top end of a reasonable range is at 28%. And we think that would equate to roughly about a 2% increase in our customer bills. Some modest impacts on our EPS and then actually some positive cash flows, given our NOL position and tax credit carryforwards. But we think we can manage through that and some of the latest thinking I've read about things that, that might be in maybe 24%, 25%. So that would even probably be less impact to our customers, which would be good from our perspective.
The minimum tax, we actually have seen more recently where they may set a threshold related to that and not really apply that to any companies that have less than, I think, $2 billion of annual income, and that would exclude us or exempt us for that. So we would be comfortable with that and obviously, supportive of that. So we wouldn't be put into that position.
As John indicated, we're actually more interested in the widened plan right now because we see some opportunities for us to utilize some of those benefits to support a lot of the future capital growth that we may be pursuing, things like Direct Pay and potentially refundability of tax credits, we think would give us a good set of cash flows that we can reinvest in future renewables going forward. The stand-alone credit for storage. We think that would really improve the economics of those opportunities for us in the future and could build out some further capital opportunities for us.
And then we're also watching the potential to be able to use PTCs instead of ITCs for solar projects that could make, what we think are, very favorable economic turns for our current solar even better. So pretty excited about some of those opportunities on the widened plan and what they might do to our capital investment opportunities going forward here."

We completed another solid quarter with strong operational and financial results. I'll share with you the highlights from the quarter and then turn it over to Robert to recap key regulatory, customer and financial results.
I'll start with a focus on our strong ESG story. We recently issued our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report. This year's update showcases many examples of our environmental stewardship, governance and our long-standing efforts to address the important social needs of the communities we proudly serve. I'll start with the end in mind as no clean energy story is complete without results.
First off, in 2020, we achieved a 42% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to 2005 levels with a clear path toward our goal of 50% reduction by 2030. We also reduced water usage by 66% in 2020, well on our way to a 75% reduction by 2030. And we've already met or exceeded our ambitious NOx, SOx and mercury emission goals. Looking forward, our aspiration is to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity we generate by 2050.
We've been reducing our carbon footprint for many years, transitioning from older and less efficient coal units to low-cost and efficient generation resources like wind, natural gas and solar. These resources continue to be low-cost options in our service territory, making them a smart choice to serve our customers well into the future. We're building on our successful wind energy expansion that includes our excellent track record of project execution as we turn toward expanding our solar energy profile. A balanced generation profile of efficient natural gas, wind, solar and battery storage will serve as the backbone for delivering safe, reliable, affordable and resilient energy to our customers.
We recently announced that our first 675 megawatts of new solar in Wisconsin is advancing to the construction phase after receiving approval from the Public Service Commission. Robert will share more details on these projects as well as our efforts to expand our solar energy footprint in Iowa a bit later in the call.
You've heard us talk about our Clean Energy Blueprint, designed to guide us toward a clean energy future. Our blueprint is comprehensive, going beyond generation to also ensure a clean, efficient and resilient energy grid. We're adding smart technologies to our grid, transitioning our electric lines from overhead to underground and expanding the use of energy storage. Our blueprint is designed to ensure resiliency and reliability of our grid, reduce customer costs and allow for more distributed renewable generation on our grid.
For example, we recently were joined by Iowa's Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg along with several local and state leaders and our partners at the ribbon-cutting event for our latest battery storage project in Decorah, Iowa. We're very excited to continue expanding battery storage solutions. Not only do these projects have a future on our system as dispatchable load, but they can also serve to enable distributed energy resources and support the resiliency of our distribution system.
Speaking of resiliency, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the derecho that devastated our Iowa service territory, I'm reminded of the resiliency of our customers and employees as we recovered from the largest storm in our company's history. It's one of the reasons I'm also excited about our commitment to plant 1 million trees, representing the customers we're so privileged to serve. As these trees grow, they'll capture CO2 out of the atmosphere and help rebuild the tree canopy lost in the storm across so many Iowa communities.
I mentioned earlier our focus on ESG. One of our newest social efforts is investing in the Energy Impact Partners' Elevate Future Fund, which aims to create a more diverse founder community within the broader energy transition. The fund will be focused on investing in companies founded or run by diverse leaders that are driving innovation and advancing the low-carbon economy, including supply decarbonization, electrification and technology-enabled infrastructure. The Elevate team will form partnerships with technology accelerators and universities, including historically Black colleges to nurture talent, promote infrastructure and support systems to retain talent from underrepresented groups.
We're excited about the promising opportunities this partnership creates for inclusiveness, locally and nationally. And we appreciate the opportunities to support innovative ways to build a more diverse and inclusive workforce that advances our collective efforts for creating a carbon-free future.
Before I turn the call over to Robert, I want to share that the accomplishments that I highlighted today are the direct results of the efforts of our talented employees who work each and every day to deliver on our purpose: to serve customers and build stronger communities. Their efforts over the past year are nothing short of amazing, and I want to take the opportunity today to thank them for all that they do.
Thank you for your continued interest in Alliant Energy. I'll turn the call over to Robert."
312949,1674280592,2367159,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2021",2021-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.57 per share compared to $0.54 per share in 2020. Our utility earnings increased year-over-year driven by higher margins from increasing rate base and wa",996,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.57 per share compared to $0.54 per share in 2020. Our utility earnings increased year-over-year driven by higher margins from increasing rate base and warmer temperatures. These increases in earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction from rate base additions in 2020.
With a very solid first half of the year now in the books, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.64 per share. And as a result of favorable margins from temperature impacts year-to-date as well as our continued success in managing costs, we are currently trending towards the upper half of our guidance range.
Contributing to the higher margins was a higher rate base at our Iowa utility related to the successful completion of our 1,000-megawatt wind expansion program in 2020, which has resulted in lower fuel costs and increased tax credits for our Iowa customers. Additionally, our Iowa utility began recovering earlier this year, a return of and a return on the $110 million payment made to NextEra to terminate the Purchase Power Agreement with the Duane Arnold nuclear facility 5 years early. Customers in Iowa began benefiting from lower energy costs related to this transaction last fall.
In Wisconsin, higher margins are attributable to the rate stabilization plan that was approved last year. Based with the unexpected challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we work collaboratively with our stakeholders to keep rates flat for customers in 2021. This approach is benefiting both our customers as well as our shareowners as we began recovery of previously approved projects, such as our Kossuth Wind Farm and the Western Wisconsin pipeline, which we offset with excess deferred income tax benefits and fuel savings.
The second quarter continued the trend of improving economic conditions as our service territories return to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity. Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales in the second quarter were up 4% versus the second quarter last year. This increase was largely from strength in commercial and industrial sales. These changes in sales are a positive sign of economic recovery and resulted in a positive impact to margin.
As economic conditions have improved, we've also seen an uptick in economic development in our service territory. Two noteworthy successes so far this year are the announcements of new facilities for Simmons Pet Food in our Iowa jurisdiction and Spray Tech in our Wisconsin jurisdiction. These 2 new customers are bringing new jobs into communities in our service territories in addition to new load for Alliant Energy.
Many of you joined us a few weeks ago at our ESG investor event. I hope you took away from our comments how passionate we are about our leadership position in the transition to cleaner energy and other important aspects of our ESG performance.
One key area of the ESG story is our commitment to focus on customer affordability. That begins with the efforts and innovations of our outstanding employees. Two such innovations include our planned tax equity partnerships for solar generation and the levelized cost recovery mechanism for our retiring Edgewater coal plant in Wisconsin. Both of these were brought to us through the research and hard work of our employees who are consistently looking for new and unique ways to keep customer costs low.
Let me spend a moment on our corporate tax rate, which are provided on Slide 4 of our supplemental slides. We estimate our full year 2021 effective tax rate will be negative 17%, which is primarily the result of production tax credits we earned from our expansion of wind generation and the excess deferred tax benefits from the 2017 federal tax reform, which we continue to return to our customers. Both of these items support affordable rates for our customers. And please note that these items are largely earnings-neutral as they lower both revenues and income tax expense.
Our financing plans for 2021 remain unchanged. We plan to issue up to $300 million of long-term debt for our Wisconsin utility later this year. And we're also on track to issue approximately $25 million of common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan in 2021.
Moving to our key regulatory initiatives. We are pleased that our strong collaboration with stakeholders resulted in a settlement agreement in the second quarter for the 2022 and 2023 revenue requirements in our Wisconsin rate review. The agreement includes maintaining 10% return on equity, achieving an effective regulatory equity layer of 54%, and utilizing an innovative recovery mechanism for WPL's retiring Edgewater coal plant. The settlement is now subject to review and approval by the PSCW, and we anticipate a decision on this filing later this year. More details on the terms of the settlement agreement can be found on Slide 6.
As John mentioned earlier, we received written approval from the PSCW in June for 675 megawatts of new solar generation in Wisconsin. This is a significant milestone in our clean energy transition and another example of our long track record of achieving constructive regulatory outcomes. We also filed our second Certificate of Authority application for an additional 414 megawatts of Wisconsin solar in March. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW on this filing in the first half of next year.
Later this quarter, we plan to file a request for advanced ratemaking principles for up to 400 megawatts of new solar projects in Iowa. The advanced ratemaking principles process in Iowa includes approval of the return on equity for the life of the asset, depreciation rates and cost caps for the projects.

We completed another solid quarter with strong operational and financial results. I'll share with you the highlights from the quarter and then turn it over to Robert to recap key regulatory, customer and financial results. 
I'll start with a focus on our strong ESG story. We recently issued our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report. This year's update showcases many examples of our environmental stewardship, governance and our long-standing efforts to address the important social needs of the communities we proudly serve. I'll start with the end in mind as no clean energy story is complete without results. 
First off, in 2020, we achieved a 42% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to 2005 levels with a clear path toward our goal of 50% reduction by 2030. We also reduced water usage by 66% in 2020, well on our way to a 75% reduction by 2030. And we've already met or exceeded our ambitious NOx, SOx and mercury emission goals. Looking forward, our aspiration is to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity we generate by 2050. 
We've been reducing our carbon footprint for many years, transitioning from older and less efficient coal units to low-cost and efficient generation resources like wind, natural gas and solar. These resources continue to be low-cost options in our service territory, making them a smart choice to serve our customers well into the future. We're building on our successful wind energy expansion that includes our excellent track record of project execution as we turn toward expanding our solar energy profile. A balanced generation profile of efficient natural gas, wind, solar and battery storage will serve as the backbone for delivering safe, reliable, affordable and resilient energy to our customers. 
We recently announced that our first 675 megawatts of new solar in Wisconsin is advancing to the construction phase after receiving approval from the Public Service Commission. Robert will share more details on these projects as well as our efforts to expand our solar energy footprint in Iowa a bit later in the call. 
You've heard us talk about our Clean Energy Blueprint, designed to guide us toward a clean energy future. Our blueprint is comprehensive, going beyond generation to also ensure a clean, efficient and resilient energy grid. We're adding smart technologies to our grid, transitioning our electric lines from overhead to underground and expanding the use of energy storage. Our blueprint is designed to ensure resiliency and reliability of our grid, reduce customer costs and allow for more distributed renewable generation on our grid. 
For example, we recently were joined by Iowa's Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg along with several local and state leaders and our partners at the ribbon-cutting event for our latest battery storage project in Decorah, Iowa. We're very excited to continue expanding battery storage solutions. Not only do these projects have a future on our system as dispatchable load, but they can also serve to enable distributed energy resources and support the resiliency of our distribution system. 
Speaking of resiliency, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the derecho that devastated our Iowa service territory, I'm reminded of the resiliency of our customers and employees as we recovered from the largest storm in our company's history. It's one of the reasons I'm also excited about our commitment to plant 1 million trees, representing the customers we're so privileged to serve. As these trees grow, they'll capture CO2 out of the atmosphere and help rebuild the tree canopy lost in the storm across so many Iowa communities. 
I mentioned earlier our focus on ESG. One of our newest social efforts is investing in the Energy Impact Partners' Elevate Future Fund, which aims to create a more diverse founder community within the broader energy transition. The fund will be focused on investing in companies founded or run by diverse leaders that are driving innovation and advancing the low-carbon economy, including supply decarbonization, electrification and technology-enabled infrastructure. The Elevate team will form partnerships with technology accelerators and universities, including historically black colleges to nurture talent, promote infrastructure and support systems to retain talent from underrepresented groups. 
We're excited about the promising opportunities this partnership creates for inclusiveness, locally and nationally. And we appreciate the opportunities to support innovative ways to build a more diverse and inclusive workforce that advances our collective efforts for creating a carbon-free future. 
Before I turn the call over to Robert, I want to share that the accomplishments that I highlighted today are the direct results of the efforts of our talented employees who work each and every day to deliver on our purpose: to serve customers and build stronger communities. Their efforts over the past year are nothing short of amazing, and I want to take the opportunity today to thank them for all that they do. 
Thank you for your continued interest in Alliant Energy. I'll turn the call over to Robert."
312949,1674280592,2367239,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2021",2021-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.57 per share compared to $0.54 per share in 2020. Our utility earnings increased year-over-year driven by higher margins from increasing rate base and wa",995,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.57 per share compared to $0.54 per share in 2020. Our utility earnings increased year-over-year driven by higher margins from increasing rate base and warmer temperatures. These increases in earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and lower allowance for funds used during construction from rate base additions in 2020. 
With a very solid first half of the year now in the books, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.64 per share. And as a result of favorable margins from temperature impacts year-to-date as well as our continued success in managing costs, we are currently trending towards the upper half of our guidance range. 
Contributing to the higher margins was a higher rate base at our Iowa utility related to the successful completion of our 1,000-megawatt wind expansion program in 2020, which has resulted in lower fuel costs and increased tax credits for our Iowa customers. Additionally, our Iowa utility began recovering earlier this year, a return of and a return on the $110 million payment made to NextEra to terminate the Purchase Power Agreement with the Duane Arnold nuclear facility 5 years early. Customers in Iowa began benefiting from lower energy costs related to this transaction last fall. 
In Wisconsin, higher margins are attributable to the rate stabilization plan that was approved last year. Based with the unexpected challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we work collaboratively with our stakeholders to keep rates flat for customers in 2021. This approach is benefiting both our customers as well as our shareowners as we began recovery of previously approved projects, such as our Kossuth Wind Farm and the Western Wisconsin pipeline, which we offset with excess deferred income tax benefits and fuel savings. 
The second quarter continued the trend of improving economic conditions as our service territories return to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity. Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales in the second quarter were up 4% versus the second quarter last year. This increase was largely from strength in commercial and industrial sales. These changes in sales are a positive sign of economic recovery and resulted in a positive impact to margin. 
As economic conditions have improved, we've also seen an uptick in economic development in our service territory. Two noteworthy successes so far this year are the announcements of new facilities for Simmons Pet Food in our Iowa jurisdiction and Spray-Tek in our Wisconsin jurisdiction. These two new customers are bringing new jobs into communities in our service territories in addition to new load for Alliant Energy. 
Many of you joined us a few weeks ago at our ESG investor event. I hope you took away from our comments how passionate we are about our leadership position in the transition to cleaner energy and other important aspects of our ESG performance. 
One key area of the ESG story is our commitment to focus on customer affordability. That begins with the efforts and innovations of our outstanding employees. Two such innovations include our planned tax equity partnerships for solar generation and the levelized cost recovery mechanism for our retiring Edgewater coal plant in Wisconsin. Both of these were brought to us through the research and hard work of our employees who are consistently looking for new and unique ways to keep customer costs low. 
Let me spend a moment on our corporate tax rate, which are provided on Slide 4 of our supplemental slides. We estimate our full year 2021 effective tax rate will be negative 17%, which is primarily the result of production tax credits we earned from our expansion of wind generation and the excess deferred tax benefits from the 2017 federal tax reform, which we continue to return to our customers. Both of these items support affordable rates for our customers. And please note that these items are largely earnings-neutral as they lower both revenues and income tax expense. 
Our financing plans for 2021 remain unchanged. We plan to issue up to $300 million of long-term debt for our Wisconsin utility later this year. And we're also on track to issue approximately $25 million of common equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan in 2021. 
Moving to our key regulatory initiatives. We are pleased that our strong collaboration with stakeholders resulted in a settlement agreement in the second quarter for the 2022 and 2023 revenue requirements in our Wisconsin rate review. The agreement includes maintaining 10% return on equity, achieving an effective regulatory equity layer of 54%, and utilizing an innovative recovery mechanism for WPL's retiring Edgewater coal plant. The settlement is now subject to review and approval by the PSCW, and we anticipate a decision on this filing later this year. More details on the terms of the settlement agreement can be found on Slide 6. 
As John mentioned earlier, we received written approval from the PSCW in June for 675 megawatts of new solar generation in Wisconsin. This is a significant milestone in our clean energy transition and another example of our long track record of achieving constructive regulatory outcomes. We also filed our second Certificate of Authority application for an additional 414 megawatts of Wisconsin solar in March. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW on this filing in the first half of next year. 
Later this quarter, we plan to file a request for advanced ratemaking principles for up to 400 megawatts of new solar projects in Iowa. The advanced ratemaking principles process in Iowa includes approval of the return on equity for the life of the asset, depreciation rates and cost caps for the projects. We anticipate a decision from the Iowa Utility Board on this filing by the middle of next year. 
Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Alliant Energy. We look forward to connecting with many of you over the coming months.

And thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the third quarter of 2021. 
To start us off, I'm pleased to share our narrowed and increased 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.61 to $2.67, which represents a forecasted 12th consecutive year of 5% or greater earnings growth. We are also announcing our 2022 earnings guidance range of $2.65 to $2.79 per share, marking yet another year of forecasted 5% to 7% growth. We understand the importance of delivering consistent returns for our investors and solid operations for our customers. And in keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend to $1.71 per share. 
In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert to share more details of our excellent third quarter financial results. But before I do, I'll highlight some of our many accomplishments from the quarter. 
Over the past several weeks, I've been pleased to meet with many investors and continue to share our ESG story. It's been a natural journey for us and a direct outcome of how we deliver on our purpose: to serve customers and build stronger communities. We know that a clear vision and solid execution are very important factors when making investment decisions. We are proud that our progress and results have been recognized by several key ESG rating organizations who rate us near the top of the utility industry. Our top-performing results can be seen on supplemental Slide #2. 
Our recent corporate responsibility report highlights many of our achievements. We continue to make steady progress, such as our commitment to plant more than 1 million trees across our service territory over the next decade. Not only will this support our care for the environment value and our carbon reduction efforts, it is also responsive to the impact from the 2020 derecho windstorm that devastated our service territory. 
In Wisconsin, we celebrated our first community solar project with a public open house and tours in the town of Fond du Lac. The 1-megawatt solar garden will supply clean energy to up to 1,000 homes and is expected to be operational by the end of 2021. Celebrating this solar garden reflects the community's innovative spirit and passion for clean energy. 
In Iowa, we are excited to have received IUB approval for our first solar garden. It's expected to be constructed in 2022 at a site near Cedar Rapids. 
In the third quarter, we also assumed ownership of the Bear Creek, North Rock, Wood County and Grand County solar projects in Wisconsin. Construction has either started or will be started shortly on these projects that totaled 450 megawatts. 
And here in the fourth quarter, we acquired the Crawfish River project and expect to acquire the Onion River project before the end of the year. With those acquisitions, we will have assumed ownership of all 675 megawatts of solar that was approved as part of our first CA filing in Wisconsin. 
2 final highlights I'll share are tied to the social side of ESG. In September, we committed $4 million to the Hometown Care Energy Fund to help customers who need financial assistance to help pay their energy bills during the upcoming home heating season. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that Midwest natural gas expenditures will rise by nearly 50% compared with last winter. And while we expect the proactive planning by our energy markets team will keep us in line or below those forecasted increases, we know customers will welcome the additional support from this donation to help them stay on track with their energy bills during this time of increased natural gas demand. 
And finally, I'm excited to share that with the support of our suppliers and partners, our 15th annual Drive Out Hunger event raised over $400,000, bringing our 15-year fundraising total to more than $5 million. This event has provided over 17 million meals to families in need across our service territory. Combating hunger is one of the focus areas of our charitable foundation, and we are proud to partner with our Feeding America Food Bank partners in Iowa and Wisconsin to help thousands of our customers access nutritious food to strengthen their families. 
With all the great results from the quarter, I would be remiss in not mentioning that our economic development and customer growth efforts have resulted in our third year in a row of being named a top utility and economic development by Site Selector magazine. Our economic development team in collaboration with local, regional and state partners in Iowa and Wisconsin created more than $900 million in new capital investments and more than 2,200 new jobs across Iowa and Wisconsin. 
I look forward to meeting with many of you next week at the EEI Financial Conference to share even more about our company, including our clean energy vision, flexible and well-executed capital investment plan, our long track record of consistent financial and operational results, and our focus on the well-being of our employees, customers and communities. 
Thank you for your confidence in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,1685451208,2427441,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $1.02 per share compared to $0.98 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements d",1174,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. 
Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $1.02 per share compared to $0.98 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base as well as higher temperature normalized sales compared to the third quarter of 2020. These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and timing of income tax expense. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2020, we recorded a non-GAAP adjustment of $0.04 per share related to a legacy guarantee in our nonutility operations. 
Through the first 9 months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.08 per share. By comparison in 2020, the year-to-date temperature impacts through the first 3 quarters increased retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.01 per share. 
Turning to temperature normalized sales. Our retail electric sales in the third quarter of 2021 were up 4.1% versus last year. The 2 key drivers for this increase are continued pandemic recovery in year-over-year sales, particularly in the commercial and industrial classes, and minimal storm activity this year compared to the third quarter of 2020 when our Iowa territory experienced a derecho windstorm. Through the first 9 months of 2021, temperature-normalized electric sales have been better than forecasted, largely due to higher-than-expected demand from residential and industrial customer classes. 
As John mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2022 earnings guidance range of $2.65 to $2.79 per share. The key driver of the 6% growth in temperature normalized EPS is higher earnings on increasing capital investments, primarily driven by our solar program. The details of our refreshed capital expenditure plans are shown on Slides 5 and 6. 
Our capital expenditures, net of expected tax equity contributions over the 5-year period from 2021 through 2025, will total approximately $7 billion or an average of $1.4 billion per year. Our capital expenditure plans continue to be focused on the transition to cleaner energy and strengthening the reliability and resiliency of our electric grid. 
We continue to make progress on our plans to add 1,500 megawatts of solar energy for both our Wisconsin and Iowa customers and have adjusted our flexible capital expenditure plans to address the current market conditions for solar panels and related project materials. Our plan includes expectations for increasing costs for these solar projects as supply constraints and commodity inflation continue to be prevalent in the solar market. Despite increasing costs, these solar projects remain key elements of our clean energy blueprints and will bring long-term environmental and cost benefits to our customers. 
In addition to the 1.1 gigawatts of solar previously announced for our Wisconsin customers, our plan includes additional renewables and energy storage in Wisconsin, in part to replace the capacity from a portion of the West Riverside Energy Center that we anticipate will be purchased by our neighboring utilities over the next few years. 
In Iowa, we recently completed an advanced rate making filing for our announced 400 megawatts of solar and 75 megawatts of battery storage. We plan for 200 megawatts of that solar, plus the battery storage, to be located at the site of the recently retired Dewayne Arnold Energy Center, leveraging the existing transmission interconnection from the former nuclear plant. This will be our first utility-scale battery storage installation and will be an important complement to our solar generation. 
Finally, we've also included capital expenditures in the latter part of our 5-year plan for additional energy storage and renewables, including wind repowering opportunities, to increase our portfolio of cost-effective clean energy sources for our utility customers. 
Slide 9 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 13% for 2021 and positive 6% for 2022. At our Wisconsin utility, we will have returned essentially all of the available excess deferred income tax benefits to our customers by the end of 2021, leading to a higher effective tax rate going forward. At our Iowa utility, our large wind portfolio and the resulting production tax credits will maintain our lower effective tax rate for several more years. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits flow back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the changes in the effective tax rate related to the PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral. 
Next, I'd highlight our continued focus on controlling costs for our customers. We have met virtually with many of you throughout this year and shared our strategy to reduce O&M over the next few years. This strategy is important as we head into the upcoming winter heating season, with much higher anticipated fuel prices, reminding us that our customers need our continued focus on controlling costs to keep rates affordable. Additionally, while we are not immune to rising commodity prices, we are able to leverage our risk management programs to mitigate the impact of rising natural gas and coal costs on customer bills. 
Let's move next to our financing plans. In September, we issued a $300 million green bond at WPL to finance renewal projects in Wisconsin. The coupon rate of 1.95% represents the lowest interest rate for a 10-year debenture issued by WPL, helping to support our customer affordability objectives. Our financing plan over the next 14 months includes issuing up to $1.4 billion of long-term debt at our utilities and Alliant Energy Finance. The proceeds from the new debt issuances will be used to refinance existing debt and the redemption of preferred stock and to finance the utilities capital expenditure plans. Our 2022 financing plans also include $25 million of new common equity through our DRIP plan. Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 7. 
As mentioned earlier, this week, we filed the advanced ratemaking principles for 400 megawatts of solar and 75 megawatts of storage for our Iowa utility. The key details of this filing are outlined on Slide 8. We plan to receive a decision on this filing in the second half of 2022. 
Looking ahead, this quarter, we expect to receive the written decision regarding our WPL rate review, including the decision on the innovative cost recovery mechanism for the Edgewater Unit 5 coal plant expected to retire by the end of 2022. And in the first half of next year, we plan to receive a decision on our second solar CA filing in Wisconsin. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you during the EEI Finance Conference next week. 
Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and the November 2021 fact book, which details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures, rate base, and construction work and progress forecast through 2025. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

This is Robert. I guess when we look beyond '25, which we've announced to date, we have provided some guidance through some of our materials that show we're thinking about roughly $7 billion to $9 billion of CapEx over the following 5-year plan. And as you think about that, I think it's going to be a continuation of what we're focused on now. A lot of it is going to be focused on cleaner energy sources. So think of that as more solar, more wind, including repowering opportunities, more storage. So all of those line up well with what our intention is, to translate or transfer our generation fleet to cleaner sources. 
And we think this new legislation that's being proposed under the Budget Reconciliation Bill, we'd be very supportive of that and help be able to provide some good cost benefits for our customers through that program. And also, on a continuation of our electric grid spend, so we've obviously talked a lot to you guys about the fact that we feel it's very important to focus on reliability and resiliency in that system. And so we'll see a continuation of undergrounding spend on 25 kV standardization. So that's going to drive a lot of that CapEx in the latter half. So those are the 2 primary categories. 
We'll have other things that we'll obviously watch. And as John indicated before, we let our capital compete. We're always looking for the best opportunities for our customers. But those seem to be bubbling up to the top right now as far as cleaner sources of energy and the grid."

We do continue to focus on making sure those investments remain affordable for our customers. So you'll see us weighing in on occasion on those. To handicap what's going to come out with the FERC, I guess I'd say it's going to be -- I'm just going to assume that it's going to be reasonable. It's going to continue to be helpful for transmission to get built. And other than trying to predict numbers, I think we've got a lot of that baked into our forecast, and we'll continue to monitor it.

And thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the third quarter of 2021. 
To start us off, I'm pleased to share our narrowed and increased 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.61 to $2.67, which represents a forecasted 12th consecutive year of 5% or greater earnings growth. We are also announcing our 2022 earnings guidance range of $2.65 to $2.79 per share, marking yet another year of forecasted 5% to 7% growth. We understand the importance of delivering consistent returns for our investors and solid operations for our customers. And in keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend to $1.71 per share. 
In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert to share more details of our excellent third quarter financial results. But before I do, I'll highlight some of our many accomplishments from the quarter. 
Over the past several weeks, I've been pleased to meet with many investors and continue to share our ESG story. It's been a natural journey for us and a direct outcome of how we deliver on our purpose: to serve customers and build stronger communities. We know that a clear vision and solid execution are very important factors when making investment decisions. We are proud that our progress and results have been recognized by several key ESG rating organizations who rate us near the top of the utility industry. Our top-performing results can be seen on supplemental Slide #2. 
Our recent corporate responsibility report highlights many of our achievements. We continue to make steady progress, such as our commitment to plant more than 1 million trees across our service territory over the next decade. Not only will this support our care for the environment value and our carbon reduction efforts, it is also responsive to the impact from the 2020 derecho windstorm that devastated our service territory. 
In Wisconsin, we celebrated our first community solar project with a public open house and tours in the town of Fond du Lac. The 1-megawatt solar garden will supply clean energy to up to 1,000 homes and is expected to be operational by the end of 2021. Celebrating this solar garden reflects the community's innovative spirit and passion for clean energy. 
In Iowa, we are excited to have received IUB approval for our first solar garden. It's expected to be constructed in 2022 at a site near Cedar Rapids. 
In the third quarter, we also assumed ownership of the Bear Creek, North Rock, Wood County and Grand County solar projects in Wisconsin. Construction has either started or will be started shortly on these projects that totaled 450 megawatts. 
And here in the fourth quarter, we acquired the Crawfish River project and expect to acquire the Onion River project before the end of the year. With those acquisitions, we will have assumed ownership of all 675 megawatts of solar that was approved as part of our first CA filing in Wisconsin. 
2 final highlights I'll share are tied to the social side of ESG. In September, we committed $4 million to the Hometown Care Energy Fund to help customers who need financial assistance to help pay their energy bills during the upcoming home heating season. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that Midwest natural gas expenditures will rise by nearly 50% compared with last winter. And while we expect the proactive planning by our energy markets team will keep us in line or below those forecasted increases, we know customers will welcome the additional support from this donation to help them stay on track with their energy bills during this time of increased natural gas demand. 
And finally, I'm excited to share that with the support of our suppliers and partners, our 15th annual Drive Out Hunger event raised over $400,000, bringing our 15-year fundraising total to more than $5 million. This event has provided over 17 million meals to families in need across our service territory. Combating hunger is one of the focus areas of our charitable foundation, and we are proud to partner with our Feeding America food bank partners in Iowa and Wisconsin to help thousands of our customers access nutritious food to strengthen their families. 
With all the great results from the quarter, I would be remiss in not mentioning that our economic development and customer growth efforts have resulted in our third year in a row of being named a top utility and economic development by Site Selector magazine. Our economic development team in collaboration with local, regional and state partners in Iowa and Wisconsin created more than $900 million in new capital investments and more than 2,200 new jobs across Iowa and Wisconsin. 
I look forward to meeting with many of you next week at the EEI Financial Conference to share even more about our company, including our clean energy vision, flexible and well-executed capital investment plan, our long track record of consistent financial and operational results, and our focus on the well-being of our employees, customers and communities. 
Thank you for your confidence in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $1.02 per share compared to $0.98 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements d",1174,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. 
Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $1.02 per share compared to $0.98 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base as well as higher temperature normalized sales compared to the third quarter of 2020. These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and timing of income tax expense. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2020, we recorded a non-GAAP adjustment of $0.04 per share related to a legacy guarantee in our nonutility operations. 
Through the first 9 months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.08 per share. By comparison in 2020, the year-to-date temperature impacts through the first 3 quarters increased retail electric and gas margins by approximately $0.01 per share. 
Turning to temperature normalized sales. Our retail electric sales in the third quarter of 2021 were up 4.1% versus last year. The 2 key drivers for this increase are continued pandemic recovery in year-over-year sales, particularly in the commercial and industrial classes, and minimal storm activity this year compared to the third quarter of 2020 when our Iowa territory experienced a derecho windstorm. Through the first 9 months of 2021, temperature-normalized electric sales have been better than forecasted, largely due to higher-than-expected demand from residential and industrial customer classes. 
As John mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2022 earnings guidance range of $2.65 to $2.79 per share. The key driver of the 6% growth in temperature normalized EPS is higher earnings on increasing capital investments, primarily driven by our solar program. The details of our refreshed capital expenditure plans are shown on Slides 5 and 6. 
Our capital expenditures, net of expected tax equity contributions over the 5-year period from 2021 through 2025, will total approximately $7 billion or an average of $1.4 billion per year. Our capital expenditure plans continue to be focused on the transition to cleaner energy and strengthening the reliability and resiliency of our electric grid. 
We continue to make progress on our plans to add 1,500 megawatts of solar energy for both our Wisconsin and Iowa customers and have adjusted our flexible capital expenditure plans to address the current market conditions for solar panels and related project materials. Our plan includes expectations for increasing costs for these solar projects as supply constraints and commodity inflation continue to be prevalent in the solar market. Despite increasing costs, these solar projects remain key elements of our clean energy blueprints and will bring long-term environmental and cost benefits to our customers. 
In addition to the 1.1 gigawatts of solar previously announced for our Wisconsin customers, our plan includes additional renewables and energy storage in Wisconsin, in part to replace the capacity from a portion of the West Riverside Energy Center that we anticipate will be purchased by our neighboring utilities over the next few years. 
In Iowa, we recently completed an advanced rate making filing for our announced 400 megawatts of solar and 75 megawatts of battery storage. We plan for 200 megawatts of that solar, plus the battery storage, to be located at the site of the recently retired Duane Arnold Energy Center, leveraging the existing transmission interconnection from the former nuclear plant. This will be our first utility-scale battery storage installation and will be an important complement to our solar generation. 
Finally, we've also included capital expenditures in the latter part of our 5-year plan for additional energy storage and renewables, including wind repowering opportunities, to increase our portfolio of cost-effective clean energy sources for our utility customers. 
Slide 9 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 13% for 2021 and positive 6% for 2022. At our Wisconsin utility, we will have returned essentially all of the available excess deferred income tax benefits to our customers by the end of 2021, leading to a higher effective tax rate going forward. At our Iowa utility, our large wind portfolio and the resulting production tax credits will maintain our lower effective tax rate for several more years. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits flow back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the changes in the effective tax rate related to the PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral. 
Next, I'd highlight our continued focus on controlling costs for our customers. We have met virtually with many of you throughout this year and shared our strategy to reduce O&M over the next few years. This strategy is important as we head into the upcoming winter heating season, with much higher anticipated fuel prices, reminding us that our customers need our continued focus on controlling costs to keep rates affordable. Additionally, while we are not immune to rising commodity prices, we are able to leverage our risk management programs to mitigate the impact of rising natural gas and coal costs on customer bills. 
Let's move next to our financing plans. In September, we issued a $300 million green bond at WPL to finance renewal projects in Wisconsin. The coupon rate of 1.95% represents the lowest interest rate for a 10-year debenture issued by WPL, helping to support our customer affordability objectives. Our financing plan over the next 14 months includes issuing up to $1.4 billion of long-term debt at our utilities and Alliant Energy Finance. The proceeds from the new debt issuances will be used to refinance existing debt and the redemption of preferred stock and to finance the utilities capital expenditure plans. Our 2022 financing plans also include $25 million of new common equity through our DRIP plan. Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 7. 
As mentioned earlier, this week, we filed the advanced ratemaking principles for 400 megawatts of solar and 75 megawatts of storage for our Iowa utility. The key details of this filing are outlined on Slide 8. We plan to receive a decision on this filing in the second half of 2022. 
Looking ahead, this quarter, we expect to receive the written decision regarding our WPL rate review, including the decision on the innovative cost recovery mechanism for the Edgewater Unit 5 coal plant expected to retire by the end of 2022. And in the first half of next year, we plan to receive a decision on our second solar CA filing in Wisconsin. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you during the EEI Finance Conference next week. 
Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and the November 2021 fact book, which details the separate IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures, rate base, and construction work and progress forecast through 2025. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

So that could be an opportunity for us for future rate base growth if those provisions come to fruition through the new legislation."

You guys obviously are taking a look at that really depending on what's going on. Some other companies do not. As far as looking forward, because you always kind of -- your CapEx plans are somewhat front-end loaded and then you kind of fill in. As you look at the second part of the decade, you get out to '25 and beyond, what's kind of not included yet that you envisioned to, whether it's in '24 or '25, and more importantly, '26, '27 to be kind of added or big CapEx spend going forward?"

This is Robert. I guess when we look beyond '25, which we've announced to date, we have provided some guidance through some of our materials that show we're thinking about roughly $7 billion to $9 billion of CapEx over the following 5-year plan. And as you think about that, I think it's going to be a continuation of what we're focused on now. A lot of it is going to be focused on cleaner energy sources. So think of that as more solar, more wind, including repowering opportunities, more storage. So all of those line up well with what our intention is, to translate or transfer our generation fleet to cleaner sources. 
And we think this new legislation that's being proposed under the Budget Reconciliation Bill, we'd be very supportive of that and help be able to provide some good cost benefits for our customers through that program. And also, on a continuation of our electric grid spend, so we've obviously talked a lot to you guys about the fact that we feel it's very important to focus on reliability and resiliency in that system. And so we'll see a continuation of undergrounding spend on 25 kV standardization. So that's going to drive a lot of that CapEx in the latter half. So those are the 2 primary categories. 
We'll have other things that we'll obviously watch. And as John indicated before, we let our capital compete. We're always looking for the best opportunities for our customers. But those seem to be bubbling up to the top right now as far as cleaner sources of energy and the grid."

But one area that kind of, I think, always been something that you guys are focused on is like lowering the cost of transmission for your customers since I think ITC is a big part of that cost. So could you kind of maybe talk about what efforts, if any, you're trying to do as far as reduce your transmission costs, as far as returns, and what you may be hearing from the FERC, and what direction they're going as far as adders and also potential reduction of the base ROE, and whether you're in support of that?

Yes, it's certainly important, Andrew, from overall cost, and we know it's important for transmission that's needed to connect renewables. So we certainly have a forecast for that and certainly would like to see transmission commensurate with the renewable adds. 
We do continue to focus on making sure those investments remain affordable for our customers. So you'll see us weighing in on occasion on those. To handicap what's going to come out with the FERC, I guess I'd say it's going to be -- I'm just going to assume that it's going to be reasonable. It's going to continue to be helpful for transmission to get built. And other than trying to predict numbers, I think we've got a lot of that baked into our forecast, and we'll continue to monitor it."
