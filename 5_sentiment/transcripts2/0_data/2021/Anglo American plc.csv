I probably should give a little bit of a health warning at the start of the presentation. We are trying a new approach and a new technology. And so if there are any stuff-ups, it's my fault. It's not Paul'",3050,"Okay. Thank you very much, and welcome, everyone. I probably should give a little bit of a health warning at the start of the presentation. We are trying a new approach and a new technology. And so if there are any stuff-ups, it's my fault. It's not Paul's and it's not the operators. So we'll see how we go. 
The theme for our presentation is keeping our feet on the ground. And while I'm a believer in the strong fundamentals to demand in our industry and the likely constrain of supply in many of our products, the last thing I want to see in our team is anyone lifting their heads and forgetting about our focus on our continuing business transformation journey. So to be clear, we believe we have a portfolio of assets and opportunities that play favorably into the big global themes around climate change, circular economy and the growing importance of material sciences in finding new and exciting uses for our metals and minerals. 
We've been strategic in our outlook and positioning for a number of years, and today's world continues to confirm we are, mostly more than ever, position to improve and grow our business, both in the short, medium and the longer term. 
I now move to the cautionary statement. You should read carefully, preferably in your own time. On Slide 3, our order of play is consistent with our established routines. I'll touch on performance and highlight a few key points. Stephen or mister balance will then run you through the numbers to provide detailed insights and to reinforce our focus on capital and our investment disciplines. And to close, I will take you through how we are transforming the business and positioning for today and the future. 
So again, next slide, please, on #4. On safety, health and environment. For us, the improvement journey continues. First, on safety. Over the last 5 years, we've recorded a 40% reduction in total injuries and an 82% reduction in fatal incidents. For us, despite a couple of serious incidents early in the year, it was our best ever safety performance as we continue our journey towards zero. And as we say, no year is a good year if you've lost someone in your operations. And so we still have to get there, but we're getting very close. And from our point of view, everything is going in to get us there. 
Secondly, on health cases. Those issues are made up of less obvious or immediate hazards of risks in the business, we are also heading in the right direction. And again, significant improvement since 2013, about 95% reduction. So we're very proud of that performance. And on the environment, our improved planning and operating disciplines continue to support incident reductions across the group. And as people know, making sure we don't get that call in the middle of the night, requires constant focus, appropriate technical design, operating disciplines and open and effective governance process to ensure we're doing the right things the right way all the time. 
And for us, we still haven't got to a point where we've eliminated all of our incidents and our early issues last year point to that. But I do want people to understand we're working very hard to eliminate all of those things from the business. And from our point of view, we've made significant progress. But we're certainly not yet where we want to be. 
I've now moved to Page 5. And on our broader ESG context, we continue to make good progress on our critical targets. Our energy efficiency improvements have also supported our greenhouse gas savings. And as you can see, we have met both improvement targets for 2020. Working off our 2016 baseline, and that's represented by the horizontal green bars that we have on those charts, our next step is an absolute reduction of 30% on both by 2030. 
On our social way compliance and social way being our social standards and the practices package, per our broader operating model approach to business, you can see we are approaching full compliance across the group. Now as you know, these things evolve and develop over time. And so we have now designed the third-generation social way package that will be used as a new and higher bar to community and social engagement. 
And we would say, we've still got a long way to go. We haven't yet got our community relations where we want them to be. But again, just to let you know, we are working very hard in all of our communities and across all of our sites on this particular aspect of the business. The new package goes beyond industry benchmarks and has been imaginatively called Social Way 3.0. So a new industry standard with a title that only an engineer could love. 
Next slide. On COVID-19, despite the encouraging vaccine progress in many countries, it is clear the pandemic and the challenges for most are not going away quickly. Our responsible holistic approach, including supporting our communities continues. And this broader community approach is an approach we share with many of our industry colleagues, particularly in jurisdictions where government support is less equipped to deal with these types of issues. And we have been taking these initiatives further as we have understood when people in communities are under stress, domestic and gender-based violence issues can grow. So we're working with our community leaders and governments to make sure we're dealing with all of the direct and indirect impacts of COVID. 
The lives and livelihoods of our employees, their families and the communities are the priority, and we've managed a strong operational recovery at the same time. We've been strengthening and reinforcing protocols to help deal with second waves affecting our operations as well. Our focus on people returning to workplace Christmas has been very important, and we've seen some impacts, but they're being managed effectively. And in anticipation of that post-Christmas suit, we put in extra levels of testing to identify and mitigate risks. 
Based on our latest data, we expect most of the site impacts will be negligible as we move into March. On demand for products, despite lockdowns in limitations, our order books are generally pretty full. And on diamonds, the demand bounces has been quite solid. So the early signs have been encouraging. But we do have some residual risks that will probably remain in some jurisdiction, probably to the mid year, but it's not significant. It's being managed. And from our point of view, I'd have to say the teams have done a great job in managing all the dimensions of the COVID-19 issue. 
On results, an encouraging finishing -- finish after a tough start to the year. Despite all the issues and dramas through the first half, we finished the year running at around 95% of full production capacity. But even more importantly and despite lower volumes, our unit costs and our capital spend were held in tight control. Along with the improving prices, we saw our second half EBITDA recover to $6.5 billion, our highest for a 6-month period since 2011. This recovery and the disciplines that have gone with the learnings from the Q1 disruptions have put us in a good position going into 2021. 
On earnings per share, $2.53 for the year or 1 point 8 1 or $1.81 in the second half. The full year return on capital employed at 17% was impacted by our higher capital base. We're spending on Quellaveco and the [ Sirius ] acquisition impacting the denominator for the calculation. We will show pre and post new project spend when we report these quarterly numbers going forward. However, the half -- the second half ROCE number was a pleasing 24%. So that's a good number. 
Hopefully, we're all now on Slide 8 and looking at our 4 key business segments. De Beers has been -- has seen SAS picking up through the fourth quarter and continuing into 2021, with site 1 in January, delivering our highest [indiscernible] sales for 3 years. The term will continue to manage production levels to demand and have kept costs very well-managed through the process, with a 10% unit cost improvement year-on-year despite 18% lower volumes. Given our broader restructuring, we expect to see more unit cost improvements through 2021. [indiscernible] and the guys have done some really hard yards through the year, and we will continue to work through 2021. 
In copper and nickel, we've delivered consistent performance. In copper, we've navigated the twin challenges of water constraints and COVID with production in the entire levels despite the challenges. The effective implementation of social distancing in Chile and Brazil has been a model for all of our operations, with work on water and securing alternative sources in Chile being a real winner for the year. And [indiscernible] and the guys have done great work there, [indiscernible] and the crew in full support. 
On PGMs, a pleasing mining performance and processing production back to 100% levels by year-end. At the same time, the reinstalled A unit at the ACNP  has been running very well since late November, after a very careful and well-managed commissioning process by Natasha and the team. So we are looking forward to a better year of both mined and refined production. And with current strong spot prices we're very well placed to deliver some strong margins and cash generation. 
In box, Minas-Rio Rio has continued to improve. Another record performance in a year when we were down for 1 month for the planned pipeline inspection makes it a really an incredible performance. At Kumba, despite lower production, largely as a result of COVID, unit costs were 6% lower at $31 a tonne, and it was a similar story in our South African thermal coal operations. 
In Metco, the spat between Australia and China still remains an issue, although the pricing gap is starting to close as the market adjusts now for delivering to new customers or adjust to new deliveries for new customers. In addition, we've had our operating challenges. Most recent the current longwall panel at Moranbah has been moving through some tough ground since last Saturday night, and we recorded a high carbon monoxide gas reading in the waste areas. Now carbon monoxide is a result of latent heating in the gulf area. So as per our protocols, we withdrew the workforce, and we commenced monitoring the gas from them [indiscernible] since that time. And by the end of the shift, the levels that actually returned to normal. Now we think that might have been the result of the [indiscernible], but we're taking extra precautions, we're actually pumping nitrogen in to make sure that we don't have any further gas levels. And we'd expect to return to operations in the next 2 to 3 weeks. We are working with the inspector in Queensland, again to make sure we've got all the angles covered. But at this stage, I think it is -- we have seen these things before. And it usually takes a week or 2 to get through them. So watching it carefully, but I think the guys have done a good job in handling it and certainly satisfied that all the issues have been covered. 
On Grosvenor, the key issue for us is the timing of the restart and the commissioning of the new longwall. We expect to restart sometime in the second half of the year, but we don't want to preempt the inquiry or its filings. And so we will be both patient and cautious in our approach. 
And so if I can go to the next slide, please. Okay. Consistent with growing cash flow and returns, you should be on Slide 9 -- consistent with growing cash flow and returns for Anglo American, the improvement journey does continue. While we've reported a 43% margin for the year, our 47% margin in the second half was the eye catcher. Our 2023 target is greater than 45% using long term prices. And with Quellaveco and our other projects and the incremental projects we have, in the pipeline, we'd expect to hit those numbers. The long-term improvement approach has been driven by portfolio restructuring, our technical reconfiguration through Tony and his team and in his work with the operating leaders, of the assets that stayed within the portfolio, and the introduction of our industrial operating disciplines brought by the Anglo operating model. And that is unique to the industry. The total change package supported a 45% rural improvement in our operating costs, or around 30% in nominal terms. And that's despite running 50% less assets. And that is -- we've actually grown production by around 12%. That's in 2019 numbers. Obviously, we've come back in '20. But again, we'll be back on that profile this year and beyond. 
And as I've said before, the improvement journey has no end in terms of what we see. In our Phase II work, we'll continue to drive up the benchmark performance curves on our capital assets, while building incremental and new capacity that has a lower cost structure, further supporting our margin growth. So it's not just about growth, it's about quality growth in terms of the portfolio. 
Now if we go to Slide 10 and looking forward, we have carefully sequenced the execution of our portfolio of incremental and new projects, which drive significant margin accretive production growth over the next 5 years and beyond. From a strategic perspective, this growth is also continuing our portfolio repositioning towards future-enabling commodities. And so our 20% growth by 2023, and that's compared to 2018, is more like 30% if we compare it to last year's production. And that is well underway. And the 25% by 2025 builds off our technology footprint and is as much about quality, as I said, as it is about top line growth. And our sequencing -- and with our sequencing, we are not trying to do too many things at the same time. That's being considered quite careful in the way we've phased our projects. Now Stephen will step you through some of this later, but the 2 main new constituents in our stage growth process are Quellaveco and Woodsmith. 
On Quellaveco, we're tracking the original schedule despite COVID. So whilst we picked up 6 months in the pre-COVID execution work, we've given most of that back to COVID. And whilst we are still dealing with some cases on site, we're at about 90% manning levels, and we've got the work focusing on the critical task item. So we do -- we're still doing very well on the shed, and Tom and the guys have done a great job. 
We have also -- we have now also approved the installation of coarse particle recovery in the plant following very successful test work. So that will enhance overall production recovery, and we'll continue to improve the economics of the program as we try and bring our commissioning process forward in terms of additional production, which we can see we can do as a consequence of the latest drilling. 
The other thing that we've done is we're in the process of committing to fully renewable energy power, a fully renewable energy power contract, which will also improve our carbon emission credentials as part of the development of the project. 
At Woodsmith, progress is solid. The tunnel has now been driven to almost 13 kilometers of its 37-kilometer target. Our detailed technical review is nearing completion and confirms the quality of the overall project design and the development approach within the parameters we had set. Ahead of our scheduled mid-2021 update to the market, which will present final capital and schedule estimates, we are refining 2 aspects of the project that we had allowed for in our investment case. We will likely bring forward the investment in additional ventilation to increase early production flexibility, and we are working through the detailed scheduling of the 2 shaft installations. Based on our work and involvement so far, we're very happy with the asset and its market potential. And importantly, it sits in the Q1 of the cost curve and is therefore capable of some really attractive returns. And from our point of view, these are really important points to focus on. 
I will again stress the point that it's not a potash mine, it's polyhalite, 4 nutrients trans, low carbon footprint. We don't have to do all that downstream processing. And we can put product on a boat shoe than literally anyone and deliver it to almost any market in the world. This is a very different project to the ones you've been hearing about. And from our point of view, we think it's great potential. We're certainly very pleased with what we've got based on everything we've seen so far. 
So if I go to the next slide, finally, and most importantly, on our business improvement focus, as I've said before, the first steps were in the operating model setting a stable base, from which we use our P101 program, which is about getting all of our capital assets up to top industry performance. Not in top quartile, we're talking to P101 meaning best of the best to drive improving performance levels. To date, the team has delivered around $2 billion in raw numbers in the improvement, which is in terms of annual EBITDA on the business improvement side, through efficiencies and operational delivery. 
The more difficult issue is we've given some of that back due to the instability that we have in some parts of the process. And the ACMP failed to reflect that as an example of that instability. So the opportunity to get that additional $1 billion back to the bottom line is around stability and consistency in the operation. That's a real percent in the operating model. Yes, we've come a lot of productivity to drop it say, out of that cost. But getting that stability to get to the next, that for Tony and his team and the operating leaders across the business. We're able to approach, but we where we would be. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Stephen."
409115,704883639,2223842,"Anglo American plc, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks very much, Mark.

And so you know, I'd like to the number [Technical Difficulty] operations cash flow and we'll work hard to recapture that in 2020. Two, return to your holders, now 40% paying ratio dividend; and three, a strong balance sheet and invest in the future. And that balance really sets us up for a strong and sustainable future. 
So on Slide 13, let's turn to the 2020 numbers our EBITDA, good recovery, $6.2 billion in the second half, a record since '11. Looking at the full year strong present [indiscernible] results, this [indiscernible] income challenges that we had. Earnings per share fairly consistent, and that then flows through to consistent dividends. Net debt at 0.6x EBITDA benefited from good prices, but more to come in terms of that story with the unwind of the working capital build that we had this year. 
Half 2 free cash flow, $3.3 billion done with SSA without the help of the working capital. So if we turn to Slide 14, looking across the different [indiscernible], recovery of diamonds in the second half, strong mining margins at 54%, which talks to the underlying quality and resilience of the assets, $650 million in revenue from site 1 in 2021. So encouraging recovery so far helped by a decent selling season through Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year and lower rough and polished inventory. 
Of course, we [indiscernible] group performance on unit cost of 113 cents per pound, we had some additional noncash movements in provisions in the year. But again, [indiscernible] margins. PGMs, good recovery in the second half, plus price on spots around or above 3,000 PGM an ounce. [indiscernible] previously known as minor metals. Obviously [indiscernible]. Even with the AC disruption, last year, we generated, I think, $2 billion of revenue from palladium and $2 billion from radium [indiscernible] '21, the DA which as we mentioned, would be slightly [indiscernible]. 
In [indiscernible], Minas-Rio has been our outstanding performer, gaining good stability into driving the sales in here at 24 million tonnes of high iron content product. That is $1.9 billion of EBITDA [indiscernible] 2%. Our convert margin was 55% and an 80% return on capital employed year. Clearly we see the prices that those higher-quality products from both Minas and Kumba, we believe [indiscernible] managing steel industry. Clearly, a topic for met coal that improved prices totally persist into 2021. 
So overall, a good set of numbers, and particularly pleasing with the recovery through the second half. 
And just before I leave this slide, I encourage you to play with all the spreadsheet that I think is the first-line and please form your own view on forward prices across the year. But I would note if you won't ask moving [indiscernible], if you put in spots from a couple of weeks ago, you could well end up with a number [indiscernible] all it does work. 
Turning to slide [indiscernible], a  quick look at drivers of EBITDA shows that overall, we're at relatively consistent levels, even with the volatility for price, COVID and operational disruptions. Importantly, as I mentioned, we are seeing underlying  constant volume improvements primarily this period of copper in Minas-Rio, but we are very focused on turning on as operating challenges at PGMs and met coal going forward. So I think you see the [indiscernible] drop to the bottom line and understand on that a little bit more on to the next slide [indiscernible]. 
[indiscernible] on Slide 16. The half as shown a bit of help from [indiscernible] payment, core net debt down to the $0.5 billion and as well with our target gearing of 0.6 [indiscernible]. 
[indiscernible] very well to stage of delivery. Just to remind you $5.6 billion of net debt includes $1 billion of [indiscernible] accounting  [indiscernible] $1.6 billion for inventory build all through the year, largely in PGMs and diamonds and particularly in PGM to see that unwind over the so actually in a very good position, a strong balance sheet, a strong pipeline value [indiscernible] to able to retain good returns to shareholders. 
If we go to slide [indiscernible] favorably balanced, reposition the portfolio when required and return cash to shareholders. So mentioned good cash across the period, $2.7 billion after funding sustaining capital with $3.3 billion in the second half. As such, we use that to support the payout ratio based item with a total of $1.2 billion declared for 2020. We allocated $1.4 billion in terms of growth CapEx, $0.7 billion in terms of the acquisition of Sirius minerals and a [indiscernible], $0.2 billion remains from a $1 billion share buyback scheme that we initiated in July '19 and completed early in 2020. 
So if we turn to Slide 18 and just over the next couple of slides, I want to spend a little bit of time just focusing on CapEx. I know there's a few questions out there to understand the timing, particularly in how that relates to the volumes. And so I'll focus and talk through in detail, both in terms of sustaining and growth CapEx, and hopefully, [indiscernible] some of our priorities. Just to be clear, there's no change to previous guidance on CapEx that we provided back in December. 
So let's have a first look at sustaining CapEx on this slide. You can see that there's a long-term sustaining CapEx level of around that $3 billion as our portfolio evolves. And [indiscernible] is on top of that, and that will be a little bit variable. We are seeing slightly elevated levels of [indiscernible] CapEx over the next couple of years, around that $700 million to $900 million per year, and that's as we complete the development of projects that you know around Venetia underground, Aquila and Kolomela. 
Longer term average, more around that region of $500 million per year. The underlying sustaining CapEx is also a touch higher in the next couple of years. The main drivers being the deferral of spend from 2020. And as we reprogram those work streams over the next year or 2. We've also included the desalination plant at Collahuasi. It's probably a combination of sustaining and growth that supports both current water requirements and wider expansion of Collahuasi, which I'll come onto in a moment. And so probably a combination of growth at sustaining. 
Needless to say, there's some growth -- I mean better numbers simply linked to the growth in the portfolio, a copper unit equivalent basis as we deliver that growth. 
So let's now look at growth CapEx on Slide 19. So in terms of growth CapEx, again, I'll walk you through a couple of slides just to provide a bit more clarity on what we're setting up here particularly in terms of that growth CapEx and how that leads to delivering the growth volumes over time. Again, just to emphasize, no change to the guidance that we provided back in December. So if we exclude what we've spoken just for the moment, growth CapEx per year around $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next 3 years. And with that, we see our copper equivalent production increasing by around at 20% by 2023 of that 2018 base. It's disciplined, it's margin accretive and predominantly focused around forward-facing or future enabling portfolio, it's technology friendly and links directly to the decarbonization agenda that we have in many mess. The CapEx that's forecast on this slide out to '23 also provides some of the earlier spend on some of that volume growth beyond 2023 on projects that we do anticipate approving in that interim period. For example, Collahuasi Phase I, Mohali cline and the MG plant debottlenecking. 
We go to Slide 20, please. So let's look at some of those projects in detail. Each case, attractive IRRs. And as Mark mentioned, they're well sequenced across time so that we managed to spend in the balance sheet appropriately. Quellaveco, as Mark mentioned, progressing well, our share remaining around that 1.5 billion over the next 18 months or so. In 2023, we expect to see copper production of 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes. That adds in its own right around 10% to our overall copper equivalent volume at spots from about 2 weeks ago. Obviously, it's a fast-moving at least from about 2 weeks ago, that would give us EBITDA of around $1 billion in 2022 and more than $2 billion in 2023 on a 100% basis. 
Another project on the Marine Namibia new vessel, the AMP 3, again on time for delivery. It's a fast returning brownfield project, adds around 500,000 carats at a very high-value per carat on a 100% basis. And for us, it adds about 1% in copper equivalent volumes for our 50% share. 
Turning to Collahuasi, it's clearly a world-class long life asset, and we're looking at efficient and incremental growth over time in a number of phases. Phase I, which see us adding additional mill and related infrastructure our CapEx while still being refined around [ 1 billion ]. Phase I increased throughput by around 20%, moving from about 160,000 to 200,000 tonnes per day. This equates to about 50,000 tonnes per annum of additional copper for our share. And that's about copper equivalent production growth at the group level. 
We'll also progressively look at technology initiatives such as bulk ore sorting to further optimize the operation, but that's more likely to be in a Phase II expansion. Those studies are underway. That would most likely be a full fourth line expansion, increasing throughput to around 300,000 tonnes per day. And that would add about 100,000 tonnes of copper equivalent production in our share. Obviously, we will require new permits, and it's a little early to provide capital units on that just at this stage. 
[indiscernible], a long life asset, we've almost already doubled production over the last 8 years of outspending major capital. The focus has been on embedding the operating model and production efficiencies. And  while we'll continue to drive efficiencies, the next stage will require some debottlenecking. And it's likely that we'll add some additional concentrator capacity, which will add around 300,000 to 600,000 PGM ounces of production. 
While still being refined, it's expected to cost between around $0.8 billion to $1.4 billion. And again, we take a technology focus and the [indiscernible] this are underway through 2021. 
So if I could then turn to Slide 21. So if we look beyond 2023, you would have seen earlier this week, we approved the [indiscernible] UHDMS project. It adds iron units to existing production, if you assume that we're well constrained by increasing iron grade and quality product. And importantly, [indiscernible] adds 3 -- at least 3 to 4 years of my life. In terms of Woodsmith, as Mark mentioned, the Q1 cost curve asset with strong margins. We've committed to spend around $0.5 billion this year, and we'll provide further guidance in July. [indiscernible] would add around 5% to our copper equivalent production when it's fully ramped up to that 10 million tonne production level. 
And Moranbah-Grosvenor, again a brownfield debottlenecking plant -- debottlenecking of the watch plant. Immediate focus, though, does remain bringing Grosvenor safely back in H2. But when completed, would add around 3% copper equivalent growth in around 2024. 
And finally, on the technology projects, there's a number of fast payback, relatively small individual investments, and there's quite a bit more detail provided in the appendix. Programs such as the bulk ore sorting, or the coarse particle rotation projects, cost competitive, modernize the operations to set us up on a more sustainable basis. For example, the hydrogen haul trucks and really underpin that journey as we have for. 
So if we move to Slide 22, just to pull those themes together across the 3 pillars, as we've spoken about on our journey through to 2022. The 3 pillars: one, sustaining CapEx, provides a continuing base for delivering on that efficient; two, technology and innovation adds to that in a productive and sort of sustainable way; and then the growth projects, as I just discussed, build on and transition the portfolio. 
So our $3 billion to $4 billion improvement target to 2022 remains very much on target. So let's just quickly look at each of those pillars. Firstly, on the operating model in P101 and some examples. So the business on the ground is getting more efficient as we often spoke about Minas-Rio, approaching 26 million tonnes by 2022. P101, systematically targeting opportunities across the value chain. Some examples, again, 15% increase in truck utilization at Arava, increased haul truck payloads at Los [indiscernible], an 8% throughput increase at the Minas-Rio beneficiation plant and world-class shovel performance across multiple operations. As Mark highlighted, we've seen about $2 billion increase in the underlying business run rates and $1 billion of that has dropped through to the bottom line to EBITDA so far, $800 million in the P101 category and about $0.2 billion in the technology area. Our focus now remains on delivering that stable and capable platform, so we get more of those improvements to drop to that bottom line. 
On the technology and development front, digital technologies, for example, the predictive maintenance are leading the way and have delivered that $0.2 billion today. Some other examples, bulk ore sorting, testing and early rollout going well. We've also had a pilot plant shows about a 10% reduction in energy and water intensity for that operation. 
Full-scale units are now being installed at Mogalakwena, Ara Alto and Las Brisas, and expected to be fully operational within 12 months. While also it allows us to process more accurately by discounting some of the lower value ores before we put them through the plant. Also resulting in energy and water savings per unit processed as well. And ultimately, that can drive a 5% to 10% grade uplift, which flows through the production and a 3% to 4% unit cost improvement. With bulk ore sorting, we expect to see initial benefits to EBITDA of probably $01. billion to $0.2 billion per annum, a very strong run rate energy [indiscernible]. 
Another example, of course, particle recovery. First full-scale plant in now installed at [indiscernible] through separations and traded ore on a higher size that saves around 30% in energy and crushing and greater water recovery in terms of reuse from tailings up to a 50% benefit in water usage. Combination of those factors can drive a 5% to 10% production increase and up to a 5% reduction in unit costs. We believe that this technology is applicable across as many as 6 of the group's key assets, including Quellaveco. And we've announced the approval of that project today. 
Limited benefit by 2022, but will potentially drive EBITDA benefits rising over time to around $250 million per year. 
Now I've already touched on the growth pillar, so we won't really go over that. But again, just to confirm, we remain on track for that $3 billion to $4 billion target improvement by 2022, that we first committed to back in 2018. 
So just to conclude, on Slide 23, our story remains consistent. It's all about balance. Returns continuing with $6.1 billion in dividends and buybacks in '17. The balance sheet remains strong. Our commitment to discipline remains while we deliver this value-added growth of around that 20% level through to 2023. That, in turn, drives our margins into our target range of 45% to 50%. 
Mark, back to you."
409115,704883639,2223842,"Anglo American plc, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, Stephen. And now we'll look more broadly and forward across the business. I am now on Page 25. So on diamonds at an industry level, the fundamentals continue to improve. Our views on a positive recovery are simply built on industry fundamentals an",2748,"Thanks, Stephen. And now we'll look more broadly and forward across the business. I am now on Page 25. So on diamonds at an industry level, the fundamentals continue to improve. Our views on a positive recovery are simply built on industry fundamentals and the associated buying behaviors of our customers. 
First, on demand, demand has been steady and the outlook looks pretty encouraging. So given long-term and most recent experience, we expect demand to continue to follow global GDP and perhaps more importantly, for a luxury good, personal disposable income or PDI. Both GDP and PDI are expected to grow by around 3% per year over the next decade. As the middle class is growing size in their aspiration to grow as we better target advertising and key customer segments. In China, currently, the second biggest diamond market after the U.S., Chinese middle classes are expected to purchase around $1 billion worth of diamond and jewelry over this same period. Globally, the demand profile is shifting towards female self purchasing, now making up almost 1/3 of diamond jewelry purchases. And the continuing shift in focus on branding and provenance is something that these has lent for many years. 
On supply, looking forward in terms of natural diamond production, it's generally grow the industry is on a flat to declining production trajectory. There has been a lack of significant kimberlite discoveries most recently, and that's on a global basis. In addition, some 15% of existing supply by volume has been taken off stream or has reached the end of its mine life. The combination of growth in consumer demand for diamond jewelry and the flat to declining production, points to good prospects for the diamond industry, both in the medium to longer term. Certainly, we expect the recovery to continue in 2021 of those fundamentals. 
On De Beers and our branding story, and this has really been the most significant part of Bruce team's work most recently, we're building off the De Beers brand and partnering our offering to target segments that is a key to the driving price for only the best philosophy that we have in De Beers. Our drive towards longer-term margin improvement is built from our COVID response, with the accelerated business transformation necessitated by our stark first half reality. Being a key player in driving the necessary modernization business with more efficient inventory management, increased online purchasing and growing consumer design for products with demonstrable ethical and sustainability credentials, including an enhanced depreciation of the natural work, really have been key considerations in the evolution of our change model. These are all messages that are resonating and consistent with the Anglo American and De Beers branding positions. 
The De Beers focus on continuing cost reduction reflects what all good businesses should be doing. And shortening production to customer times, increasing our own jewelry business offerings and premium brands are all part of a strategic remaking of the business, all connected through digital technologies in mining, processing, cutting, selling, tracing. They're all part of the strategic makeover Bruce and Tony and their teams in terms of technology application are joined at the hip. 
Consistent with our De Beers strategy, our Lightbox strategy for lab-grown products has also been an important part of our strategic approach to different market segments. De Beers is all about natural products that reflect and recognize every natural diamond is special or one of a kind, a measure of a personal commitment on our very most, or our most special personal relationships. On Lightbox, a fun fashion lab-grown product with growing discounts, now around 60% to 70% compared to the natural product. And from our point of view, a good market to be in the market to the naturals. And whilst that's not a simple 2-market piece, what we are seeing is the differentiation of those 2 segments in people's mind increases over time. And Bruce and the team are very sensitive to make sure the messaging is right in both context. 
Now to go to Slide 27. On PGMs, we have another sector with strong fundamentals and a great long-term potential. Obviously, the news from Russia overnight probably increases the short-term potential given palladium and nickel impacts. PGM pricing is also being driven by strong fundamentals on a broader basis. The strength in demand with mixed supplies resulted in a 50% increase in PGM basket price in 2020, and this strength in pricing has obviously continued into the new year. 
On the demand side, ever-increasing emission standards is crucial for the auto industry and means higher loadings of PGMs. We believe a 40% increase in loadings in 2029 is quite possible. In particular, tighter emission standards in both Europe and China are driving demand for palladium and rhodium, both are currently in deficit. Palladium is expected by many to remain in deficit for at least 2 to 3 years, even after taking into account a 10% substitution to platinum. And in our case, it's not a bad thing. We're happy to see flatten and pick up more market. But again, when we look at platinum, it's the all-round PGM, as diverse range of other demand sources continue to emerge: Food storage, glass making, 5G technology being some of the example. The point here though that these are nonmetals with unique properties, the full application of which is still being understood. And we're not standing back waiting for others to recognize potential applications. Through the AP Ventures Fund, we are investing in the development of PGMs for new applications to unlock the full potential, which, for example, we think will be a key for a vital hydrogen economy. Though the AP Ventures Fund has to raise $325 million of our $100 million see it coming. And so we're very excited about where we are and what the potential is in the industry. 
And on the supply side, there are very few near-term medium -- view few near to medium-term supply growth options across PGM production month 28 now. At the same time, currently minable assets are depleted. And with PGM processing capacity at a premium, we're in a massive strategic position of more than 50% of the world ex-Russia smelting, refining and associated base levels refining capacity. And in the longer term, producers are unsure whether to expand production until they see more evidence of the EV and hydrogen developments. And certainly, from our perspective, hydrogen today is a real conversation and moving quicker by the day. 
And while we don't have to worry about the decisions on putting more capital into new downstream processing capacity, we've already got the lion's share, we can build out incremental mine opportunities while debottlenecking and squeezing better margins from a full value chain position, and it is unique in this industry. 
The result, it is likely price will continue to do the heavy lifting in what is a constrained market. We have a great business with highly competitive and improving unit costs of around $700 an ounce, which supports a 70% mining margin across our basket of PGM products. The remarkable point to note, after a very tough year, we have still delivered a record financial performance, and we have no doubt -- and we have no debt in the business and with 70% mining margin as we stand today. So from our point of view, we have a unique position in what is shaping up to be a long [indiscernible] to the portfolio. 
So to Slide 29. talking about portfolio, our future enabling commodity mix alongside quality with diversity of positive differentiators in our industry, consumer-driven demand for diamonds, crop nutrients and PGMs and environmental themes and electrification driving demand for our copper, nickel and again, PGMs contributes to the hydrogen economy, are all big positive for Anglo American and our portfolio. And our iron ore and met coal assets are high quality, both physically and chemically. And therefore, desirable inputs for steel mills, and in particular, future green steel mills. And for those that understand with high iron ore values and low deleterious elements, the green technologies are far more efficient, the higher quality the iron ore feed. So we are uniquely positioned in that market as well for the longer term. 
And for a green -- and for a general investor, our mix across these high demand growth sectors is not just for the next 5 years, but for the next 10 to 20 years. And so from our point of view, positioning the business through 2040 is something we've been thinking about and doing for the last few years. 
So to Slide 30. Our role in making the world a better place is the way we think about a number of the issues that we're working through and making sure they connect with good performance. Our technology push, led by Tony and in partnership with our business leaders, is part of why we've been able to commit to making the business carbon neutral by 2040. Earlier than most, but we think that this is the right time line as it will continue to drive us while supporting our relentless push down all of our cost curves. 
Importantly, it's more than a target. We have plans to get there, and we have plans to get 8 of our sites to carbon neutrality by 2030. And as you know, we've contracted to be on 100% renewable power in Chile and Brazil by 2021, we saw in wind initiatives. And in Peru, we are already working through the same options for the Quellaveco business. 
On our planned exit from the South African thermal coal operations, I'm pleased to report we're making good progress, with the preparation work on the demerger option certainly available to us probably during the course of this year. And if we do see a trade sale option emerge that we think has merits, we will still look at that. But certainly, on the demerger option, we're well advanced and are in a good place to continue the process and announce something during the course of this year. 
And on Cerrejón, we also intend to exit our 1/3 in Cerrejón certainly within 3 years. But obviously, we've got 2 partners that we have to work with to make sure that's the right way. 
Now turning to Slide [indiscernible] and talking to carbon reduction and turning carbon reduction in our competitive advantage is something we recognized back in 2015. And again, Tony and the team working on the options with our Corporate Relations team. We've been thinking through the technical issues, and that's been led by Tony and how we set the business up to connect with our communities. So you've heard about that decarbonization [indiscernible] to place operations. We think 2040 is a challenging target, but it is to deliver where we have a plan to deliver. And while we don't want to get caught up in the conversation around scope 3 emissions and what we call the carbon reduction arms race, we believe the target that we have is appropriate and reflects the actions we're putting in place, which will also improve our competitive position. 
Now on scope 3 emissions, we make a few simple observation. To us, our scope 3 work has helped as I've been more clear, but carbon intensity of our value chain. And the one thing that is clear is there are many different ways of calculating numbers. They're off the base that we've used. We understand that, for example, thermal coal represents around 25% of our carbon emission. So obviously, an exit from thermal coal over the next 3 years would impact our reported scope 3 numbers in that order. 
But we also point to our work on Scope 1 and 2 emissions where the technical work will also impact adjacencies, how we connect with our communities. And we also think there are credits, both in supply chain terms and what we're doing at the community, to further impact our scope 3 emissions. 
In the steel industry, you've got met coal and iron ore. And again, they represent the 2 other most significant areas in terms of our scope 3 emissions. For iron ore, it represents somewhere around 45% to 50% of our reported Scope 3 emissions. And the industry tells they'd expect to have green steel production making up about 50% of the world's steel supply by 2040. And you can apply those assumptions across -- really across the terms of our iron ore business, remembering that the products we produce are favored in those new technologies because of the high-quality, when they start to get a sense of what think we can do at all. 
In met coal, the really important point to note that the demand we don't have, significant alternatives that we can replace existing technologies in steel very quickly. So based on what we think the direction of travel and the timing it would take to do the conversion to [ green steel industry ], that timing would be far longer than the life of our met coal assets. So what we're thinking through is how do we continue to make improvements in those businesses and make a meaningfull contribution to our partners in the industry, but at the same time continue to improve our carbon position. Now we don't think it's right to just think about depleting assets. We don't think that's the right way that we should be working with all the assets we can improve, and we're working through that. And we'll keep you posted on how that thinking is all coming together over the next 12 months. We've got our sustainability update in April. We'll again update at the end and continue to update you over the next 12 months. And the one thing that I think is important to note, the credibility we've built on how we're attacking the Scope 1 and Scope 2 issues is the stage we're dealing with Scope 3. And again, when we come with the final positions and targets, it will be thoughtful, it will be backed by a plan, it will be supported by the technology and how we believe we should shape the portfolio into the future. And as you know, the work we're doing today is all about the future and certainly the positioning of our portfolio in the long term. 
On Page 32, I think I want to step back and reflect purpose again. It's founded on the delivery of sustainable returns to shareholders, employees and our business and societal stakeholders. And so to reimagine mining to improve people's lives is not something we just say, it is what we believe we must do as a business, both through the value we contribute to our society, our host communities and society, and also in the way we can in basic materials that it enable the world to be sustainable in all of expansions. 
Our business, we keep our targets pretty simple: We target a better than 10% free cash flow on capital employed, and that's after making sure we're replacing depleted resources, as the prime measure of our effectiveness as business managers. To measure the efficiency of how we got that free cash flow, we measure with capital employed in the range, 15% to 20%, which is about measuring the efficiency of those cash flows. 
And then we have our 7 performance pillars that look at safety, health environment, our competitive cost position in each of our tire markets. And as a business, how we set the balance sheet up to flexible as Stephen as reported for you today. And that's the focus of everyone within Anglo American, and everybody has a responsibility to make sure every day we're moving closer to hitting those targets consistently and improving those numbers on a day-to-day basis. 
And then finally, on Page 33. Just to remind you about our investment proposition, and it's pretty simple. We have the assets, we have the people, and we have delivered industry-leading returns since 2000 to interact [ 10% ] a year. And we have set the foundation to perform through 2030 and beyond. And we've got the portfolio, and we're in the right businesses to continue to improve that performance. 
So with that, we'll pause for questions, just to say Stephen and Tony are also here to answer the really hard questions. And so we'll hand across to the moderator."

It's something that we actively discuss and something that actively consider. If prices continue, then obviously, that challenge comes nearer term even with the growth spend. But I'd probably see that has been in the form of some sort of special return above the base.

We are already improving, increasing under belt. At Mogalakwena, we've got incremental improvements planned. And most have to be planned out carefully because we've got communities that we've got to make sure that we've got good relationships as we grow the business.

What worries me for the industry is where we have incidents, whether it's a safety issue, whether it's an environmental issue, whether it's a heritage issue. These sorts of things tend to harden up regulators in dealing with the industry in an open and constructive way. 
So we've all got to do better, connect better and help communities understand what we actually do in society. A lot of people don't realize that the mining industry drives 25% gross GDP through 10% on a denomination basis, another 10% through the services that we use to provide the products we produce. And then we drive industry's ability to be more competitive. And people don't understand that you need copper and nickel and all of these things to decarbonize the world's economy. So we've got to get our message out there much better than we have. 
Our plate base work, for example, is about getting the 2 billion people that are really influential with NGOs and having them understand what work we to do and how we're trying to partner. And we're changing the nature of global conversations around mining. We all have to do it, or the world is not going to be an easy place to live without mining.

And as you know, there's also rhodium now it's in the mix as well. When you look at the hydrogen, where we produce, I think it's around 100,000 ounces of rhodium, it's up near 30,000 now. So all of these things are becoming quite interesting as we -- as the vehicle emissions are being dealt with, and we're getting the hydrogen economy and demand -- the demand source is really important. 
Whether the PGMs will be impacted on a symmetrical way will depend on price. I think platinum will still be increasing its substitution across on palladium, albeit that will take a bit of time. Rhodium at 20,000 to 25,000 worries me a little on the demand side. But because of its ability to clean NOx emissions at low temperatures, it remains a favored technology. But most sort of numbers, I think the pressure will be to pull it back at around 10,000 to 12,000. I don't think there's issue for rhodium but 25,000 it's a bit higher. 
So depending on the price you're assuming, yes, I think there will be some asymmetry, which will probably favor platinum demand as we go forward. And the other one sort of adjust based on the relative prices between the 3. So your guess is as good as mine as how that will play out, but that's how we see it at the moment.

We are trying a new approach and a new technology. And so if there are any stuff-ups, it's my fault. It's not Paul's and it's not the operators. So we'll see how we go. 
The theme for our presentation is keeping our feet on the ground. And while I'm a believer in the strong fundamentals to demand in our industry and the likely constrain of supply in many of our products, the last thing I want to see in our team is anyone lifting their heads and forgetting about our focus on our continuing business transformation journey. 
So to be clear, we believe we have a portfolio of assets and opportunities that play favorably into the big global themes around climate change, circular economy and the growing importance of material sciences in finding new and exciting uses for our metals and minerals. 
We've been strategic in our outlook and positioning for a number of years, and today's world continues to confirm we are, mostly, more than ever, position to improve and grow our business, both in the short, medium and the longer term. 
I now move to the cautionary statement. You should read carefully, preferably in your own time. On Slide 3, our order of play is consistent with our established routines. I'll touch on performance and highlight a few key points. Stephen, or mister balance, will then run you through the numbers to provide detailed insights and to reinforce our focus on capital and our investment disciplines. And to close, I will take you through how we are transforming the business and positioning for today and the future. 
So again, next slide, please, on #4. On safety, health and environment. For us, the improvement journey continues. First, on safety. Over the last 5 years, we've recorded a 40% reduction in total injuries and an 82% reduction in fatal incidents. For us, despite a couple of serious incidents early in the year, it was our best ever safety performance as we continue our journey towards zero. And as we say, no year is a good year if you've lost someone in your operations. And so we still have to get there, but we're getting very close. And from our point of view, everything is going in to get us there. 
Secondly, on health cases. Those issues are made up of less obvious or immediate hazards of risks in the business, we are also heading in the right direction. And again, significant improvement since 2013, about 95% reduction. So we're very proud of that performance. 
And on the environment, our improved planning and operating disciplines continue to support incident reductions across the group. And as people know, making sure we don't get that call in the middle of the night, requires constant focus, appropriate technical design, operating disciplines and an open and effective governance process to ensure we're doing the right things the right way all the time. 
And for us, we still haven't got to a point where we've eliminated all of our incidents and our early issues last year point to that. But I do want people to understand we're working very hard to eliminate all of those things from the business. And from our point of view, we've made significant progress. But we're certainly not yet where we want to be. 
I've now moved to Page 5. And on our broader ESG context, we continue to make good progress on our critical targets. Our energy efficiency improvements have also supported our greenhouse gas savings. And as you can see, we have met both improvement targets for 2020. Working off our 2016 baseline, and that's represented by the horizontal green bars that we have on those charts, our next step is an absolute reduction of 30% on both by 2030. 
On our social way compliance, and social way being our social standards and the practices package, per our broader operating model approach to business, you can see we are approaching full compliance across the group. Now as you know, these things evolve and develop over time. And so we have now designed the third-generation social way package that will be used as a new and higher bar to community and social engagement. 
And we would say, we've still got a long way to go. We haven't yet got our community relations where we want them to be. But again, just to let you know, we are working very hard in all of our communities and across all of our sites on this particular aspect of the business. The new package goes beyond industry benchmarks and has been imaginatively called Social Way 3.0, so a new industry standard with a title that only an engineer could love. 
Next slide. On COVID-19, despite the encouraging vaccine progress in many countries, it is clear the pandemic and the challenges for most are not going away quickly. Our responsible holistic approach, including supporting our communities, continues. And this broader community approach is an approach we share with many of our industry colleagues, particularly in jurisdictions where government support is less equipped to deal with these types of issues. 
And we have been taking these initiatives further, as we have understood when people in communities are under stress, domestic- and gender-based violence issues can grow. So we're working with our community leaders and governments to make sure we're dealing with all of the direct and indirect impacts of COVID. 
The lives and livelihoods of our employees, their families and the communities are the priority, and we've managed a strong operational recovery at the same time. We've been strengthening and reinforcing protocols to help deal with second waves affecting our operations as well. Our focus on people returning to work post-Christmas has been very important, and we've seen some impacts, but they're being managed effectively. And in anticipation of that post-Christmas surge, we put in extra levels of testing to identify and mitigate risks. 
Based on our latest data, we expect most of the site impacts will be negligible as we move into March. On demand for products, despite lockdowns and limitations, our order books are generally pretty full. And on diamonds, the demand bounce has been quite solid. So the early signs have been encouraging. But we do have some residual risks that will probably remain in some jurisdiction, probably to the mid year, but it's not significant. It's being managed. And from our point of view, I'd have to say the teams have done a great job in managing all the dimensions of the COVID-19 issue. 
On results, an encouraging finishing -- finish after a tough start to the year. Despite all the issues and dramas through the first half, we finished the year running at around 95% of full production capacity. But even more importantly and despite lower volumes, our unit costs and our capital spend were held in tight control. Along with the improving prices, we saw our second half EBITDA recover to $6.5 billion, our highest for a 6-month period since 2011. This recovery, and the disciplines that have gone with the learnings from the Q1 disruptions, have put us in a good position going into 2021. 
On earnings per share, $2.53 for the year or 1.81 or $1.81 in the second half. The full year return on capital employed, at 17%, was impacted by our higher capital base. We're spending on Quellaveco and the Sirius acquisition impacting the denominator for the calculation. We will show pre and post new project spend when we report these quarterly numbers going forward. However, the half -- the second half ROCE number was a pleasing 24%. So that's a good number. 
Hopefully, we're all now on Slide 8 and looking at our 4 key business segments. De Beers has been -- has seen sales picking up through the fourth quarter and continuing into 2021, with site 1 in January, delivering our highest site sales for 3 years. The team will continue to manage production levels to demand and have kept costs very well-managed through the process, with a 10% unit cost improvement year-on-year, despite 18% lower volumes. 
Given our broader restructuring, we expect to see more unit cost improvements through 2021, which the guys have done some really hard yards through the year, and we will continue to work through 2021. 
In copper and nickel, we've delivered consistent performance. In copper, we've navigated the twin challenges of water constraints and COVID, with production in the entire levels, despite the challenges. The effective implementation of social distancing in Chile and Brazil has been a model for all of our operations, with work on water and securing alternative sources in Chile being a real winner for the year. And our Peruvian guys have done great work there, Reuben and the crew in full support. 
On PGMs, a pleasing mining performance and processing production back to 100% levels by year-end. At the same time, the reinstalled A unit at the ACP  has been running very well since late November, after a very careful and well-managed commissioning process by Natasha and the team. So we are looking forward to a better year of both mined and refined production. And with current strong spot prices, we're very well placed to deliver some strong margins and cash generation. 
In Bulks, Minas-Rio Rio has continued to improve. Another record performance in a year, when we were down for 1 month for the planned pipeline inspection, makes it a really an incredible performance. At Kumba, despite lower production, largely as a result of COVID, unit costs were 6% lower, at $31 a tonne, and it was a similar story in our South African thermal coal operations. 
In Met Coal, the spat between Australia and China still remains an issue, although the pricing gap is starting to close as the market adjusts now for deliveries to new customers or adjust to new deliveries for new customers. In addition, we've had our operating challenges. Most recent, the current longwall panel at Moranbah has been moving through some tough ground since last Saturday night, and we recorded a high carbon monoxide gas reading in the waste areas. 
Now carbon monoxide is a result of latent heating in the gulf area. So as per our protocols, we withdrew the workforce, and we commenced monitoring the gas from the gulf since that time. And by the end of the shift, the levels had actually returned to normal. Now we think that might have been the result of the gulf wall, but we're taking extra precautions, we're actually pumping nitrogen in to make sure that we don't have any further gas levels. And we'd expect to return to operations in the next 2 to 3 weeks. We are working with the inspector in Queensland, again, to make sure we've got all the angles covered. But at this stage, I think it is -- we have seen these things before. And it usually takes a week or 2 to get through them. So watching it carefully, but I think the guys have done a good job in handling it and certainly satisfied that all the issues have been covered. 
On Grosvenor, the key issue for us is the timing of the restart and the commissioning of the new longwall. We expect to restart sometime in the second half of the year, but we don't want to preempt the inquiry or its filings. And so we will be both patient and cautious in our approach. 
And so if I can go to the next slide, please. Okay. Consistent with growing cash flow and returns, you should be on Slide 9 -- consistent with growing cash flow and returns, for Anglo American, the improvement journey does continue. While we've reported a 43% margin for the year, our 47% margin in the second half was the eye catcher. Our 2023 target is greater than 45% using long term prices. And with Quellaveco and our other projects and the incremental projects we have, in the pipeline, we'd expect to hit those numbers. 
The long-term improvement approach has been driven by portfolio restructuring, our technical reconfiguration through Tony and his team and in his work with the operating leaders, of the assets that stayed within the portfolio, and the introduction of our industrial operating disciplines brought by the Anglo operating model. And that is unique to the industry. 
The total change package supported a 45% real improvement in our operating costs, or around 30% in nominal terms. And that's despite running 50% less assets. And that is -- we've actually grown production by around 12%. That's in 2019 numbers. Obviously, we've come back in '20. But again, we'll be back on that profile this year and beyond. 
And as I've said before, the improvement journey has no end in terms of what we see. In our Phase II work, we'll continue to drive up the benchmark performance curves on our capital assets, while building incremental and new capacity that has a lower cost structure, further supporting our margin growth. So it's not just about growth, it's about quality growth in terms of the portfolio. 
Now if we go to Slide 10 and looking forward, we have carefully sequenced the execution of our portfolio of incremental and new projects, which drive significant margin accretive production growth over the next 5 years and beyond. From a strategic perspective, this growth is also continuing our portfolio repositioning towards future-enabling commodities. And so our 20% growth by 2023, and that's compared to 2018, is more like 30% if we compare it to last year's production. And that is well underway. And the 25% by 2025 builds off our technology footprint and is as much about quality, as I said, as it is about top line growth. 
And our sequencing -- and with our sequencing, we are not trying to do too many things at the same time. That's being considered quite carefully in the way we've phased our projects. Now Stephen will step you through some of this later, but the 2 main new constituents in our stage growth process are Quellaveco and Woodsmith. 
On Quellaveco, we're tracking the original schedule, despite COVID. So whilst we picked up 6 months in the pre-COVID execution work, we've given most of that back to COVID. And whilst we are still dealing with some cases on site, we're at about 90% manning levels, and we've got the work focusing on the critical task item. So we do -- we're still doing very well on the schedule, and Tom and the guys have done a great job. 
We have also -- we have now also approved the installation of coarse particle recovery in the plant following very successful test work. So that will enhance overall production recovery, and we'll continue to improve the economics of the program as we try and bring our commissioning process forward in terms of additional production, which we can see we can do as a consequence of the latest drilling. 
The other thing that we've done is we're in the process of committing to fully renewable energy power, a fully renewable energy power contract, which will also improve our carbon emission credentials as part of the development of the project. 
At Woodsmith, progress is solid. The tunnel has now been driven to almost 13 kilometers of its 37-kilometer target. Our detailed technical review is nearing completion and confirms the quality of the overall project design and the development approach within the parameters we had set. Ahead of our scheduled mid-2021 update to the market, which will present final capital and schedule estimates, we are refining 2 aspects of the project that we had allowed for in our investment case. 
We will likely bring forward the investment in additional ventilation to increase early production flexibility, and we are working through the detailed scheduling of the 2 shaft installations. Based on our work and involvement so far, we're very happy with the asset and its market potential. And importantly, it sits in the Q1 of the cost curve and is therefore capable of some really attractive returns. And from our point of view, these are really important points to focus on. 
I will again stress the point that it's not a potash mine, it's polyhalite, 4 nutrients, low carbon footprint. We don't have to do all that downstream processing. And we can put product on a boat and ship it literally anyone and deliver it to almost any market in the world. This is a very different project to the ones you've been hearing about. And from our point of view, we think it's great potential. We're certainly very pleased with what we've got, based on everything we've seen so far. 
So if I go to the next slide, finally, and most importantly, on our business improvement focus, as I've said before, the first steps were in the operating model, setting a stable base, from which we use our P101 program, which is about getting all of our capital assets up to top industry performance, not in top quartile, we're talking top. P101 means best of the best to drive improving performance levels. To date, the team has delivered around $2 billion in raw numbers in the improvement, which is in terms of annual EBITDA on the business improvement side, through efficiencies and operational delivery. 
The more difficult issues, we've given some of that back due to the instability that we have in some parts of the process and the ACP failure in platinum is an example of that instability. So the opportunity to get that additional $1 billion back to the bottom line is around stability and consistency in the operation. That's a real focus in the operating model. Yes, we've come a lot of productivity to drop it say, out of that cost. But getting that stability to get to the next, that for Tony and his team and the operating leaders across the business. We're able to approach, but we where we would be. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Stephen."

Two, return to your holders, now 40% paying ratio dividend; and three, a strong balance sheet and invest in the future. And that balance really sets us up for a strong and sustainable future. 
So on Slide 13, let's turn to the 2020 numbers our EBITDA, good recovery, $6.2 billion in the second half, a record since '11. Looking at the full year, strong present [ earnings ] results, this [ unit costs ] income challenges that we had. Earnings per share fairly consistent, and that then flows through to consistent dividends. Net debt at 0.6x EBITDA benefited from good prices, but more to come in terms of that story with the unwind of the working capital buildup that we had this year. Half 2, free cash flow, $3.3 billion drawn with SSA, without the help of the working capital. 
So if we turn to Slide 14, looking across the different venues, recovery of diamonds in the second half, strong mining margins, at 54%, which talks to the underlying quality and resilience of the assets, $650 million in revenue from site 1 in 2021. So encouraging recovery so far, helped by a decent selling season through Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, and lower rough and polished inventory. 
Copper, good performance on unit cost of 113 cents per pound, we had some additional noncash movements in provisions in the year. But again, [indiscernible] margins. PGMs, good recovery in the second half, plus price on spots around or above 3,000 PGM an ounce. And remember that 60% had previously known as minor metals. Obviously [indiscernible]. Even with the ACP disruption, last year, we generated, I think, $2 billion of revenue from palladium and $2 billion from radium [indiscernible] '21, the DA which as we mentioned, would be most likely [ business in dollars ].
In [indiscernible], Minas-Rio has been our outstanding performer, gaining good stability into driving the sales in here at 24 million tonnes of high iron content product. That is $1.9 billion of EBITDA [indiscernible] 2%. Our convert margin was 55% and an 80% return on capital employed year. Clearly we see the prices that those higher-quality products from both Minas and Kumba, we believe [indiscernible] managing steel industry. Clearly, a topic for met coal that improved prices totally persist into 2021. So overall, a good set of numbers, and particularly pleasing with the recovery through the second half. 
And just before I leave this slide, I encourage you to play with all the spreadsheet that I think is the first-line and please form your own view on forward prices across the year. But I would note if you won't ask moving [indiscernible], if you put in spots from a couple of weeks ago, you could well end up with a number [indiscernible] all it does work. 
Turning to slide [indiscernible], a quick look at drivers of EBITDA shows that overall, we're at relatively consistent levels, even with the volatility for price, COVID and operational disruptions. Importantly, as I mentioned, we are seeing underlying cost and volume improvements, primarily this period of copper in Minas-Rio, but we are very focused on turning on as operating challenges at PGMs and met coal going forward. So I think you see the improvements drop to the bottom line and I'll expand on that a little bit more on to the next slide [indiscernible]. 
[indiscernible] on Slide 16. The half as shown a bit of help from PGM improvement, core net debt down to the $0.5 billion and as well with our target gearing at a ratio of 0.6 [indiscernible]. 
[indiscernible] very well to stage of delivery. Just to remind you $5.6 billion of net debt includes $1 billion of [indiscernible] accounting  [indiscernible] $1.6 billion for inventory build all through the year, largely in PGMs and diamonds and particularly in PGM, where we're used to see that unwind over the [ year ], so actually in a very good position, a strong balance sheet, a strong pipeline value [indiscernible] to able to retain good returns to shareholders. 
If we go to slide [indiscernible] favorably balanced, reposition the portfolio when required and return cash to shareholders. So mentioned good cash across the period, $2.7 billion after funding sustaining capital with $3.3 billion in the second half. As such, we use that to support the payout ratio based item with a total of $1.2 billion declared for 2020. We allocated $1.4 billion in terms of growth CapEx, $0.7 billion in terms of the acquisition of Sirius minerals and a further piece of the puzzle, $0.2 billion remains from a $1 billion share buyback scheme that we initiated in July '19 and completed early in 2020. 
So if we turn to Slide 18 and just over the next couple of slides, I want to spend a little bit of time just focusing on CapEx. I know there's a few questions out there to understand the timing, particularly in how that relates to the volumes. And so I'll focus and talk through in detail, both in terms of sustaining and growth CapEx, and hopefully, you get a better understanding of some of our priorities. Just to be clear, there's no change to previous guidance on CapEx that we provided back in December. 
So let's have a first look at sustaining CapEx on this slide. You can see that there's a long-term sustaining CapEx level around that $3 billion as our portfolio evolves and Lifex [ aimed ] is on top of that, and that will be a little bit variable. We are seeing slightly elevated levels of Lifex CapEx over the next couple of years, around that $700 million to $900 million per year, and that's as we complete the development of projects that you know around Venetia underground, Aquila and Kolomela. 
Longer term average, more around that region of $500 million per year. The underlying sustaining CapEx is also a touch higher in the next couple of years. The main drivers being the deferral of spend from 2020 and as we reprogram those work streams over the next year or 2. 
We've also included the desalination plant at Collahuasi. It's probably a combination of sustaining and growth that supports both current water requirements and wider expansion of Collahuasi, which I'll come onto in a moment. And so it's probably a combination of growth and sustaining. Needless to say, there's some growth -- I mean better numbers simply linked to the growth in the portfolio, a copper unit equivalent basis as we deliver that growth. 
So let's now look at growth CapEx on Slide 19. So in terms of growth CapEx, again, I'll walk you through a couple of slides just to provide a bit more clarity on what we're setting up here, particularly in terms of that growth CapEx and how that links to delivering the growth volumes over time. Again, just to emphasize, no change to the guidance that we provided back in December. So if we exclude Woodsmith just for the moment, growth CapEx per year around $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next 3 years. And with that, we see our copper equivalent production increasing by around at 20% by 2023 of that 2018 base. 
It's disciplined, it's margin accretive and predominantly focused around forward-facing or future enabling portfolio, it's technology friendly and links directly to the decarbonization agenda that we have in many cases. The CapEx that's forecast on this slide out to '23 also provides some of the earlier spend on some of that volume growth beyond 2023 on projects that we do anticipate approving in that interim period. For example, Collahuasi Phase I, Mohali cline and the MG plant debottlenecking. 
We go to Slide 20, please. So let's look at some of those projects in detail. Each case, attractive IRRs. And as Mark mentioned, they're well sequenced across time so that we managed to spend in the balance sheet appropriately. Quellaveco, as Mark mentioned, progressing well, our share remaining around that 1.5 billion over the next 18 months or so. 
In 2023, we expect to see copper production of 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes. That adds, in its own right, around 10% to our overall copper equivalent volume. At spots from about 2 weeks ago, obviously, it's a fast-moving at least from about 2 weeks ago, that would give us EBITDA of around $1 billion in 2022 and more than $2 billion in 2023 on a 100% basis. 
Another project on the Marine Namibia new vessel, the AMP 3, again on time for delivery. It's a fast returning brownfield project, adds around 500,000 carats at a very high-value per carat on a 100% basis. And for us, it adds about 1% in copper equivalent volumes for our 50% share. 
Turning to Collahuasi, it's clearly a world-class long life asset, and we're looking at efficient and incremental growth over time in a number of phases. Phase I, which see us adding additional mill and related infrastructure our CapEx while still being refined around [ 1 billion ]. Phase I increased throughput by around 20%, moving from about 160,000 to 200,000 tonnes per day. This equates to about 50,000 tonnes per annum of additional copper for our share. And that's about copper equivalent production growth at the group level. 
We'll also progressively look at technology initiatives, such as bulk ore sorting to further optimize the operation, but that's more likely to be in a Phase II expansion. Those studies are underway. That would most likely be a full fourth line expansion, increasing throughput to around 300,000 tonnes per day. And that would add about 100,000 tonnes of copper equivalent production in our share. Obviously, we will require new permits, and it's a little early to provide capital units on that just at this stage. 
[ Cliner ], a long life asset, we've almost already doubled production over the last 8 years, without spending major capital. The focus has been on embedding the operating model and production efficiencies. And while we'll continue to drive efficiencies, the next stage will require some debottlenecking. And it's likely that we'll add some additional concentrator capacity, which will add around 300,000 to 600,000 PGM ounces of production. 
While still being refined, it's expected to cost between around $0.8 billion to $1.4 billion. And again, we take a technology focus and the studies to analyze this are underway through 2021. 
So if I could then turn to Slide 21. So if we look beyond 2023, you would have seen earlier this week, we approved the Sishen UHDMS project. It adds iron units to existing production, if you assume that we're well constrained by increasing iron grade and quality of product. And importantly, the Sishen adds 3 -- at least 3 to 4 years of mine life. 
In terms of Woodsmith, as Mark mentioned, the Q1 cost curve asset with strong margins. We've committed to spend around $0.5 billion this year, and we'll provide further guidance in July. [ In this iron market], it would add around 5% to our copper equivalent production when it's fully ramped up to that 10 million tonnes production level. 
And Moranbah-Grosvenor, again a brownfield debottlenecking plant -- debottlenecking of the wash plant. Immediate focus, though, does remain bringing Grosvenor safely back in H2. But when completed, would add around 3% copper equivalent growth in around 2024. 
And finally, on the technology projects, there's a number of fast payback, relatively small individual investments, and there's quite a bit more detail provided in the appendix. Programs such as the bulk ore sorting, or the coarse particle rotation projects, cost competitive, modernize the operations to set us up on a more sustainable basis. For example, the hydrogen haul trucks and really underpin that journey as we move forward.
So if we move to Slide 22, just to pull those themes together across the 3 pillars, as we've spoken about on our journey through to 2022. The 3 pillars: one, sustaining CapEx provides a continuing base for delivering on that efficient; two, technology and innovation adds to that in a productive and sustainable way; and then the growth projects, as I just discussed, build on and transition the portfolio. 
So our $3 billion to $4 billion improvement target to 2022 remains very much on target. So let's just quickly look at each of those pillars. Firstly, on the operating model in P101 and some examples. So the business on the ground is getting more efficient as we often spoke about Minas-Rio, approaching 26 million tonnes by 2022. P101, systematically targeting opportunities across the value chain. 
Some examples, again, 15% increase in truck utilization at Barro Alto, increased haul truck payloads at Los Bronces, an 8% throughput increase at the Minas-Rio beneficiation plant and world-class shovel performance across multiple operations. 
As Mark highlighted, we've seen about $2 billion increase in the underlying business run rates and $1 billion of that has dropped through to the bottom line to EBITDA so far, $800 million in the P101 category and about $0.2 billion in the technology area. Our focus now remains on delivering that stable and capable platform, so we get more of those improvements to drop to that bottom line. 
On the technology and development front, digital technologies, for example, the predictive maintenance, are leading the way and have delivered that $0.2 billion today. Some other examples, bulk ore sorting, testing and early rollout going well. We've also had a pilot plant shows about a 10% reduction in energy and water intensity for that operation. 
Full-scale units are now being installed at Mogalakwena, Barro Alto and Los Bronces, and expected to be fully operational within 12 months. Bulk ore sorting also allows us to process more accurately by discarding some of the lower value ores before we put them through the plant, also resulting in energy and water savings per unit processed as well. And ultimately, that can drive a 5% to 10% grade uplift, which flows through to production and a 3% to 4% unit cost improvement. With bulk ore sorting, we expect to see initial benefits to EBITDA of probably $01. billion to $0.2 billion per annum, a very strong run rate energy [ has that ]. 
Another example, coarse particle recovery. First full-scale plant in now installed at [ Al Sodoto ] through separations on traded ore on a higher pebble size that saves around 30% in energy and crushing and greater water recovery in terms of reuse from tailings, up to a 50% benefit in water usage. 
Combination of those factors can drive a 5% to 10% production increase and up to a 5% reduction in unit costs. We believe that this technology is applicable across as many as 6 of the group's key assets, including Quellaveco. And we've announced the approval of that project today. Limited benefit by 2022, but will potentially drive EBITDA benefits rising over time to around $250 million per year. .
Now I've already touched on the growth pillar, so we won't really go over that. But again, just to confirm, we remain on track for that $3 billion to $4 billion target improvement by 2022, that we first committed to back in 2018. 
So just to conclude, on Slide 23, our story remains consistent. It's all about balance. Returns continuing with $6.1 billion in dividends and buybacks in '17. The balance sheet remains strong. Our commitment to discipline remains while we deliver this value-added growth of around that 20% level through to 2023. That, in turn, drives our margins into our target range of 45% to 50%. 
Mark, back to you."

And now we'll look more broadly and forward across the business. I am now on Page 25. So on diamonds, at an industry level, the fundamentals continue to improve. Our views on a positive recovery are simply built on industry fundamentals a",2758,"Thanks, Stephen. And now we'll look more broadly and forward across the business. I am now on Page 25. So on diamonds, at an industry level, the fundamentals continue to improve. Our views on a positive recovery are simply built on industry fundamentals and the associated buying behaviors of our customers. 
First, on demand, demand has been steady and the outlook looks pretty encouraging. So given long-term and most recent experience, we expect demand to continue to follow global GDP and perhaps more importantly, for a luxury good, personal disposable income, or PDI. Both GDP and PDI are expected to grow by around 3% per year over the next decade as the middle class is growing in size and their aspiration to grow as we better target advertising and key customer segments. 
In China, currently, the second biggest diamond market after the U.S., Chinese middle classes are expected to purchase around $1 billion worth of diamond jewelry over this same period. Globally, the demand profile is shifting towards female self-purchasing, now making up almost 1/3 of diamond jewelry purchases. And the continuing shift in focus on branding and provenance is something De Beers has lead for many years. 
On supply, looking forward in terms of natural diamond production, it's generally agreed the industry is on a flat to declining production trajectory. There has been a lack of significant kimberlite discoveries most recently, and that's on a global basis. In addition, some 15% of existing supply by volume has been taken off stream or has reached the end of its mine life. The combination of growth in consumer demand for diamond jewelry and the flat to declining production, points to good prospects for the diamond industry, both in the medium to longer term. Certainly, we expect the recovery to continue in 2021 off those fundamentals. 
On De Beers and our branding story, and this has really been the most significant part of Bruce and team's work most recently, we're building off the De Beers brand and tailoring our offering to target segments. That is a key to the driving price for only the best philosophy that we have in De Beers. 
Our drive towards longer-term margin improvement is built from our COVID response, with the accelerated business transformation necessitated by our stark first half reality being a key player in driving the necessary modernization business with more efficient inventory management, increased online purchasing and growing consumer design for products with demonstrable ethical and sustainability credentials, including an enhanced depreciation of the natural world, really have been key considerations in the evolution of our change model. These are all messages that are resonating and consistent with the Anglo American and De Beers branding positions. 
The De Beers' focus on continuing cost reduction reflects what all good businesses should be doing. And shortening production to customer times, increasing our own jewelry business offerings and premium brands are all part of a strategic remaking of the business, all connected through digital technologies in mining, processing, cutting, selling, tracing. They're all part of the strategic makeover Bruce and Tony and their teams in terms of technology application are joined at the hip. 
Consistent with our De Beers strategy, our Lightbox strategy for lab-grown products has also been an important part of our strategic approach to different market segments. De Beers is all about natural products that reflect and recognize every natural diamond is special or one of a kind, a measure of a personal commitment on our very most, or our most special personal relationships. 
On Lightbox, a fun fashion lab-grown product with growing discounts, now around 60% to 70% compared to the natural product. And from our point of view, a good market to be in, but sub market to the naturals. And whilst that's not a simple 2-market piece, what we are seeing is the differentiation of those 2 segments in people's mind increases over time. And Bruce and the team are very sensitive to make sure the messaging is right in both context. 
Now to go to Slide 27. On PGMs, we have another sector with strong fundamentals and a great long-term potential. Obviously, the news from Russia overnight probably increases the short-term potential, given palladium and nickel impacts. PGM pricing is also being driven by strong fundamentals on a broader basis. The strength in demand with mixed supplies resulted in a 50% increase in PGM basket price in 2020, and this strength in pricing has obviously continued into the new year. 
On the demand side, ever-increasing emission standards is crucial for the auto industry and means higher loadings of PGMs. We believe a 40% increase in loadings in 2029 is quite possible. In particular, tighter emission standards in both Europe and China are driving demand for palladium and rhodium, both are currently in deficit. Palladium is expected by many to remain in deficit for at least 2 to 3 years, even after taking into account a 10% substitution to platinum. 
And in our case, it's not a bad thing. We're happy to see platinum pick up more market. But again, when we look at platinum, it's the all-round PGM, a diverse range of other demand sources continue to emerge: food storage, glass making, 5G technology being some of the examples. The point here being that these are young metals with unique properties, the full application of which is still being understood. 
And we're not standing back waiting for others to recognize potential applications. Through the AP Ventures Fund, we are investing in the development of PGMs for new applications to unlock their full potential, which, for example, we think will be a key for a vital hydrogen economy. Though the AP Ventures Fund has to date raised $325 million of our $100 million see it coming. And so we're very excited about where we are and what the potential is in the industry. 
And on the supply side, there are very few near-term medium -- very few near- to medium-term supply growth options across PGM production, 128 now. At the same time, currently minable assets are depleted. And with PGM processing capacity at a premium, we're in a massive strategic position of more than 50% of the world ex-Russia smelting, refining and associated base levels refining capacity. And in the longer term, producers are unsure whether to expand production until they see more evidence of the BEE and hydrogen developments. And certainly, from our perspective, hydrogen today is a real conversation and moving quicker by the day. 
And while we don't have to worry about the decisions on putting more capital into new downstream processing capacity, we've already got the lion's share, we can build out incremental mine opportunities while debottlenecking and squeezing better margins from a full value chain position, and it is unique in this industry. 
The result, it is likely price will continue to do the heavy lifting in what is a constrained market. We have a great business, with highly competitive and improving unit costs of around $700 an ounce, which supports a 70% mining margin across our basket of PGM products. The remarkable point to note, after a very tough year, we have still delivered a record financial performance, and we have no doubt -- and we have no debt in the business and with 70% mining margin as we stand today. So from our point of view, we have a unique position in what is shaping up to be a long [ trigger up ] to the portfolio. 
So to Slide 29. talking about portfolio, our future enabling commodity mix, alongside quality with diversity, are positive differentiators in our industry, consumer-driven demand for diamonds, crop nutrients and PGMs and environmental themes and electrification driving demand for our copper, nickel and, again, PGMs, contributes to the hydrogen economy, are all big positive for Anglo American and our portfolio. 
And our iron ore and met coal assets are high quality, both physically and chemically, and therefore, desirable inputs for steel mills, and in particular, future green steel mills. And for those that understand with high iron ore values and low deleterious elements, the green technologies are far more efficient, the higher quality the iron ore feed. So we are uniquely positioned in that market as well for the longer term. 
And for a green -- and for a general investor, our mix across these high demand growth sectors is not just for the next 5 years, but for the next 10 to 20 years. And so from our point of view, positioning the business through 2040 is something we've been thinking about and doing for the last few years. 
So to Slide 30. Our role in making the world a better place is the way we think about a number of the issues that we're working through and making sure they connect with good performance. Our technology push, led by Tony and in partnership with our business leaders, is part of why we've been able to commit to making the business carbon neutral by 2040. Earlier than most, but we think that this is the right time line as it will continue to drive us while supporting our relentless push down all of our cost curves. 
Importantly, it's more than a target. We have plans to get there, and we have plans to get 8 of our sites to carbon neutrality by 2030. And as you know, we've contracted to be on 100% renewable power in Chile and Brazil by 2021, we saw in wind initiatives. And in Peru, we are already working through the same options for the Quellaveco business. 
On our planned exit from the South African thermal coal operations, I'm pleased to report we're making good progress, with the preparation work on the demerger option certainly available to us probably during the course of this year. And if we do see a trade sale option emerge that we think has merits, we will still look at that. But certainly, on the demerger option, we're well advanced and are in a good place to continue the process and announce something during the course of this year. 
And on Cerrejón, we also intend to exit our 1/3 in Cerrejón certainly within 3 years. But obviously, we've got 2 partners that we have to work with to make sure that's done the right way. 
Now turning to Slide 31 and talking to carbon reduction and turning carbon reduction in our competitive advantage is something we recognized back in 2015. And again, Tony and the team working on the options with our Corporate Relations team. We've been thinking through the technical issues, and that's been led by Tony and how we set the business up to connect with our communities. 
So you've heard about that decarbonization strategy and how it applies to operations. We think 2040 is a challenging target, but it is deliverable and we have a plan to deliver. And while we don't want to get caught up in the conversation around scope 3 emissions and what we call the carbon reduction arms race, we believe the target that we have is appropriate and reflects the actions we're putting in place, which will also improve our competitive position. 
Now on scope 3 emissions, we make a few simple observations. First, our scope 3 work has helped us understand more clearly the carbon intensity of our value chain. And the one thing that is clear is there are many different ways of calculating numbers. Now off the base that we've used, we understand that, for example, thermal coal represents around 25% of our carbon emission. 
So obviously, an exit from thermal coal over the next 3 years would impact our reported scope 3 numbers in that order.  But we also point to our work on Scope 1 and 2 emissions, where the technical work will also impact adjacencies, how we connect with our communities. And we also think there are credits, both in supply chain in terms of what we're doing at the community, to further impact our scope 3 emissions. 
In the steel industry, you've got met coal and iron ore. And again, they represent the 2 other most significant areas in terms of our scope 3 emissions. For iron ore, it represents somewhere around 45% to 50% of our reported Scope 3 emissions. And the industry tells us they'd expect to have green steel production making up about 50% of the world's steel supply by 2040. And you can apply those assumptions across -- really across the terms of our iron ore business, remembering that the products we produce are favored in those new technologies because of the high-quality, when you start to get a sense of what we can do in iron ore.
In met coal, the really important point to note that the demand we don't have, significant alternatives that we can replace existing technologies in steel very quickly. So based on what we think the direction of travel and the timing it would take to do the conversion to green steel industry, that timing would be far longer than the life of our met coal assets. 
So what we're thinking through is how do we continue to make improvements in those businesses and make a meaningful contribution to our partners in the industry, but at the same time, continue to improve our carbon position. Now we don't think it's right to just think about depleting assets. We don't think that's the right way that we should be working with all the assets we can improve, and we're working through that. And we'll keep you posted on how that thinking is all coming together over the next 12 months. 
We've got our sustainability update in April. We'll again update at the end and continue to update you over the next 12 months. And the one thing that I think is important to note, the credibility we've built on how we're attacking the Scope 1 and Scope 2 issues is the stage we're dealing with Scope 3. And again, when we come with the final positions and targets, it will be thoughtful, it will be backed by a plan, it will be supported by the technology and how we believe we should shape the portfolio into the future. And as you know, the work we're doing today is all about the future and certainly the positioning of our portfolio in the long term. 
On Page 32, I think I want to step back and reflect on our purpose again. It's founded on the delivery of sustainable returns to shareholders, employees and our business and society and stakeholders. And so to reimagine mining to improve people's lives is not something we just say, it is what we believe we must do as a business, both through the value we contribute to our society, our host communities and society, and also in the way we [ provide ] basic materials that it enable the world to be sustainable in all of expansions. 
Our business, we keep our targets pretty simple: We target a better than 10% free cash flow on capital employed, and that's after making sure we're replacing depleted resources, as the prime measure of our effectiveness as business managers. To measure the efficiency of how we got that free cash flow, we measure with capital employed in the range, 15% to 20%, which is about measuring the efficiency of those cash flows. 
And then we have our 7 performance pillars that look at safety, health, environment, our competitive cost position in each of our target markets and as a business, how we set the balance sheet up to be flexible as Stephen has reported for you today. And that's the focus of everyone within Anglo American, and everybody has a responsibility to make sure every day we're moving closer to hitting those targets consistently and improving those numbers on a day-to-day basis. 
And then finally, on Page 33. Just to remind you about our investment proposition, and it's pretty simple. We have the assets, we have the people, and we have delivered industry-leading returns since 2000 to interact [ 33% ] a year. And we have set the foundation to perform through 2030 and beyond. And we've got the portfolio, and we're in the right businesses to continue to improve that performance. 
So with that, we'll pause for questions, just to say Stephen and Tony are also here to answer the really hard questions. And so we'll hand across to the moderator."

You saw that, what's now 18 months ago, of July 19, I think it was, we announced the $1 billion buyback. So it's something that we do think about. It's something that we actively discuss and something that actively consider. If prices continue, then obviously, that challenge comes nearer term even with the growth spend. But I'd probably see that has been in the form of some sort of special return above the base. 
Remembering, the beauty of the payout ratio is that, that also increases in terms of amount as profits increase. And so 40% of a couple of billion is bigger than 40%, $1 billion. So it sort of naturally adjusts in addition to considering additional returns."

But certainly, in terms of application, the PGM suite are attractive for a whole range of reasons, rhodium, for example. 
So we're watching it carefully, our ability to accelerate. We are already improving at Amandelbult. At Mogalakwena, we've got incremental improvements planned. And most have to be planned out carefully because we've got communities that we've got to make sure that we've got good relationships as we grow the business. And we've got other assets where the people are aware of what they're taking over. 
So we've got the ability to accelerate and get bigger. But we still think it's a bit too early to call anything big. And from our point of view, probably best to debottle -- continue our debottlenecking and improving the processing operations, and making sure we're getting the best bang from our buck for our internally sourced products by getting our cost down.

And the living mining concept that Tony's been talking to for those that know the product will have a sense of what we've got in our heads and innate work in such a way and making sure those 2 pieces connect is a really strategic approach to making sure we're developing partnerships, and we don't have this old paternalistic management approach to managing communities. 
I mean you don't manage communities, you have to partner with communities, whether that's on heritage issues or whether that's on mine development or whether that's the work we do in the communities in developing jobs. And our sustainability targets on being a catalyst for 5 jobs for every 1 job on site. 
If you're doing those sorts of things, you're going to have lots of problems getting your projects away. But I think, look at Quellaveco as a good example. Peru has had a history of challenges. And I think so far, Thomas has done a fantastic job in connecting with the local communities. That's the sort of stuff we have to do to be successful. So it's a big issue.

What worries me for the industry is where we have incidents, whether it's a safety issue, whether it's an environmental issue, whether it's a heritage issue. These sorts of things tend to harden up regulators in dealing with the industry in an open and constructive way. 
So we've all got to do better, connect better and help communities understand what we actually do in society. A lot of people don't realize that the mining industry drives 25% gross GDP through 10% on a denomination basis, another 10% through the services that we use to provide the products we produce. And then we drive industry's ability to be more competitive. And people don't understand that you need copper and nickel and all of these things to decarbonize the world's economy. So we've got to get our message out there much better than we have. 
Our plate base work, for example, is about getting the 2 billion people that are really influential with NGOs and helping them understand what work we to do and how we're trying to partner.

With a strong catch-up that you guys could quote later part of the year, the 5% price increase in January. It looks like conditions are probably stronger than most of as expected. Is there, okay, could we expect a faster unwind of inventory in the course of H1 already? That's my first question. 
My second one is on PGMs and really reflecting on your Slide 27, when you're showing an increase in [ earnings ] with EU7 and China 7 standards coming by 2025. And if you could perhaps help us understand if some PGMs are going to be impacted more than others? Is it more of a gold and palladium story, which would exclude the restock we're seeing at the moment? Or would you say those standards would impact all the 3 of them in a symmetric way? 
My last question is on emissions. When we look at [ source of ] emissions, and Mark, you mentioned that fugitive methane emissions are [indiscernible] a bit share of your Scope 1 in met coal. I know the core leg of the strategy mainly about thermal. But if you only stay ahead of the curve on this theme is not a time to also consider met coal as a little bit more problematic than is usually perceived. And obviously, you had some operational issues at Moranbah, we've seen China pushing back on imports. I'm just wondering whether it is still worth deploying technology, CapEx and time in a business which is facing so many headwinds. Thanks."

So the focus for us on working capital then largely moved to a PGM buildup that we had. We've done a lot of work, and the team have done enormous amount of planning out over the next 12 plus months, but that will take us a little bit longer as we see it today, but we continue to look for opportunities to unwind that working capital as well.

Look, on the PGMs, it's a very good question. And as you know, there's also rhodium now it's in the mix as well.

And as you know, there's also rhodium now it's in the mix as well. When you look at the hydrogen, where we produce, I think it's around 100,000 ounces of rhodium, it's up near 30,000 now. So all of these things are becoming quite interesting as we -- as the vehicle emissions are being dealt with, and we're getting the hydrogen economy and demand -- the demand source is really important. 
Whether the PGMs will be impacted on a symmetrical way will depend on price. I think platinum will still be increasing its substitution across on palladium, albeit that will take a bit of time. Rhodium at 20,000 to 25,000 worries me a little on the demand side. But because of its ability to clean NOx emissions at low temperatures, it remains a favored technology. But in those sort of numbers, I think the pressure will be to pull it back at around 10,000 to 12,000. I don't think there's issue for rhodium but 25,000 it's a bit higher. 
So depending on the price you're assuming, yes, I think there will be some asymmetry, which will probably favor platinum demand as we go forward. And the other one will sort of adjust, based on the relative prices between the 3. So your guess is as good as mine as how that will play out, but that's how we see it at the moment. 
On met coal, you're right in saying methane and emissions that we're focusing on. Tony, do you want to talk about Pierre's work and how we're thinking about broadly the emissions, but in particular, the handling of the leak and the research work we're doing."

We are trying a new approach and a new technology. And so if there are any stuff-ups, it's my fault. It's not Paul's and it's not the operators. So we'll see how we go. 
The theme for our presentation is keeping our feet on the ground. And while I'm a believer in the strong fundamentals to demand in our industry and the likely constrain of supply in many of our products, the last thing I want to see in our team is anyone lifting their heads and forgetting about our focus on our continuing business transformation journey. 
So to be clear, we believe we have a portfolio of assets and opportunities that play favorably into the big global themes around climate change, circular economy and the growing importance of material sciences in finding new and exciting uses for our metals and minerals. 
We've been strategic in our outlook and positioning for a number of years, and today's world continues to confirm we are, mostly, more than ever, position to improve and grow our business, both in the short, medium and the longer term. 
I now move to the cautionary statement. You should read carefully, preferably in your own time. On Slide 3, our order of play is consistent with our established routines. I'll touch on performance and highlight a few key points. Stephen, or mister balance, will then run you through the numbers to provide detailed insights and to reinforce our focus on capital and our investment disciplines. And to close, I will take you through how we are transforming the business and positioning for today and the future. 
So again, next slide, please, to #4. On safety, health and environment, for us, the improvement journey continues. First, on safety. Over the last 5 years, we've recorded a 40% reduction in total injuries and an 82% reduction in fatal incidents. For us, despite a couple of serious incidents early in the year, it was our best ever safety performance as we continue our journey towards zero. And as we say, no year is a good year if you've lost someone in your operations. And so we still have to get there, but we're getting very close. And from our point of view, everything is going in to get us there. 
Secondly, on health cases. Those issues are made up of less obvious or immediate hazards of risks in the business, we are also heading in the right direction. And again, significant improvement since 2013, about 95% reduction. So we're very proud of that performance. 
And on the environment, our improved planning and operating disciplines continue to support incident reductions across the group. And as people know, making sure we don't get that call in the middle of the night, requires constant focus, appropriate technical design, operating disciplines and an open and effective governance process to ensure we're doing the right things the right way all the time. 
And for us, we still haven't got to a point where we've eliminated all of our incidents and our early issues last year point to that. But I do want people to understand we're working very hard to eliminate all of those things from the business. And from our point of view, we've made significant progress. But we're certainly not yet where we want to be. 
I've now moved to Page 5. And on our broader ESG context, we continue to make good progress on our critical targets. Our energy efficiency improvements have also supported our greenhouse gas savings, and as you can see, we have met both improvement targets for 2020. Working off our 2016 baseline, and that's represented by the horizontal green bars that we have on those charts, our next step is an absolute reduction of 30% on both by 2030. 
On our social way compliance and social way being our social standards and the practices package, per our broader operating model approach to business, you can see we are approaching full compliance across the group. Now as you know, these things evolve and develop over time. And so we have now designed the third-generation social way package that will be used as a new and higher bar for community and social engagement. 
And we would say, we've still got a long way to go. We haven't yet got our community relations where we want them to be. But again, just to let you know, we are working very hard in all of our communities and across all of our sites on this particular aspect of the business. The new package goes beyond industry benchmarks and has been imaginatively called Social Way 3.0, so a new industry standard with a title that only an engineer could love. 
Next slide. On COVID-19, despite the encouraging vaccine progress in many countries, it is clear the pandemic and the challenges for most are not going away quickly. Our responsible holistic approach, including supporting our communities, continues. And this broader community approach is an approach we share with many of our industry colleagues, particularly in jurisdictions where government support is less equipped to deal with these types of issues. 
And we have been taking these initiatives further, as we have understood when people in communities are under stress, domestic and gender-based violence issues can grow. So we're working with our community leaders and governments to make sure we're dealing with all of the direct and indirect impacts of COVID. 
The lives and livelihoods of our employees, their families and the communities are the priority, and we've managed a strong operational recovery at the same time. We've been strengthening and reinforcing protocols to help deal with second waves affecting our operations as well. Our focus on people returning to work post-Christmas has been very important, and we've seen some impacts, but they're being managed effectively. And in anticipation of that post-Christmas surge, we put in extra levels of testing to identify and mitigate risks. 
Based on our latest data, we expect most of the site impacts will be negligible as we move into March. On demand for products, despite lockdowns and limitations, our order books are generally pretty full. And on diamonds, the demand bounce has been quite solid. So the early signs have been encouraging. But we do have some residual risks that will probably remain in some jurisdiction, probably to the mid year, but it's not significant. It's being managed. And from our point of view, I'd have to say the teams have done a great job in managing all the dimensions of the COVID-19 issue. 
On results, an encouraging finishing -- finish after a tough start to the year. Despite all the issues and dramas through the first half, we finished the year running at around 95% of full production capacity. But even more importantly and despite lower volumes, our unit costs and our capital spend were held in tight control. Along with the improving prices, we saw our second half EBITDA recover to $6.5 billion, our highest for a 6-month period since 2011. This recovery, and the disciplines that have gone with the learnings from the Q1 disruptions, have put us in a good position going into 2021. 
On earnings per share, $2.53 for the year or 1.81 or $1.81 in the second half. The full year return on capital employed, at 17%, was impacted by our higher capital base. We're spending on Quellaveco and the Sirius acquisition impacting the denominator for the calculation. We will show pre and post new project spend when we report these quarterly numbers going forward. However, the half -- the second half ROCE number was a pleasing 24%. So that's a good number. 
Hopefully, we're all now on Slide 8 and looking at our 4 key business segments. De Beers has been -- has seen sales picking up through the fourth quarter and continuing into 2021, with site 1 in January, delivering our highest site sales for 3 years. The team will continue to manage production levels to demand and have kept costs very well-managed through the process, with a 10% unit cost improvement year-on-year, despite 18% lower volumes. 
Given our broader restructuring, we expect to see more unit cost improvements through 2021, which the guys have done some really hard yards through the year, and we will continue to work through 2021. 
In copper and nickel, we've delivered consistent performance. In copper, we've navigated the twin challenges of water constraints and COVID, with production in the entire levels, despite the challenges. The effective implementation of social distancing in Chile and Brazil has been a model for all of our operations, with work on water and securing alternative sources in Chile being a real winner for the year. And our Peruvian guys have done great work there, Reuben and the crew in full support. 
On PGMs, a pleasing mining performance and processing production back to 100% levels by year-end. At the same time, the reinstalled A unit at the ACP has been running very well since late November, after a very careful and well-managed commissioning process by Natasha and the team. So we are looking forward to a better year of both mined and refined production. And with current strong spot prices, we're very well placed to deliver some strong margins and cash generation. 
In Bulks, Minas-Rio has continued to improve. Another record performance in a year, when we were down for 1 month for the planned pipeline inspection, makes it a really an incredible performance. At Kumba, despite lower production, largely as a result of COVID, unit costs were 6% lower, at $31 a tonne, and it was a similar story in our South African thermal coal operations. 
In met coal, the spat between Australia and China still remains an issue, although the pricing gap is starting to close as the market adjusts now for deliveries for new customers or adjust to new deliveries for new customers. In addition, we've had our operating challenges. Most recent, the current longwall panel at Moranbah has been moving through some tough ground since last Saturday night, and we recorded a high carbon monoxide gas reading in the waste areas. 
Now carbon monoxide is a result of latent heating in the gulf area. So as per our protocols, we withdrew the workforce, and we commenced monitoring the gas from the gulf since that time. And by the end of the shift, the levels had actually returned to normal. Now we think that might have been the result of the gulf wall, but we're taking extra precautions, we're actually pumping nitrogen in to make sure that we don't have any further gas levels. And we'd expect to return to operations in the next 2 to 3 weeks. We are working with the inspector in Queensland, again, to make sure we've got all the angles covered. But at this stage, I think it is -- we have seen these things before. And it usually takes a week or 2 to get through them. So watching it carefully, but I think the guys have done a good job in handling it and certainly satisfied that all the issues have been covered. 
On Grosvenor, the key issue for us is the timing of the restart and the commissioning of the new longwall. We expect to restart sometime in the second half of the year, but we don't want to preempt the inquiry or its filings. And so we will be both patient and cautious in our approach. 
And so if I can go to the next slide, please. Okay. Consistent with growing cash flow and returns, you should be on Slide 9 -- consistent with growing cash flow and returns, for Anglo American, the improvement journey does continue. While we've reported a 43% margin for the year, our 47% margin in the second half was the eye catcher. Our 2023 target is greater than 45% using long term prices. And with Quellaveco and our other projects and the incremental projects we have, in the pipeline, we'd expect to hit those numbers. 
The long-term improvement approach has been driven by portfolio restructuring, our technical reconfiguration through Tony and his team and in his work with the operating leaders, of the assets that stayed within the portfolio, and the introduction of our industrial operating disciplines brought by the Anglo operating model, and that is unique to the industry. 
The total change package supported a 45% real improvement in our operating costs, or around 30% in nominal terms. And that's despite running 50% less assets. And that is -- we've actually grown production by around 12%. That's in 2019 numbers. Obviously, we've come back in '20. But again, we'll be back on that profile this year and beyond. 
And as I've said before, the improvement journey has no end in terms of what we see. In our Phase II work, we'll continue to drive up the benchmark performance curves on our capital assets, while building incremental and new capacity that has a lower cost structure, further supporting our margin growth. So it's not just about growth, it's about quality growth in terms of the portfolio. 
Now if we go to Slide 10 and looking forward, we have carefully sequenced the execution of our portfolio of incremental and new projects, which drive significant margin accretive production growth over the next 5 years and beyond. From a strategic perspective, this growth is also continuing our portfolio repositioning towards future-enabling commodities. And so our 20% growth by 2023, and that's compared to 2018, is more like 30% if we compare it to last year's production. And that is well underway. And the 25% by 2025 builds off our technology footprint and is as much about quality, as I said, as it is about top line growth. 
And our sequencing -- and with our sequencing, we are not trying to do too many things at the same time. That's being considered quite carefully in the way we've phased our projects. Now Stephen will step you through some of this later, but the 2 main new constituents in our stage growth process are Quellaveco and Woodsmith. 
On Quellaveco, we're tracking the original schedule, despite COVID. So whilst we picked up 6 months in the pre-COVID execution work, we've given most of that back to COVID. And whilst we are still dealing with some cases on site, we're at about 90% manning levels, and we've got the work focusing on the critical task item. So we do -- we're still doing very well on the schedule, and Tom and the guys have done a great job. 
We have also -- we have now also approved the installation of coarse particle recovery in the plant, following very successful test work. So that will enhance overall production recovery, and we'll continue to improve the economics of the program as we try and bring our commissioning process forward in terms of additional production, which we can see we can do as a consequence of the latest drilling. 
The other thing that we've done is we're in the process of committing to fully renewable energy power, a fully renewable energy power contract, which will also improve our carbon emission credentials as part of the development of the project. 
At Woodsmith, progress is solid. The tunnel has now been driven to almost 13 kilometers of its 37-kilometer target. Our detailed technical review is nearing completion and confirms the quality of the overall project design and the development approach within the parameters we had set. Ahead of our scheduled mid-2021 update to the market, which will present final capital and schedule estimates, we are refining 2 aspects of the project that we had allowed for in our investment case. 
We will likely bring forward the investment in additional ventilation to increase early production flexibility, and we are working through the detailed scheduling of the 2 shaft installations. Based on our work and involvement so far, we're very happy with the asset and its market potential. And importantly, it sits in the Q1 of the cost curve and is therefore capable of some really attractive returns. And from our point of view, these are really important points to focus on. 
I will again stress the point that it's not a potash mine, it's polyhalite, 4 nutrients, low carbon footprint. We don't have to do all that downstream processing. And we can put product on a boat cheaper than literally anyone and deliver it to almost any market in the world. This is a very different project to the ones you've been hearing about. And from our point of view, we think it's great potential. And we're certainly very pleased with what we've got, based on everything we've seen so far. 
So I go to the next slide. Finally, and most importantly, on our business improvement focus, as I've said before, the first steps were in the operating model, setting a stable base, from which we use our P101 program, which is about getting all of our capital assets up to top industry performance, not in top quartile, we're talking top. P101 means best of the best to drive improving performance levels. To date, the team has delivered around $2 billion in raw numbers in the improvement, which is in terms of annual EBITDA on the business improvement side, through efficiencies and operational delivery. 
The more difficult issues, we've given some of that back due to the instability that we have in some parts of the process and the ACP failure in platinum is an example of that instability. So the opportunity to get that additional $1 billion back to the bottom line is around stability and consistency in the operation. That's a real focus in the operating model. And yes, we've come a lot of productivity to drop it, say, out of that cost. But getting that stability to get to the next, and that's the works in progress [indiscernible] for Tony and his team and the operating leaders across the business. We're able to approach, but [indiscernible] where we would be. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Stephen."

And so you know, I'd like to the number [indiscernible] operations and we'll work hard to recapture that in 2020; two, return to your holders, now 40% paying ratio dividend; and three, a strong balance sheet and invest in the future. And that balance really sets us up for a strong and sustainable future. 
So on Slide 13, let's turn to the 2020 numbers. Our EBITDA, good recovery, $6.2 billion in the second half, a record since '11. Looking at the full year, strong present [indiscernible] results, [indiscernible] income challenges that we had. Earnings per share fairly consistent, and that then flows through to consistent dividends. Net debt at 0.6x EBITDA benefited from good prices, but more to come in terms of that story with the unwind of the working capital buildup that we had this year. Half 2, free cash flow, $3.3 billion drawn with SSA, without the help of the working capital. 
So if we turn to Slide 14, looking across the different venues, this recovery of diamonds in the second half, strong mining margins, at 54%, which talks to the underlying quality and resilience of the assets, [ $600  million ] in revenue from site 1 in 2021. So encouraging recovery so far, helped by a decent selling season through Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, and lower rough and polished inventory. [indiscernible] 
Copper, good performance on unit cost of 113 cents per pound, we had some additional noncash movements in provisions in the year. But again, [indiscernible] margins. PGMs, good recovery in the second half, plus price on spots around or above 3,000 PGM an ounce. And remember that 60% had [indiscernible] previously known as minor metals. Obviously [indiscernible]. Even with the ACP disruption, last year, we generated, I think $2 billion of revenue from palladium and $2 billion from radium [indiscernible] '21, the DA which as we mentioned, would be most likely [ business in dollars ].
In [indiscernible], Minas-Rio has been an outstanding performer, gaining good stability into driving the sales in here at 24 million tonnes of high iron content product. That is $1.9 billion of EBITDA [indiscernible]. Our convert margin was 55% and an 80% return on capital employed year. Clearly we see the prices that those higher-quality products from both Minas and Kumba, we believe [indiscernible] managing steel industry. Clearly, a topic for met coal that improved prices totally persist into 2021. So overall, a good set of numbers, and particularly pleasing with the recovery through the second half. 
And just before I leave this slide, I encourage you to play with all the spreadsheet that I think is the first-line in the [indiscernible] and please form your own view on forward prices across the year. But I would note if you won't ask moving [indiscernible], if you put in spots from a couple of weeks ago, you could well end up with a number [indiscernible] all it does work. 
Turning to slide [indiscernible], a quick look at drivers of EBITDA shows that overall, we're at relatively consistent levels, even with the volatility for price, COVID and operational disruptions. Importantly, as I mentioned, we are seeing underlying cost and volume improvements, primarily this period of copper in Minas-Rio, but we are very focused on turning on as operating challenges at PGMs and met coal going forward. So I think you see the improvements drop to the bottom line, and I'll explain on that a little bit more on to the next slide [indiscernible] 
[indiscernible] on Slide 16. The half has shown a bit of help from PGM improvement [indiscernible] core net debt down to the $0.5 billion and as well with our target gearing at a ratio of 0.6 [indiscernible]. 
[indiscernible] very well to stage of delivery. Just to remind you $5.6 billion of net debt includes $1 billion of [indiscernible] accounting  [indiscernible] $1.6 billion for inventory build all through the year, largely in PGMs and diamonds and particularly in PGM, where we're used to see that unwind over the [indiscernible]. So it's actually in a very good position, a strong balance sheet, a strong pipeline value [indiscernible] to able to retain good returns to shareholders. 
If we go to slide [indiscernible] favorably balanced, reposition the portfolio when required and return cash to shareholders. So mentioned good cash across the period, $2.7 billion after funding sustaining capital with $3.3 billion in the second half. As such, we use that to support the payout ratio based item with a total of $1.2 billion declared for 2020. We allocated $1.4 billion in terms of growth CapEx, $0.7 billion in terms of the acquisition of Sirius minerals and a further piece of the puzzle, $0.2 billion remains from a $1 billion share buyback scheme that we initiated in July '19 and completed early in 2020. 
So if we turn to Slide 18 and just over the next couple of slides, I want to spend a little bit of time just focusing on CapEx. I know there's a few questions out there to understand the timing, particularly in how that relates to the volumes. And so I'll focus and talk through in detail, both in terms of sustaining and growth CapEx, and hopefully, you get a better understanding of some of our priorities. Just to be clear, there's no change to previous guidance on CapEx that we provided back in December. 
So let's have a first look at sustaining CapEx on this slide. You can see that there's a long-term sustaining CapEx level around that $3 billion as our portfolio evolves and Lifex [ aimed ] is on top of that, and that will be a little bit variable. We are seeing slightly elevated levels of Lifex CapEx over the next couple of years, around that $700 million to $900 million per year, and that's as we complete the development of projects that you know around Venetia underground, Aquila and Kolomela. 
Longer term average, more around that region of $500 million per year. The underlying sustaining CapEx is also a touch higher in the next couple of years. The main drivers being the deferral of spend from 2020 and as we reprogram those work streams over the next year or 2. 
We've also included the desalination plant at Collahuasi. It's probably a combination of sustaining and growth that supports both current water requirements and wider expansion of Collahuasi, which I'll come onto in a moment. And so it's probably a combination of growth and sustaining. Needless to say, there's some growth -- I mean better numbers simply linked to the growth in the portfolio, a copper unit equivalent basis as we deliver that growth. 
So let's now look at growth CapEx on Slide 19. So in terms of growth CapEx, again, I'll walk you through a couple of slides just to provide a bit more clarity on what we're setting up here, particularly in terms of that growth CapEx and how that links to delivering the growth volumes over time. Again, just to emphasize, no change to the guidance that we provided back in December. So if we exclude Woodsmith, just for the moment, growth CapEx per year around $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next 3 years. And with that, we see our copper equivalent production increasing by around at 20% by 2023 of that 2018 base. 
It's disciplined, it's margin accretive and predominantly focused around forward-facing or future-enabling portfolio, it's technology friendly and links directly to the decarbonization agenda that we have in many cases. The CapEx that's forecast on this slide out to '23 also provides some of the earlier spend on some of that volume growth beyond 2023 on projects that we do anticipate approving in that interim period. For example, Collahuasi Phase I, Mohali cline and the MG plant debottlenecking. 
We go to Slide 20, please. So let's look at some of those projects in detail. Each case, attractive IRRs. And as Mark mentioned, they're well sequenced across time so that we managed to spend in the balance sheet appropriately. Quellaveco, as Mark mentioned, progressing well, our share remaining around that 1.5 billion over the next 18 months or so. 
In 2023, we expect to see copper production of 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes. That adds, in its own right, around 10% to our overall copper equivalent volume. At spots from about 2 weeks ago, obviously, it's a fast-moving at least from about 2 weeks ago, that would give us EBITDA of around $1 billion in 2022 and more than $2 billion in 2023 on a 100% basis. 
Another project on the Marine Namibia new vessel, the AMP 3, again on time for delivery. It's a fast returning brownfield project, adds around 500,000 carats at a very high-value per carat on a 100% basis. And for us, it adds about 1% in copper equivalent volumes for our 50% share. 
Turning to Collahuasi, it's clearly a world-class long life asset, and we're looking at efficient and incremental growth over time in a number of phases. Phase I, which see us adding additional mill and related infrastructure our CapEx while still being refined around [ 1 billion ]. Phase I increased throughput by around 20%, moving from about 160,000 to 200,000 tonnes per day. This equates to about 50,000 tonnes per annum of additional copper for our share. And that's about copper equivalent production growth at the group level. 
We'll also progressively look at technology initiatives, such as bulk ore sorting to further optimize the operation, but that's more likely to be in a Phase II expansion. Those studies are underway. That would most likely be a full fourth line expansion, increasing throughput to around 300,000 tonnes per day. And that would add about 100,000 tonnes of copper equivalent production in our share. Obviously, we will require new permits, and it's a little early to provide capital units on that just at this stage. 
[ Cliner ], a long life asset, we've almost already doubled production over the last 8 years, without spending major capital. The focus has been on embedding the operating model and production efficiencies. And while we'll continue to drive efficiencies, the next stage will require some debottlenecking. And it's likely that we'll add some additional concentrator capacity, which will add around 300,000 to 600,000 PGM ounces of production. 
While still being refined, it's expected to cost between around $0.8 billion to $1.4 billion. And again, we take a technology focus and the studies to analyze this are underway through 2021. 
So if I could then turn to Slide 21. So if we look beyond 2023, you would have seen earlier this week, we approved the Sishen UHDMS project. It adds iron units to existing production, if you assume that we're well constrained by increasing iron grade and quality of product. And importantly, the Sishen adds 3 -- at least 3 to 4 years of mine life. 
In terms of Woodsmith, as Mark mentioned, the Q1 cost curve asset with strong margins. We've committed to spend around $0.5 billion this year, and we'll provide further guidance in July. [ In this iron market], it would add around 5% to our copper equivalent production when it's fully ramped up to that 10 million tonnes production level. 
And Moranbah-Grosvenor, again a brownfield debottlenecking plant -- debottlenecking of the wash plant. Immediate focus, though, does remain bringing Grosvenor safely back in H2. But when completed, would add around 3% copper equivalent growth in around 2024. 
And finally, on the technology projects, there's a number of fast payback, relatively small individual investments, and there's quite a bit more detail provided in the appendix. Programs such as the bulk ore sorting, or the coarse particle rotation projects, cost competitive, modernize the operations to set us up on a more sustainable basis. For example, the hydrogen haul trucks and really underpin that journey as we move forward.
So if we move to Slide 22, just to pull those themes together across the 3 pillars, as we've spoken about on our journey through to 2022. The 3 pillars: one, sustaining CapEx provides a continuing base for delivering on that efficient; two, technology and innovation adds to that in a productive and sustainable way; and then the growth projects, as I just discussed, build on and transition the portfolio. 
So our $3 billion to $4 billion improvement target to 2022 remains very much on target. So let's just quickly look at each of those pillars. Firstly, on the operating model in P101 and some examples. So the business on the ground is getting more efficient as we often spoke about Minas-Rio, approaching 26 million tonnes by 2022. P101, systematically targeting opportunities across the value chain. 
Some examples, again, 15% increase in truck utilization at [indiscernible] increased haul truck payloads at Los Bronces, an 8% throughput increase at the Minas-Rio beneficiation plant and world-class shovel performance across multiple operations. 
As Mark highlighted, we've seen about $2 billion increase in the underlying business run rates and $1 billion of that has dropped through to the bottom line to EBITDA so far, $800 million in the P101 category and about $0.2 billion in the technology area. Our focus now remains on delivering that stable and capable platform, so we get more of those improvements to drop to that bottom line. 
On the technology and development front, digital technologies, for example, the predictive maintenance, are leading the way and have delivered that $0.2 billion today. Some other examples, bulk ore sorting, testing and early rollout going well. We've also had a pilot plant shows about a 10% reduction in energy and water intensity for that operation. 
Full-scale units are now being installed at Mogalakwena, Barro Alto and Los Bronces, and expected to be fully operational within 12 months. Bulk ore sorting also allows us to process more accurately by discarding some of the lower value ores before we put them through the plant, also resulting in energy and water savings per unit processed as well. And ultimately, that can drive a 5% to 10% grade uplift, which flows through to production and a 3% to 4% unit cost improvement. With bulk ore sorting, we expect to see initial benefits to EBITDA of probably $0.1 billion to $0.2 billion per annum, a very strong run rate energy [ has that ]. 
Another example, the coarse particle recovery. First full-scale plant in now installed at [ Al Sodoto ] through separations on traded ore on a higher pebble size that saves around 30% in energy and crushing and greater water recovery in terms of reuse from tailings, up to a 50% benefit in water usage. 
Combination of those factors can drive a 5% to 10% production increase and up to a 5% reduction in unit costs. We believe that this technology is applicable across as many as 6 of the group's key assets, including Quellaveco. And we've announced the approval of that project today. Limited benefit by 2022, but will potentially drive EBITDA benefits rising over time to around $250 million per year. 
Now I've already touched on the growth pillar, so we won't really go over that. But again, just to confirm, we remain on track for that $3 billion to $4 billion target improvement by 2022, that we first committed to back in 2018. 
So just to conclude, on Slide 23, our story remains consistent. It's all about balance. Returns continuing with $6.1 billion in dividends and buybacks in '17. The balance sheet remains strong. Our commitment to discipline remains while we deliver this value-added growth of around that 20% level through to 2023. That, in turn, drives our margins into our target range of 45% to 50%. 
Mark, back to you."
409115,704883639,2318486,"Anglo American plc, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, Stephen. And now we'll look more broadly and forward across the business. I am now on Page 25. So on diamonds, at an industry level, the fundamentals continue to improve. Our views on a positive recovery are simply built on industry fundamentals a",2757,"Thanks, Stephen. And now we'll look more broadly and forward across the business. I am now on Page 25. So on diamonds, at an industry level, the fundamentals continue to improve. Our views on a positive recovery are simply built on industry fundamentals and the associated buying behaviors of our customers. 
First, on demand, demand has been steady and the outlook looks pretty encouraging. So given long-term and most recent experience, we expect demand to continue to follow global GDP and perhaps more importantly, for a luxury good, personal disposable income, or PDI. Both GDP and PDI are expected to grow by around 3% per year over the next decade as the middle class is growing in size and their aspiration to grow as we better target advertising and key customer segments. 
In China, currently, the second biggest diamond market after the U.S., Chinese middle classes are expected to purchase around $1 billion worth of diamond jewelry over this same period. Globally, the demand profile is shifting towards female self-purchasing, now making up almost 1/3 of diamond jewelry purchases. And the continuing shift in focus on branding and provenance is something De Beers has lead for many years. 
On supply, looking forward in terms of natural diamond production, it's generally agreed the industry is on a flat to declining production trajectory. There has been a lack of significant kimberlite discoveries most recently, and that's on a global basis. In addition, some 15% of existing supply by volume has been taken off stream or has reached the end of its mine life. The combination of growth in consumer demand for diamond jewelry and the flat to declining production points to good prospects for the diamond industry, both in the medium to longer term. Certainly, we expect the recovery to continue in 2021 off those fundamentals. 
On De Beers and our branding story, and this has really been the most significant part of Bruce and team's work most recently, we're building off the De Beers brand and tailoring our offering to target segments. That is a key to the driving price for only the best philosophy that we have in De Beers. 
Our drive towards longer-term margin improvement is built from our COVID response, with the accelerated business transformation necessitated by our stark first half reality being a key player in driving the necessary modernization business with more efficient inventory management, increased online purchasing and growing consumer design for products with demonstrable ethical and sustainability credentials, including an enhanced depreciation of the natural world, really have been key considerations in the evolution of our change model. These are all messages that are resonating and consistent with the Anglo American and De Beers branding positions. 
The De Beers' focus on continuing cost reduction reflects what all good businesses should be doing. And shortening production to customer times, increasing our own jewelry business offerings and premium brands are all part of a strategic remaking of the business, all connected through digital technologies in mining, processing, cutting, selling, tracing. They're all part of the strategic makeover Bruce and Tony and their teams in terms of technology application are joined at the hip. 
Consistent with our De Beers strategy, our Lightbox strategy for lab-grown products has also been an important part of our strategic approach to different market segments. De Beers is all about natural products that reflect and recognize every natural diamond is special or one of a kind, a measure of a personal commitment on our very most, or our most special personal relationships. 
On Lightbox, a fun fashion lab-grown product with growing discounts, now around 60% to 70% compared to the natural product. And from our point of view, a good market to be in, but sub market to the naturals. And whilst that's not a simple 2-market piece, what we are seeing is the differentiation of those 2 segments in people's mind increases over time. And Bruce and the team are very sensitive to make sure the messaging is right in both context. 
Now to go to Slide 27. On PGMs, we have another sector with strong fundamentals and a great long-term potential. Obviously, the news from Russia overnight probably increases the short-term potential, given palladium and nickel impacts. PGM pricing is also being driven by strong fundamentals on a broader basis. The strength in demand with mixed supplies resulted in a 50% increase in PGM basket price in 2020, and this strength in pricing has obviously continued into the new year. 
On the demand side, ever-increasing emission standards is crucial for the auto industry and means higher loadings of PGMs. We believe a 40% increase in loadings in 2029 is quite possible. In particular, tighter emission standards in both Europe and China are driving demand for palladium and rhodium, both are currently in deficit. Palladium is expected by many to remain in deficit for at least 2 to 3 years, even after taking into account a 10% substitution to platinum. 
And in our case, it's not a bad thing. We're happy to see platinum pick up more market. But again, when we look at platinum, it's the all-round PGM, a diverse range of other demand sources continue to emerge: food storage, glass making, 5G technology being some of the examples. The point here being that these are young metals with unique properties, the full application of which is still being understood. 
And we're not standing back waiting for others to recognize potential applications. Through the AP Ventures Fund, we are investing in the development of PGMs for new applications to unlock their full potential, which, for example, we think will be a key for a vital hydrogen economy. Though the AP Ventures Fund has to date raised $325 million of our $100 million see it coming. And so we're very excited about where we are and what the potential is in the industry. 
And on the supply side, there are very few near-term medium -- very few near- to medium-term supply growth options across PGM production, 128 now. At the same time, currently minable assets are depleted. And with PGM processing capacity at a premium, we're in a massive strategic position of more than 50% of the world ex-Russia smelting, refining and associated base levels refining capacity. And in the longer term, producers are unsure whether to expand production until they see more evidence of [indiscernible] and hydrogen developments. And certainly, from our perspective, hydrogen today is a real conversation and moving quicker by the day. 
And while we don't have to worry about the decisions on putting more capital into new downstream processing capacity, we've already got the lion's share, we can build out incremental mine opportunities while debottlenecking and squeezing better margins from a full value chain position, and it is unique in this industry. 
The result, it is likely price will continue to do the heavy lifting in what is a constrained market. We have a great business, with highly competitive and improving unit costs of around $700 an ounce, which supports a 70% mining margin across our basket of PGM products. The remarkable point to note, after a very tough year, we have still delivered a record financial performance, and we have no doubt -- and we have no debt in the business and with 70% mining margin as we stand today. So from our point of view, we have a unique position in what is shaping up to be a long [ triggered up ] to the portfolio. 
So to Slide 29. Talking about portfolio, our future enabling commodity mix, alongside quality with diversity, are positive differentiators in our industry, consumer-driven demand for diamonds, crop nutrients and PGMs and environmental themes and electrification driving demand for our copper, nickel and, again, PGMs, contributes to the hydrogen economy, are all big positive for Anglo American and our portfolio. 
And our iron ore and met coal assets are high quality, both physically and chemically, and therefore, desirable inputs for steel mills, and in particular, future green steel mills. And for those that understand with high iron ore values and low deleterious elements, the green technologies are far more efficient, the higher quality the iron ore feed. So we are uniquely positioned in that market as well for the longer term. 
And for a green -- and for a general investor, our mix across these high demand growth sectors is not just for the next 5 years, but for the next 10 to 20 years. And so from our point of view, positioning the business through 2040 is something we've been thinking about and doing for the last few years. 
So to Slide 30. Our role in making the world a better place is the way we think about a number of the issues that we're working through and making sure they connect with good performance. Our technology push, led by Tony and in partnership with our business leaders, is part of why we've been able to commit to making the business carbon neutral by 2040. Earlier than most, but we think that this is the right time line as it will continue to drive us while supporting our relentless push down all of our cost curves. 
Importantly, it's more than a target. We have plans to get there, and we have plans to get 8 of our sites to carbon neutrality by 2030. And as you know, we've contracted to be on 100% renewable power in Chile and Brazil by 2021, we saw in wind initiatives. And in Peru, we are already working through the same options for the Quellaveco business. 
On our planned exit from the South African thermal coal operations, I'm pleased to report we're making good progress, with the preparation work on the demerger option certainly available to us probably during the course of this year. And if we do see a trade sale option emerge that we think has merits, we will still look at that. But certainly, on the demerger option, we're well advanced and are in a good place to continue the process and announce something during the course of this year. 
And on Cerrejón, we also intend to exit our 1/3 in Cerrejón certainly within 3 years. But obviously, we've got 2 partners that we have to work with to make sure that's done the right way. 
Now turning to Slide 31 and talking to carbon reduction and turning carbon reduction in our competitive advantage is something we recognized back in 2015. And again, Tony and the team working on the options with our Corporate Relations team. We've been thinking through the technical issues, and that's been led by Tony and how we set the business up to connect with our communities. 
So you've heard about that decarbonization strategy and how it applies to operations. We think 2040 is a challenging target, but it is deliverable and we have a plan to deliver. And while we don't want to get caught up in the conversation around scope 3 emissions and what we call the carbon reduction arms race, we believe the target that we have is appropriate and reflects the actions we're putting in place, which will also improve our competitive position. 
Now on scope 3 emissions, we make a few simple observations. First, our scope 3 work has helped us understand more clearly the carbon intensity of our value chain. And the one thing that is clear is there are many different ways of calculating numbers. Now off the base that we've used, we understand that, for example, thermal coal represents around 25% of our carbon emission. 
So obviously, an exit from thermal coal over the next 3 years would impact our reported scope 3 numbers in that order.  But we also point to our work on Scope 1 and 2 emissions, where the technical work will also impact adjacencies, how we connect with our communities. And we also think there are credits, both in supply chain in terms of what we're doing at the community, to further impact our scope 3 emissions. 
In the steel industry, you've got met coal and iron ore. And again, they represent the 2 other most significant areas in terms of our scope 3 emissions. For iron ore, it represents somewhere around 45% to 50% of our reported Scope 3 emissions. And the industry tells us they'd expect to have green steel production making up about 50% of the world's steel supply by 2040. And you can apply those assumptions across -- really across the terms of our iron ore business, remembering that the products we produce are favored in those new technologies because of the high-quality, when you start to get a sense of what we can do in iron ore.
In met coal, the really important point to note that the demand we don't have, significant alternatives that we can replace existing technologies in steel very quickly. So based on what we think the direction of travel and the timing it would take to do the conversion to the steel industry, that timing would be far longer than the life of our met coal assets. 
So what we're thinking through is how do we continue to make improvements in those businesses and make a meaningful contribution to our partners in the industry, but at the same time, continue to improve our carbon position. Now we don't think it's right to just think about depleting assets. We don't think that's the right way that we should be working with all the assets we can improve, and we're working through that. And we'll keep you posted on how that thinking is all coming together over the next 12 months. 
We've got our sustainability update in April. We'll again update at the end and continue to update you over the next 12 months. And the one thing that I think is important to note, the credibility we've built on how we're attacking the Scope 1 and Scope 2 issues is the stage we're dealing with Scope 3. And again, when we come with the final positions and targets, it will be thoughtful, it will be backed by a plan, it will be supported by the technology and how we believe we should shape the portfolio into the future. And as you know, the work we're doing today is all about the future and certainly the positioning of our portfolio in the long term. 
On Page 32, I think I want to step back and reflect on our purpose again. It's founded on the delivery of sustainable returns to shareholders, employees and our business and society and stakeholders. And so to reimagine mining to improve people's lives is not something we just say, it is what we believe we must do as a business, both through the value we contribute to our society, our host communities and society, and also in the way we [ provide ] basic materials that it enable the world to be sustainable in all of expansions. 
Our business, we keep our targets pretty simple: We target a better than 10% free cash flow on capital employed, and that's after making sure we're replacing depleted resources, as the prime measure of our effectiveness as business managers. To measure the efficiency of how we got that free cash flow, we measure with capital employed in the range 15% to 20%, which is about measuring the efficiency of those cash flows. 
And then we have our 7 performance pillars that look at safety, health, environment, our competitive cost position in each of our target markets and as a business, how we set the balance sheet up to be flexible as Stephen has reported for you today. And that's the focus of everyone within Anglo American, and everybody has a responsibility to make sure every day we're moving closer to hitting those targets consistently and improving those numbers on a day-to-day basis. 
And then finally, on Page 33. Just to remind you about our investment proposition, and it's pretty simple. We have the assets, we have the people, and we have delivered industry-leading returns since 2000 to interact [ 16% ] a year. And we have set the foundation to outperform through 2030 and beyond. And we've got the portfolio, and we're in the right businesses to continue to improve that performance. 
So with that, we'll pause for questions, just to say Stephen and Tony are also here to answer the really hard questions. And so we'll hand across to the moderator."

You saw that, what's now 18 months ago, of July '19, I think it was, we announced the $1 billion buyback. So it's something that we do think about. It's something that we actively discuss and something that actively consider. If prices continue, then obviously, that challenge comes nearer term even with the growth spend. But I'd probably see that has been in the form of some sort of special return above the base.

But certainly, in terms of application, the PGM suite are attractive for a whole range of reasons, rhodium, for example. 
So we're watching it carefully, our ability to accelerate. We are already improving at Amandelbult. At Mogalakwena, we've got incremental improvements planned. And most have to be planned out carefully because we've got communities that we've got to make sure that we've got good relationships as we grow the business. And we've got other assets where the people are aware of what they're taking over. 
So we've got the ability to accelerate and get bigger. But we still think it's a bit too early to call anything big. And from our point of view, probably best to debottle -- continue our debottlenecking and improving the processing operations and making sure we're getting the best bang from our buck for our internally sourced products by getting our cost down. 
So we can't build and improve, but we'll watch the market and we look for a few more signs. But certainly very encouraging at the moment."

And the living mining concept that Tony's been talking to for those that know the product will have a sense of what we've got in our heads and innate work in such a way and making sure those 2 pieces connect is a really strategic approach to making sure we're developing partnerships, and we don't have this old paternalistic management approach to managing communities. 
I mean you don't manage communities, you have to partner with communities, whether that's on heritage issues or whether that's on mine development or whether that's the work we do in the communities in developing jobs. And our sustainability targets on being a catalyst for 5 jobs for every 1 job on site. 
If you're doing those sorts of things, you're going to have lots of problems getting your projects away. But I think, look at Quellaveco as a good example. Peru has had a history of challenges.

What worries me for the industry is where we have incidents, whether it's a safety issue, whether it's an environmental issue, whether it's a heritage issue. These sorts of things tend to harden up regulators in dealing with the industry in an open and constructive way. 
So we've all got to do better, connect better and help communities understand what we actually do in society. A lot of people don't realize that the mining industry drives 25% gross GDP through 10% on a denomination basis, another 10% through the services that we use to provide the products we produce.

The microwave technology, the CPR are all about fundamentally shifting the rates where possible, probably up 20%, 25%. So we concentrate on that. We've got a really good strategic understanding of our ore bodies. I think it's important that we, to Mark's point, keep our discipline.

But at the same time, you've got to be careful in forecasting how quickly the business recovers is something we'll work carefully through 2021. 
But I think his strategy is right. I think the focus and understanding and playing to our brand strategy, which is something that we've rebuilt after we've got the De Beers brand back in the stable, I think that was a really important strategic move. The success of Forevermark, the success of the work he's done in China. The work on Lightbox and differentiating between the naturals, I think, they are all things that will help us get back to those numbers and better. And certainly, that's where we're taking the business.

In terms of complexity, one thing that we would certainly like is for some of those relationships to be a little bit easier. But at the same time, we're not about to go and do something for the sake of just doing it and blowing value.

And if you could perhaps help us understand if some PGMs are going to be impacted more than others? Is it more of a gold and palladium story, which would exclude the restock we're seeing at the moment? Or would you say those standards would impact all the 3 of them in a symmetric way? 
My last question is on emissions. When we look at [ source of ] emissions, and Mark, you mentioned that fugitive methane emissions are [indiscernible] a bit share of your Scope 1 in met coal. I know the core leg of the strategy mainly about thermal. But if you only stay ahead of the curve on this theme is not a time to also consider met coal as a little bit more problematic than is usually perceived.

So all of these things are becoming quite interesting as we -- as the vehicle emissions are being dealt with, and we're getting the hydrogen economy and demand -- the demand source is really important. 
Whether the PGMs will be impacted on a symmetrical way will depend on price. I think platinum will still be increasing its substitution across on palladium, albeit that will take a bit of time. Rhodium at 20,000 to 25,000 worries me a little on the demand side. But because of its ability to clean NOx emissions at low temperatures, it remains a favored technology. But in those sort of numbers, I think the pressure will be to pull it back. So at around 10,000 to 12,000, I don't think there's issue for rhodium but 25,000, it's a bit higher. 
So depending on the price you're assuming, yes, I think there will be some asymmetry, which will probably favor platinum demand as we go forward. And the other one will sort of adjust, based on the relative prices between the 3. So your guess is as good as mine as how that will play out, but that's how we see it at the moment. 
On met coal, you're right in saying methane and emissions that we're focusing on. Tony, do you want to talk about Pierre's work and how we're thinking about broadly the emissions, but in particular, the handling of the methane and the research work we're doing."

Thank you for joining us today. You've got both Stephen and myself by. Next slide, please. For those that enjoy a bedtime read, we've got the cautionary statement. Next slide, please.",2769,"Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those a little further. Thank you for joining us today. You've got both Stephen and myself by. Next slide, please. 
For those that enjoy a bedtime read, we've got the cautionary statement. Next slide, please. For today, our order of play is consistent with our established routine. You'll have myself touching on performance and highlighting a couple of, we think, key points. Second, Stephen will run through the numbers to provide the detailed insights and to reinforce our focus on capital discipline, which is reflected through our returns to shareholders and our capital spending priorities. And to close, I'll take you through how we are positioning the business for the future. And as you've seen from our thermal coal announcements in the half, there's lots happening on this front. 
Next slide, please. On results, a record half for us, our highest ever EBITDA in a reporting half, somewhere in the 70% range higher than anything we've ever done before. The result was delivered despite us running at around 95% full production capacity. COVID remains a factor across the globe. And while it's been carefully managed our people and across all of our jurisdictions, it did have an impact on the operations. So from our perspective, we still see improvement in the business as countries move through the vaccination processes. 
We're also impacted in the operations with our met coal constraints, although Moranbah was operating again at the end of the half and development work has restarted at, although that will still take a bit of time to bring through. Growing EBITDA margin of 61% tells much of the earnings story, a function of both solid costs in terms of where we come from in the last few years and improving product prices. And our focus on quality and delivering value in use credit in terms of the prices we've realized above and beyond benchmark prices has really come to the fore, and I think has been a very obvious part of the story in terms of the results. 
Return on capital employed, 49%. And if we adjust the capital base for Kia Veco and Woodsmith spending so far, which do impact the denominator, our ROTE would be, in fact, 56%. So again, both very strong numbers. Of course, high commodity prices have been very important to us. But at the same time, we've seen increasing prices. Unit costs were up 15%, largely a function of stronger FX, particularly in the emerging economies. 
If we exclude the FX impact, where unit costs were up 6%, reflecting our 5% productivity pause through the COVID issues and some higher input costs as commodity prices have driven our input or, if you like, the consumable pricing. But Stephen will give you more color in his part of the presentation. But all in all, an encouraging result. It reflects and has been reflected through additional shareholder returns of $2 billion on top of the base dividend of $2.1 billion, and that reflects a 77% million payout just short of the 80% -- just short of 80%. From our point of view, if you add in Tongala the returns look very good. But again, Stephen will unpack all of those parts of the story. 
So next slide, please. On safety, health and environment, we continue to focus on our improvement journey. Looking at safety first, you'll see that we have been fatality-free in the first half, which I think reflects the good work we've been doing on the elimination of fatalities task force that we put in place a few years ago. The negative there is the slight uptick in our injury frequency rates, and that's the total injury frequency rates. And we've seen a higher injury rate in our precious metals business and in the Cavco project. 2 countries impacted by COVID. And so the team is being very careful in terms of how we manage work to make sure that we don't see that negative trend continue. But real focus on safety and making sure that we're balancing off and making sure that COVID doesn't impact the processes we follow in terms of doing the work. 
Health, again, great improvement over the last few years, reflecting the focus on elimination of hazards at source. And on the environment, again, no incidents in the first half, which again reflects the improved planning and operating disciplines that we've introduced across the business. And whilst it's good to see no incidents in the first half, we've still got a way to go to make sure that we're happy with all aspects of the operations. 
Next slide, please. On the healthy environment and thriving communities, which is the broader social conversation, the critical -- or the progress we've made on improving towards our targets per the sustainable mining plan have been solid. We're targeting an absolute reduction of 30% in both energy and greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. And that's from the 2016 levels. And that's our scope 1 and scope 2 equivalent. The recovery from Covet has been patchy and required -- and we require improved operating stability to make sure that we're operating in our best energy-efficient level. So a little bit more to be done. But certainly, from our point of view, a pretty good results so far. 
We've also been making pleasing progress towards decarbonizing our operations, both of the energy efficient work and by switching power sources, particularly in South America from traditional fossil fuels to renewables. And as of next year, with the agreement done in Peru on Quellaveco and recent changes we've made in Brazil and Chile, we will be 100% green main supply electricity across South America from next year. So that's a major milestone for us in business. And we also plan to generate hydrogen from electrolysis at our mine sites along across the globe.  We're using those renewable energy sources. So the move to eliminate diesel in our operations starts with these changes. And if we're able to get our truck fleet done by 2030, that in and of itself would be a 15% reduction in our energy -- or in our greenhouse gas emissions. So an important milestone with the truck that we've got coming in at. 
As you know, last year, we designed our new Social Way 3.0 program, and that is a package of social standards and practices. We are working to fully transition to this new set of standards and processes by the end of '22. Implementing this new high bar and industry benchmark for community engagement and social performance is very important to us. And certainly, there's been good progress in the half. And by next year, we should be in really good shape at that next level. 
Next slide, please. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our WeCare program has enabled us to meet a responsible, holistic and coordinated effort to protect people, both in the business and in our host communities, while also making sure we secure and maintain the integrity of our operations. And that 95% production rate reflects the processes, the procedures, some absenteeism due to COVID, but making sure all of those pieces are done controlling the spread of the the virus, and we'll make sure that we continue to work with everybody in terms of mitigating the operating impacts. 
A comprehensive suite of robust operating protocols and controls remain in place in our operations and certainly would expect those controls to remain in place for the balance of the year. The investment we've actually made in our own testing laboratories helps us rapidly identify new sources of infection and take action to limit the spread. And again, that's been very much appreciated in our local communities and on a broader scale at a national level. And we represent in a few countries that we operate the most significant private run testing program across those countries, and that's certainly been appreciated. 
We are firmly committed to vaccination into supporting governments in rolling out national vaccination programs, and we've already got a program in South Africa that's been supported by the government. 
Next slide, please. In terms of contributions and benefits to all stakeholders, I'm also very pleased to announce today that we'll be making a $100 million special endowment allocation to the Anglo American Foundation, providing further support to long-term health, education, livelihoods and environmental projects that contribute to our sustainable mining targets across the glide, which, as you know, are aligned with the UN sustainability development goals. The funding will go to a broad range of projects, spanning climate change initiatives, health infrastructure, childhood nutrition, clean water and sanitation, early childhood development, just as a few examples. 
This investment in the future builds on the comprehensive contribution that we make to our stakeholders that totaled over $25 billion in 2020. So it's not just a shareholder story, it's about the good we do on a much broader basis. Having worked in this industry for longer than I can remember, I'm deeply proud of the contribution both Anglo American and the mining industry makes to our societies in particular, the countries in which we work. We do make a real difference to the lives of local people, acting as catalysts for positive change. I don't think many industries can demonstrate such a positive contribution to the countries where they generate their profits, the taxes we pay, there's no industry that matches mining in terms of its contribution to local economies. And for us, we all need to be proud of that contribution. And for us, this is a very important part of our conversation today. 
Next slide, please. To business, across our key business sectors at De Beers, we saw good sales in the first half, certainly a big move against last year. Consumer demand for polished products has been very solid. China has been good. U.S. continues to improve. Despite the impact of the second wave of viruses in India, and we saw that in the numbers in our fourth site, the most recent sites have been very solid. And again, people are aware that we announced our Site 6 numbers yesterday. And again, they were very strong. 
So from our point of view, we think the fundamentals for diamonds are very strong. And whilst we talk about the big contribution from iron ore from copper, from PGMs and other parts of the business, we've got to remember that De Beers in recovery mode. And so in the second half and into next year, we think it will continue to improve its contribution to the business. 
Copper has continued to deliver -- the copper team have continued to deliver consistent operating and cost performance. The near-term water management initiatives we put in place at Los Bronces are delivering results. And we are continuing to work on the longer-term solutions to reduce our water footprint across the country. In this price environment, you may see many different stakeholders, including governments looking for a bigger share of the pie. And we need to remember that our contribution to Chile, Peru and other countries is significant and will become more significant, and we've been involved in a lot of programs and dialogues with both government and our stakeholders in both countries, and those conversations have been very positive. And in particular, helping people understand the contributions we're making, I hope, and we think we'll change some of those debates, particularly in both Chile and Peru, where we think the conversation is becoming quite sensible. 
PGM is a solid mining performance despite the impact of COVID. And the ACP running extremely well. It's actually operating 18% above plan for the first 6 months, reflecting both a higher operating rate, reflecting some of the technical changes we made in the last refurbishment and as well, we're seeing much better maintenance availability. So again, a reflection of the due care and attention that Natasha and the team are putting into the unit. 
Strong pricing, clearly, supporting record margins and cash generation despite the impact of the higher U.S. dollar prices. In Bulks, we generated record iron ore margins during the first half, reflecting the quality of iron ore that we produce from both Kumba and and with the realized iron ore price for our products for the half being at $210 a tonne, I'll pick up why that's occurring a little bit in a minute. But certainly, from our point of view, we think it's a real differentiating point. Our focus on quality, and we've talked about it for the last few years, you are seeing it in the numbers. And I think it's very important to make sure we explain how we're doing that. 
Operationally, there were some unplanned maintenance at Minas-Rio. And I think that does track back a little bit to the impact of COVID on maintenance scheduling. I think we've now got that back in balance and don't expect a much better second half from the Minas-Rio team. And at Kumba, the team managed the external impacts of COVID very well, and they are working very closely with Transnet to make sure we utilize rail capacity to the fullest. 
In met coal, Moranbah restarted at the beginning of June. We'll take things very carefully as we work through some geological conditions, but again, each week is getting better. At Grosvenor, work restarted underground in April. We're also reviewing all the findings of the Board of Inquiry. There will be numerous learnings, I think, for both us and the industry, and we are targeting a restart by the end of the year. But again, we'll just make sure that we've got all the issues covered before we kick things away. But certainly, we're making good progress. 
Next slide, please. So just to explain the work we've been doing. And when we talk about marketing products, people are still asking us questions about quality and what's it worth? As we restructured Anglo, the big headline was 50% less assets. We're producing more today out of half the assets than we were back 7 or 8 years ago. And our unit costs have dropped, if you look at these results, around 25% in nominal terms over that period. So it reflects both portfolio change and the focus on the industrial processes and the technology work that Tony and the team have been contributing. 
This relative performance has been delivered despite the mitigation measures we've implemented to offset COVID in the last 12 months. So if we include the reduction of thermal coal from the mix, the reduction in numbers of assets is around 60%. The longer-term improvement approach has been driven by portfolio restructuring, our technical reconfiguring and as I said, the benchmarking work, the operating model P101. And P101 is about focusing and improving on industry benchmarks for shovels, trucks, right across the board. So today, we are, per the chart, operating across our businesses at about the 28 percentile on average across the portfolio. If you then compare that to our peers, the top 5, they operate somewhere between 33% and 46%. Now a few years back, we're at the 49th percentile. 
Now I'm using the inverse margin curve, which takes quality and then looks at a breakeven cost in each of our commodities to come up with that figure. And so our focus on cost improvement and price improvement for the quality of the products that we produce, then the margin is what's reflected in that price or cost position, which is a breakeven position. 
So if we go to the next slide, we'll just take it, that's it. One example, Kumba. Kumba was operating top end third quartile, almost in the fourth quartile. We've literally taken almost 50% out of the cost. Shovel productivities are up 40%. Truck productivities and load factors are up 10%, 15%. So that's moved us to the left. But our focus on going from 62.5% quality product to 64.5% quality product, the introduction of the new technologies has kicked our price realizations up at the same time. And the marketing team we're selectively selling to those steel producers that pay for quality. 
And so put all those factors together, Kumba is now a first quartile producer and Minas-Rio is at the front of the curve. And so it's not about costs. It's not simply about costs. It's about cost, it's about quality and getting value and in the marketing. So it's a 3-dimensional strategy that's driving margins and driving returns. 
With that, I'll hand across to Stephen."
409115,1675450262,2354846,"Anglo American plc, H1 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks very much, Mark. So let's jump straight into the numbers on the next slide, please. So turning to the first half numbers. EBITDA at $12.1 billion, a great result and that's driven a record EPS of $4.30 per share for the half. That translated into $",2415,"Thanks very much, Mark. So let's jump straight into the numbers on the next slide, please. So turning to the first half numbers. EBITDA at $12.1 billion, a great result and that's driven a record EPS of $4.30 per share for the half. That translated into $1.71 per share base dividend at the 40% payout ratio. 
So clearly, the balance sheet strengthened further through the first half off the back of the very, very strong cash flows, with net debt at 0.1x EBITDA. That's allowed us to announce an additional $2 billion of returns, taking the total returns to $3.31 per share. This nicely demonstrates the 3 key themes that I'd like you to take away from today's presentation, capital discipline, balance between growth and returns and continued focus on operating performance. 
We are seeing some upward pressure on costs, and you'd expect that in this price environment, largely driven from 2 factors: strengthening producer currencies and perhaps not surprisingly, increased commodity input costs. So up 6% on an FX-neutral basis, and I'll touch further on some of those cost details later. 
So if we go to the next slide and look across the different BUs. So a great recovery in diamonds, as Mark mentioned. Demand for polished product is strong, and that's coupled with limited supply and that's led to great demand in our sector. The midstream has largely destocked, and prices increased 14% in the 6-month period. COVID still remains an element of risk that we're monitoring in the cutting and polishing sector and also closely monitoring from our own operations perspective. 
At Venetia, as we transition from the open pit to the underground, we'll see some variability in grade, and that will result in some variability as report over the next few periods. Copper, continuing good operating performance, a great control of costs from the team, so really well done there. 
PGMs, strong refining performance during the first half with the ACP running well. That looks set to continue through the second half. And price is very, very strong with the minor metals, which are not so minor anymore. So $3.4 billion revenue from rhodium in the half and over $400 million from iridium and ruthenium combined. Healthy margins at 70% despite the higher U.S. dollar unit costs. 
Turning to bulks, iron ore, firstly, 70% margins, strong pricing from our high-quality products from Minas-Rio and Kumba and that really plays into the modern demand themes that we're seeing across the steel industry as operators value that quality, the efficiency that brings from an energy and greenhouse gas point of view, and that flows into the premiums that we've seen in the half. 
It was a challenging period for met coal, Noranda now coming back on stream and ramping up and obviously, growth scheduled to come back on later in the second half. Hopefully, they flow into a strongly improved pricing environment for met coal. So overall, a strong set of numbers, but still room to improve in the second half and as we move into '22. 
So next slide, if we look quickly at the drivers of EBITDA itself. Price, clearly, a big factor, no surprises there, but also really pleased with the year-on-year recovery in volumes that we saw from the prior period that was quite heavily impacted from that initial period of COVID. We do continue to have some impacts of COVID, and that's flowing into our ability to realize some of those cost and volume benefits and some of those improvement initiatives that should flow through into the cost and volume bucket in due course. 
Next slide, please. if we look at across at our unit costs, so as I said, 6% up on an FX-neutral basis. So foreign exchange was the single largest driver at 9% as producer currencies strengthened. So combined, up 15% over the same period last year. So general CPI across the geographies that we're working was up 3%, but we do need to keep that in perspective. So the CPI pressure here amounted to $200 million impacting our EBITDA, whereas the price impact in the half was close to $8 million positive impact. 
So given the strong pricing environment we've enjoyed through the first half, there's no surprise that we're starting to see higher input costs from things like steel, I think met coal and iron ore and copper in copper price. We've also seen some input increases through diesels and reagents. And you got to remember that COVID has also resulted in some significant impacts in our supply chain, which has also fed into prices in terms of our input costs. That's added a little bit of pressure into maintenance costs, which have added another 2%, but I expect less of the maintenance headwind in the second half given that we've front-loaded some of the work through the year. 
So just a reminder, this is on a unit cost basis, so impacted by volumes and costs. And I'd like to think that as we continue through the second half of H2 and then into 2022, that we recover some of those volumes and that should feed into this outcome. So looking ahead to the second half, we've supplied some full year guidance in the appendix in today's presentations. But on the basis that spot prices continue where they are, which is obviously great for revenue, then we would expect producer currencies to remain strong and provide some element of headwind. But as I say, hopefully, modify as we've written volumes back through '22. 
So turning to the next slide and looking at CapEx. So CapEx for the half was $2.2 billion. As I say, COVID has had some ability on our capacity to execute some of the noncritical works during the first half. So we have slightly underspent in terms of where we're expecting to travel for the first half and particularly as we prioritized our maintenance costs and activity rather than the capital works. So we do expect to catch up some of that through the second half but probably not all. And we will see some of the same headwinds that we're seeing from a strong currency and some inflation instrument teams also through the capital space, again, steel, copper, oil-related inputs, and that should materialize a little bit or may materialize a little bit in the second half. So in total, we are revising our guidance down by $200 million to $5.5 billion to $6 billion of capital for the year. 
Next slide, please. So the half clearly saw some incredibly strong cash generation that's reflected the operational recovery, obviously, as well as strong pricing. It's driven down our debt by $3.6 billion for the half year period and that's obviously a big impact from the higher realized prices. That pricing impact, though, in terms of working capital is probably hidden some of the great work we've done as we've reduced and refined the PDM work-in-progress stocks that we've built up at the end of last year. And we've also run down our inventory in De Beers. So what you see is some of the positive price impact feed into receivables and our purchase concentrate in the PGMs business. So if you can have a good increase in working capital, then this is probably it. So the balance sheet in excellent shape to support our program of capital, investment in growth, and it's allowed us to make those greater returns to shareholders. 
Next slide, please. So looking at those returns, we're really pleased to announce the additional $2 billion of returns to shareholders for the half in addition to that base dividend that has naturally increased to $2.1 billion. So $4.1 billion in total. And just a reminder that we also distributed the Tongala shares during the half, which I think help this morning were trading around the GBP 2. And so that equates to another 20p on that 10:1 ratio in terms of distributions to shareholders. 
As you know, I'm of balance. Mark often calls me has to balance. So the additional return is structured as a $1 billion special dividend and a $1 billion buyback. So that's 77% payout for the first half and reaffirms our commitment to that capital discipline and returns, exactly as we would say, would do. That takes our returns since we reinstituted the dividend in the first half of '17 to over $10.3 billion. 
The 40% payout ratio remains in place. We really do believe that that's an appropriate payout ratio for a company like ourselves through the cycle, particularly when we offer that combination of high margin growth as well as attractive returns, so remembering through the cycle. 
So as Mark mentioned, next slide, thanks, it's been a record half for our shareholders, but also for many of the other stakeholders that we touch across the operations. In the first half, our activities resulted in $3.1 billion of taxes, taxes collected and royalties for our host governments, and that's over 2.5x higher than the prior period. 
Now it's probably not often you hear a CFO say, but I'm incredibly proud of that large tax number and the contribution that we make to the countries that we operate in. Importantly, we pay our taxes where the profits arise in our host countries. So when prices rise, so do our tax payments and royalty contributions. It's a win-win, and that's how the tax system is in fact supposed to work. We expect of higher profits again in the second half that we would continue to make significant tax payments through that period. 
Now depending on the country, the timing of those cash tax payments across different jurisdictions may vary based on tax installment regimes, profitability, level of past investment, losses, et cetera. But overall, I expect our tax payments to increase year-on-year quite significantly. If we look to Brazil, just as a quick example, clearly, the contribution in the current period doesn't reflect the multibillion dollars of investment we've made over the last few years in Minas-Rio. But now that we have utilized a lot of the tax losses, et cetera, in that country, I would expect we will have utilized all those through the second half and our tax payment should rise significantly before year-end. 
Now as Mark mentioned, clearly, it's an important topic in many of these jurisdictions that we work, but we are having constructive conversations across the board. And I think people do really appreciate that broader economic contribution that we make. 
Next slide, please. So as you know, every period, I'd like to recap our performance against our capital allocation model and scorecard. So cash generation for the period of $6.2 billion after funding our sustaining capital. That continues to drive our payout ratio-based dividend with a total of $2.1 billion declared for the first half of the year. As I say, it's always about balance as we continue to invest for near-term growth with $800 million or $0.8 billion allocated to growth capital through that first half and the additional $2 billion of returns in addition to the 20p from Tangela. 
So if I can turn to some of the growth that we do offer, and that's both in terms of cost and volume and margin, as well as capital projects. So as I've mentioned, the first half has seen some impact from COVID in terms of our ability to drive some of those operational improvements and some of the technology rollout. It has been hampered just practically in terms of the things that we've had to deal with. And clearly, the priority on every site is the safe and healthy working conditions for our employees and contractors. So we do remain absolutely committed to the $3 billion to $4 billion improvement target, but the delivery has been delayed by 1 year to 2023. 
Now it is worth noting that I would expect that target to now actually increase given -- excuse me, that in 2023, we'll have a full year benefit from Quellaveco and that will feed through, I think, both in the cost and the volume line. But we'll formally update that guidance in December at the investment update. But no make mistake, the big ticket items that we are chasing continue to remain our focus. And while you're not seeing it drop to the bottom line at the moment, we are very confident in the delivery. 
Next slide, please. So in terms of growth projects itself, they remain broadly on track, and more than 90% of our growth capital is allocated to future-enabling products within our portfolio. So those metals and minerals that are essential for the decarbonization of the planet and meeting our global consumer demand trends. 
In the near term, Quellaveco remains on track for next year, delivering at least a 10% uplift in copper equivalent volume. We also have several smaller, quicker return projects coming on stream in the next 2 to 3 years, the diamond vessel in Namibia, delivering some of the highest value diamonds across the portfolio, UHDMS technology project, delivering more of that premium product and the debottlenecking at Minas-Rio. In addition, incremental expansions at. 
So a little further out, we've also got the project, but we're still working on that best configuration of size, technology to integrate into the project. I would expect the studies would be largely complete by the end of the year and then in a position to potentially make a decision in the first half of next year. 
In met coal, clearly, the current focus is around stability and safety in the operations as we bring them back, and we look at how that low CapEx expansion in the wash plant may feed in in due course. Mark will provide an update on Woodsmith shortly. But similar to the operating side, we are seeing some impact from COVID as we just sensibly roll out these projects. And again, if there's any change to the timing, we'll update you in December. 
So last slide for me to wrap up. A familiar message, it's all about balance, competitive returns to shareholders with over $10 billion return since 2017. We offer attractive high-margin near-term growth in future-enabling products. We do remain confident of achieving that 45% to 50% mining margin across the cycle. But importantly, we're really delivering on the integrity and sustainability of the business to make the world a better place. Mark, back to you."

Just go to the next slide, please, if we could. I think in the conversation and in what both Stephen and I have talked to, 2 of the key differentiators, we think in the business. The relative improvement we've made to our operating cost,",2641,"Thanks, Stephen. Just go to the next slide, please, if we could. I think in the conversation and in what both Stephen and I have talked to, 2 of the key differentiators, we think in the business. The relative improvement we've made to our operating cost, which is an ongoing journey and still lots more to do and lots more potential. So we think that's very important. Secondly, the marketing work we've done in understanding and driving for higher realized prices even against benchmarks established in the industry, and that's helping with our margin growth, and they've been 2 key differentiators. The third and probably goes at the top is our portfolio. 
So the balanced investment program that Stephen talks about is coupled with our move out of thermal coal and into crop nutrients. That will position our portfolio increasingly towards future-enabling products to play well into key demand teams. And again, I think the movements that we've created over the last few years in our portfolio really is helping us shape a very different future for our company relative to our competitors. And that we think is very important and it's one that I don't think we've yet been given full appreciation for in the market. 
The world needs the metals and minerals we produce to enable the transposition to allow the economy -- low carbon economy and to meet other global consumer demand trends. Our growing copper production is key to electrification. Our PGMs are essential for decarbonization mobility today. And we think will play a key role in hydrogen in the hydrogen solution for the longer term, while our high-quality iron ore, and I'm talking high-quality iron ore, relative to others is essential to enable the delivery of the cleaner steel necessary for building a low-carbon infrastructure that supports the energy and carbon transition. 
The balance of mix is in met coal where we produce predominantly premium hard coking coal. And while the world needs still to deliver on our decarbonization targets, met coal in the short term and high-quality met coal, in particular, is absolutely critical to produce steel to enable that decarbonization. In the long term, the move to hydrogen and other technologies will see met coal reduce in the mix. And so by 2040, which is about the length of our resources in the ground, we think that matches with the transition that we have to go through and that our high-quality hard or premium hard coking coal is important as part of that transition. 
Next slide, please. So touching some more on those portfolio changes. We're very pleased with the progress on thermal coal. We said we'd be out of thermal coal within 2 to 3 years, and we've delivered well ahead of schedule, but importantly, in a responsible way. As you know, we completed the demerger of the South African operations at the start of June, maintaining the public scrutiny and accountability by listing the business. 
We've also ensured that we do the right thing by all stakeholders in setting that business up for success with the initial funding we provided as well as our transitional support being key to that responsible transition. It's been a good outcome all around. We would prefer to put our capital to work in those future-enabling commodities, as Steven outlined, and there were clear dissynergies between the thermal coal business as it stood today and the rest of the portfolio. Building on that success, we're very pleased to announce the sale of our 1/3 interest in Cerrejon to Glencore. Assuming we secure regulatory approvals, we expect to complete in the first half of 2022. However, economically, we'll have been out from the 31st of December 2020. 
So looking at the future-enabling changes to our portfolio, next slide, please, on Quellaveco, construction remains on schedule and on budget. The second wave of COVID in Peru meant that they got off to a slightly slower start in 2021. So we expect capital to be a little bit lower or on the lower end of the scale, that is the $0.8 billion to $1 billion range for 2021. That means some of the works will shift into 2022. But Tom and the guys have been very careful in the way they've scheduled the critical path activities. So we've maintained our resources on those critical path activities as a priority. And so we're still on track for that mid-'22 commissioning date. 
There's been good progress on the infrastructure projects, big milestones for completion of the construction of the viscose dam, so that's the water infrastructure. That also is important from both a project point of view and a community point of view because it's an important source of water for the community gives them all around water for 365 day a year agricultural activity, which is a really important commitment to the community.  are already starting to focus on the ramp-up of the mining operations. And as you can see, they've also got a flare for the colorful. For those that don't know what those colors represent, They're the colors of Peru and McKague. So despite times being tough, it's always good to see they go celebrate a milestone. 
From our point of view, they're about 25% ahead of the mining volumes that we've committed to be where we committed to be from the outset. And so that all goes well for our commissioning as we start on those key works early next year. So really pleased with the progress and the guys have done a great job in what has been fairly difficult circumstances. 
Next slide, please. Turning to Woodsmith, our greenfield crop nutrients program in the U.K. A technical review of Woodsmith has made significant progress, and we're working through the findings to finalize the design and schedule and budget. The renewable work has further emphasized the high-quality nature of the resource. The work that we're doing in the markets, and we're now in full commercial trials with the product. So we've proven that the product can deliver and does deliver material benefits to the crops that we touch. And so we're now in about 550 commercial trials. And that's about building the customer base for long-term use of the product. 
The review has further emphasized the quality and the different type of product we're producing. Because of the resource, basically run of mine material, on a ship able to go anywhere in the world, it's a first quartile product in terms of cost. Very low carbon footprint, the right physical configuration and with work on the project infrastructure, all those projects are going pretty well. 
As we said in February, as we work towards bringing everything up to standard, we do see some challenges in the timing of the shafts. We're working through those challenges. And our intention is to make sure that we finished the detail, which we'll do by the end of this year. We then program out the shaft to make sure we manage the cost in a very tight envelope. And so by probably next year, we will give you then the full plan and the projected timing from the project based on that detail. 
As we've said at Anglo, the lessons learned over a long period of time in projects is you must get the strategy right, the detail in the planning right and then the execution will follow in an efficient and cost-effective way. And we won't change that model and that formula for any project. And so we're quite excited. We think we're in a good place. We've still got a lot more work to do. And I make 1 final point about the nature of the product. It is not potash. It is a multi-nutrient, low chloride fertilizer certified for organic use. It has a carbon footprint, 85% lower than conventional products. 
If you don't understand that conversation, please contact us, we'll explain to you why this is very different. It's bottom quartile cost, it can literally travel anywhere in the world, and it's a unique product as our future customers are starting to see in the crop trials that we're going through. 
Next slide, please. In terms of the metals and minerals we're producing I think there's another differentiating point that really comes through in our futureSmartMining and the way we've linked that to our sustainability work and the focus on creating a healthy environment. While the metals and minerals we produce are critical to decarbonizing our planet, we're under no illusions. Improvements must be delivered sustainably, and our technical innovation program must connect with all of those objectives across the business. These leading capabilities are also the key to delivering our sustainable mining plan and carbon-neutral operations by 2040. Importantly, these targets are backed by solid plans and work programs that would deliver long-term sustainability while also driving productivity and cost improvement. One can go with the other, if you've got the technology right, and you're executing the key sequences to make sure that you make this a net business performance improvement as well as being a cleaner, healthier set of operations. 
I believe we will be in a position for our sustainability update event in October to announce our Scope 3 targets, that will then demonstrate to people how we believe we can travel over the next 10 to 20 years, making a net positive impact across the globe and certainly demonstrate that mining can be one of the key drivers of a clean future for the world. 
Next slide, please. Consistent with that theme and again, scratching at and pointing to that -- another point of differentiation in the business. Our technical innovation program is holistic in its scope and approach, and it's about changing the way mining is undertaken given where we've come from over the last 100 years. Tony's team and looking at a broad range of integrated technical and digital solutions that will reduce our energy and carbon footprint, as I talked to earlier. 
Our water consumption will also materially drop as well our physical footprint. That is production intensity will improve, which means your capital intensity drops as well. With the added benefit that whilst being created decarbonizing, it makes sense from an economic perspective. And I think that's critical. And again, it explains, I think, a differentiating point with how we put these programs together to drive business performance. We've talked a lot about these technical innovations with Tony updating you most recently in May. That's worth checking out if you can get a copy of the presentation. These guys spoke a lot about the voxel platform that is really exciting and is industry-leading and helps us tie all the key moving parts. 
We were ahead of the curve in building our technical function when many in the industry were cutting theirs. And even when we went through '15 and '16, and it was tough times, but we felt that this commitment would be a game changer. And so it's turning out to be and certainly underpins both our business improvement initiatives and our commitment to decarbonization and improving our environmental footprint or reducing our environmental footprint. 
Next slide, please. Very simple example of the innovation that we're driving across the business. The first 300-tonne truck is actually being constructed as we speak. And this is the early peak of where we are today. I know many of you have been very interested in the progress we're making with the truck. The components are currently going through bench trials ahead of delivery to Mogalakwena in October. The hydrogen production plant should start commissioning in November. We will then conduct extensive field testing through '22, '23. It should reduce operational emissions by about 15% across the globe once fully installed. 
So with that, we are also finalizing conversations to get the build of the 100-megawatt solar plant underway which is also expected to reduce our emissions in the PGM business by 25%. Now this is an important step as well as it's also part of the coordination and connection work we're doing in South Africa and looking at helping them build their grids in a very different way. And as you would be aware, most recently, the South African government actually approved for the industry, the building of 100-megawatt -- up to 100-megawatt power plants to be operated by private players. And so we'll be one of the first to move into that space. 
Next slide, please. So how does this all come together? We're working on growing the portfolio in the right products, while ensuring that we deliver those products in the most sustainable way from both in the ESG and operations performance standpoint. And as Stephen talks to, our capital allocation has been balanced in terms of improvements and in terms of growth for the future and making sure that our shareholders share in those returns as we continue to improve performance. We believe we need to continue our trajectory from being a focused mining company, i.e., digging holes, to be a metals and minerals company we are today. That is we're focused on customers, margins and making sure that we're getting the right value for the products that we're selling. And that is the value we're creating for our customers. And our transition to be a material solution provider takes into account where we think the world is going and how we believe we can shape our business to continue building new profit pools and improve our returns for the long term. 
So we're not simply about costs. We're about costs. We're about value. We're about sustainable delivery of value for shareholders, for all of our stakeholders. Because with that approach, we believe we'll get support to continue developing and growing as we've shown and as we're demonstrating in terms of our investments in growth in the portfolio. 
Next slide, please. So finally, and in summary, we believe the delivery of sustainable returns to all stakeholders is an imperative that will define the long-term success of our business. We are well positioned to deliver on these key imperatives as we are differentiated with a combination of technical, marketing and sustainability capabilities that have been developed as competitive advantages in our rapidly changing external environment. 
Coupling these capabilities with our world-class assets, strong balance sheet, and our ongoing improvement journey underpinned by the people that are developing and very proud of what they're delivering, we believe the future has been set, the foundations have been set and we should continue to improve. We've been clear in terms of what we're focused on. Delivering better than 10% free cash flow through the cycle is the key to both investing in future opportunities, delivery of returns to shareholders and making sure we continue to build and grow the business. And by focusing on our returns on capital, the ROCE number makes sure that we're not blowing returns by putting -- by over capitalizing the assets. And that natural tension between the 2 is critical. And from our point of view, is about delivery of long-term value for us. And then making sure that, that value is sustainable and growth is sustainable, our 7 pillars of value, starting from safety and health through to the social performance right the way through to making sure our balance sheet is flexible so we can be countercyclical. And so we continue to be a balanced player in the market, as Stephen described, is all about getting these parameters and these targets right. 
And so for us, this is what we come to work thinking about each and every day, and these are where the debates are focused in making sure we've got the position right for the future. So with that, very happy to take questions."

As you know, we've been investing in the business. We've been improving. We're the first to say that we're nowhere near where we want to be, so we can continue to improve. The second half, obviously, we have to work through COVID. We're operating at about 95% capacity. So that's my first point. We'd like to get that to 100% as we go into 2022. But I think it will still be with us for the next 6 months. I think that's important to note. 
In terms of commodities, I think iron ore might soften a little bit. But the underlying or the fundamentals are still very good, and the fact we've got quality, I think, means that we'll preferentially maybe do a little bit better, but that's a bit hard to judge, but I certainly think we're in the right place in the market. And as people tighten up a bit, they generally like to see a little more quality supporting their volumes. So I think we're okay there. 
PGMs are well still short. Palladium and rhodium already tracked back a bit in my view. So I don't think it will go too far. Copper, I think the underlying demand fundamentals are strong. So again, we don't think that will fall back. Diamonds is in recovery mode. That's improving. And in met coal, we've still got more to do and more to improve and why we won't see much of Grosvenor this year, we think continuous improvements in Moranbah and then Grosvenor adding to that means that through the balance of this year and into next year, lots of things to be positive about. And then you've got Quellaveco. 
So from our point of view, no, we don't fit is as good as we can be. We still got a long way to go. Pricing, a little bit more of an open debate, but the breadth of our portfolio, the depth, the cost position I think we're set to take advantage of that, and we're growing. And not many others in this industry can say they're growing with the quality that we're growing with. And those positions will also improve our relative cost position. So I think we're in pretty good shape, Alain."

Look, I'll give a broad perspective, and I'll invite Stephen -- although he doesn't need to be invited, but in any way, we'll chat. But look, if you look at the business, I think De Beers has more improvement potential on its operating cost. It's had a really bumpy ride in the last 12 months. It's a major restructuring. Bruce is bringing those changes through to reduce its costs. It's certainly been impacted by COVID, both in Canada where we had to stop for a month. has been struggling with COVID. 
We're all part of the solution there and they're improving. Namibia will have the new ship. So I think De Beers will be in good shape and continue to improve, particularly as we go into 2022. The copper vessel cost has done a good job. Quellaveco coming in, 300,000 tonnes of copper at around $1 a will come in a bit less than that in the early days. And we'll probably commission up pretty quickly based on the new mine plan. So that will make a real contribution on the copper side. 
Timber and the guys have still got some more work and improvements they said Kumba. Minas has been a bit in and out, although they're 20% under the original feasibility costs. I think getting more stability and a little bit more volume will help them on the operating shots of improvements. Then you've got Tony and the team's full technology program. We're just starting to put some of those new technologies in the business. We haven't really seen a big contribution yet other than the incremental stuff you're seeing across the board. So in the next 2 years, those impacts are at least in the 5% to 10% range. So that might help us balance off some of the input pressures. Steve?"

A couple of quick comments to add to that. I think copper, being, yes, 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes around the dollar market, let's call it cash cost.

I think copper, being, yes, 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes around the dollar market, let's call it cash cost. That's clearly going to bring us down the copper curve across our portfolio. 
Iron ore, I think quality premiums generally will remain. Even if in absolute terms, the iron ore base and the premium number come down, I think as a percentage and as a differentiator, that theme will continue. 
And then in PGMs, that's assuming we finalized the Mogalakwena expansion and just that increased focus on quality and returns from that expansion. And and have set some pretty challenging cost targets that they're going to get after. So I think that could flow through as well. And just to pick up one of the last points Mark made on the technology and innovation is we know you're not seeing it in the bottom line just at the moment, but we are very confident that those benefits are emerging in the business and will continue to emerge. Maybe slightly delayed, as I said, from where we had originally envisaged, but they should start to come through strongly through '22 and '23 in particular."

And for us, you've got to be countercyclical, keep the balance sheet conservative, make sure you're delivering the returns as you should.

And that's quite unique for an acquisition in this industry in these days. The resource is better than we thought. The mining methods we think are appropriate. We've said that we'd bring a bit of capital forward for the ventilation shaft to give us more flexibility. We have gone for a fully continuous miner automated operation as opposed to some drill and blast. So we made technical changes, which means you change a few parameters. 
The main issue are the 2 shafts. Now we've got the first SBR that's turned last week. That will actually start operation during the course of August. And that will tell us because that's the critical path work what the shafts would look like. And so we'll have a bit under our belt in terms of the SBRs and their performance by the year-end, which will then inform our investments going forward. But even if we take an envelope of good and bad it's still overwhelmingly a positive strong project. 
The Board bought Sirius, and we bought Sirius to build and go forward, that hasn't changed from anything we've seen. In our due diligence, we picked up the shaft as the issue. They certainly are. And when we come to you at the end of the year, I expect we'll be telling you what the execution strategy and ultimately, the only debate will be the date of acceleration. And for us, it's important to make sure it's right and done well before we go forward. But we'll be going forward with this project, I believe."

So has the experience over the last 6, 12 months led you to take a more conservative and phased approach when you're thinking about those projects? 
And linked to that, is there a ceiling in terms of how much CapEx this group can handle? Is it around $6 billion to $7 billion? And then a separate slightly cheeky follow-up, just on a question for you, Mark, on your tenure. Not that I'm wishing you way by any means, but you previously suggested that you aim to remain CEO until Quellaveco delivered next year. Does that timing still hold? Or is COVID push things out?"

No, I don't think that there's any link to any timing in terms of probably the COVID or capital capacity at the moment. It's really about bringing the projects through in the right time with the right discipline. And so a couple of the obvious ones, things like Norenberg Grove, that's really been operated by the operation. I have been impacted by the operational aspects that are really well known. So really, until we get those back up and running at the capacity we'll reassess then the impact on the wash plant. 
If we hit that capacity quite quickly, I imagine that most planned expansion may make perfect sense. But let's wait, let's get back and then we'll make that decision. The planning work for that project is progressing. We'll put it in the COVID, and then we'll see how we go.  again, it's about doing the right work and making sure we've got the right technology matched with the right size and scale for mining, for processing, et cetera. And so that work is ongoing. That should complete by the end of the year. And as I said, hopefully, by first half. 
Woodsmith, I think Mark's covered well. So they're really the main moving parts. You then got Quellaveco various of those things. So we have, I suppose, captured those elements within the capital guidance that we've given. Yes, they happen to drop around that sort of, let's call it, $5 million to $7 million when you combine that with the sustaining the life extension, et cetera. So, yes, we think we're pretty well placed across that portfolio. I probably wouldn't want to spend too much more than 6 or 7 a year, but our capacity to do so, I suppose, potentially increases as we keep improving our cash flow in our operations and progressively bring projects like Quellaveco.

Hence, Quellaveco, the team -- some of the team will roll off into to support the team there. The smaller projects or 3 smaller projects each year, quite within our capacity to handle physically and from a balance sheet point of view. And the way we've sequenced those moves something like Mogalakwena. We don't want to put too much material in the market. So we're very sensitive to pricing despite what 1 or 2 others may say, we really pay attention to diamond market, PGMs market. And so making sure that we don't bring on too much at any one time is also an important point and a responsibility point from our point of view. There's no point undermining the value we create by getting that wrong. So that approach is consistent. 
And certainly, from our point of view, it's about the organization capacity as well to spend it in a sensible way. On my own personal situation, I've said and made a commitment to the Board that I would see Quellaveco through, and I would continue to serve at their pleasure. That hasn't changed. As all organizations do and should do, we've tried to make sure that the Board has got -- and my job has been to make sure they've got internal options, and I think we've done that, and they'll make the decision when it's appropriate.

But at the moment, that 11% reflects products coming back into the market different customers wanting different things, good quality products that we're able to put our hands on. So it's a combination of things that have popped it up to the 11%, but that would be hard to maintain in a steadier market.

On the buyback versus special, a couple of factors we take into account. Shareholder preference is clearly one of them. And we recognize that there are different views in the market with different shareholders, perhaps particularly across regions. Again, we try to strike a balance. So if you look at the $4.1 billion, $3.1 billion of that is dividend and $1 billion is buyback. And I think Mark touched on it as well in terms of value. We believe what we're delivering.

Look, on the Chile conversation, we led an interaction with the Senate Committee for the industry. And the reason we led it, Tyler, is because of our technology work, our hydrogen work. And Chile is really looking to develop its technology economy and looking to be a clean economy, obviously, off the back of copper. And they see our progress and our lead in that space as being an important point. So we led the conversation. 
The points we made, I think we're all about mining in country. We pay tax in the country unlike many other sectors that have been subject to a lot of debate. I think that point was really well acknowledged. The second point is that taxes and with the improvement in earnings that we're generating more tax flows will be coming. So that will continue to improve the. And in fact, South Africa just made an announcement earlier this morning that the tax take in the first quarter was the best they've seen in 3 or 4 years, and it's the mining industry that's made a difference. 
So our messaging on what contributions we make in those countries. And when we take into account wages and all the other contributions is unlike any other industry, that's the messaging. That's what we delivered last week. And it was a really constructive interaction. So if I was betting, I'd say, look, Chile is now in a sensible place in terms of its conversations. 
I think there will be no doubt pressure still on some type of adjustment given the constitutional base. But I'm now a lot more comfortable that it's a sensible conversation that we do have from time to time in these moments. Peru, first speech post election, again, much more balanced than we've seen. Our interactions with him have been pretty positive. He recognize, understand that Quellaveco represents 1% of the country's GDP. He made a specific point of saying in the speech that it's not his intention to impact growth and the important drivers of the economy. So that was good. 
He did talk about having a chat to the industry about stability agreements. Remember, we've got a 15-year stability agreement. But again, I think it was far more conciliatory and balanced than what we've previously seen. So I think we're getting to a more sensible set of conversations that may impact to some degree, but I don't think it will be crazy stuff that we saw maybe even 3 months ago."

And that is that just a reminder that the U.K. you've done it, but they just do it in a red brief case on the doorsteps of Downing Street.  And the U.S. have done it, and they do it passing through parliament. So it's not just something that's focused on emerging economies, all economies are thinking about how they're balancing their books. My encouragement is always, let's do it as simply as possible with established tax regimes and rules and calculation methodology on its broader base as possible. And I think that sets everyone up for a more sustainable certain future. 
On inflation, again, just a quick first-up comment. Remember, the impact of revenue or strong prices that we've had versus perhaps currency and commodity input costs, clearly, far weighted towards the $8 billion we had in terms of positive revenue impact. On sticky inflation, we're not seeing anything untoward at this point in time. A lot of our employment agreements to our major operations are partway through their current, say, 2-, 3- or 4-year sort of time frame. We have a number of them rolling into, I think, '20 -- maybe '22 or '23 at the earliest across our operations. The current period, it's been a little bit hard to react to the inflation inputs. So supply chains have been disrupted, they sort of had to pay and source what you could get, particularly if there was disruption, you were concerned about to secure material. It's been harder to react in terms of volumes. While we say we're operating around that 95% level, that's as a result of seriously hard work across the operations, let's say, to get us up from an otherwise 85% level by the great work the teams have done to minimize the impact in the operation front. So it's been a bit hard to respond beyond that to close that gap on a unit cost basis. So remember, these are unit costs we're talking about, which are impacted by volume. 
Again, I'd come back to the TNS and technology and innovation initiatives. Our ability, particularly through the first quarter of the year in some of the Southern Hemisphere, where you had COVID and rain and summer holidays, it was hard to get the momentum through that first quarter. I think we're back on track now through a lot of those automation, process control, some of the bulk ore orders, et cetera. Those projects are now progressing quite well. 
And so it's just been a little bit hard to respond in as quick a period as you would like. Remember, we weren't seeing it at the end of last year when we reported in February. And so yes, it has emerged. Some of it currency, some of it cost. We will respond in time, I think, appropriately. We've always said ourselves improvement targets well above that expected inflation for exactly this reason that we need to drive improvements in the underlying business."

And obviously, the general improvements that we've made across the board, the technical reconfiguration of session, all those sorts of things. 
The second phase that we're just lining up to roll through in the next 3 or 4 years is the capital investments and growth in quality projects that all have better margins. So that 45% to 50% margin we talked about is based on those lower cost operations coming in and making a positive cost and margin contribution. And the technology where bulk ore sorting cause particle flotation, all of that over the next 2 to 3 years start to impact the operations as well. 
So there's a real forward momentum, but it's sort of a flat spot. And then '22, '23, '24, you'll see a real push again down from where we've been, which is very similar to what we saw in '15, '16 and '17, in my view. So I think we're doing a lot of work to balance and try and negate those impacts. But in this sort of environment, you will have those input pressures, but that's there for us to manage."

And from our point of view, no one sits comfortably when you've had that type of incident. So you've got to really be introspective and trying to understand or introspect and try and understand the issues. I think the management of gas and how we set the longwalls up needs to be adjusted from an industry perspective as well. There have been a number of gas emissions in the field. 
And so automation, elevating some of the technical work we do to make sure that we've got the right expertise in solving some of those problems is something that I think we've learned a few lessons on as well. And the designs that we think need to be taken into account, the ability to drop the power off if you get a waste for is also important. So there's quite a few things there, Ian, but I think there's quite a few things for the industry. 
And again, we've used it right across the board to try and take ourselves to another level on the safety front. So it's a journey. We recognize that we're not where we want to be. I mean, compared to where we were 7 years ago in 2013, we had 15 fatal incidents. And so we've obviously made a lot of progress, but we're still not where we want to be, and we're the first put our hand and look at ourselves and say there's still more work to be done. 
And I think the recommendation, we don't agree with some of the points, by the way, but because on our guys couldn't give evidence that will be covered in the formal evidence that's provided.

Thank you for joining us today. You've got both Stephen and myself. Next slide, please.For those that enjoy a bedtime read, we've got the cautionary statement. Next slide, plea",2771,"Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those a little further afield. Thank you for joining us today. You've got both Stephen and myself. Next slide, please.
For those that enjoy a bedtime read, we've got the cautionary statement. Next slide, please. For today, our order of play is consistent with our established routine. You'll have myself touching on performance and highlighting a couple of, we think, key points. Second, Stephen will run through the numbers to provide the detailed insights and to reinforce our focus on capital discipline, which is reflected through our returns to shareholders and our capital spending priorities. And to close, I'll take you through how we are positioning the business for the future. And as you've seen from our thermal coal announcements in the half, there's lots happening on this front.
Next slide, please. On results, a record half for us, our highest ever EBITDA in a reporting half, somewhere in the 70% range higher than anything we've ever done before. The result was delivered despite us running at around 95% full production capacity. COVID remains a factor across the globe. And while it's been carefully managed our people and across all of our jurisdictions, it did have an impact on the operations. So from our perspective, we still see improvement in the business as countries move through the vaccination processes.
We're also impacted in the operations with our met coal constraints, although Moranbah was operating again at the end of the half and development work has restarted at Grosvenor, although that will still take a bit of time to bring through. Growing EBITDA margin of 61% tells much of the earnings story, a function of both solid costs in terms of where we come from in the last few years and improving product prices. And our focus on quality and delivering value in use credit in terms of the prices we've realized above and beyond benchmark prices has really come to the fore, and I think has been a very obvious part of the story in terms of the results.
Return on capital employed, 49%. And if we adjust the capital base for Quellaveco and Woodsmith spending so far, which do impact the denominator, our ROTE would be, in fact, 56%. So again, both very strong numbers. Of course, high commodity prices have been very important to us. But at the same time, we've seen increasing prices. Unit costs were up 15%, largely a function of stronger FX, particularly in the emerging economies.
If we exclude the FX impact, where unit costs were up 6%, reflecting our 5% productivity pause through the COVID issues and some higher input costs as commodity prices have driven our input or, if you like, the consumable pricing. But Stephen will give you more color in his part of the presentation. But all in all, an encouraging result. It reflects -- and has been reflected through additional shareholder returns of $2 billion on top of the base dividend of $2.1 billion, and that reflects a 77% million payout just short of the 80% -- just short of 80%. From our point of view, if you add in Thungela, the returns look very good. But again, Stephen will unpack all of those parts of the story.
So next slide, please. On safety, health and environment, we continue to focus on our improvement journey. Looking at safety first, you'll see that we have been fatality-free in the first half, which I think reflects the good work we've been doing on the elimination of fatalities task force that we put in place a few years ago. The negative there is the slight uptick in our injury frequency rates, and that's the total injury frequency rates. And we've seen a higher injury rate in our precious metals business and in the Quellaveco project, 2 countries impacted by COVID. And so the team is being very careful in terms of how we manage work to make sure that we don't see that negative trend continue. But real focus on safety and making sure that we're balancing off and making sure that COVID doesn't impact the processes we follow in terms of doing the work.
Health, again, great improvement over the last few years, reflecting the focus on elimination of hazards at source. And on the environment, again, no incidents in the first half, which again reflects the improved planning and operating disciplines that we've introduced across the business. And whilst it's good to see no incidents in the first half, we've still got a way to go to make sure that we're happy with all aspects of the operations.
Next slide, please. On the healthy environment and thriving communities, which is the broader social conversation, the critical -- or the progress we've made on improving towards our targets per the sustainable mining plan have been solid. We're targeting an absolute reduction of 30% in both energy and greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. And that's from the 2016 levels. And that's our scope 1 and scope 2 equivalent. The recovery from COVID has been patchy and required -- and we require improved operating stability to make sure that we're operating at our best energy-efficient level. So a little bit more to be done. But certainly, from our point of view, a pretty good results so far.
We've also been making pleasing progress towards decarbonizing our operations, both of the energy efficient work and by switching power sources, particularly in South America from traditional fossil fuels to renewables. And as of next year, with the agreement done in Peru on Quellaveco and recent changes we've made in Brazil and Chile, we will be 100% green main supply electricity across South America from next year. So that's a major milestone for us in business. And we also plan to generate hydrogen from electrolysis at our mine sites along across the globe. We're using those renewable energy sources. So the move to eliminate diesel in our operations starts with these changes. And if we're able to get our truck fleet done by 2030, that in of itself would be a 15% reduction in our energy -- or in our greenhouse gas emissions. So an important milestone with the truck that we've got coming in at Mogalakwena.
As you know, last year, we designed our new Social Way 3.0 program, and that is a package of social standards and practices. We are working to fully transition to this new set of standards and processes by the end of '22. Implementing this new high bar and industry benchmark for community engagement and social performance is very important to us. And certainly, there's been good progress in the half. And by next year, we should be in really good shape at that next level.
Next slide, please. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our WeCare program has enabled us to make a responsible, holistic and coordinated effort to protect people, both in the business and in our host communities, while also making sure we secure and maintain the integrity of our operations. And that 95% production rate reflects the processes, the procedures, some absenteeism due to COVID, but making sure all of those pieces are done
[Audio Gap]
controlling the spread of the virus, and we'll make sure that we continue to work with everybody in terms of mitigating the operating impacts.
A comprehensive suite of robust operating protocols and controls remain in place at our operations and certainly would expect those controls to remain in place for the balance of the year. The investment we've actually made in our own testing laboratories helps us rapidly identify new sources of infection and take action to limit the spread. And again, that's been very much appreciated in our local communities and on a broader scale at a national level. And we represent in a few countries that we operate the most significant private run testing program across those countries, and that's certainly been appreciated.
We are firmly committed to vaccination and supporting governments in rolling out national vaccination programs, and we've already got a program in South Africa that's been supported by the government.
Next slide, please. In terms of contributions and benefits to all stakeholders, I'm also very pleased to announce today that we'll be making a $100 million special endowment allocation to the Anglo American Foundation, providing further support to long-term health, education, livelihood and environmental projects that contribute to our sustainable mining targets across the globe, which, as you know, are aligned with the UN sustainability development goals. The funding will go to a broad range of projects, spanning climate change initiatives, health infrastructure, childhood nutrition, clean water and sanitation, early childhood development, just as a few examples.
This investment in the future builds on the comprehensive contribution that we make to our stakeholders that totaled over $25 billion in 2020. So it's not just a shareholder story, it's about the good we do on a much broader basis. Having worked in this industry for longer than I can remember, I'm deeply proud of the contribution both Anglo American and the mining industry makes to our societies. In particular, the countries in which we work, we do make a real difference to the lives of local people, acting as catalysts for positive change. I don't think many industries can demonstrate such a positive contribution to the countries where they generate their profits, the taxes we pay, there's no industry that matches mining in terms of its contribution to local economies. And for us, we all need to be proud of that contribution. And for us, this is a very important part of our conversation today.
Next slide, please. To business, across our key business sectors at De Beers, we saw good sales in the first half, certainly a big move against last year. Consumer demand for polished products has been very solid. China has been good. U.S. continues to improve. Despite the impact of the second wave of viruses in India, and we saw that in the numbers in our fourth site, the most recent sites have been very solid. And again, people are aware that we announced our site 6 numbers yesterday. And again, they were very strong.
So from our point of view, we think the fundamentals for diamonds are very strong. And whilst we talk about the big contribution from iron ore, from copper, from PGMs and other parts of the business, we've got to remember that De Beers is in recovery mode. And so in the second half and into next year, we think it will continue to improve its contribution to the business.
Copper has continued to deliver -- the copper team have continued to deliver consistent operating and cost performance. The near-term water management initiatives we put in place at Los Bronces are delivering results. And we are continuing to work on the longer-term solutions to reduce our water footprint across the country. In this price environment, you may see many different stakeholders, including governments looking for a bigger share of the pie. And we need to remember that our contribution to Chile, Peru and other countries is significant and will become more significant, and we've been involved in a lot of programs and dialogues with both government and our stakeholders in both countries, and those conversations have been very positive. And in particular, helping people understand the contributions we're making, I hope and we think, will change some of those debates, particularly in both Chile and Peru, where we think the conversation is becoming quite sensible.
PGM is a solid mining performance despite the impact of COVID. And the ACP running extremely well. It's actually operating 18% above plan for the first 6 months, reflecting both a higher operating rate, reflecting some of the technical changes we made in the last refurbishment and as well, we're seeing much better maintenance availability. So again, a reflection of the due care and attention that Natasha and the team are putting into the unit.
Strong pricing, clearly, supporting record margins and cash generation despite the impact of the higher U.S. dollar prices. In Bulks, we generated record iron ore margins during the first half, reflecting the quality of iron ore that we produce from both Kumba and Minas-Rio and with the realized iron ore price for our products for the half being at $210 a tonne, I'll pick up why that's occurring a little bit in a minute. But certainly, from our point of view, we think it's a real differentiating point. Our focus on quality, and we've talked about it for the last few years, you are seeing it in the numbers. And I think it's very important to make sure we explain how we're doing that.
Operationally, there were some unplanned maintenance at Minas-Rio. And I think that does track back a little bit to the impact of COVID on maintenance scheduling. I think we've now got that back in balance and I would expect a much better second half from the Minas-Rio team. And at Kumba, the team managed the external impacts of COVID very well, and they are working very closely with Transnet to make sure we utilize rail capacity to the fullest.
In met coal, Moranbah restarted at the beginning of June. We'll take things very carefully as we work through some geological conditions, but again, each week is getting better. At Grosvenor, work restarted underground in April. We're also reviewing all the findings of the Board of Inquiry. There will be numerous learnings, I think, for both us and the industry, and we are targeting a restart by the end of the year. But again, we'll just make sure that we've got all the issues covered before we kick things away. But certainly, we're making good progress.
Next slide, please. So just to explain the work we've been doing. And when we talk about marketing products, people are still asking us questions about quality and what's it worth? As we restructured Anglo, the big headline was 50% less assets. We're producing more today out of half the assets than we were back 7 or 8 years ago. And our unit costs have dropped, if you look at these results, around 25% in nominal terms over that period. So it reflects both portfolio change and the focus on the industrial processes and the technology work that Tony and the team have been contributing.
This relative performance has been delivered despite the mitigation measures we've implemented to offset COVID in the last 12 months. So if we include the reduction of thermal coal from the mix, the reduction in numbers of assets is around 60%. The longer-term improvement approach has been driven by portfolio restructuring, our technical reconfiguring, as I said, the benchmarking work, the operating model P101. And P101 is about focusing and improving on industry benchmarks for shovels, trucks right across the board. So today, we are, per the chart, operating across our businesses at about the 28 percentile on average across the portfolio. If you then compare that to our peers, the top 5, they operate somewhere between 33% and 46%. Now a few years back, we're at the 49th percentile.
Now I'm using the inverse margin curve, which takes quality and then looks at a breakeven cost in each of our commodities to come up with that figure. And so our focus on cost improvement and price improvement for the quality of the products that we produce, then the margin is what's reflected in that price or cost position, which is a breakeven position.
So if we go to the next slide, we'll just take it, that's it. One example, Kumba. Kumba was operating top end third quartile, almost into fourth quartile, we've literally taken almost 50% out of the cost. Shovel productivities are up 40%. Truck productivities, load factors are up 10%, 15%. So that's moved us to the left. But our focus on going from 62.5% quality product to 64.5% quality product, the introduction of the new technologies has kicked our price realizations up at the same time. And the marketing team are selectively selling to those steel producers that pay for quality.
And so put all those factors together, Kumba is now a first quartile producer and Minas-Rio is at the front of the curve. And so it's not about costs. It's not simply about costs. It's about cost, it's about quality and getting value and in the marketing. So it's a 3-dimensional strategy that's driving margins and driving returns.
With that, I'll hand across to Stephen."
409115,1675450262,2355758,"Anglo American plc, H1 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks very much, Mark. So let's jump straight into the numbers on the next slide, please. So turning to the first half numbers. EBITDA at $12.1 billion, a great result and that's driven a record EPS of $4.30 per share for the half. That translated into $",2418,"Thanks very much, Mark. So let's jump straight into the numbers on the next slide, please. So turning to the first half numbers. EBITDA at $12.1 billion, a great result and that's driven a record EPS of $4.30 per share for the half. That translated into $1.71 per share base dividend at the 40% payout ratio.
So clearly, the balance sheet strengthened further through the first half off the back of the very, very strong cash flows with net debt at 0.1x EBITDA. That's allowed us to announce an additional $2 billion of returns, taking the total returns to $3.31 per share. This nicely demonstrates the 3 key themes that I'd like you to take away from today's presentation, capital discipline, balance between growth and returns and continued focus on operating performance.
We are seeing some upward pressure on costs, and you'd expect that in this price environment, largely driven from 2 factors: strengthening producer currencies and perhaps not surprisingly, increased commodity input costs. So up 6% on an FX-neutral basis, and I'll touch further on some of those cost details later.
So if we go to the next slide and look across the different BUs. So a great recovery in diamonds, as Mark mentioned. Demand for polished product is strong, and that's coupled with limited supply and that's led to great demand in our sector. The midstream has largely destocked, and prices increased 14% in the 6-month period. COVID still remains an element of risk that we're monitoring in the cutting and polishing sector and also closely monitoring from our own operations perspective.
At Venetia, as we transition from the open pit to the underground, we'll see some variability in grade, and that will result in some variability as report over the next few periods. Copper, continuing good operating performance, a great control of costs from the team, so really well done there.
PGMs, strong refining performance during the first half with the ACP running well. That looks set to continue through the second half. And price is very, very strong with the minor metals, which are not so minor anymore. So $3.4 billion revenue from rhodium in the half and over $400 million from iridium and ruthenium combined. Healthy margins at 70% despite the higher U.S. dollar unit costs.
Turning to bulks, iron ore, firstly, 70% margins, strong pricing from our high-quality products from Minas-Rio and Kumba and that really plays into the modern demand themes that we're seeing across the steel industry as operators value that quality, the efficiency that brings from an energy and greenhouse gas point of view, and that flows into the premiums that we've seen in the half.
It was a challenging period for met coal, Moranbah now coming back on stream and ramping up and obviously, Grosvenor scheduled to come back on later in the second half. Hopefully, they flow into a strongly improved pricing environment for met coal. So overall, a strong set of numbers, but still room to improve in the second half and as we move into '22.
So next slide, if we look quickly at the drivers of EBITDA itself. Price, clearly, a big factor, no surprises there, but also really pleased with the year-on-year recovery in volumes that we saw from the prior period that was quite heavily impacted from that initial period of COVID. We do continue to have some impacts of COVID, and that's flowing into our ability to realize some of those cost and volume benefits and some of those improvement initiatives that should flow through into the cost and volume bucket in due course.
Next slide, please. If we look at across at our unit costs, so as I said, 6% up on an FX-neutral basis. So foreign exchange was the single largest driver at 9% as producer currencies strengthened. So combined, up 15% over the same period last year. So general CPI across the geographies that we're working was up 3%, but we do need to keep that in perspective. So the CPI pressure here amounted to $200 million impacting our EBITDA, whereas the price impact in the half was close to $8 million positive impact.
So given the strong pricing environment we've enjoyed through the first half, there's no surprise that we're starting to see higher input costs from things like steel, I think met coal and iron ore and copper, I think copper price. We've also seen some input increases through diesels and reagents. And you got to remember that COVID has also resulted in some significant impacts in our supply chain, which has also fed into prices in terms of our input costs. That's added a little bit of pressure into maintenance costs, which have added another 2%, but I expect less of the maintenance headwind in the second half given that we've front-loaded some of the work through the year.
So just a reminder, this is on a unit cost basis, so impacted by volumes and costs. And I'd like to think that as we continue through the second half of H2 and then into 2022, that we recover some of those volumes and that should feed into this outcome. So looking ahead to the second half, we've supplied some full year guidance in the appendix in today's presentations. But on the basis that spot prices continue where they are, which is obviously great for revenue, then we would expect producer currencies to remain strong and provide some element of headwind. But as I say, hopefully, modify as we've written volumes back through '22.
So turning to the next slide and looking at CapEx. So CapEx for the half was $2.2 billion. As I say, COVID has had some ability on our capacity to execute some of the noncritical works during the first half. So we have slightly underspent in terms of where we're expecting to travel for the first half and particularly as we prioritized our maintenance costs and activity rather than the capital works. So we do expect to catch up some of that through the second half, but probably not all. And we will see some of the same headwinds that we're seeing from a strong currency and some [indiscernible] teams also through the capital space, again, steel, copper, oil-related inputs, and that should materialize a little bit or may materialize a little bit in the second half. So in total, we are revising our guidance down by $200 million to $5.5 billion to $6 billion of capital for the year.
Next slide, please. So the half clearly saw some incredibly strong cash generation that's reflected the operational recovery, obviously, as well as strong pricing. It's driven down our debt by $3.6 billion for the half year period and that's obviously a big impact from the higher realized prices. That pricing impact, though, in terms of working capital has probably hidden some of the great work we've done as we've reduced and refined the PGM work-in-progress stocks that we've built up at the end of last year. And we've also run down our inventory in De Beers. So what you see is some of the positive price impact feed into receivables and our purchase concentrate in the PGMs business. So if you can have a good increase in working capital, then this is probably it. So the balance sheet in excellent shape to support our program of capital, investment in growth, and it's allowed us to make those greater returns to shareholders.
Next slide, please. So looking at those returns, we're really pleased to announce the additional $2 billion of returns to shareholders for the half in addition to that base dividend that has naturally increased to $2.1 billion. So $4.1 billion in total. And just a reminder that we also distributed the Thungela shares during the half, which I think as of this morning were trading around GBP 2. And so that equates to another 20p on a 10:1 ratio in terms of distributions to shareholders.
As you know, I'm a fan of balance. Mark often calls me Mr. Balance. So the additional return is structured as a $1 billion special dividend and a $1 billion buyback. So that's 77% payout for the first half and reaffirms our commitment to that capital discipline and returns, exactly as we would say, would do. That takes our returns since we reinstituted the dividend in the first half of '17 to over $10.3 billion.
The 40% payout ratio remains in place. We really do believe that that's an appropriate payout ratio for a company like ourselves through the cycle, particularly when we offer that combination of high margin growth as well as attractive returns, so remembering through the cycle.
So as Mark mentioned, next slide, thanks. It's been a record half for our shareholders, but also for many of the other stakeholders that we touch across the operations. In the first half, our activities resulted in $3.1 billion of taxes, taxes collected and royalties for our host governments, and that's over 2.5x higher than the prior period.
Now it's probably not often you hear a CFO say, but I'm incredibly proud of that large tax number and the contribution that we make to the countries that we operate in. Importantly, we pay our taxes where the profits arise in our host countries. So when prices rise, so do our tax payments and royalty contributions. It's a win-win, and that's how the tax system is in fact supposed to work. I expect of higher profits again in the second half that we would continue to make significant tax payments through that period.
Now depending on the country, the timing of those cash tax payments across different jurisdictions may vary based on tax installment regimes, profitability, level of past investment, losses, et cetera. But overall, I expect our tax payments to increase year-on-year quite significantly. If we look to Brazil, just as a quick example, clearly, the contribution in the current period doesn't reflect the multibillion dollars of investment we've made over the last few years in Minas-Rio. But now that we have utilized a lot of the tax losses, et cetera, in that country, I would expect we will have utilized all those through the second half and our tax payment should rise significantly before year-end.
Now as Mark mentioned, clearly, it's an important topic in many of these jurisdictions that we work, but we are having constructive conversations across the board. And I think people do really appreciate that broader economic contribution that we make.
Next slide, please. So as you know, every period, I'd like to recap our performance against our capital allocation model and scorecard. So cash generation for the period of $6.2 billion after funding sustaining capital. That continues to drive our payout ratio-based dividend with a total of $2.1 billion declared for the first half of the year. As I say, it's always about balance as we continue to invest for near-term growth with $800 million or $0.8 billion allocated to growth capital through that first half and the additional $2 billion of returns in addition to 20p from Thungela.
So if I can turn to some of the growth that we do offer, and that's both in terms of cost and volume and margin, as well as capital projects. So as I've mentioned, the first half has seen some impact from COVID in terms of our ability to drive some of those operational improvements and some of the technology roll-out. It has been hampered just practically in terms of the things that we've had to deal with. And clearly, the priority on every site is the safe and healthy working conditions for our employees and contractors. So we do remain absolutely committed to the $3 billion to $4 billion improvement target, but the delivery has been delayed by 1 year to 2023.
Now it is worth noting that I would expect that target to now actually increase given -- excuse me, that in 2023, we'll have a full year benefit from Quellaveco and that will feed through, I think, both in the cost and the volume line. But we'll formally update that guidance in December at the investment update. But make no mistake, the big ticket items that we are chasing continue to remain our focus. And while you're not seeing it drop to the bottom line at the moment, we are very confident in the delivery.
Next slide, please. So in terms of growth projects itself, they remain broadly on track, and more than 90% of our growth capital is allocated to future-enabling products within our portfolio. So those metals and minerals that are essential for the decarbonization of the planet and meeting our global consumer demand trends.
In the near term, Quellaveco remains on track for next year, delivering at least a 10% uplift in copper equivalent volumes. We also have several smaller, quicker return projects coming on stream in the next 2 to 3 years, the diamond vessel in Namibia, delivering some of the highest value diamonds across the portfolio, the Sishen UHDMS technology project, delivering more of that premium product and the debottlenecking at Minas-Rio. In addition, incremental expansions at Collahuasi.
So a little further out, we've also got the Mogalakwena project, but we're still working on that best configuration of size, technology to integrate into the project. I would expect the studies would be largely complete by the end of the year and then in a position to potentially make a decision in the first half of next year.
In met coal, clearly, the current focus is around stability and safety in the operations as we bring them back, and we look at how that low CapEx expansion in the wash plant may feed in, in due course. Mark will provide an update on Woodsmith shortly. But similar to the operating side, we are seeing some impact from COVID as we just sensibly roll out these projects. And again, if there's any change to the timing, we'll update you in December.
So last slide for me to wrap up. A familiar message, it's all about balance, competitive returns to shareholders with over $10 billion return since 2017. We offer attractive high-margin, near-term growth in future-enabling products. We do remain confident of achieving that 45% to 50% mining margin across the cycle. But importantly, we're really delivering on the integrity and sustainability of the business to make the world a better place. Mark, back to you."

Just go to the next slide, please, if we could. I think in the conversation and in what both Stephen and I have talked to, 2 of the key differentiators, we think in the business. The relative improvement we've made to our operating cost,",2650,"Thanks, Stephen. Just go to the next slide, please, if we could. I think in the conversation and in what both Stephen and I have talked to, 2 of the key differentiators, we think in the business. The relative improvement we've made to our operating cost, which is an ongoing journey and still lots more to do and lots more potential. So we think that's very important. Secondly, the marketing work we've done in understanding and driving for higher realized prices even against benchmarks established in the industry, and that's helping with our margin growth, and they've been 2 key differentiators. The third and probably goes at the top is our portfolio.
So the balanced investment program that Stephen talks about is coupled with our move out of thermal coal and into crop nutrients. That will position our portfolio increasingly towards future-enabling products to play well into key demand themes. And again, I think the movements that we've created over the last few years in our portfolio really is helping us shape a very different future for our company relative to our competitors. And that we think is very important and it's one that I don't think we've yet been given full appreciation for in the market.
The world needs the metals and minerals we produce to enable the transposition to a low economy -- low-carbon economy and to meet other global consumer demand trends. A growing copper production is key to electrification. Our PGMs are essential for decarbonization mobility today. And we think will play a key role in hydrogen -- in the hydrogen solution for the longer term, while our high-quality iron ore, and I'm talking high-quality iron ore, relative to others is essential to enable the delivery of the cleaner steel necessary for building a low-carbon infrastructure that supports the energy and carbon transition.
The balance of mix is in met coal where we produce predominantly premium hard coking coal. And while the world needs still to deliver on our decarbonization targets, met coal in the short term and high-quality met coal, in particular, is absolutely critical to produce steel to enable that decarbonization. In the long term, the move to hydrogen and other technologies will see met coal reduce in the mix. And so by 2040, which is about the length of our resources in the ground, we think that matches with the transition that we have to go through and that our high-quality hard or premium hard coking coal is important as part of that transition.
Next slide, please. So touching some more on those portfolio changes. We're very pleased with the progress on thermal coal. We said we'd be out of thermal coal within 2 to 3 years, and we've delivered well ahead of schedule, but importantly, in a responsible way. As you know, we completed the demerger of the South African operations at the start of June, maintaining the public scrutiny and accountability by listing the business.
We've also ensured that we do the right thing by all stakeholders in setting that business up for success with the initial funding we provided as well as our transitional support being key to that responsible transition. It's been a good outcome all around. We would prefer to put our capital to work in those future-enabling commodities, as Stephen outlined, and there were clear dissynergies between the thermal coal business as it stood today and the rest of the portfolio. Building on that success, we're very pleased to announce the sale of our 1/3 interest in Cerrejon to Glencore. Assuming we secure regulatory approvals, we expect to complete in the first half of 2022. However, economically, we'll have been out from the 31st of December 2020.
So looking at the future-enabling changes to our portfolio, next slide, please. And on Quellaveco, construction remains on schedule and on budget. The second wave of COVID in Peru meant that they got off to a slightly slower start in 2021. So we expect capital to be a little bit lower or on the lower end of the scale, that is the $0.8 billion to $1 billion range for 2021. That means some of the works will shift into 2022. But Tom and the guys have been very careful in the way they've scheduled the critical path activities. So we've maintained our resources on those critical path activities as a priority. And so we're still on track for that mid-'22 commissioning date.
There's been good progress on the infrastructure projects, big milestones with completion of the construction of the Vizcachas dam, so that's the water infrastructure. That also is important from both a project point of view and a community point of view because it's an important source of water for the community, gives them all around water for ""365 day a year"" agricultural activity, which is a really important commitment to the community. [indiscernible] and the team are already starting to focus on the ramp-up of the mining operations. And as you can see, they've also got a flare for the colorful. For those that don't know what those colors represent, they're the colors of Peru and [ McKague ]. So despite times being tough, it's always good to see they go celebrate a milestone.
From our point of view, they're about 25% ahead of the mining volumes that we've committed to be -- where we committed to be from the outset. And so that all goes well for our commissioning as we start on those key works early next year. So really pleased with the progress and the guys have done a great job in what has been fairly difficult circumstances.
Next slide, please. Turning to Woodsmith, our greenfield crop nutrients program in the U.K. A technical review of Woodsmith has made significant progress, and we're working through the findings to finalize the design and schedule and budget. The renewable work has further emphasized the high-quality nature of the resource. The work that we're doing in the markets, and we're now in full commercial trials with the product. So we've proven that the product can deliver and does deliver material benefits to the crops that we touch. And so we're now in about 550 commercial trials. And that's about building the customer base for long-term use of the product.
The review has further emphasized the quality and the different type of product we're producing. Because of the resource, basically run of mine material, on a ship able to go anywhere in the world, it's a first quartile product in terms of cost. Very low carbon footprint, the right physical configuration and with work on the project infrastructure, all those projects are going pretty well.
As we said in February, as we work towards bringing everything up to standard, we do see some challenges in the timing of the shafts. We're working through those challenges. And our intention is to make sure that we finish the detail, which we'll do by the end of this year. We then program out the shaft to make sure we manage the cost in a very tight envelope. And so by probably next year, we will give you then the full plan and the projected timing from the project based on that detail.
As we've said at Anglo, the lessons learned over a long period of time in projects is you must get the strategy right, the detail in the planning right and then the execution will follow in an efficient and cost-effective way. And we won't change that model and that formula for any project. And so we're quite excited. We think we're in a good place. We've still got a lot more work to do. And I make 1 final point about the nature of the product. It is not potash. It is a multi-nutrient, low-chloride fertilizer certified for organic use. It has a carbon footprint, 85% lower than conventional products.
If you don't understand that conversation, please contact us, we'll explain to you why this is very different. It's bottom quartile cost. It can literally travel anywhere in the world, and it's a unique product as our future customers are starting to see in the crop trials that we're going through.
Next slide, please. In terms of the metals and minerals we're producing, I think there's another differentiating point that really comes through in our FutureSmart Mining and the way we've linked that to our sustainability work and the focus on creating a healthy environment. While the metals and minerals we produce are critical to decarbonizing our planet, we're under no illusions. Improvements must be delivered sustainably, and our technical innovation program must connect with all of those objectives across the business. These leading capabilities are also the key to delivering our sustainable mining plan and carbon-neutral operations by 2040. Importantly, these targets are backed by solid plans and work programs that would deliver long-term sustainability, while also driving productivity and cost improvement. One can go with the other, if you've got the technology right, and you're executing the key sequences to make sure that you make this a net business performance improvement as well as being a cleaner, healthier set of operations.
I believe we will be in a position for our sustainability update event in October to announce our Scope 3 targets, that will then demonstrate to people how we believe we can travel over the next 10 to 20 years, making a net positive impact across the globe and certainly demonstrate that mining can be one of the key drivers of a clean future for the world.
Next slide, please. Consistent with that theme and again, scratching at and pointing to that -- another point of differentiation in the business. Our technical innovation program is holistic in its scope and approach, and it's about changing the way mining is undertaken given where we've come from over the last 100 years. Tony's team are looking at a broad range of integrated technical and digital solutions that will reduce our energy and carbon footprint, as I talked to earlier.
Our water consumption will also materially drop as well our physical footprint. That is production intensity will improve, which means your capital intensity drops as well. With the added benefit that whilst being created decarbonizing, it makes sense from an economic perspective. And I think that's critical. And again, it explains, I think, a differentiating point with how we put these programs together to drive business performance. We've talked a lot about these technical innovations with Tony updating you most recently in May. That's worth checking out if you can get a copy of the presentation. His guys spoke a lot about the VOXEL platform that is really exciting and is industry-leading and helps us tie all the key moving parts.
We were ahead of the curve in building our technical function when many in the industry were cutting theirs. And even when we went through '15 and '16, and it was tough times, but we felt that this commitment would be a game changer. And so it's turning out to be and certainly underpins both our business improvement initiatives and our commitment to decarbonization and improving our environmental footprint or reducing our environmental footprint.
Next slide, please. Very simple example of the innovation that we're driving across the business. The first 300-tonne truck is actually being constructed as we speak. And this is the early peak of where we are today. I know many of you have been very interested in the progress we're making with the truck. The components are currently going through bench trials ahead of delivery to Mogalakwena in October. The hydrogen production plant should start commissioning in November. We will then conduct extensive field testing through '22, '23. It should reduce operational emissions by about 15% across the globe once fully installed.
So with that, we are also finalizing conversations to get the build of the 100-megawatt solar plant underway, which is also expected to reduce our emissions in the PGMs business by 25%. Now this is an important step as well as it's also a part of the coordination and connection work we're doing in South Africa and looking at helping them build their grids in a very different way. And as you would be aware, most recently, the South African government actually approved for the industry, the building of 100-megawatt -- up to 100-megawatt power plants to be operated by private players. And so we'll be one of the first to move into that space.
Next slide, please. So how does this all come together? We're working on growing the portfolio in the right products, while ensuring that we deliver those products in the most sustainable way from both in the ESG and operations performance standpoint. And as Stephen talks to, our capital allocation has been balanced in terms of improvements and in terms of growth for the future and making sure that our shareholders share in those returns as we continue to improve performance. We believe we need to continue our trajectory from being a focused mining company, i.e., digging holes, to be a metals and minerals company we are today. That is we're focused on customers, margins and making sure that we're getting the right value for the products that we're selling. And that is the value we're creating for our customers. And our transition to be a material solution provider takes into account where we think the world is going and how we believe we can shape our business to continue building new profit pools and improve our returns for the long term.
So we're not simply about costs. We're about costs. We're about value. We're about sustainable delivery of value for shareholders, for all of our stakeholders. Because with that approach, we believe we'll get support to continue developing and growing as we've shown and as we're demonstrating in terms of our investments in growth in the portfolio.
Next slide, please. So finally, and in summary, we believe the delivery of sustainable returns to all stakeholders is an imperative that will define the long-term success of our business. We are well positioned to deliver on these key imperatives as we are differentiated with a combination of technical, marketing and sustainability capabilities that have been developed as competitive advantages in our rapidly changing external environment.
Coupling these capabilities with our world-class assets, strong balance sheet, and our ongoing improvement journey underpinned by the people that are developing and very proud of what they're delivering, we believe the future has been set, the foundations have been set and we should continue to improve. We've been clear in terms of what we're focused on. Delivering better than 10% free cash flow through the cycle is the key to both investing in future opportunities, delivery of returns to shareholders and making sure we continue to build and grow the business.
And by focusing on our returns on capital, the ROCE number, makes sure that we're not blowing returns by putting -- by over capitalizing the assets. And that natural tension between the 2 is critical. And from our point of view, is about delivery of long-term value for us. And then making sure that, that value is sustainable and growth is sustainable, our 7 pillars of value, starting from safety and health through to the social performance right the way through to making sure our balance sheet is flexible so we can be countercyclical. And so we continue to be a balanced player in the market, as Stephen described, is all about getting these parameters and these targets right.
And so for us, this is what we come to work thinking about each and every day, and these are where the debates are focused in making sure we've got the position right for the future. So with that, very happy to take questions."

As you know, we've been investing in the business. We've been improving. We're the first to say that we're nowhere near where we want to be, so we can continue to improve. The second half, obviously, we have to work through COVID. We're operating at about 95% capacity. So that's my first point. We'd like to get that to 100% as we go into 2022. But I think it will still be with us for the next 6 months. I think that's important to note.
In terms of commodities, I think iron ore might soften a little bit. But the underlying or the fundamentals are still very good, and the fact we've got quality, I think, means that we'll preferentially maybe do a little bit better, but that's a bit hard to judge, but I certainly think we're in the right place in the market. And as people tighten up a bit, they generally like to see a little more quality supporting their volumes. So I think we're okay there.
PGMs are well still short. Palladium and rhodium already tracked back a bit in my view. So I don't think it will go too far. Copper, I think the underlying demand fundamentals are strong. So again, we don't think that will fall back. Diamonds is in recovery mode. That's improving. And in met coal, we've still got more to do and more to improve and whilst we won't see much of Grosvenor this year, we think continuous improvements in Moranbah and then Grosvenor adding to that means that through the balance of this year and into next year, lots of things to be positive about. And then you've got Quellaveco.
So from our point of view, no, we don't think this is as good as we can be. We still got a long way to go. Pricing, a little bit more of an open debate, but the breadth of our portfolio, the depth, the cost position, I think we're set to take advantage of that, and we're growing. And not many others in this industry can say they're growing with the quality that we're growing with. And those positions will also improve our relative cost position. So I think we're in pretty good shape, Alain."

Look, I'll give a broad perspective, and I'll invite Stephen -- although he doesn't need to be invited, but in any way, we'll chat. But look, if you look at the business, I think De Beers has more improvement potential on its operating cost. It's had a really bumpy ride in the last 12 months. It's a major restructuring. Bruce is bringing those changes through to reduce its costs. It's certainly been impacted by COVID, both in Canada where we had to stop Gahcho Kué for a month. Botswana has been struggling with COVID.
We're all part of the solution there and they're improving. Namibia will have the new ships. I think De Beers will be in good shape and continue to improve, particularly as we go into 2022. The copper business guys have done a good job. Quellaveco coming in, 300,000 tonnes of copper at around $1 and in fact, will come in a bit less than that in the early days. And we'll probably commission up pretty quickly based on the new mine plan. So that will make a real contribution on the copper side.
[indiscernible] and the guys have still got some more work and improvements they said Kumba. Minas has been a bit in and out, although they're 20% under the original feasibility costs. I think getting more stability and a little bit more volume will help them on the operating shots of improvements. Then you've got Tony and the team's full technology program. We're just starting to put some of those new technologies in the business. We haven't really seen a big contribution yet other than the incremental stuff you're seeing across the board. So in the next 2 years, those impacts are at least in the 5% to 10% range. So that might help us balance off some of the input pressures. Steve?"

Iron ore, I think quality premiums generally will remain. Even if in absolute terms, the iron ore price and the premium number come down, I think as a percentage and as a differentiator, that theme will continue. And then in PGMs, that's assuming we finalized the Mogalakwena expansion and just that increased focus on quality and returns from that expansion. And [indiscernible] have set some pretty challenging cost targets that they're going to get after. So I think that could flow through as well. And just to pick up one of the last points Mark made on the technology and innovation is we know you're not seeing it in the bottom line just at the moment, but we are very confident that those benefits are emerging in the business and will continue to emerge. Maybe slightly delayed, as I said, from where we had originally envisaged, but they should start to come through strongly through '22 and '23, in particular."

We've said that we'd bring a bit of capital forward for the ventilation shaft to give us more flexibility. We have gone for a fully continuous miner automated operation as opposed to some drill and blast. So we made technical changes, which means you change a few parameters.
The main issue are the 2 shafts. Now we've got the first SBR that's turned last week. That will actually start operation during the course of August. And that will tell us because that's the critical path work what the shafts would look like. And so we'll have a bit under our belt in terms of the SBRs and their performance by the year-end, which will then inform our investments going forward. But even if we take an envelope of good and bad, it's still overwhelmingly a positive strong project.
The Board bought Sirius, and we bought Sirius to build and go forward. That hasn't changed from anything we've seen. In our due diligence, we picked up the shafts as the issue. They certainly are. And when we come to you at the end of the year, I expect we'll be telling you what the execution strategy and ultimately, the only debate will be the date of acceleration.

But we can all see there are still challenges from COVID, tax changes in LatAm and so on. And when I think back to what you were telling us at the December investor update, you were targeting 3 or 4 projects to be approved or accelerated from the back end of this year. So has the experience over the last 6, 12 months led you to take a more conservative and phased approach when you're thinking about those projects?
And linked to that, is there a ceiling in terms of how much CapEx this group can handle? Is it around $6 billion to $7 billion? And then a separate slightly cheeky follow-up, just on a question for you, Mark, on your tenure. Not that I'm wishing you away by any means, but you previously suggested that you aim to remain CEO until Quellaveco is delivered next year. Does that timing still hold? Or has COVID pushed things out?"

No, I don't think that there's any link to any timing in terms of probably to COVID or capital capacity at the moment. It's really about bringing the projects through in the right time with the right discipline. And so a couple of the obvious ones, things like Moranbah, Grosvenor, that's really been operated by the operation -- have been impacted by the operational aspects that are really well known. So really, until we get those back up and running at the capacity, we'll reassess then the impact on the wash plant.
If we hit that capacity quite quickly, I imagine that wash plant expansion may make perfect sense. But let's wait, let's get back and then we'll make that decision. The planning work for that project is progressing. We'll put it in [indiscernible], and then we'll see how we go. Mogalakwena, again, it's about doing the right work and making sure we've got the right technology matched with the right size and scale for mining, for processing, et cetera. And so that work is ongoing. That should complete by the end of the year. And as I said, hopefully, by first half.
Woodsmith, I think Mark's covered well. So they're really the main moving parts. You then got Collahuasi, various of those things. So we have, I suppose, captured those elements within the capital guidance that we've given. Yes, they have to drop around that sort of, let's call it, $5 million to $7 million when you combine that with the sustaining, the life extension, et cetera. So, yes, we think we're pretty well placed across that portfolio. I probably wouldn't want to spend too much more than 6 or 7 a year, but our capacity to do so, I suppose, potentially increases as we keep improving our cash flow in our operations and progressively bring projects like Quellaveco 1.

Hence, Quellaveco, the team -- some of the team will roll off into to support the team there. The smaller projects, 2 or 3 smaller projects each year, quite within our capacity to handle physically and from a balance sheet point of view. And the way we've sequenced those moves something like Mogalakwena, we don't want to put too much material in the market. So we're very sensitive to pricing despite what 1 or 2 others may say, we really pay attention to diamond market, PGMs market. And so making sure that we don't bring on too much at any one time is also an important point and a responsibility point from our point of view. There's no point undermining the value we create by getting that wrong. So that approach is consistent.
And certainly, from our point of view, it's about the organization capacity as well to spend it in a sensible way. On my own personal situation, I've said and made a commitment to the Board that I would see Quellaveco through, and I would continue to serve at their pleasure. That hasn't changed. As all organizations do and should do, we've tried to make sure that the Board has got -- and my job has been to make sure they've got internal options, and I think we've done that, and they'll make the decision when it's appropriate. We'll let you know when that decision has been made, if it's going to be made in the near term."

Is that just a timing difference where you were working away inventories? And does that mean that perhaps some of the -- of that momentum is a little bit of a one-off in the first half?
I just noted, Mark, your comment that you thought that there was still steady improvement second half into next year to come. And then my second question is just on the buyback versus special. You've noted that you still see value. Was it an easy decision? Is it just a balanced decision between buybacks versus specials? I just wondered if you could talk to some of those thoughts."

Bruce has done a lot of good work. The team has done a lot of good work on with customers and he's trying to improve that margin. But at the moment, that 11% reflects products coming back into the market, different customers wanting different things, good quality products that we're able to put our hands on. So it's a combination of things that have popped it up to the 11%, but that would be hard to maintain in a steadier market. So we'd like to see to continue, but that will probably track back a little bit. Stephen, do you want to say anything?"

On the buyback versus special, yes, a couple of factors we take into account. Shareholder preference is clearly one of them. And we recognize that there are different views in the market with different shareholders, perhaps particularly across regions. Again, we try to strike a balance. So if you look at the $4.1 billion, $3.1 billion of that is dividend and $1 billion is buyback. And I think Mark touched on it as well in terms of value. We believe what we're delivering. We believe in the journey ahead of us, and we believe in the value that we can deliver."

We've deregulated or we've come to an agreement with the South African government on the deregulation of foreign exchange controls for us. So we've got a single balance sheet. And when we look at the future and the growth we have, we think we're differentiated in that the market is not fully realizing that value.

Obviously, the FX has been a big headwind for you guys, especially [ this hour ]. But I'm just wondering from sort of a -- sort of fundamental inflation perspective, how much are you seeing sort of sticky inflation, i.e., labor being sort of ahead of CPI here, suppliers being more forceful in their negotiations?

Look, on the Chile conversation, we led an interaction with the Senate Committee for the industry. And the reason we led it, Tyler, is because of our technology work, our hydrogen work. And Chile is really looking to develop its technology economy and looking to be a clean economy, obviously, off the back of copper. And they see our progress and our lead in that space as being an important point. So we led the conversation.
The points we made, I think, were all about mining in country. We pay tax in the country unlike many other sectors that have been subject to a lot of debate. I think that point was really well acknowledged. The second point is that taxes and with the improvement in earnings that we're generating, more tax flows will be coming. So that will continue to improve [indiscernible] and in fact, South Africa just made an announcement earlier this morning that the tax take in the first quarter was the best they've seen in 3 or 4 years, and it's the mining industry that's made a difference.
So our messaging on what contributions we make in those countries and when we take into account wages and all the other contributions is unlike any other industry, that's the messaging. That's what we delivered last week. And it was a really constructive interaction. So if I was betting, I'd say, look, Chile is now in a sensible place in terms of its conversations.
I think there will be no doubt pressure still on some type of adjustment given the constitutional [indiscernible]. But I'm now a lot more comfortable that it's a sensible conversation that we do have from time to time in these moments. Peru, Humala's first speech post election, again, much more balanced than we've seen. Our interactions with him have been pretty positive. He recognize, understand that Quellaveco represents 1% of the country's GDP. He made a specific point of saying in the speech that it's not his intention to impact growth and the important drivers of the economy. So that was good.
He did talk about having a chat to the industry about stability agreements. Remember, we've got a 15-year stability agreement. But again, I think it was far more conciliatory and balanced than what we've previously seen. So I think we're getting to a more sensible set of conversations that may impact to some degree, but I don't think it will be crazy stuff that we saw maybe even 3 months ago."

And that is that just a reminder that the U.K. have done it, but they just do it in a red brief case on the doorsteps of Downing Street.  And the U.S. have done it, and they do it passing through parliament. So it's not just something that's focused on emerging economies, all economies are thinking about how they're balancing their books. My encouragement is always, let's do it as simply as possible with established tax regimes and rules and calculation methodology on its broader base as possible. And I think that sets everyone up for a more sustainable certain future.
On inflation, again, just a quick first-up comment. Remember, the impact of revenue and strong prices that we've had versus perhaps currency and commodity input costs, clearly, far weighted towards the $8 billion we had in terms of positive revenue impact. On sticky inflation, we're not seeing anything untoward at this point in time. A lot of our employment agreements to our major operations are partway through their current, say, 2-, 3- or 4-year sort of time frame. We have a number of them rolling into, I think, '20 -- maybe '22 or '23 at the earliest across our operations.
The current period, it's been a little bit hard to react to the inflation inputs. So supply chains have been disrupted, they sort of had to pay and source what you could get, particularly if there was disruption, you were concerned about to secure material. It's been harder to react in terms of volumes. While we say we're operating around that 95% level, that's as a result of seriously hard work across the operations, let's say, to get us up from an otherwise 85% level by the great work the teams have done to minimize the impact in the operation front. So it's been a bit hard to respond beyond that to close that gap on a unit cost basis. So remember, these are unit costs we're talking about, which are impacted by volume.
Again, I'd come back to the T&S and -- technology and innovation initiatives. Our ability, particularly through the first quarter of the year in some of the Southern Hemisphere, where you had COVID and rain and summer holidays, it was hard to get the momentum through that first quarter. I think we're back on track now through a lot of those automation, process control, some of the bulk ore orders, et cetera. Those projects are now progressing quite well.
And so it's just been a little bit hard to respond in as quick a period as you would like. Remember, we weren't seeing it at the end of last year when we reported in February. And so yes, it has emerged. Some of it currency, some of it cost. We will respond in time, I think, appropriately. We've always said ourselves improvement targets well above that expected inflation for exactly this reason that we need to drive improvements in the underlying business."

And obviously, the general improvements that we've made across the board, the technical reconfiguration of session, all those sorts of things.
The second phase that we're just lining up to roll through in the next 3 or 4 years is the capital investments and growth in quality projects that all have better margins. So that 45% to 50% margin we talked about is based on those lower cost operations coming in and making a positive cost and margin contribution. And the technology work, bulk ore sorting, coarse particle flotation, all of that over the next 2 to 3 years start to impact the operations as well.
So there's a real forward momentum, but it's sort of a flat spot. And then '22, '23, '24, you'll see a real push again down from where we've been, which is very similar to what we saw in '15, '16 and '17 in my view. So I think we're doing a lot of work to balance and try and negate those impacts. But in this sort of environment, you will have those input pressures, but that's there for us to manage."

But De Beers, we think, has a significant improvement potential. We're seeing that track through the fact that we were able to stand behind De Beers. Last year was another example of the value that we add to the business in tough times. But to be fair, Bruce and the guys did a fantastic job managing and we ended up with a small negative cash flow, which was all about investing to make sure we had the product for the first site.
So a great outcome, but it demonstrated how De Beers can take the long view because they've got us backing them. And I still think there's a lot more potential at De Beers. And if we're generating the cash flow, I think, ultimately, the value will come through the share price. Secondly, on minorities, we always look at those sorts of opportunities. And if I said that those things remain important opportunities for us, then the answer is yes, but it has to be done the right way.

Thank you for joining us today. You've got both Stephen and myself. Next slide, please.For those that enjoy a bedtime read, we've got the cautionary statement. Next slide, plea",2787,"Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those a little further afield. Thank you for joining us today. You've got both Stephen and myself. Next slide, please.
For those that enjoy a bedtime read, we've got the cautionary statement. Next slide, please. For today, our order of play is consistent with our established routine. You'll have myself touching on performance and highlighting a couple of, we think, key points. Second, Stephen will run through the numbers to provide the detailed insights and to reinforce our focus on capital discipline, which is reflected through our returns to shareholders and our capital spending priorities. And to close, I'll take you through how we are positioning the business for the future. And as you've seen from our thermal coal announcements in the half, there's lots happening on this front.
Next slide, please. On results, a record half for us, our highest ever EBITDA in a reporting half, somewhere in the 70% range higher than anything we've ever done before. The result was delivered despite us running at around 95% full production capacity. COVID remains a factor across the globe. And while it's been carefully managed our people and across all of our jurisdictions, it did have an impact on the operations. So from our perspective, we still see improvement in the business as countries move through the vaccination processes.
We're also impacted in the operations with our met coal constraints, although Moranbah was operating again at the end of the half and development work has restarted at Grosvenor, although that will still take a bit of time to bring through. Growing EBITDA margin of 61% tells much of the earnings story, a function of both solid costs in terms of where we come from in the last few years and improving product prices. And our focus on quality and delivering value in use credit in terms of the prices we've realized above and beyond benchmark prices has really come to the fore, and I think has been a very obvious part of the story in terms of the results.
Return on capital employed, 49%. And if we adjust the capital base for Quellaveco and Woodsmith spending so far, which do impact the denominator, our ROTE would be, in fact, 56%. So again, both very strong numbers. Of course, high commodity prices have been very important to us. But at the same time, we've seen increasing prices. Unit costs were up 15%, largely a function of stronger FX, particularly in the emerging economies.
If we exclude the FX impact, where unit costs were up 6%, reflecting our 5% productivity pause through the COVID issues and some higher input costs as commodity prices have driven our input or, if you like, the consumable pricing. But Stephen will give you more color in his part of the presentation. But all in all, an encouraging result. It reflects -- and has been reflected through additional shareholder returns of $2 billion on top of the base dividend of $2.1 billion, and that reflects a 77% million payout just short of the 80% -- just short of 80%. From our point of view, if you add in Thungela, the returns look very good. But again, Stephen will unpack all of those parts of the story.
So next slide, please. On safety, health and environment, we continue to focus on our improvement journey. Looking at safety first, you'll see that we have been fatality-free in the first half, which I think reflects the good work we've been doing on the elimination of fatalities task force that we put in place a few years ago. The negative there is the slight uptick in our injury frequency rates, and that's the total injury frequency rates. And we've seen a higher injury rate in our precious metals business and in the Quellaveco project, 2 countries impacted by COVID. And so the team is being very careful in terms of how we manage work to make sure that we don't see that negative trend continue. But real focus on safety and making sure that we're balancing off and making sure that COVID doesn't impact the processes we follow in terms of doing the work.
Health, again, great improvement over the last few years, reflecting the focus on elimination of hazards at source. And on the environment, again, no incidents in the first half, which again reflects the improved planning and operating disciplines that we've introduced across the business. And whilst it's good to see no incidents in the first half, we've still got a way to go to make sure that we're happy with all aspects of the operations.
Next slide, please. On the healthy environment and thriving communities, which is the broader social conversation, the critical -- or the progress we've made on improving towards our targets per the sustainable mining plan have been solid. We're targeting an absolute reduction of 30% in both energy and greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. And that's from the 2016 levels. And that's our scope 1 and scope 2 equivalent. The recovery from COVID has been patchy and required -- and we require improved operating stability to make sure that we're operating at our best energy-efficient level. So a little bit more to be done. But certainly, from our point of view, a pretty good results so far.
We've also been making pleasing progress towards decarbonizing our operations, both of the energy efficient work and by switching power sources, particularly in South America from traditional fossil fuels to renewables. And as of next year, with the agreement done in Peru on Quellaveco and recent changes we've made in Brazil and Chile, we will be 100% green main supply electricity across South America from next year. So that's a major milestone for us in business. And we also plan to generate hydrogen from electrolysis at our mine sites along across the globe. We're using those renewable energy sources. So the move to eliminate diesel in our operations starts with these changes. And if we're able to get our truck fleet done by 2030, that in of itself would be a 15% reduction in our energy -- or in our greenhouse gas emissions. So an important milestone with the truck that we've got coming in at Mogalakwena.
As you know, last year, we designed our new Social Way 3.0 program, and that is a package of social standards and practices. We are working to fully transition to this new set of standards and processes by the end of '22. Implementing this new high bar and industry benchmark for community engagement and social performance is very important to us. And certainly, there's been good progress in the half. And by next year, we should be in really good shape at that next level.
Next slide, please. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our WeCare program has enabled us to make a responsible, holistic and coordinated effort to protect people, both in the business and in our host communities, while also making sure we secure and maintain the integrity of our operations. And that 95% production rate reflects the processes, the procedures, some absenteeism due to COVID, but making sure all of those pieces are done properly and that we're looking after people. We'll continue to follow a well planned and managed approach to controlling the spread of the virus, and we'll make sure that we continue to work with everybody in terms of mitigating the operating impacts.
A comprehensive suite of robust operating protocols and controls remain in place at our operations and certainly would expect those controls to remain in place for the balance of the year. The investment we've actually made in our own testing laboratories helps us rapidly identify new sources of infection and take action to limit the spread. And again, that's been very much appreciated in our local communities and on a broader scale at a national level. And we represent in a few countries that we operate the most significant private run testing program across those countries, and that's certainly been appreciated.
We are firmly committed to vaccination and supporting governments in rolling out national vaccination programs, and we've already got a program in South Africa that's been supported by the government.
Next slide, please. In terms of contributions and benefits to all stakeholders, I'm also very pleased to announce today that we'll be making a $100 million special endowment allocation to the Anglo American Foundation, providing further support to long-term health, education, livelihood and environmental projects that contribute to our sustainable mining targets across the globe, which, as you know, are aligned with the UN sustainability development goals. The funding will go to a broad range of projects, spanning climate change initiatives, health infrastructure, childhood nutrition, clean water and sanitation, early childhood development, just as a few examples.
This investment in the future builds on the comprehensive contribution that we make to our stakeholders that totaled over $25 billion in 2020. So it's not just a shareholder story, it's about the good we do on a much broader basis. Having worked in this industry for longer than I can remember, I'm deeply proud of the contribution both Anglo American and the mining industry makes to our societies. In particular, the countries in which we work, we do make a real difference to the lives of local people, acting as catalysts for positive change. I don't think many industries can demonstrate such a positive contribution to the countries where they generate their profits, the taxes we pay, there's no industry that matches mining in terms of its contribution to local economies. And for us, we all need to be proud of that contribution. And for us, this is a very important part of our conversation today.
Next slide, please. To business, across our key business sectors at De Beers, we saw good sales in the first half, certainly a big move against last year. Consumer demand for polished products has been very solid. China has been good. U.S. continues to improve. Despite the impact of the second wave of viruses in India, and we saw that in the numbers in our fourth site, the most recent sites have been very solid. And again, people are aware that we announced our site 6 numbers yesterday. And again, they were very strong.
So from our point of view, we think the fundamentals for diamonds are very strong. And whilst we talk about the big contribution from iron ore, from copper, from PGMs and other parts of the business, we've got to remember that De Beers is in recovery mode. And so in the second half and into next year, we think it will continue to improve its contribution to the business.
Copper has continued to deliver -- the copper team have continued to deliver consistent operating and cost performance. The near-term water management initiatives we put in place at Los Bronces are delivering results. And we are continuing to work on the longer-term solutions to reduce our water footprint across the country. In this price environment, you may see many different stakeholders, including governments looking for a bigger share of the pie. And we need to remember that our contribution to Chile, Peru and other countries is significant and will become more significant, and we've been involved in a lot of programs and dialogues with both government and our stakeholders in both countries, and those conversations have been very positive. And in particular, helping people understand the contributions we're making, I hope and we think, will change some of those debates, particularly in both Chile and Peru, where we think the conversation is becoming quite sensible.
PGM is a solid mining performance despite the impact of COVID. And the ACP running extremely well. It's actually operating 18% above plan for the first 6 months, reflecting both a higher operating rate, reflecting some of the technical changes we made in the last refurbishment and as well, we're seeing much better maintenance availability. So again, a reflection of the due care and attention that Natasha and the team are putting into the unit.
Strong pricing, clearly, supporting record margins and cash generation despite the impact of the higher U.S. dollar prices. In Bulks, we generated record iron ore margins during the first half, reflecting the quality of iron ore that we produce from both Kumba and Minas-Rio and with the realized iron ore price for our products for the half being at $210 a tonne, I'll pick up why that's occurring a little bit in a minute. But certainly, from our point of view, we think it's a real differentiating point. Our focus on quality, and we've talked about it for the last few years, you are seeing it in the numbers. And I think it's very important to make sure we explain how we're doing that.
Operationally, there were some unplanned maintenance at Minas-Rio. And I think that does track back a little bit to the impact of COVID on maintenance scheduling. I think we've now got that back in balance and I would expect a much better second half from the Minas-Rio team. And at Kumba, the team managed the external impacts of COVID very well, and they are working very closely with Transnet to make sure we utilize rail capacity to the fullest.
In met coal, Moranbah restarted at the beginning of June. We'll take things very carefully as we work through some geological conditions, but again, each week is getting better. At Grosvenor, work restarted underground in April. We're also reviewing all the findings of the Board of Inquiry. There will be numerous learnings, I think, for both us and the industry, and we are targeting a restart by the end of the year. But again, we'll just make sure that we've got all the issues covered before we kick things away. But certainly, we're making good progress.
Next slide, please. So just to explain the work we've been doing. And when we talk about marketing products, people are still asking us questions about quality and what's it worth? As we restructured Anglo, the big headline was 50% less assets. We're producing more today out of half the assets than we were back 7 or 8 years ago. And our unit costs have dropped, if you look at these results, around 25% in nominal terms over that period. So it reflects both portfolio change and the focus on the industrial processes and the technology work that Tony and the team have been contributing.
This relative performance has been delivered despite the mitigation measures we've implemented to offset COVID in the last 12 months. So if we include the reduction of thermal coal from the mix, the reduction in numbers of assets is around 60%. The longer-term improvement approach has been driven by portfolio restructuring, our technical reconfiguring, as I said, the benchmarking work, the operating model P101. And P101 is about focusing and improving on industry benchmarks for shovels, trucks right across the board. So today, we are, per the chart, operating across our businesses at about the 28 percentile on average across the portfolio. If you then compare that to our peers, the top 5, they operate somewhere between 33% and 46%. Now a few years back, we're at the 49th percentile.
Now I'm using the inverse margin curve, which takes quality and then looks at a breakeven cost in each of our commodities to come up with that figure. And so our focus on cost improvement and price improvement for the quality of the products that we produce, then the margin is what's reflected in that price or cost position, which is a breakeven position.
So if we go to the next slide, we'll just take it, that's it. One example, Kumba. Kumba was operating top end third quartile, almost into fourth quartile, we've literally taken almost 50% out of the cost. Shovel productivities are up 40%. Truck productivities, load factors are up 10%, 15%. So that's moved us to the left. But our focus on going from 62.5% quality product to 64.5% quality product, the introduction of the new technologies has kicked our price realizations up at the same time. And the marketing team are selectively selling to those steel producers that pay for quality.
And so put all those factors together, Kumba is now a first quartile producer and Minas-Rio is at the front of the curve. And so it's not about costs. It's not simply about costs. It's about cost, it's about quality and getting value and in the marketing. So it's a 3-dimensional strategy that's driving margins and driving returns.
With that, I'll hand across to Stephen."
409115,1675450262,2370078,"Anglo American plc, H1 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks very much, Mark. So let's jump straight into the numbers on the next slide, please. So turning to the first half numbers. EBITDA at $12.1 billion, a great result and that's driven a record EPS of $4.30 per share for the half. That translated into $",2418,"Thanks very much, Mark. So let's jump straight into the numbers on the next slide, please. So turning to the first half numbers. EBITDA at $12.1 billion, a great result and that's driven a record EPS of $4.30 per share for the half. That translated into $1.71 per share base dividend at the 40% payout ratio.
So clearly, the balance sheet strengthened further through the first half off the back of the very, very strong cash flows with net debt at 0.1x EBITDA. That's allowed us to announce an additional $2 billion of returns, taking the total returns to $3.31 per share. This nicely demonstrates the 3 key themes that I'd like you to take away from today's presentation, capital discipline, balance between growth and returns and continued focus on operating performance.
We are seeing some upward pressure on costs, and you'd expect that in this price environment, largely driven from 2 factors: strengthening producer currencies and perhaps not surprisingly, increased commodity input costs. So up 6% on an FX-neutral basis, and I'll touch further on some of those cost details later.
So if we go to the next slide and look across the different BUs. So a great recovery in diamonds, as Mark mentioned. Demand for polished product is strong, and that's coupled with limited supply and that's led to great demand in our sector. The midstream has largely destocked, and prices increased 14% in the 6-month period. COVID still remains an element of risk that we're monitoring in the cutting and polishing sector and also closely monitoring from our own operations perspective.
At Venetia, as we transition from the open pit to the underground, we'll see some variability in grade, and that will result in some variability as report over the next few periods. Copper, continuing good operating performance, a great control of costs from the team, so really well done there.
PGMs, strong refining performance during the first half with the ACP running well. That looks set to continue through the second half. And price is very, very strong with the minor metals, which are not so minor anymore. So $3.4 billion revenue from rhodium in the half and over $400 million from iridium and ruthenium combined. Healthy margins at 70% despite the higher U.S. dollar unit costs.
Turning to bulks, iron ore, firstly, 70% margins, strong pricing from our high-quality products from Minas-Rio and Kumba and that really plays into the modern demand themes that we're seeing across the steel industry as operators value that quality, the efficiency that brings from an energy and greenhouse gas point of view, and that flows into the premiums that we've seen in the half.
It was a challenging period for met coal, Moranbah now coming back on stream and ramping up and obviously, Grosvenor scheduled to come back on later in the second half. Hopefully, they flow into a strongly improved pricing environment for met coal. So overall, a strong set of numbers, but still room to improve in the second half and as we move into '22.
So next slide, if we look quickly at the drivers of EBITDA itself. Price, clearly, a big factor, no surprises there, but also really pleased with the year-on-year recovery in volumes that we saw from the prior period that was quite heavily impacted from that initial period of COVID. We do continue to have some impacts of COVID, and that's flowing into our ability to realize some of those cost and volume benefits and some of those improvement initiatives that should flow through into the cost and volume bucket in due course.
Next slide, please. If we look at across at our unit costs, so as I said, 6% up on an FX-neutral basis. So foreign exchange was the single largest driver at 9% as producer currencies strengthened. So combined, up 15% over the same period last year. So general CPI across the geographies that we're working was up 3%, but we do need to keep that in perspective. So the CPI pressure here amounted to $200 million impacting our EBITDA, whereas the price impact in the half was close to $8 million positive impact.
So given the strong pricing environment we've enjoyed through the first half, there's no surprise that we're starting to see higher input costs from things like steel, I think met coal and iron ore and copper, I think copper price. We've also seen some input increases through diesels and reagents. And you got to remember that COVID has also resulted in some significant impacts in our supply chain, which has also fed into prices in terms of our input costs. That's added a little bit of pressure into maintenance costs, which have added another 2%, but I expect less of the maintenance headwind in the second half given that we've front-loaded some of the work through the year.
So just a reminder, this is on a unit cost basis, so impacted by volumes and costs. And I'd like to think that as we continue through the second half of H2 and then into 2022, that we recover some of those volumes and that should feed into this outcome. So looking ahead to the second half, we've supplied some full year guidance in the appendix in today's presentations. But on the basis that spot prices continue where they are, which is obviously great for revenue, then we would expect producer currencies to remain strong and provide some element of headwind. But as I say, hopefully, modify as we've written volumes back through '22.
So turning to the next slide and looking at CapEx. So CapEx for the half was $2.2 billion. As I say, COVID has had some ability on our capacity to execute some of the noncritical works during the first half. So we have slightly underspent in terms of where we're expecting to travel for the first half and particularly as we prioritized our maintenance costs and activity rather than the capital works. So we do expect to catch up some of that through the second half, but probably not all. And we will see some of the same headwinds that we're seeing from a strong currency and some [indiscernible] teams also through the capital space, again, steel, copper, oil-related inputs, and that should materialize a little bit or may materialize a little bit in the second half. So in total, we are revising our guidance down by $200 million to $5.5 billion to $6 billion of capital for the year.
Next slide, please. So the half clearly saw some incredibly strong cash generation that's reflected the operational recovery, obviously, as well as strong pricing. It's driven down our debt by $3.6 billion for the half year period and that's obviously a big impact from the higher realized prices. That pricing impact, though, in terms of working capital has probably hidden some of the great work we've done as we've reduced and refined the PGM work-in-progress stocks that we've built up at the end of last year. And we've also run down our inventory in De Beers. So what you see is some of the positive price impact feed into receivables and our purchase concentrate in the PGMs business. So if you can have a good increase in working capital, then this is probably it. So the balance sheet in excellent shape to support our program of capital, investment in growth, and it's allowed us to make those greater returns to shareholders.
Next slide, please. So looking at those returns, we're really pleased to announce the additional $2 billion of returns to shareholders for the half in addition to that base dividend that has naturally increased to $2.1 billion. So $4.1 billion in total. And just a reminder that we also distributed the Thungela shares during the half, which I think as of this morning were trading around GBP 2. And so that equates to another 20p on a 10:1 ratio in terms of distributions to shareholders.
As you know, I'm a fan of balance. Mark often calls me Mr. Balance. So the additional return is structured as a $1 billion special dividend and a $1 billion buyback. So that's 77% payout for the first half and reaffirms our commitment to that capital discipline and returns, exactly as we would say, would do. That takes our returns since we reinstituted the dividend in the first half of '17 to over $10.3 billion.
The 40% payout ratio remains in place. We really do believe that that's an appropriate payout ratio for a company like ourselves through the cycle, particularly when we offer that combination of high margin growth as well as attractive returns, so remembering through the cycle.
So as Mark mentioned, next slide, thanks. It's been a record half for our shareholders, but also for many of the other stakeholders that we touch across the operations. In the first half, our activities resulted in $3.1 billion of taxes, taxes collected and royalties for our host governments, and that's over 2.5x higher than the prior period.
Now it's probably not often you hear a CFO say, but I'm incredibly proud of that large tax number and the contribution that we make to the countries that we operate in. Importantly, we pay our taxes where the profits arise in our host countries. So when prices rise, so do our tax payments and royalty contributions. It's a win-win, and that's how the tax system is in fact supposed to work. I expect of higher profits again in the second half that we would continue to make significant tax payments through that period.
Now depending on the country, the timing of those cash tax payments across different jurisdictions may vary based on tax installment regimes, profitability, level of past investment, losses, et cetera. But overall, I expect our tax payments to increase year-on-year quite significantly. If we look to Brazil, just as a quick example, clearly, the contribution in the current period doesn't reflect the multibillion dollars of investment we've made over the last few years in Minas-Rio. But now that we have utilized a lot of the tax losses, et cetera, in that country, I would expect we will have utilized all those through the second half and our tax payment should rise significantly before year-end.
Now as Mark mentioned, clearly, it's an important topic in many of these jurisdictions that we work, but we are having constructive conversations across the board. And I think people do really appreciate that broader economic contribution that we make.
Next slide, please. So as you know, every period, I'd like to recap our performance against our capital allocation model and scorecard. So cash generation for the period of $6.2 billion after funding sustaining capital. That continues to drive our payout ratio-based dividend with a total of $2.1 billion declared for the first half of the year. As I say, it's always about balance as we continue to invest for near-term growth with $800 million or $0.8 billion allocated to growth capital through that first half and the additional $2 billion of returns in addition to 20p from Thungela.
So if I can turn to some of the growth that we do offer, and that's both in terms of cost and volume and margin, as well as capital projects. So as I've mentioned, the first half has seen some impact from COVID in terms of our ability to drive some of those operational improvements and some of the technology roll-out. It has been hampered just practically in terms of the things that we've had to deal with. And clearly, the priority on every site is the safe and healthy working conditions for our employees and contractors. So we do remain absolutely committed to the $3 billion to $4 billion improvement target, but the delivery has been delayed by 1 year to 2023.
Now it is worth noting that I would expect that target to now actually increase given -- excuse me, that in 2023, we'll have a full year benefit from Quellaveco and that will feed through, I think, both in the cost and the volume line. But we'll formally update that guidance in December at the investment update. But make no mistake, the big ticket items that we are chasing continue to remain our focus. And while you're not seeing it drop to the bottom line at the moment, we are very confident in the delivery.
Next slide, please. So in terms of growth projects itself, they remain broadly on track, and more than 90% of our growth capital is allocated to future-enabling products within our portfolio. So those metals and minerals that are essential for the decarbonization of the planet and meeting our global consumer demand trends.
In the near term, Quellaveco remains on track for next year, delivering at least a 10% uplift in copper equivalent volumes. We also have several smaller, quicker return projects coming on stream in the next 2 to 3 years, the diamond vessel in Namibia, delivering some of the highest value diamonds across the portfolio, the Sishen UHDMS technology project, delivering more of that premium product and the debottlenecking at Minas-Rio. In addition, incremental expansions at Collahuasi.
So a little further out, we've also got the Mogalakwena project, but we're still working on that best configuration of size, technology to integrate into the project. I would expect the studies would be largely complete by the end of the year and then in a position to potentially make a decision in the first half of next year.
In met coal, clearly, the current focus is around stability and safety in the operations as we bring them back, and we look at how that low CapEx expansion in the wash plant may feed in, in due course. Mark will provide an update on Woodsmith shortly. But similar to the operating side, we are seeing some impact from COVID as we just sensibly roll out these projects. And again, if there's any change to the timing, we'll update you in December.
So last slide for me to wrap up. A familiar message, it's all about balance, competitive returns to shareholders with over $10 billion return since 2017. We offer attractive high-margin, near-term growth in future-enabling products. We do remain confident of achieving that 45% to 50% mining margin across the cycle. But importantly, we're really delivering on the integrity and sustainability of the business to make the world a better place. Mark, back to you."
409115,1675450262,2370078,"Anglo American plc, H1 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Thanks, Stephen. Just go to the next slide, please, if we could. I think in the conversation and in what both Stephen and I have talked to, 2 of the key differentiators, we think in the business. The relative improvement we've made to our operating cost,",2650,"Thanks, Stephen. Just go to the next slide, please, if we could. I think in the conversation and in what both Stephen and I have talked to, 2 of the key differentiators, we think in the business. The relative improvement we've made to our operating cost, which is an ongoing journey and still lots more to do and lots more potential. So we think that's very important. Secondly, the marketing work we've done in understanding and driving for higher realized prices even against benchmarks established in the industry, and that's helping with our margin growth, and they've been 2 key differentiators. The third and probably goes at the top is our portfolio.
So the balanced investment program that Stephen talks about is coupled with our move out of thermal coal and into crop nutrients. That will position our portfolio increasingly towards future-enabling products to play well into key demand themes. And again, I think the movements that we've created over the last few years in our portfolio really is helping us shape a very different future for our company relative to our competitors. And that we think is very important and it's one that I don't think we've yet been given full appreciation for in the market.
The world needs the metals and minerals we produce to enable the transposition to a low economy -- low-carbon economy and to meet other global consumer demand trends. A growing copper production is key to electrification. Our PGMs are essential for decarbonization mobility today. And we think will play a key role in hydrogen -- in the hydrogen solution for the longer term, while our high-quality iron ore, and I'm talking high-quality iron ore, relative to others is essential to enable the delivery of the cleaner steel necessary for building a low-carbon infrastructure that supports the energy and carbon transition.
The balance of mix is in met coal where we produce predominantly premium hard coking coal. And while the world needs still to deliver on our decarbonization targets, met coal in the short term and high-quality met coal, in particular, is absolutely critical to produce steel to enable that decarbonization. In the long term, the move to hydrogen and other technologies will see met coal reduce in the mix. And so by 2040, which is about the length of our resources in the ground, we think that matches with the transition that we have to go through and that our high-quality hard or premium hard coking coal is important as part of that transition.
Next slide, please. So touching some more on those portfolio changes. We're very pleased with the progress on thermal coal. We said we'd be out of thermal coal within 2 to 3 years, and we've delivered well ahead of schedule, but importantly, in a responsible way. As you know, we completed the demerger of the South African operations at the start of June, maintaining the public scrutiny and accountability by listing the business.
We've also ensured that we do the right thing by all stakeholders in setting that business up for success with the initial funding we provided as well as our transitional support being key to that responsible transition. It's been a good outcome all around. We would prefer to put our capital to work in those future-enabling commodities, as Stephen outlined, and there were clear dissynergies between the thermal coal business as it stood today and the rest of the portfolio. Building on that success, we're very pleased to announce the sale of our 1/3 interest in Cerrejon to Glencore. Assuming we secure regulatory approvals, we expect to complete in the first half of 2022. However, economically, we'll have been out from the 31st of December 2020.
So looking at the future-enabling changes to our portfolio, next slide, please. And on Quellaveco, construction remains on schedule and on budget. The second wave of COVID in Peru meant that they got off to a slightly slower start in 2021. So we expect capital to be a little bit lower or on the lower end of the scale, that is the $0.8 billion to $1 billion range for 2021. That means some of the works will shift into 2022. But Tom and the guys have been very careful in the way they've scheduled the critical path activities. So we've maintained our resources on those critical path activities as a priority. And so we're still on track for that mid-'22 commissioning date.
There's been good progress on the infrastructure projects, big milestones with completion of the construction of the Vizcachas dam, so that's the water infrastructure. That also is important from both a project point of view and a community point of view because it's an important source of water for the community, gives them all around water for ""365 day a year"" agricultural activity, which is a really important commitment to the community. [indiscernible] and the team are already starting to focus on the ramp-up of the mining operations. And as you can see, they've also got a flare for the colorful. For those that don't know what those colors represent, they're the colors of Peru and [ McKague ]. So despite times being tough, it's always good to see they go celebrate a milestone.
From our point of view, they're about 25% ahead of the mining volumes that we've committed to be -- where we committed to be from the outset. And so that all goes well for our commissioning as we start on those key works early next year. So really pleased with the progress and the guys have done a great job in what has been fairly difficult circumstances.
Next slide, please. Turning to Woodsmith, our greenfield crop nutrients program in the U.K. A technical review of Woodsmith has made significant progress, and we're working through the findings to finalize the design and schedule and budget. The renewable work has further emphasized the high-quality nature of the resource. The work that we're doing in the markets, and we're now in full commercial trials with the product. So we've proven that the product can deliver and does deliver material benefits to the crops that we touch. And so we're now in about 550 commercial trials. And that's about building the customer base for long-term use of the product.
The review has further emphasized the quality and the different type of product we're producing. Because of the resource, basically run of mine material, on a ship able to go anywhere in the world, it's a first quartile product in terms of cost. Very low carbon footprint, the right physical configuration and with work on the project infrastructure, all those projects are going pretty well.
As we said in February, as we work towards bringing everything up to standard, we do see some challenges in the timing of the shafts. We're working through those challenges. And our intention is to make sure that we finish the detail, which we'll do by the end of this year. We then program out the shaft to make sure we manage the cost in a very tight envelope. And so by probably next year, we will give you then the full plan and the projected timing from the project based on that detail.
As we've said at Anglo, the lessons learned over a long period of time in projects is you must get the strategy right, the detail in the planning right and then the execution will follow in an efficient and cost-effective way. And we won't change that model and that formula for any project. And so we're quite excited. We think we're in a good place. We've still got a lot more work to do. And I make 1 final point about the nature of the product. It is not potash. It is a multi-nutrient, low-chloride fertilizer certified for organic use. It has a carbon footprint, 85% lower than conventional products.
If you don't understand that conversation, please contact us, we'll explain to you why this is very different. It's bottom quartile cost. It can literally travel anywhere in the world, and it's a unique product as our future customers are starting to see in the crop trials that we're going through.
Next slide, please. In terms of the metals and minerals we're producing, I think there's another differentiating point that really comes through in our FutureSmart Mining and the way we've linked that to our sustainability work and the focus on creating a healthy environment. While the metals and minerals we produce are critical to decarbonizing our planet, we're under no illusions. Improvements must be delivered sustainably, and our technical innovation program must connect with all of those objectives across the business. These leading capabilities are also the key to delivering our sustainable mining plan and carbon-neutral operations by 2040. Importantly, these targets are backed by solid plans and work programs that would deliver long-term sustainability, while also driving productivity and cost improvement. One can go with the other, if you've got the technology right, and you're executing the key sequences to make sure that you make this a net business performance improvement as well as being a cleaner, healthier set of operations.
I believe we will be in a position for our sustainability update event in October to announce our Scope 3 targets, that will then demonstrate to people how we believe we can travel over the next 10 to 20 years, making a net positive impact across the globe and certainly demonstrate that mining can be one of the key drivers of a clean future for the world.
Next slide, please. Consistent with that theme and again, scratching at and pointing to that -- another point of differentiation in the business. Our technical innovation program is holistic in its scope and approach, and it's about changing the way mining is undertaken given where we've come from over the last 100 years. Tony's team are looking at a broad range of integrated technical and digital solutions that will reduce our energy and carbon footprint, as I talked to earlier.
Our water consumption will also materially drop as well our physical footprint. That is production intensity will improve, which means your capital intensity drops as well. With the added benefit that whilst being created decarbonizing, it makes sense from an economic perspective. And I think that's critical. And again, it explains, I think, a differentiating point with how we put these programs together to drive business performance. We've talked a lot about these technical innovations with Tony updating you most recently in May. That's worth checking out if you can get a copy of the presentation. His guys spoke a lot about the VOXEL platform that is really exciting and is industry-leading and helps us tie all the key moving parts.
We were ahead of the curve in building our technical function when many in the industry were cutting theirs. And even when we went through '15 and '16, and it was tough times, but we felt that this commitment would be a game changer. And so it's turning out to be and certainly underpins both our business improvement initiatives and our commitment to decarbonization and improving our environmental footprint or reducing our environmental footprint.
Next slide, please. Very simple example of the innovation that we're driving across the business. The first 300-tonne truck is actually being constructed as we speak. And this is the early peak of where we are today. I know many of you have been very interested in the progress we're making with the truck. The components are currently going through bench trials ahead of delivery to Mogalakwena in October. The hydrogen production plant should start commissioning in November. We will then conduct extensive field testing through '22, '23. It should reduce operational emissions by about 15% across the globe once fully installed.
So with that, we are also finalizing conversations to get the build of the 100-megawatt solar plant underway, which is also expected to reduce our emissions in the PGMs business by 25%. Now this is an important step as well as it's also a part of the coordination and connection work we're doing in South Africa and looking at helping them build their grids in a very different way. And as you would be aware, most recently, the South African government actually approved for the industry, the building of 100-megawatt -- up to 100-megawatt power plants to be operated by private players. And so we'll be one of the first to move into that space.
Next slide, please. So how does this all come together? We're working on growing the portfolio in the right products, while ensuring that we deliver those products in the most sustainable way from both in the ESG and operations performance standpoint. And as Stephen talks to, our capital allocation has been balanced in terms of improvements and in terms of growth for the future and making sure that our shareholders share in those returns as we continue to improve performance. We believe we need to continue our trajectory from being a focused mining company, i.e., digging holes, to be a metals and minerals company we are today. That is we're focused on customers, margins and making sure that we're getting the right value for the products that we're selling. And that is the value we're creating for our customers. And our transition to be a material solution provider takes into account where we think the world is going and how we believe we can shape our business to continue building new profit pools and improve our returns for the long term.
So we're not simply about costs. We're about costs. We're about value. We're about sustainable delivery of value for shareholders, for all of our stakeholders. Because with that approach, we believe we'll get support to continue developing and growing as we've shown and as we're demonstrating in terms of our investments in growth in the portfolio.
Next slide, please. So finally, and in summary, we believe the delivery of sustainable returns to all stakeholders is an imperative that will define the long-term success of our business. We are well positioned to deliver on these key imperatives as we are differentiated with a combination of technical, marketing and sustainability capabilities that have been developed as competitive advantages in our rapidly changing external environment.
Coupling these capabilities with our world-class assets, strong balance sheet, and our ongoing improvement journey underpinned by the people that are developing and very proud of what they're delivering, we believe the future has been set, the foundations have been set and we should continue to improve. We've been clear in terms of what we're focused on. Delivering better than 10% free cash flow through the cycle is the key to both investing in future opportunities, delivery of returns to shareholders and making sure we continue to build and grow the business.
And by focusing on our returns on capital, the ROCE number, makes sure that we're not blowing returns by putting -- by over capitalizing the assets. And that natural tension between the 2 is critical. And from our point of view, is about delivery of long-term value for us. And then making sure that, that value is sustainable and growth is sustainable, our 7 pillars of value, starting from safety and health through to the social performance right the way through to making sure our balance sheet is flexible so we can be countercyclical. And so we continue to be a balanced player in the market, as Stephen described, is all about getting these parameters and these targets right.
And so for us, this is what we come to work thinking about each and every day, and these are where the debates are focused in making sure we've got the position right for the future. So with that, very happy to take questions."

As you know, we've been investing in the business. We've been improving. We're the first to say that we're nowhere near where we want to be, so we can continue to improve. The second half, obviously, we have to work through COVID. We're operating at about 95% capacity. So that's my first point. We'd like to get that to 100% as we go into 2022. But I think it will still be with us for the next 6 months. I think that's important to note.
In terms of commodities, I think iron ore might soften a little bit. But the underlying or the fundamentals are still very good, and the fact we've got quality, I think, means that we'll preferentially maybe do a little bit better, but that's a bit hard to judge, but I certainly think we're in the right place in the market. And as people tighten up a bit, they generally like to see a little more quality supporting their volumes. So I think we're okay there.
PGMs are well still short. Palladium and rhodium already tracked back a bit in my view. So I don't think it will go too far. Copper, I think the underlying demand fundamentals are strong. So again, we don't think that will fall back. Diamonds is in recovery mode. That's improving. And in met coal, we've still got more to do and more to improve and whilst we won't see much of Grosvenor this year, we think continuous improvements in Moranbah and then Grosvenor adding to that means that through the balance of this year and into next year, lots of things to be positive about. And then you've got Quellaveco.
So from our point of view, no, we don't think this is as good as we can be. We still got a long way to go. Pricing, a little bit more of an open debate, but the breadth of our portfolio, the depth, the cost position, I think we're set to take advantage of that, and we're growing. And not many others in this industry can say they're growing with the quality that we're growing with. And those positions will also improve our relative cost position. So I think we're in pretty good shape, Alain."

Look, I'll give a broad perspective, and I'll invite Stephen -- although he doesn't need to be invited, but in any way, we'll chat. But look, if you look at the business, I think De Beers has more improvement potential on its operating cost. It's had a really bumpy ride in the last 12 months. It's a major restructuring. Bruce is bringing those changes through to reduce its costs. It's certainly been impacted by COVID, both in Canada where we had to stop Gahcho Kué for a month. Botswana has been struggling with COVID.
We're all part of the solution there and they're improving. Namibia will have the new ships. I think De Beers will be in good shape and continue to improve, particularly as we go into 2022. The copper business guys have done a good job. Quellaveco coming in, 300,000 tonnes of copper at around $1 and in fact, will come in a bit less than that in the early days. And we'll probably commission up pretty quickly based on the new mine plan. So that will make a real contribution on the copper side.
[indiscernible] and the guys have still got some more work and improvements they said Kumba. Minas has been a bit in and out, although they're 20% under the original feasibility costs. I think getting more stability and a little bit more volume will help them on the operating shots of improvements. Then you've got Tony and the team's full technology program. We're just starting to put some of those new technologies in the business. We haven't really seen a big contribution yet other than the incremental stuff you're seeing across the board.

Iron ore, I think quality premiums generally will remain. Even if in absolute terms, the iron ore price and the premium number come down, I think as a percentage and as a differentiator, that theme will continue. And then in PGMs, that's assuming we finalized the Mogalakwena expansion and just that increased focus on quality and returns from that expansion. And [indiscernible] have set some pretty challenging cost targets that they're going to get after. So I think that could flow through as well. And just to pick up one of the last points Mark made on the technology and innovation is we know you're not seeing it in the bottom line just at the moment, but we are very confident that those benefits are emerging in the business and will continue to emerge. Maybe slightly delayed, as I said, from where we had originally envisaged, but they should start to come through strongly through '22 and '23, in particular."

And that's quite unique for an acquisition in this industry in these days. The resource is better than we thought. The mining methods we think are appropriate. We've said that we'd bring a bit of capital forward for the ventilation shaft to give us more flexibility. We have gone for a fully continuous miner automated operation as opposed to some drill and blast. So we made technical changes, which means you change a few parameters.
The main issue are the 2 shafts. Now we've got the first SBR that's turned last week. That will actually start operation during the course of August. And that will tell us because that's the critical path work what the shafts would look like. And so we'll have a bit under our belt in terms of the SBRs and their performance by the year-end, which will then inform our investments going forward. But even if we take an envelope of good and bad, it's still overwhelmingly a positive strong project.
The Board bought Sirius, and we bought Sirius to build and go forward. That hasn't changed from anything we've seen. In our due diligence, we picked up the shafts as the issue. They certainly are. And when we come to you at the end of the year, I expect we'll be telling you what the execution strategy and ultimately, the only debate will be the date of acceleration. And for us, it's important to make sure it's right and done well before we go forward. But we'll be going forward with this project, I believe."

So has the experience over the last 6, 12 months led you to take a more conservative and phased approach when you're thinking about those projects?
And linked to that, is there a ceiling in terms of how much CapEx this group can handle? Is it around $6 billion to $7 billion? And then a separate slightly cheeky follow-up, just on a question for you, Mark, on your tenure. Not that I'm wishing you away by any means, but you previously suggested that you aim to remain CEO until Quellaveco is delivered next year. Does that timing still hold?

No, I don't think that there's any link to any timing in terms of probably to COVID or capital capacity at the moment. It's really about bringing the projects through in the right time with the right discipline. And so a couple of the obvious ones, things like Moranbah, Grosvenor, that's really been operated by the operation -- have been impacted by the operational aspects that are really well known. So really, until we get those back up and running at the capacity, we'll reassess then the impact on the wash plant.
If we hit that capacity quite quickly, I imagine that wash plant expansion may make perfect sense. But let's wait, let's get back and then we'll make that decision. The planning work for that project is progressing. We'll put it in [indiscernible], and then we'll see how we go. Mogalakwena, again, it's about doing the right work and making sure we've got the right technology matched with the right size and scale for mining, for processing, et cetera. And so that work is ongoing. That should complete by the end of the year. And as I said, hopefully, by first half.
Woodsmith, I think Mark's covered well. So they're really the main moving parts. You then got Collahuasi, various of those things. So we have, I suppose, captured those elements within the capital guidance that we've given. Yes, they have to drop around that sort of, let's call it, $5 million to $7 million when you combine that with the sustaining, the life extension, et cetera. So, yes, we think we're pretty well placed across that portfolio. I probably wouldn't want to spend too much more than 6 or 7 a year, but our capacity to do so, I suppose, potentially increases as we keep improving our cash flow in our operations and progressively bring projects like Quellaveco 1.

Hence, Quellaveco, the team -- some of the team will roll off into to support the team there. The smaller projects, 2 or 3 smaller projects each year, quite within our capacity to handle physically and from a balance sheet point of view. And the way we've sequenced those moves something like Mogalakwena, we don't want to put too much material in the market. So we're very sensitive to pricing despite what 1 or 2 others may say, we really pay attention to diamond market, PGMs market. And so making sure that we don't bring on too much at any one time is also an important point and a responsibility point from our point of view. There's no point undermining the value we create by getting that wrong. So that approach is consistent.
And certainly, from our point of view, it's about the organization capacity as well to spend it in a sensible way. On my own personal situation, I've said and made a commitment to the Board that I would see Quellaveco through, and I would continue to serve at their pleasure. That hasn't changed.

On the buyback versus special, yes, a couple of factors we take into account. Shareholder preference is clearly one of them. And we recognize that there are different views in the market with different shareholders, perhaps particularly across regions. Again, we try to strike a balance. So if you look at the $4.1 billion, $3.1 billion of that is dividend and $1 billion is buyback. And I think Mark touched on it as well in terms of value. We believe what we're delivering.

Obviously, the FX has been a big headwind for you guys, especially [ this hour ]. But I'm just wondering from sort of a -- sort of fundamental inflation perspective, how much are you seeing sort of sticky inflation, i.e., labor being sort of ahead of CPI here, suppliers being more forceful in their negotiations? Just curious if you could provide some color there, if you could?"

Look, on the Chile conversation, we led an interaction with the Senate Committee for the industry. And the reason we led it, Tyler, is because of our technology work, our hydrogen work. And Chile is really looking to develop its technology economy and looking to be a clean economy, obviously, off the back of copper. And they see our progress and our lead in that space as being an important point. So we led the conversation.
The points we made, I think, were all about mining in country. We pay tax in the country unlike many other sectors that have been subject to a lot of debate. I think that point was really well acknowledged. The second point is that taxes and with the improvement in earnings that we're generating, more tax flows will be coming. So that will continue to improve [indiscernible] and in fact, South Africa just made an announcement earlier this morning that the tax take in the first quarter was the best they've seen in 3 or 4 years, and it's the mining industry that's made a difference.
So our messaging on what contributions we make in those countries and when we take into account wages and all the other contributions is unlike any other industry, that's the messaging. That's what we delivered last week. And it was a really constructive interaction. So if I was betting, I'd say, look, Chile is now in a sensible place in terms of its conversations.
I think there will be no doubt pressure still on some type of adjustment given the constitutional [indiscernible]. But I'm now a lot more comfortable that it's a sensible conversation that we do have from time to time in these moments. Peru, Humala's first speech post election, again, much more balanced than we've seen. Our interactions with him have been pretty positive. He recognize, understand that Quellaveco represents 1% of the country's GDP. He made a specific point of saying in the speech that it's not his intention to impact growth and the important drivers of the economy. So that was good.
He did talk about having a chat to the industry about stability agreements. Remember, we've got a 15-year stability agreement. But again, I think it was far more conciliatory and balanced than what we've previously seen. So I think we're getting to a more sensible set of conversations that may impact to some degree, but I don't think it will be crazy stuff that we saw maybe even 3 months ago."

And that is that just a reminder that the U.K. have done it, but they just do it in a red brief case on the doorsteps of Downing Street.  And the U.S. have done it, and they do it passing through parliament. So it's not just something that's focused on emerging economies, all economies are thinking about how they're balancing their books. My encouragement is always, let's do it as simply as possible with established tax regimes and rules and calculation methodology on its broader base as possible. And I think that sets everyone up for a more sustainable certain future.
On inflation, again, just a quick first-up comment. Remember, the impact of revenue and strong prices that we've had versus perhaps currency and commodity input costs, clearly, far weighted towards the $8 billion we had in terms of positive revenue impact. On sticky inflation, we're not seeing anything untoward at this point in time. A lot of our employment agreements to our major operations are partway through their current, say, 2-, 3- or 4-year sort of time frame. We have a number of them rolling into, I think, '20 -- maybe '22 or '23 at the earliest across our operations.
The current period, it's been a little bit hard to react to the inflation inputs. So supply chains have been disrupted, they sort of had to pay and source what you could get, particularly if there was disruption, you were concerned about to secure material. It's been harder to react in terms of volumes. While we say we're operating around that 95% level, that's as a result of seriously hard work across the operations, let's say, to get us up from an otherwise 85% level by the great work the teams have done to minimize the impact in the operation front. So it's been a bit hard to respond beyond that to close that gap on a unit cost basis. So remember, these are unit costs we're talking about, which are impacted by volume.
Again, I'd come back to the T&S and -- technology and innovation initiatives. Our ability, particularly through the first quarter of the year in some of the Southern Hemisphere, where you had COVID and rain and summer holidays, it was hard to get the momentum through that first quarter. I think we're back on track now through a lot of those automation, process control, some of the bulk ore orders, et cetera. Those projects are now progressing quite well.
And so it's just been a little bit hard to respond in as quick a period as you would like. Remember, we weren't seeing it at the end of last year when we reported in February. And so yes, it has emerged. Some of it currency, some of it cost. We will respond in time, I think, appropriately. We've always said ourselves improvement targets well above that expected inflation for exactly this reason that we need to drive improvements in the underlying business."

And obviously, the general improvements that we've made across the board, the technical reconfiguration of session, all those sorts of things.
The second phase that we're just lining up to roll through in the next 3 or 4 years is the capital investments and growth in quality projects that all have better margins. So that 45% to 50% margin we talked about is based on those lower cost operations coming in and making a positive cost and margin contribution. And the technology work, bulk ore sorting, coarse particle flotation, all of that over the next 2 to 3 years start to impact the operations as well.
So there's a real forward momentum, but it's sort of a flat spot. And then '22, '23, '24, you'll see a real push again down from where we've been, which is very similar to what we saw in '15, '16 and '17 in my view. So I think we're doing a lot of work to balance and try and negate those impacts. But in this sort of environment, you will have those input pressures, but that's there for us to manage."

So you've got to really be introspective and try and understand -- or introspect and try and understand the issues. I think the management of gas and how we set the longwalls up needs to be adjusted from an industry perspective as well. There have been a number of gas emissions in the field.
And so automation, elevating some of the technical work we do to make sure that we've got the right expertise in solving some of those problems is something that I think we've learned a few lessons on as well. And the designs that we think need to be taken into account, the ability to drop the power off if you get a waste for is also important. So there's quite a few things there, Ian, but I think there's quite a few things for the industry.
And again, we've used it right across the board to try and take ourselves to another level on the safety front. So it's a journey. We recognize that we're not where we want to be.

But to be fair, Bruce and the guys did a fantastic job managing and we ended up with a small negative cash flow, which was all about investing to make sure we had the product for the first site.
So a great outcome, but it demonstrated how De Beers can take the long view because they've got us backing them. And I still think there's a lot more potential at De Beers. And if we're generating the cash flow, I think, ultimately, the value will come through the share price. Secondly, on minorities, we always look at those sorts of opportunities.
