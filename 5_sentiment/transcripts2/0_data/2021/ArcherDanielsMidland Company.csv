This morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, up 49% year-over-year if we exclude the prior year impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.115 billion. 12",660,"Thank you, Victoria. This morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, up 49% year-over-year if we exclude the prior year impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.115 billion. 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019.
For the full year, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $3.59, $3.4 billion in adjusted segment operating profit, 12% higher than 2019, 4 straight quarters of year-over-year segment operating profit growth. And trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC of 7.7%, almost 200 basis points above our weighted cost of capital. We maintain our strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows. The team managed a wide variety of risks superbly. And we achieved our strategic initiatives, exceeding our $500 million to $600 million guidance and driving our ability to deliver a steady, sustainable earnings growth.
I'd like to thank our team for this tremendous performance and highlight for you some of our many achievements in 2020. In our optimized pillar around the globe, amid lockdowns, rapidly shifting demand patterns and extreme weather events, our colleagues fulfilled our purpose by adapting and innovating to keep our work environment safe from COVID-19, maintaining our operations to support the global food value chain and delivering for our customers to provide nutrition around the world.
Beyond that, for the year, our Ag Services & Oilseeds team delivered more than $300 million in capital reduction initiatives, and we are focusing on new ways to enhance the return structure of that business from digital technologies, like our Grainbridge joint venture to differentiated products and services that add share value for growers, customers and ADM.
In our drive pillar, our new organizational structures and business processes like our Centers of Excellence and our 1ADM business transformation project are helping drive better decision-making and operational excellence.
We continued our work to support our planet and its natural resources. We achieved our 15x20 environmental goals ahead of schedule and launched Strive 35, an even more ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and waste by 2035. And we're partnering with farmers in their efforts to form better outcomes, supported by the 6.5 million acres we had in sustainable forming programs over recent years.
In our growth pillar, our nutrition team exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We expanded our plant-based protein capabilities, including the launch of our PlantPlus Foods joint venture. And amid an incredibly dynamic demand environment, we utilize new innovative technologies and continued launching new products to ensure we were meeting our customers' needs.
Our Carbohydrate Solutions colleagues move quickly to meet changing customer needs for retail flower, industrial starches for cargo and USP-grade alcohol for hand sanitizers. And the ADM team show its innovative spirit by partnering and supporting companies that are making food out of air, spiders, silk out of corn and animal feed out of insects.
Finally, I'm proud to say we surpassed by about 10%, our stretch goal of $1.3 billion in readiness run rate benefits by the end of the year. Readiness is driving our strategic initiatives, enabling us to be more efficient and powering our growth. Perhaps most importantly, today, we can say that readiness is truly embedded in our culture is how we work.
Thanks to these impressive achievements, I'm pleased to announce a quarterly dividend increase of 2.8% to $0.37 per quarter. This dividend will be our 357th consecutive quarterly payment, an interrupted record of 89 years. It's been a remarkable year with achievements and results that truly demonstrate the strategic work we've been doing over the years to optimize, drive and grow. Even more important is how we are building for the future. We've created and are now strengthening the strategic foundation to deliver steady, sustained earnings growth for years to come.
I'll be talking about that shortly. But first, let me turn the call over to Ray to take us through our business performance. Ray?"
251704,701619909,2181452,"Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Archer-Daniels-Midland Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.21, down from the $1.42 in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the",1317,"Yes. Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.21, down from the $1.42 in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the recognition of about $0.61 per share for the retroactive biodiesel tax credits. Absent this, earnings would have grown by about 49%.
Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7.7%, almost 200 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC. In our trailing 4-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.7 billion. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately 8% compared to a benefit of 1% in the prior year. The calendar year 2020 effective tax rate was approximately 5%, down from the approximately 13% in 2019.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the impact of U.S. tax credits, mainly the railroad tax credits, which have an offsetting expense in the cost of products sold. Absent the effect of EPS adjusting items, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11%, and for the calendar year 2020 was approximately 9%. Looking ahead, we're expecting full year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%.
We generate about $3.1 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year, significantly higher than 2019. Return of capital for the year was $942 million, including more than $800 million from dividends. We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 32%, up from the 29% a year ago due to higher working capital needs due to rising commodity prices.
Capital spending for the year was about $820 million, in line with our guidance and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion. For 2021, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion.
Slide 5, please. Other business results were substantially lower than the prior year quarter. ADM investor services earnings were impacted by drastically lower short-term interest rates. Captive insurance results were negatively impacted by $15 million more in net intracompany settlements compared to the prior year quarter. For 2021, we expect other business results to be in line with 2020.
In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $278 million, were higher year-over-year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals, increased IT and project-related expenses and centralization of certain costs, including from Neovia. Other charges decreased due to lower maintenance expenses partially offset by the absence of prior year investment gains. For 2021, corporate unallocated should be overall similar to 2020.
Net interest expense for the quarter was lower than last year due to lower short-term interest rates and liability management actions taken in 2020. For 2021, we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be similar to or slightly lower than 2020.
Slide 6, please. The Ag Services & Oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year with record adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter. Ag Services wealth were significantly higher year-over-year. In North America, the team executed extremely well, capitalizing on strong global demand, particularly from China, to deliver higher export volumes and margins. South American origination was lower year-over-year after significantly accelerated farmer selling in the first half of 2020. Global trade continued to do a great job, contributing to higher results by utilizing its global reach and managing risk well to meet customer demand. Approximately $80 million of prior timing effects reversed in the quarter as expected.
Crushing also delivered substantially higher results versus the prior year period. The business did a great job to capture higher margins in a continued environment of tight soybean supply and strong global demand for both meal and vegetable oils. There was approximately $125 million in net negative timing in the quarter, driven by basis impacts and improved soft seat margins. Refined products and other results were higher year-over-year, absent the recognition of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year. With good results, driven primarily by solid South American margins.
Wilmar's strong performance drove our equity earnings higher versus the prior year despite our slightly lower ownership stake. For the full year, Ag Services & Oilseeds delivered exceptional results of $2.1 billion, 9% higher than 2019. Its team achieved multiple records, including an all-time high global crush volumes. In addition, we're proud of the team that brought our reserve export facility back online safely and ahead of schedule despite dealing with multiple severe weather events this year.
Looking ahead, we expect the first quarter of 2021 results for Ag Services & Oilseeds to be significantly higher than the prior year first quarter, driven by extremely strong North American export demand and continued healthy crush margins.
Slide 7, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team, again, delivered substantially higher year-over-year results despite the impacts of lockdowns in key market segments. The starches and sweeteners subsegment achieved significantly higher results, driven by lower net corn costs and intercompany insurance settlements. Earnings were partially offset by low results from corn oil and wet mill ethanol margins.
Vantage corn processors results were also better versus the prior year, though they continue to reflect the challenging ethanol industry environment. The team delivered higher year-over-year margins as they met increased demand for USP-grade alcohol, partially offset by fixed costs from the 2 temporarily-idled dry mills.
Considering the impact of lockdowns in both driving miles and the foodservice sector, we're extremely proud of our carbohydrate Solutions team for delivering full year results of $717 million, 11% higher than 2019. The team achieved record-high operating profits from starches in the year. They acted decisively by temporary idling production at our 2 VCP dry mill plants, helping address industry supply and demand balances, and the wheat milling businesses modernization and optimization plan, including a new state-of-the-art mill in Mendota, Illinois, helped power a significant improvement over full year 2019 for that business.
Looking ahead, we expect Carbohydrate Solutions results in the first quarter to be significantly higher than last year's first quarter, which was negatively impacted by corn oil mark-to-market impacts. But below the fourth quarter 2020 levels due to the challenged industry ethanol margins.
Slide 8, please. The nutrition team delivered 24% year-over-year growth in the quarter. In human nutrition, flavors delivered a strong quarter driven by good sales and product mix in North America, and EMEAi. Continued strength in plant proteins drove higher results in specialty ingredients. Health and wellness delivered higher sales in probiotics, in natural health and nutrition. Prior year results included revenue and income related to the launch of the strategics fiber relationship.
Human nutrition results for the quarter also included an intercompany insurance settlement. Animal nutrition results were significantly higher year-over-year, driven by strong performances in Asia and EMEAi, and improvements in amino acid results, partially offset by currency effects in Latin America. We're continuing to make improvements in our amino acid business, including our announcement last month that we're discontinuing dry lysine production and transitioning to our liquid and encapsulated products in the first half of this year.
For the full year, nutrition results were $574 million, 37% higher than 2019. The nutrition team grew revenue 5% on a constant currency basis and continue to expand EBITDA margins. We exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We are truly seeing the benefits of our investments in nutrition. Looking ahead, we expect nutrition to solidly grow operating profits in 2021 calendar year. But the first quarter should be similar to the prior year period due to the timing of certain expenses over the year, including investments in projects to drive organic growth.
With that, let me turn it over to Juan to conclude. Juan?"

I'd like to congratulate the team once more on delivering great results in 2020. I'm proud of what we achieved and I'm excited to see our work and powering us to reach even greater heights. In 2020, Ag Services & Oilseeds capitalized is unparalleled and flexible global footprint to meet strong demand. In 2021, we expect Ag Services & Oilseeds strong execution, diverse and flexible crush capabilities, including an extensive softseed footprint, an important strategic work to continue to drive results. In addition, we expect the global demand environment for Ag Services & Oilseeds to remain strong. China should continue to be a significant buyer we see continued strong global growth in mill demand, and we expect increased demand for vegetable oil due to recovery in cooking oils for food service and growth in demand for biofuels, including renewable green diesel. That is why we are confident in another outstanding performance from Ag Services & Oilseeds in 2021.
Carbohydrate Solutions is showing how we have embedded great execution into our operational structure and culture. The team is doing a great job strengthening their business by optimizing their plans and product mix. And their ability to adjust production in 2020 to quickly meet changes in demand showed how those strategic efforts are paying off. Now they are well positioned to use those same tools as the effect of lockdowns on the foodservice and transportation fuel sectors dissipates throughout 2021. We expect solid profit growth for the year for Carbohydrate Solutions.
Nutrition continued to harvest investments, leading consumer growth trends areas and partner with customers to bring innovative new products and solutions to market in 2020. Based on our current organic growth plans, we expect the nutrition team to deliver solid revenue expansion, and enter a period of an average 15% per annum operating profit growth. Consistent with our strategic plan.
Across ADM, we are fulfilling our purpose and building on a foundation for steady, sustainable earnings growth. We are growing and leading in key trend areas, including food security, health and wellness and sustainability. Our continued advancements of readiness is benefiting in the entire enterprise, and we're making investments in exciting growth innovation platforms, which we'll be talking more about in the future.
In 2021, we will remain focused on the drivers under our control, adding incremental returns as we focus on organic growth, advancing operational excellence initiatives to maximize returns from every business and every asset and continuing to generate benefits from readiness. With a strong execution of these strategic initiatives and improving market conditions as the year progresses, we expect to build on a record 2020 with a strong growth in segment operating profit, and another record year of EPS in 2021.

Maybe with a different mix of earnings that we have in this year. If you think about 2021, we're starting with tailwinds from 2020. So we're starting from a different position. And we starting the year with improved global crush margins in Q1 versus Q1 last year. So we see a year in which we flex a little bit more our capabilities. We see a strong still soybean crush, but an exceptional strong and recovery after many years of softness in softseed crush. And I remind you that we have about 25% of our capacity in softseed, and we have about 15% of our capacity that is shifting. So that's a competitive advantage for ADM. We see a strong demand for mill, and we see also the vegetable story playing out with good global demand and prices that are today are about 20% higher than the same time last year.
I'm not only coming from food demand but also from fuel, a new renewable green diesel capacity is having an impact in bean oil demand and margins. And we think that, that could be something about 500 million lbs per year this year of extra demand. So all in all, we see tight balances and we see a strong margin environment for the rest of the year."

And I know you talked about kind of seeing pathway for growth there.

But help us think through some of the different pieces there, ethanol in the first half of this year looks to be in a bit of a tougher spot. Obviously, corn prices have moved up pretty notably. Just trying to think about some of the different moving pieces and help us how we get the growth in that business in 2021?"

Let me start here. So just -- it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right?

So just -- it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right? Because 2020, when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19, the Carb Sol segment was the one most negatively impacted. Yet, in 2020, they grew earnings, right? So what they did was they really manage projects -- product mix extremely well, driving starches, driving industrial alcohol. They managed the ethanol production well and frankly, had a positive impact on industry margins through the dialing actions it took. But what a lot of people forget is we have an international business that's growing, right? So we're expanding capacity over in Europe. And the European operations almost doubled in profitability in 2020 compared to 2019, a big contributor there. And then the North American milling operations, their footprint optimization really paying off with 20% growth in profitability in '20 versus '19. So when you think about 2021 this playbook continues, right? So #1, we do expect stabilizations in the North American starches and sweetener business as the beginnings of recovery and demand for certain products occur with the dissipation of lockdowns. And secondly, they're continuing to drive great product portfolio mix. And so particularly in the area of liquid textiles and multiple dextrans and citric acid. Those are actually from a product mix perspective, very beneficial. Thirdly, continued international growth. And so think about where sugar prices are around the world right now. Our European operations, whereby we've added capacity, continues to drive growth. They're going to be another contributor. And then lastly, we can expect continued growth in terms of our milling operations and very pleased in terms of how their optimization plan is really playing out.
Now getting back to some of the comments on the year-over-year comparison, we start off the year with weaker margins in ethanol. But if you recall, in last year, margins actually hit a low of negative $0.45 in March. We don't see that, right? So when you think about year-over-year comparisons, we're going to start off on a challenged basis, but we do expect that the industry supply demand balances in the ethane industry get better balance as we move through the year for several reasons: #1, China actually has been buying U.S. ethanol. That's something that they have not been doing over the past couple of years. And we believe that they have already made commitments already in the first half of the year for U.S. ethanol equal to the previous all-time high for the calendar year, roughly 200 million gallons. And so we'll have to see where China ends up in the calendar year in terms of imports of U.S. ethanol; Secondly, there has been announced reconfiguration of ethanol capacity by various competitors in the industry as they kind of focus their production away from transportation fuel ethanol towards other products. So that's going to have an impact in industry supply and demand; thirdly, the industry itself, there is about 10% to 15% of capacity that remained idle. And from our perspective, we're going to remain very disciplined in terms of when we actually restart the dry mills because we'll want to see sustainable margins before we restart. And hopefully, sometime in the first half, we're going to see that. And then lastly, how the small refinery exemptions will play out over the first part of the year as the Supreme Court rules on it, will have an impact, frankly, in terms of domestic demand for ethanol. And if you take a look at RINs pricing right now, there's an expectation in the U.S. that domestic ethanol demand is going to be strong over the course of this calendar year. Given just the recovery in terms of driving miles as we go through the year. And then secondly, how the expectations in terms of how the SREs will play out.
So overall, Adam, we feel good about how we've started the year in terms of the Carb Solutions businesses. But we do see, particularly in the area of ethanol, we see green shoots of recovery in 2021 for this business here."

Of course, nobody wants to run that inverse through -- cold inventory through the inverse. What we are seeing is that, that inverse is bringing is that it's bringing clear systems for exports for North America and South America and we think that that's an advantage for the Ag Services business in which it brings better margins normally for export system. So you're going to see a little bit what happened last year that Brazil sold everything, run out of material, then the dive shifted immediately for the U.S. The U.S. is starting from an extended window of exports because Brazil started a little bit late, the planting. So we are starting with good margins. We are starting good exports for the first quarter. For the first quarter, Vince, we expect U.S. record volumes for Q1. And then we expect a very strong season at the end of the year with another strong Q4. So we're very, very optimistic about it."

We have an exceptionally strong year for global trade in 2020, which I think we're going to have a strong year, we don't know exactly we're going to get to the same level. So we plan another outstanding year for Ag Services & Oilseeds in 2021.
Carb Solutions, I think that, that's the business, as Ray explained it before, that has been the biggest impact -- impacted by COVID-19, and we think that last year, it was a very tough year in which the team did an outstanding job of growing not only 11% in that environment. And we think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that. And with some exports to China in ethanol, we expect there are many elements there to build a more constructive scenario in 2021 than in 2020.
And the Nutrition business will continue to grow. We are investing in that business. And it's a business that have a strong organic growth program. And we see in that range, as I mentioned before. And then when we look at the strategic plan for Nutrition as we grow Nutrition to the $1 billion OP during our plan. We'll look for a 15% CAGR to get there, and that's what we're expecting for this year. So that's how I think about 2021."

With respect to the contracts, just a reminder, not every contract gets negotiated in the contract cycle. We have multiyear contracts. And so certain amount of contracts got negotiated. And the outcome of the negotiations is the fact that we expect to be able to maintain our margins as we go into -- go to 2021 relative to 2020 through combination contract negotiations as well as the efforts that we're doing in terms of managing the mix and also managing our costs there.
The other comment in terms of rising corn costs and also given really a strong demand environment for feed is you've seen coal product values go up. That's a benefit for our businesses as well. So I think in the fourth quarter, we made the comment that part of the strong results is that we had very favorable net corn costs.

Animal nutrition has been a little bit more affected by in the sense that there are some parts of it like aquaculture, where fish and shrimp are much more consuming restaurants than at home. While, on the other hand, pet, with people spending more time at Canyon animals have become a little bit better. So I would say there are puts and takes there. It's difficult to judge ahead of time. I think the important thing about the nutrition business is when you take a look at what's happening is that that's a business that is investing in growth, but this also has been able to grow returns and to grow margins during the year in both divisions, both in animal and in human nutrition. And I think we're going to continue to see that.
With, as I said, the different path to growth. With animal nutrition more in building organic growth for some of the projects, especially in Asia and in parts of Latin America. And then in human nutrition, with more specific customer innovation projects in North America and Europe."

So Juan, I just want to dive a little -- I just want to add a little bit my first question is on Nutrition, just to add a little bit more clarity to that. Last year, you had talked about harvesting more of your investments, you built a lot of plants in South America, in Asia for your nutrition business. And I still expect that harvesting that investment is still a big part of your earnings story and your margin story. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in your harvesting of margins for nutrition? And I'm sure it differs between human and animal. But can you help us with that a little bit?"

I would say the harvesting continues, these plants that we built are relatively plants, whether it's protein or specialty proteins in Campo Grande. So we're going to have harvesting for many years down the road, hopefully. I would say, the 2021 is a year of heavier investments, if you will, again, another round of investment. Some of those things are capabilities, whether it's customer insights and marketing, whether it's new digital connections to customers, new models to innovate virtually and even a lot of organic growth, we have -- we kind of went light in organic growth projects in animal nutrition during 2020 because we were working on the synergies. And to be honest, because the COVID environment didn't allow for a lot of project work, and now we are going into more of that. So you're going to see 2021 being a little bit heavier investments in that -- in capabilities and plants. And we see some of these, you don't see because it's building the foundations. We are a science-based nutrition company. But you see, for example, in the quarter, we got 2 awards. We got the FIE Award for innovation in P protein, and we got the BIG Innovation Award for BPL 1, one of our probiotics. So we'll continue to invest in science, in customer insights and in organic growth in this business, as we harvest. And the harvesting you see in how our ROIC continues to grow in that business. And you see the success of our value proposition in how the EBITDA margins continue to grow in our business. So we are very happy. But Eric, we are at the early stages of building the best nutrition company out there. We are probably halfway through that build."

You look at what's going on in South America, which is clearly, the world needed 140 million metric tons of soybeans out of Brazil, and they're not going to get that. We're seeing weak in Russia. Can you -- it seems to me when you just put all the numbers together on a global basis. We are not going to rebuild these global supplies in a single year. It might take a couple of years of good weather and all of that to sustain demand. Can you kind of encapsulate how ADM is looking at the next 2 years regarding demand and supply of global grains?"

We see an environment of real demand, real effective demand happening out there. And to be honest, our customers don't have a lot of inventory because everybody has been destocking or going hand to mouth with this inverse. So we see truly a strong demand and tight balance sheets. As you said, corn and oilseeds, I think they're going to touch that pipeline balance sheet. Wheat is a little bit stronger, but the Black sea has not had a great wheat season, although Australia has a wheat growing season. So we see this is going to take 18 to 24 months for this supply demand balances to be rebuilt. So we see these conditions subsisting for the next couple of years. Even with farmers, imagine, like you trying to plant more because I think that these prices will bring more acres into production. But we need those extra acres right now."

But the rest of the projects, if you think that the commodity business have maybe a multiplier of -- you need 5 units of CapEx to get 1 unit of OP. Sometimes in nutrition, you get the one-on-one. So I think the issue is that because it's a smaller business, sometimes this investment, these efforts have a higher impact in their P&L because they need to carry as they grow and as they build a smaller business. But I would say, the nutrition is not a heavy capital-intensive business. So when you hear me speaking about animal nutrition, organic growth projects, those are a small projects. they are not in the hundreds of millions of dollars type of projects. So I would say we continue to emphasize them, but it's not a heavy burden on the capital. That's why we're growing so fast, and we still are not forecasting north of $1 billion, even when we're doing 1ADM and all that. So I think it's a very affordable growth from a capital perspective."

This morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, up 49% year-over-year if we exclude the prior year impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.115 billion, 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. 
For the full year, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $3.59; $3.4 billion in adjusted segment operating profit, 12% higher than 2019; 4 straight quarters of year-over-year segment operating profit growth; and trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC of 7.7%, almost 200 basis points above our weighted cost of capital. We maintain our strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows. 
The team managed a wide variety of risks superbly, and we achieved our strategic initiatives, exceeding our $500 million to $600 million guidance and driving our ability to deliver a steady, sustainable earnings growth. I'd like to thank our team for this tremendous performance and highlight for you some of our many achievements in 2020. 
In our optimized pillar around the globe, amid lockdowns, rapidly shifting demand patterns and extreme weather events, our colleagues fulfilled our purpose by adapting and innovating to keep our work environment safe from COVID-19, maintaining our operations to support the global food value chain and delivering for our customers to provide nutrition around the world. Beyond that, for the year, our Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered more than $300 million in capital reduction initiatives, and we are focusing on new ways to enhance the return structure of that business from digital technologies, like our Grainbridge joint venture, to differentiated products and services that add share value for growers, customers and ADM.
In our drive pillar, our new organizational structures and business processes, like our centers of excellence and our 1ADM business transformation project, are helping drive better decision-making and operational excellence. We continued our work to support our planet and its natural resources. We achieved our 15x20 environmental goals ahead of schedule and launched Strive 35, an even more ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and waste by 2035. And we're partnering with farmers in their efforts to -- for better outcomes, supported by the 6.5 million acres we had in sustainable farming programs over recent years.
In our growth pillar, our Nutrition team exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We expanded our plant-based protein capabilities, including the launch of our PlantPlus Foods joint venture. And amid an incredibly dynamic demand environment, we utilize new innovative technologies and continued launching new products to ensure we were meeting our customers' needs.
Our Carbohydrate Solutions colleagues moved quickly to meet changing customer needs for retail flour, industrial starches for cardboard and USP-grade alcohol for hand sanitizers. And the ADM team show its innovative spirit by partnering and supporting companies that are making food out of air, spider silk out of corn and animal feed out of insects.
Finally, I'm proud to say we surpassed by about 10% our stretch goal of $1.3 billion in Readiness run rate benefits by the end of the year. Readiness is driving our strategic initiatives, enabling us to be more efficient and powering our growth. Perhaps most importantly, today, we can say that Readiness is truly embedded in our culture. It's how we work.
Thanks to these impressive achievements, I'm pleased to announce a quarterly dividend increase of 2.8% to $0.37 per quarter. This dividend will be our 357th consecutive quarterly payment and an interrupted record of 89 years. It's been a remarkable year with achievements and results that truly demonstrate the strategic work we've been doing over the years to optimize, drive and grow. Even more important is how we are building for the future. We've created and are now strengthening the strategic foundation to deliver steady, sustained earnings growth for years to come.
I'll be talking about that shortly. But first, let me turn the call over to Ray to take us through our business performance. Ray?"

As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.21, down from the $1.42 in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the recognition of about $0.61 per share for the retroactive biodiesel tax credits. Absent this, earnings would have grown by about 49%.
Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7.7%, almost 200 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC. And our trailing 4-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.7 billion. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately 8% compared to a benefit of 1% in the prior year. The calendar year 2020 effective tax rate was approximately 5%, down from the approximately 13% in 2019.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the impact of U.S. tax credits, mainly the railroad tax credits, which have an offsetting expense in the cost of products sold. Absent the effect of EPS adjusting items, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11% and for the calendar year 2020 was approximately 9%. Looking ahead, we're expecting full year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%.
We generate about $3.1 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year, significantly higher than 2019. Return of capital for the year was $942 million, including more than $800 million from dividends. We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 32%, up from the 29% a year ago due to higher working capital needs due to rising commodity prices.
Capital spending for the year was about $820 million, in line with our guidance and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion. For 2021, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion.
Slide 5, please. Other Business results were substantially lower than the prior year quarter. ADM Investor Services earnings were impacted by drastically lower short-term interest rates. Captive insurance results were negatively impacted by $15 million more in net intracompany settlements compared to the prior year quarter. For 2021, we expect Other Business results to be in line with 2020.
In the Corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $278 million, were higher year-over-year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals, increased IT and project-related expenses and centralization of certain costs, including from Neovia. Other charges decreased due to lower railroad maintenance expenses partially offset by the absence of prior year investment gains. For 2021, Corporate unallocated should be overall similar to 2020.
Net interest expense for the quarter was lower than at last year due to lower short-term interest rates and liability management actions taken in 2020. For 2021, we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be similar to or slightly lower than 2020.
Slide 6, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year with record adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter. Ag Services results were significantly higher year-over-year. In North America, the team executed extremely well, capitalizing on strong global demand, particularly from China, to deliver higher export volumes and margins. 
South American origination was lower year-over-year after significantly accelerated farmer selling in the first half of 2020. Global Trade continued to do a great job, contributing to higher results by utilizing its global reach and managing risk well to meet customer demand. Approximately $80 million of prior timing effects reversed in the quarter as expected.
Crushing also delivered substantially higher results versus the prior year period. The business did a great job to capture higher margins in a continued environment of tight soybean supply and strong global demand for both meal and vegetable oils. There was approximately $125 million in net negative timing in the quarter, driven by basis impacts and improved softseed margins. 
Refined Products and Other results were higher year-over-year, absent the recognition of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year, with good results, driven primarily by solid South American margins. Wilmar's strong performance drove our equity earnings higher versus the prior year despite our slightly lower ownership stake. 
For the full year, Ag Services and Oilseeds delivered exceptional results of $2.1 billion, 9% higher than 2019. Its team achieved multiple records, including an all-time-high global crush volumes. In addition, we're proud of the team that brought our reserve export facility back online safely and ahead of schedule despite dealing with multiple severe weather events this year. Looking ahead, we expect the first quarter of 2021 results for Ag Services and Oilseeds to be significantly higher than the prior year first quarter, driven by extremely strong North American export demand and continued healthy crush margins.
Slide 7, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team again delivered substantially higher year-over-year results despite the impacts of lockdowns in key market segments. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment achieved significantly higher results, driven by lower net corn costs and intracompany insurance settlements. Earnings were partially offset by low results from corn oil and wet mill ethanol margins.
Vantage Corn Processors results were also better versus the prior year, though they continue to reflect the challenging ethanol industry environment. The team delivered higher year-over-year margins as they met increased demand for USP-grade alcohol, partially offset by fixed costs from the 2 temporarily idled dry mills.
Considering the impact of lockdowns in both driving miles and the food service sector, we're extremely proud of our Carbohydrate Solutions team for delivering full year results of $717 million, 11% higher than 2019. The team achieved record-high operating profits from starches in the year. They acted decisively by temporary idling production at our 2 VCP dry mill plants, helping address industry supply and demand balances. And the wheat milling business's modernization and optimization plan, including a new state-of-the-art mill in Mendota, Illinois, helped power a significant improvement over full year 2019 for that business.
Looking ahead, we expect Carbohydrate Solutions results in the first quarter to be significantly higher than last year's first quarter, which was negatively impacted by corn oil mark-to-market impacts, but below the fourth quarter 2020 levels due to the challenged industry ethanol margins.
Slide 8, please. The Nutrition team delivered 24% year-over-year growth in the quarter. In Human Nutrition, flavors delivered a strong quarter driven by good sales and product mix in North America, and EMEAI. Continued strength in plant proteins drove higher results in Specialty Ingredients. Health & Wellness delivered higher sales in probiotics, in natural health and nutrition. Prior year results included revenue and income related to the launch of the strategic Spiber relationship. Human Nutrition results for the quarter also included an intracompany insurance settlement. 
Animal Nutrition results were significantly higher year-over-year, driven by strong performances in Asia and EMEAI, and improvements in amino acid results, partially offset by currency effects in Latin America. We're continuing to make improvements in our amino acid business, including our announcement last month that we're discontinuing dry lysine production and transitioning to our liquid and encapsulated products in the first half of this year.
For the full year, Nutrition results were $574 million, 37% higher than 2019. The Nutrition team grew revenue 5% on a constant currency basis and continue to expand EBITDA margins. We exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We are truly seeing the benefits of our investments in Nutrition. 
Looking ahead, we expect Nutrition to solidly grow operating profits in 2021 calendar year. But the first quarter should be similar to the prior year period due to the timing of certain expenses over the year, including investments in projects to drive organic growth.
With that, let me turn it over to Juan to conclude. Juan?"

I'd like to congratulate the team once more on delivering great results in 2020. I'm proud of what we achieved, and I'm excited to see our work empowering us to reach even greater heights. 
In 2020, Ag Services and Oilseeds capitalized its unparalleled and flexible global footprint to meet strong demand. In 2021, we expect Ag Services and Oilseeds' strong execution; diverse and flexible crush capabilities, including an extensive softseed footprint; and important strategic work to continue to drive results. 
In addition, we expect the global demand environment for Ag Services and Oilseeds to remain strong. China should continue to be a significant buyer we see continued strong global growth in mill demand, and we expect increased demand for vegetable oil due to recovery in cooking oils for food service and growth in demand for biofuels, including renewable green diesel. That is why we are confident in another outstanding performance from Ag Services and Oilseeds in 2021. 
Carbohydrate Solutions is showing how we have embedded great execution into our operational structure and culture. The team is doing a great job strengthening their business by optimizing their plants and product mix. And their ability to adjust production in 2020 to quickly meet changes in demand showed how those strategic efforts are paying off. Now they are well positioned to use those same tools as the effect of lockdowns on the food service and transportation fuel sectors dissipates throughout 2021.

Listen, we expect 2021 to be a very, very strong year for Oilseeds and Ag Services, maybe with a different mix of earnings that we have in this year. If you think about 2021, we're starting with the tailwinds from 2020. So we're starting from a different position. And we're starting the year with improved global crush margins in Q1 versus Q1 last year. 
So we see a year in which we flex a little bit more our capabilities. We see a strong still soybean crush, but an exceptionally strong and recover after many years of softness in softseed crush. And I'll remind you that we have about 25% of our capacity in softseed, and we have about 15% of our capacity that is shifting. So that's a competitive advantage for ADM. 
We see a strong demand for mill, and we see also the vegetable story playing out with good global demand and prices that are today are about 20% higher than the same time last year. And not only coming from food demand but also from fuel. A new renewable green diesel capacity is having an impact in bean oil demand and margins. And we think that, that could be something about 0.5 billion pounds per year this year of extra demand. So all in all, we see tight balances, and we see a strong margin environment for the rest of the year."

And I know you talked about kind of seeing a pathway for growth there. Understanding kind of, especially in the first half of the year, there's some pretty easy comps in terms of capacity utilization and with weak volumes on the HFCS side. 
But help us think through some of the different pieces there. Ethanol in the first half of this year looks to be in a bit of a tougher spot. Obviously, corn prices have moved up pretty notably. Just trying to think about some of the different moving pieces and help us how we get to growth in that business in 2021."

Let me start here. So just -- it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right?

So just -- it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right? Because 2020, when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19, the carb sol segment was the one most negatively impacted. Yet, in 2020, they grew earnings, right? 
So what they did was they really manage projects -- product mix extremely well, driving starches, driving industrial alcohol. They managed the ethanol production well and, frankly, had a positive impact on industry margins through the idling actions it took. 
But what a lot of people forget is we have an international business that's growing, right? So we're expanding capacity over in Europe, and the European operations almost doubled in profitability in 2020 compared to 2019, a big contributor there. And then the North America milling operations, their footprint optimization really paying off with 20% growth in profitability in '20 versus '19. 
So when you think about 2021, this playbook continues, right? So number one, we do expect stabilizations in the North American Starches and Sweetener business as the beginnings of recovery and demand for certain products occur with the dissipation of lockdowns. And secondly, they're continuing to drive great product portfolio mix. And so particularly in the area of liquid dextrose and mouthfeel dextrins and citric acid. Those are actually, from a product mix perspective, very beneficial. 
Thirdly, continued international growth. And so think about where sugar prices are around the world right now. Our European operations, whereby we've added capacity, continues to drive growth. They're going to be another contributor. And then lastly, we expect continued growth in terms of our milling operations and very pleased in terms of how their optimization plan is really playing out.
Now getting back to some of the comments on the year-over-year comparison, we start off the year with weaker margins in ethanol. But if you recall, in last year, margins actually hit a low of negative $0.45 in March. We don't see that, right? So when you think about year-over-year comparisons, we're going to start off on a challenged basis. 
But we do expect that the industry supply-demand balances in the ethanol industry get better balance as we move through the year for several reasons: Number one, China actually has been buying U.S. ethanol. That's something that they have not been doing over the past couple of years. And we believe that they have already made commitments already in the first half of the year for U.S. ethanol equal to the previous all-time high for the calendar year, roughly 200 million gallons. And so we'll have to see where China ends up in the calendar year in terms of imports of U.S. ethanol. 
Secondly, there has been announced reconfiguration of ethanol capacity by various competitors in the industry as they kind of focus their production away from transportation fuel ethanol towards other products. So that's going to have an impact in the industry supply and demand. 
Thirdly, the industry itself, there is about 10% to 15% of capacity that remained idle. And from our perspective, we're going to remain very disciplined in terms of when we actually restart the dry mills, because we'll want to see sustainable margins before we restart. And hopefully, sometime in the first half, we're going to see that. 
And then lastly, how the small refinery exemptions will play out in -- over the first part of the year as the Supreme Court rules on it, will have an impact, frankly, in terms of domestic demand for ethanol. And if you take a look at RINs pricing right now, there's an expectation in the U.S. that domestic ethanol demand is going to be strong over the course of this calendar year, given just the recovery in terms of driving miles as we go through the year. And then secondly, how the expectations in terms of how the SREs will play out.
So overall, Adam, we feel good about how we started the year in terms of the carb solutions businesses. But we do see, particularly in the area of ethanol, we see green shoots of recovery in 2021 for this business here."

Of course, nobody wants to run that inverse through -- hold inventory through the inverse. 
What we are seeing is that, that inverse is bringing is that it's bringing clear seasons for exports for North America and South America, and we think that that's an advantage for the Ag Services business in which it brings better margins normally for export season. So you're going to see a little bit what happened last year, that Brazil sold everything, ran out of material. Then the tide shifted immediately for the U.S. 
The U.S. is starting from an extended window of exports because Brazil started a little bit late, the planting. So we are starting with good margins. We are starting good exports for the first quarter. For the first quarter, Vince, we expect U.S. record volumes for Q1. And then we expect a very strong season at the end of the year with another strong Q4. So we're very, very optimistic about it."

We still expect exports from Ag Services to be very strong. We have an exceptionally strong year for Global Trade in 2020, which I think we're going to have a strong year. We don't know exactly we're going to get to the same level. So we plan another outstanding year for Ag Services and Oilseeds in 2021.
Carb solutions, I think that, that's the business, as Ray explained it before, that has been the biggest impact -- impacted by COVID-19.

And we think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that.

So 2021 will be one of our peak years into the project, the 1ADM project. So we do have some capitalized, some incremental capitalized costs associated with the program. That's in part of our CapEx budget. 
Secondly, some -- with the pandemic in 2020, some projects got moved over, got pushed from 2020 into 2021. Some of them are growth projects, some of them are cost reduction projects. Some of them are just nondiscretionary expenditure projects. So there's a series of projects that we did push from 2020 to '21 just due to the pandemic and our ability to execute. 
And then thirdly, we do have growth projects. We mentioned organic growth, our focus in that area. So we do have organic growth projects going on in the course of 2021. So those are the 3 buckets as to why the number is increasing from the number that we finished up in '20 to 2021. Again, the range $900 million to $1 billion is a large range. A lot of it -- we haven't approved some of these projects. We're just putting it in terms of a placeholder. But part of our discipline is we will be evaluating the timing, the returns and determining, do we actually spend it in the course of '21 or not.
But as you know, in terms of growth projects, our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages, right? Our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages in order to approve these projects."

So Human Nutrition is much more related to specific innovation projects that are driven by customers in our pipeline, and we feel very strongly about that. Our pipeline continues to grow, and our win rates continue to grow. 
Animal Nutrition has been a little bit more affected by COVID in the sense that there are some parts of it, like aquaculture, where fish and shrimp are much more consumed in restaurants than at home. While, on the other hand, pet, with people spending more time at home, companion animals have become a little bit better. So I would say there are puts and takes there. It's difficult to judge ahead of time. 
I think the important thing about the Nutrition business is when you take a look at what's happening is that that's a business that is investing in growth, but is also has been able to grow returns and to grow margins during the year in both divisions, both in Animal and in Human Nutrition. And I think we're going to continue to see that with, as I said, the different path to growth: with Animal Nutrition, more in building organic growth for some of the projects, especially in Asia and in parts of Latin America; and then in Human Nutrition, with more specific customer innovation projects in North America and Europe."

These plants that we built are relatively new plants, whether it's pea protein or specialty proteins in Campo Grande. So we're going to have harvesting for many years down the road, hopefully. 
I would say, that 2021 is a year of heavier investments, if you will, again, another round of investment. Some of those things are capabilities, whether it's customer insights and marketing, whether it's new digital connections to customers, new models to innovate virtually and even a lot of organic growth. We have -- we kind of went light in organic growth projects in Animal Nutrition during 2020 because we were working on the synergies. And to be honest, because the COVID environment didn't allow for a lot of project work, and now we are going into more of that. 
So you're going to see 2021 being a little bit heavier investments in that -- in capabilities and plants. And we see -- some of these, you don't see because it's building the foundations. We are a science-based nutrition company. But you see, for example, in the quarter, we got 2 awards. We got the FiE award for innovation in pea protein, and we got the BIG Innovation Award for BPL1, one of our probiotics. 
So we continue to invest in science, in customer insights and in organic growth in this business as we harvest. And the harvesting, you see in how our ROIC continues to grow in that business. And you see that success of our value proposition in how the EBITDA margins continue to grow in our business. 
So we are very happy. But Eric, we are at the early stages of building the best nutrition company out there. We are probably halfway through that build."

Can you -- it seems to me when you just put all the numbers together on a global basis, we are not going to rebuild these global supplies in a single year.

As you said, corn and oilseeds, I think they're going to touch pipeline balance sheet. Wheat is a little bit stronger, but the Black Sea has not had a great wheat season, although Australia has a wheat growing season. So we see this is going to take 18 to 24 months for this supply-demand balances to be rebuilt. So we see these conditions subsisting for the next couple of years.

So if we think about the CapEx in general, that $900 million to maybe $1 billion, which is clearly up from what we saw in the last 2 years, could you give us a little bit of an understanding how you allocate or how you plan to allocate within that CapEx to the different segments?

But the Nutrition has a different OP to capital sensitivity than the other businesses. These projects are -- so sometimes, you have big projects like Campo Grande for specialty proteins. But the rest of the projects, if you think that the commodity business have maybe a multiplier of -- you need 5 units of CapEx to get 1 unit of OP, sometimes in Nutrition, you get the 1-on-1. So I think the issue is that because it's a smaller business, sometimes this investment, these efforts have a higher impact in their P&L because they need to carry as they grow and as they build a smaller business. 
But I would say, the Nutrition is not a heavy capital-intensive business. So when you hear me speaking about Animal Nutrition, organic growth projects, those are a small projects. They are not in the hundreds of millions of dollars type of projects. 
So I will say we continue to emphasize them, but it's not a heavy burden on the capital. That's why we're growing so fast, and we still are not forecasting north of $1 billion, even when we're doing 1ADM and all that. So I think it's a very affordable growth from a capital perspective."

Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.115 billion, 12",662,"Thank you, Victoria. This morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, up 49% year-over-year if we exclude the prior year impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.115 billion, 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. 
For the full year, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $3.59; $3.4 billion in adjusted segment operating profit, 12% higher than 2019; 4 straight quarters of year-over-year segment operating profit growth; and trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC of 7.7%, almost 200 basis points above our weighted cost of capital. We maintain our strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows. 
The team managed a wide variety of risks superbly, and we achieved our strategic initiatives, exceeding our $500 million to $600 million guidance and driving our ability to deliver a steady, sustainable earnings growth. I'd like to thank our team for this tremendous performance and highlight for you some of our many achievements in 2020. 
In our optimized pillar around the globe, amid lockdowns, rapidly shifting demand patterns and extreme weather events, our colleagues fulfilled our purpose by adapting and innovating to keep our work environment safe from COVID-19, maintaining our operations to support the global food value chain and delivering for our customers to provide nutrition around the world. Beyond that, for the year, our Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered more than $300 million in capital reduction initiatives, and we are focusing on new ways to enhance the return structure of that business from digital technologies, like our Grainbridge joint venture, to differentiated products and services that add share value for growers, customers and ADM.
In our drive pillar, our new organizational structures and business processes, like our centers of excellence and our 1ADM business transformation project, are helping drive better decision-making and operational excellence. We continued our work to support our planet and its natural resources. We achieved our 15x20 environmental goals ahead of schedule and launched Strive 35, an even more ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and waste by 2035. And we're partnering with farmers in their efforts to -- for better outcomes, supported by the 6.5 million acres we had in sustainable farming programs over recent years.
In our growth pillar, our Nutrition team exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We expanded our plant-based protein capabilities, including the launch of our PlantPlus Foods joint venture. And amid an incredibly dynamic demand environment, we utilize new innovative technologies and continued launching new products to ensure we were meeting our customers' needs.
Our Carbohydrate Solutions colleagues moved quickly to meet changing customer needs for retail flour, industrial starches for cardboard and USP-grade alcohol for hand sanitizers. And the ADM team show its innovative spirit by partnering and supporting companies that are making food out of air, spider silk out of corn and animal feed out of insects.
Finally, I'm proud to say we surpassed by about 10% our stretch goal of $1.3 billion in Readiness run rate benefits by the end of the year. Readiness is driving our strategic initiatives, enabling us to be more efficient and powering our growth. Perhaps most importantly, today, we can say that Readiness is truly embedded in our culture. It's how we work.
Thanks to these impressive achievements, I'm pleased to announce a quarterly dividend increase of 2.8% to $0.37 per quarter. This dividend will be our 357th consecutive quarterly payment and an interrupted record of 89 years. It's been a remarkable year with achievements and results that truly demonstrate the strategic work we've been doing over the years to optimize, drive and grow. Even more important is how we are building for the future. We've created and are now strengthening the strategic foundation to deliver steady, sustained earnings growth for years to come.
I'll be talking about that shortly. But first, let me turn the call over to Ray to take us through our business performance. Ray?"
251704,701619909,2251209,"Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Archer-Daniels-Midland Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.21, down from the $1.42 in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the",1319,"Yes. Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.21, down from the $1.42 in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the recognition of about $0.61 per share for the retroactive biodiesel tax credits. Absent this, earnings would have grown by about 49%.
Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7.7%, almost 200 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC. And our trailing 4-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.7 billion. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately 8% compared to a benefit of 1% in the prior year. The calendar year 2020 effective tax rate was approximately 5%, down from the approximately 13% in 2019.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the impact of U.S. tax credits, mainly the railroad tax credits, which have an offsetting expense in the cost of products sold. Absent the effect of EPS adjusting items, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11% and for the calendar year 2020 was approximately 9%. Looking ahead, we're expecting full year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%.
We generate about $3.1 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year, significantly higher than 2019. Return of capital for the year was $942 million, including more than $800 million from dividends. We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 32%, up from the 29% a year ago due to higher working capital needs due to rising commodity prices.
Capital spending for the year was about $820 million, in line with our guidance and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion. For 2021, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion.
Slide 5, please. Other Business results were substantially lower than the prior year quarter. ADM Investor Services earnings were impacted by drastically lower short-term interest rates. Captive insurance results were negatively impacted by $15 million more in net intracompany settlements compared to the prior year quarter. For 2021, we expect Other Business results to be in line with 2020.
In the Corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $278 million, were higher year-over-year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals, increased IT and project-related expenses and centralization of certain costs, including from Neovia. Other charges decreased due to lower railroad maintenance expenses partially offset by the absence of prior year investment gains. For 2021, Corporate unallocated should be overall similar to 2020.
Net interest expense for the quarter was lower than at last year due to lower short-term interest rates and liability management actions taken in 2020. For 2021, we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be similar to or slightly lower than 2020.
Slide 6, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year with record adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter. Ag Services results were significantly higher year-over-year. In North America, the team executed extremely well, capitalizing on strong global demand, particularly from China, to deliver higher export volumes and margins. 
South American origination was lower year-over-year after significantly accelerated farmer selling in the first half of 2020. Global Trade continued to do a great job, contributing to higher results by utilizing its global reach and managing risk well to meet customer demand. Approximately $80 million of prior timing effects reversed in the quarter as expected.
Crushing also delivered substantially higher results versus the prior year period. The business did a great job to capture higher margins in a continued environment of tight soybean supply and strong global demand for both meal and vegetable oils. There was approximately $125 million in net negative timing in the quarter, driven by basis impacts and improved softseed margins. 
Refined Products and Other results were higher year-over-year, absent the recognition of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year, with good results, driven primarily by solid South American margins. Wilmar's strong performance drove our equity earnings higher versus the prior year despite our slightly lower ownership stake. 
For the full year, Ag Services and Oilseeds delivered exceptional results of $2.1 billion, 9% higher than 2019. Its team achieved multiple records, including an all-time-high global crush volumes. In addition, we're proud of the team that brought our reserve export facility back online safely and ahead of schedule despite dealing with multiple severe weather events this year. Looking ahead, we expect the first quarter of 2021 results for Ag Services and Oilseeds to be significantly higher than the prior year first quarter, driven by extremely strong North American export demand and continued healthy crush margins.
Slide 7, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team again delivered substantially higher year-over-year results despite the impacts of lockdowns in key market segments. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment achieved significantly higher results, driven by lower net corn costs and intracompany insurance settlements. Earnings were partially offset by low results from corn oil and wet mill ethanol margins.
Vantage Corn Processors results were also better versus the prior year, though they continue to reflect the challenging ethanol industry environment. The team delivered higher year-over-year margins as they met increased demand for USP-grade alcohol, partially offset by fixed costs from the 2 temporarily idled dry mills.
Considering the impact of lockdowns in both driving miles and the food service sector, we're extremely proud of our Carbohydrate Solutions team for delivering full year results of $717 million, 11% higher than 2019. The team achieved record-high operating profits from starches in the year. They acted decisively by temporary idling production at our 2 VCP dry mill plants, helping address industry supply and demand balances. And the wheat milling business's modernization and optimization plan, including a new state-of-the-art mill in Mendota, Illinois, helped power a significant improvement over full year 2019 for that business.
Looking ahead, we expect Carbohydrate Solutions results in the first quarter to be significantly higher than last year's first quarter, which was negatively impacted by corn oil mark-to-market impacts, but below the fourth quarter 2020 levels due to the challenged industry ethanol margins.
Slide 8, please. The Nutrition team delivered 24% year-over-year growth in the quarter. In Human Nutrition, flavors delivered a strong quarter driven by good sales and product mix in North America, and EMEAI. Continued strength in plant proteins drove higher results in Specialty Ingredients. Health & Wellness delivered higher sales in probiotics, in natural health and nutrition. Prior year results included revenue and income related to the launch of the strategic Spiber relationship. Human Nutrition results for the quarter also included an intracompany insurance settlement. 
Animal Nutrition results were significantly higher year-over-year, driven by strong performances in Asia and EMEAI, and improvements in amino acid results, partially offset by currency effects in Latin America. We're continuing to make improvements in our amino acid business, including our announcement last month that we're discontinuing dry lysine production and transitioning to our liquid and encapsulated products in the first half of this year.
For the full year, Nutrition results were $574 million, 37% higher than 2019. The Nutrition team grew revenue 5% on a constant currency basis and continue to expand EBITDA margins. We exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We are truly seeing the benefits of our investments in Nutrition. 
Looking ahead, we expect Nutrition to solidly grow operating profits in 2021 calendar year. But the first quarter should be similar to the prior year period due to the timing of certain expenses over the year, including investments in projects to drive organic growth.
With that, let me turn it over to Juan to conclude. Juan?"

I'd like to congratulate the team once more on delivering great results in 2020. I'm proud of what we achieved, and I'm excited to see our work empowering us to reach even greater heights. 
In 2020, Ag Services and Oilseeds capitalized its unparalleled and flexible global footprint to meet strong demand. In 2021, we expect Ag Services and Oilseeds' strong execution; diverse and flexible crush capabilities, including an extensive softseed footprint; and important strategic work to continue to drive results. 
In addition, we expect the global demand environment for Ag Services and Oilseeds to remain strong. China should continue to be a significant buyer we see continued strong global growth in mill demand, and we expect increased demand for vegetable oil due to recovery in cooking oils for foodservice and growth in demand for biofuels, including renewable green diesel. That is why we are confident in another outstanding performance from Ag Services and Oilseeds in 2021. 
Carbohydrate Solutions is showing how we have embedded great execution into our operational structure and culture. The team is doing a great job strengthening their business by optimizing their plants and product mix. And their ability to adjust production in 2020 to quickly meet changes in demand showed how those strategic efforts are paying off. Now they are well positioned to use those same tools as the effect of lockdowns on the foodservice and transportation fuel sectors dissipates throughout 2021. We expect solid profit growth for the year for Carbohydrate Solutions.
Nutrition continued to harvest investments, lead in consumer growth trends areas and partner with customers to bring innovative, new products and solutions to market in 2020. Based on our current organic growth plans, we expect the Nutrition team to deliver solid revenue expansion and enter a period of an average 15% per annum operating profit growth, consistent with our strategic plan.
Across ADM, we are fulfilling our purpose and building on a foundation for steady, sustainable earnings growth. We are growing and leading in key trend areas, including food security, health and wellness and sustainability. Our continued advancements of readiness is benefiting the entire enterprise, and we're making investments in exciting growth innovation platforms, which we'll be talking more about in the future.
In 2021, we will remain focused on the drivers under our control, adding incremental returns as we focus on organic growth, advancing operational excellence initiatives to maximize returns from every business and every asset and continuing to generate benefits from Readiness. With a strong execution of these strategic initiatives and improving market conditions as the year progresses, we expect to build on a record 2020 with a strong growth in segment operating profit, and another record year of EPS in 2021.

Listen, we expect 2021 to be a very, very strong year for Oilseeds and Ag Services, maybe with a different mix of earnings that we have in this year. If you think about 2021, we're starting with the tailwinds from 2020. So we're starting from a different position. And we're starting the year with improved global crush margins in Q1 versus Q1 last year. 
So we see a year in which we flex a little bit more our capabilities. We see a strong still soybean crush, but an exceptionally strong and recover after many years of softness in softseed crush. And I'll remind you that we have about 25% of our capacity in softseed, and we have about 15% of our capacity that is shifting. So that's a competitive advantage for ADM. 
We see a strong demand for mill, and we see also the vegetable story playing out with good global demand and prices that are today are about 20% higher than the same time last year. And not only coming from food demand but also from fuel. A new renewable green diesel capacity is having an impact in bean oil demand and margins. And we think that, that could be something about 0.5 billion pounds per year this year of extra demand. So all in all, we see tight balances, and we see a strong margin environment for the rest of the year."

And I know you talked about kind of seeing a pathway for growth there. Understanding kind of, especially in the first half of the year, there's some pretty easy comps in terms of capacity utilization and with weak volumes on the HFCS side. 
But help us think through some of the different pieces there. Ethanol in the first half of this year looks to be in a bit of a tougher spot. Obviously, corn prices have moved up pretty notably. Just trying to think about some of the different moving pieces and help us how we get to growth in that business in 2021."
251704,701619909,2251209,"Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Archer-Daniels-Midland Company","Executives","Sure, Adam. Let me start here. So just -- it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right? Because 2020, when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19, the carb sol segment was the one most negatively",699,"Sure, Adam. Let me start here. So just -- it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right? Because 2020, when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19, the carb sol segment was the one most negatively impacted. Yet, in 2020, they grew earnings, right? 
So what they did was they really manage projects -- product mix extremely well, driving starches, driving industrial alcohol. They managed the ethanol production well and, frankly, had a positive impact on industry margins through the idling actions it took. 
But what a lot of people forget is we have an international business that's growing, right? So we're expanding capacity over in Europe, and the European operations almost doubled in profitability in 2020 compared to 2019, a big contributor there. And then the North America milling operations, their footprint optimization really paying off with 20% growth in profitability in '20 versus '19. 
So when you think about 2021, this playbook continues, right? So number one, we do expect stabilizations in the North American Starches and Sweetener business as the beginnings of recovery and demand for certain products occur with the dissipation of lockdowns. And secondly, they're continuing to drive great product portfolio mix. And so particularly in the area of liquid dextrose and mouthfeel dextrins and citric acid. Those are actually, from a product mix perspective, very beneficial. 
Thirdly, continued international growth. And so think about where sugar prices are around the world right now. Our European operations, whereby we've added capacity, continues to drive growth. They're going to be another contributor. And then lastly, we expect continued growth in terms of our milling operations and very pleased in terms of how their optimization plan is really playing out.
Now getting back to some of the comments on the year-over-year comparison, we start off the year with weaker margins in ethanol. But if you recall, in last year, margins actually hit a low of negative $0.45 in March. We don't see that, right? So when you think about year-over-year comparisons, we're going to start off on a challenged basis. 
But we do expect that the industry supply-demand balances in the ethanol industry get better balance as we move through the year for several reasons: Number one, China actually has been buying U.S. ethanol. That's something that they have not been doing over the past couple of years. And we believe that they have already made commitments already in the first half of the year for U.S. ethanol equal to the previous all-time high for the calendar year, roughly 200 million gallons. And so we'll have to see where China ends up in the calendar year in terms of imports of U.S. ethanol. 
Secondly, there has been announced reconfiguration of ethanol capacity by various competitors in the industry as they kind of focus their production away from transportation fuel ethanol towards other products. So that's going to have an impact in the industry supply and demand. 
Thirdly, the industry itself, there is about 10% to 15% of capacity that remained idle. And from our perspective, we're going to remain very disciplined in terms of when we actually restart the dry mills, because we'll want to see sustainable margins before we restart. And hopefully, sometime in the first half, we're going to see that. 
And then lastly, how the small refinery exemptions will play out in -- over the first part of the year as the Supreme Court rules on it, will have an impact, frankly, in terms of domestic demand for ethanol. And if you take a look at RINs pricing right now, there's an expectation in the U.S. that domestic ethanol demand is going to be strong over the course of this calendar year, given just the recovery in terms of driving miles as we go through the year. And then secondly, how the expectations in terms of how the SREs will play out.
So overall, Adam, we feel good about how we started the year in terms of the carb solutions businesses. But we do see, particularly in the area of ethanol, we see green shoots of recovery in 2021 for this business here."

So -- but from a leverage perspective with the RMI credits, our leverage, our balance sheet remains strong. And so we believe we've got firepower in order to continue to look at opportunistic M&A, opportunistic share buybacks over the course of the year."

Listen, the inverse certainly is indicating the farmers and everybody that -- to bring the product to the market. So we see a little bit of destocking. Of course, nobody wants to run that inverse through -- hold inventory through the inverse. 
What we are seeing is that, that inverse is bringing is that it's bringing clear seasons for exports for North America and South America, and we think that that's an advantage for the Ag Services business in which it brings better margins normally for export season. So you're going to see a little bit what happened last year, that Brazil sold everything, ran out of material. Then the tide shifted immediately for the U.S. 
The U.S. is starting from an extended window of exports because Brazil started a little bit late, the planting. So we are starting with good margins. We are starting good exports for the first quarter. For the first quarter, Vince, we expect U.S. record volumes for Q1. And then we expect a very strong season at the end of the year with another strong Q4. So we're very, very optimistic about it."

We still expect exports from Ag Services to be very strong. We have an exceptionally strong year for Global Trade in 2020, which I think we're going to have a strong year. We don't know exactly we're going to get to the same level. So we plan another outstanding year for Ag Services and Oilseeds in 2021.
Carb solutions, I think that, that's the business, as Ray explained it before, that has been the biggest impact -- impacted by COVID-19. And we think that last year, it was a very tough year in which the team did an outstanding job of growing earnings 11% in that environment. And we think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that. And with some exports to China in ethanol, we expect there are many elements there to build a more constructive scenario in 2021 than in 2020.
And the Nutrition business will continue to grow. We are investing in that business. And it's a business that have a strong organic growth program, and we see in that range, as I mentioned before. And then when we look at the strategic plan for Nutrition, as we grow Nutrition to the billion-dollar OP during our plan, we'll look for a 15% CAGR to get there, and that's what we're expecting for this year.

With respect to the contracts, just a reminder, not every contract gets negotiated in the contract cycle. We have multiyear contracts. And so certain amount of contracts got negotiated. And the outcome of the negotiations is the fact that we expect to be able to maintain our margins as we go into -- go through 2021 relative to 2020 through the combination contract negotiations as well as the efforts that we're doing in terms of managing the mix and also managing our costs there.
The other comment in terms of rising corn costs and also given really a strong demand environment for feed is you've seen whole product values go up. That's a benefit for our businesses as well. So I think in the fourth quarter, we made the comment that part of the strong results is that we had very favorable net corn costs.

I think the important thing about the Nutrition business is when you take a look at what's happening is that that's a business that is investing in growth, but is also has been able to grow returns and to grow margins during the year in both divisions, both in Animal and in Human Nutrition. And I think we're going to continue to see that with, as I said, the different path to growth: with Animal Nutrition, more in building organic growth for some of the projects, especially in Asia and in parts of Latin America; and then in Human Nutrition, with more specific customer innovation projects in North America and Europe."

Last year, you had talked about harvesting more of your investments. You built a lot of plants in South America, in Asia for your Nutrition business. And I still expect that harvesting that investment is still a big part of your earnings story and your margin story. 
Can you talk a little bit about where you are in your harvesting of margins for Nutrition? And I'm sure it differs between human and animal. But can you help us with that a little bit?"

These plants that we built are relatively new plants, whether it's pea protein or specialty proteins in Campo Grande. So we're going to have harvesting for many years down the road, hopefully. 
I would say, that 2021 is a year of heavier investments, if you will, again, another round of investment. Some of those things are capabilities, whether it's customer insights and marketing, whether it's new digital connections to customers, new models to innovate virtually and even a lot of organic growth. We have -- we kind of went light in organic growth projects in Animal Nutrition during 2020 because we were working on the synergies. And to be honest, because the COVID environment didn't allow for a lot of project work, and now we are going into more of that. 
So you're going to see 2021 being a little bit heavier investments in that -- in capabilities and plants. And we see -- some of these, you don't see because it's building the foundations. We are a science-based nutrition company. But you see, for example, in the quarter, we got 2 awards. We got the FiE award for innovation in pea protein, and we got the BIG Innovation Award for BPL1, one of our probiotics. 
So we continue to invest in science, in customer insights and in organic growth in this business as we harvest. And the harvesting, you see in how our ROIC continues to grow in that business. And you see that success of our value proposition in how the EBITDA margins continue to grow in our business. 
So we are very happy. But Eric, we are at the early stages of building the best nutrition company out there. We are probably halfway through that build."

So Juan, the question that I have, and you've talked a lot about demand around the world, which is even surprisingly strong despite the grain pricing environment that we have, which is pretty high, and we're still seeing good exports. But when you look at the U.S. crop, upcoming planting season this year, you look at what's going on in South America, which is clearly, the world needed 140 million metric tons of soybeans out of Brazil, and they're not going to get that. We're seeing weakened Russia. 
Can you -- it seems to me when you just put all the numbers together on a global basis, we are not going to rebuild these global supplies in a single year. It might take a couple of years of good weather and all of that to sustain demand. Can you kind of encapsulate how ADM is looking at the next 2 years regarding demand and supply of global grains?"

We see an environment of real demand, real effective demand happening out there. And to be honest, our customers don't have a lot of inventory because everybody has been destocking or going hand to mouth with this inverse. So we see truly a strong demand and tight balance sheets. 
As you said, corn and oilseeds, I think they're going to touch pipeline balance sheet. Wheat is a little bit stronger, but the Black Sea has not had a great wheat season, although Australia has a wheat growing season. So we see this is going to take 18 to 24 months for this supply-demand balances to be rebuilt. So we see these conditions subsisting for the next couple of years. Even with farmers, I imagine like you, trying to plant more because I think that these prices will bring more acres into production. But we need those extra acres right now."

And I mean, clearly, you've been putting a lot of emphasis on the growth and the prospects within Nutrition. And you've just said this will be another year and the need of investments in order to get to that 15% CAGR you've been talking about. 
So if we think about the CapEx in general, that $900 million to maybe $1 billion, which is clearly up from what we saw in the last 2 years, could you give us a little bit of an understanding how you allocate or how you plan to allocate within that CapEx to the different segments? And in particular, to the Nutrition business, just to understand how much capital you're adding to that business?"

But the Nutrition has a different OP to capital sensitivity than the other businesses. These projects are -- so sometimes, you have big projects like Campo Grande for specialty proteins. But the rest of the projects, if you think that the commodity business have maybe a multiplier of -- you need 5 units of CapEx to get 1 unit of OP, sometimes in Nutrition, you get the 1-on-1. So I think the issue is that because it's a smaller business, sometimes this investment, these efforts have a higher impact in their P&L because they need to carry as they grow and as they build a smaller business. 
But I would say, the Nutrition is not a heavy capital-intensive business. So when you hear me speaking about Animal Nutrition, organic growth projects, those are a small projects. They are not in the hundreds of millions of dollars type of projects. 
So I will say we continue to emphasize them, but it's not a heavy burden on the capital. That's why we're growing so fast, and we still are not forecasting north of $1 billion, even when we're doing 1ADM and all that. So I think it's a very affordable growth from a capital perspective."

This morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, up 49% year-over-year if we exclude the prior year impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.115 billion, 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. 
For the full year, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $3.59; $3.4 billion in adjusted segment operating profit, 12% higher than 2019; 4 straight quarters of year-over-year segment operating profit growth; and trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC of 7.7%, almost 200 basis points above our weighted cost of capital. We maintain our strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows. 
The team managed a wide variety of risks superbly, and we achieved our strategic initiatives, exceeding our $500 million to $600 million guidance and driving our ability to deliver a steady, sustainable earnings growth. I'd like to thank our team for this tremendous performance and highlight for you some of our many achievements in 2020. 
In our optimized pillar around the globe, amid lockdowns, rapidly shifting demand patterns and extreme weather events, our colleagues fulfilled our purpose by adapting and innovating to keep our work environment safe from COVID-19, maintaining our operations to support the global food value chain and delivering for our customers to provide nutrition around the world. Beyond that, for the year, our Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered more than $300 million in capital reduction initiatives, and we are focusing on new ways to enhance the return structure of that business from digital technologies, like our Grainbridge joint venture, to differentiated products and services that add share value for growers, customers and ADM.
In our drive pillar, our new organizational structures and business processes, like our centers of excellence and our 1ADM business transformation project, are helping drive better decision-making and operational excellence. We continued our work to support our planet and its natural resources. We achieved our 15x20 environmental goals ahead of schedule and launched Strive 35, an even more ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and waste by 2035. And we're partnering with farmers in their efforts to -- for better outcomes, supported by the 6.5 million acres we had in sustainable farming programs over recent years.
In our growth pillar, our Nutrition team exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We expanded our plant-based protein capabilities, including the launch of our PlantPlus Foods joint venture. And amid an incredibly dynamic demand environment, we utilize new innovative technologies and continued launching new products to ensure we were meeting our customers' needs.
Our Carbohydrate Solutions colleagues moved quickly to meet changing customer needs for retail flour, industrial starches for cardboard and USP-grade alcohol for hand sanitizers. And the ADM team show its innovative spirit by partnering and supporting companies that are making food out of air, spider silk out of corn and animal feed out of insects.
Finally, I'm proud to say we surpassed by about 10% our stretch goal of $1.3 billion in Readiness run rate benefits by the end of the year. Readiness is driving our strategic initiatives, enabling us to be more efficient and powering our growth. Perhaps most importantly, today, we can say that Readiness is truly embedded in our culture. It's how we work.
Thanks to these impressive achievements, I'm pleased to announce a quarterly dividend increase of 2.8% to $0.37 per quarter. This dividend will be our 357th consecutive quarterly payment and an interrupted record of 89 years. It's been a remarkable year with achievements and results that truly demonstrate the strategic work we've been doing over the years to optimize, drive and grow. Even more important is how we are building for the future. We've created and are now strengthening the strategic foundation to deliver steady, sustained earnings growth for years to come.
I'll be talking about that shortly. But first, let me turn the call over to Ray to take us through our business performance. Ray?"

Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.21, down from the $1.42 in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the",1319,"Yes. Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.21, down from the $1.42 in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the recognition of about $0.61 per share for the retroactive biodiesel tax credits. Absent this, earnings would have grown by about 49%.
Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7.7%, almost 200 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC. And our trailing 4-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.7 billion. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately 8% compared to a benefit of 1% in the prior year. The calendar year 2020 effective tax rate was approximately 5%, down from the approximately 13% in 2019.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the impact of U.S. tax credits, mainly the railroad tax credits, which have an offsetting expense in the cost of products sold. Absent the effect of EPS adjusting items, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11% and for the calendar year 2020 was approximately 9%. Looking ahead, we're expecting full year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%.
We generate about $3.1 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year, significantly higher than 2019. Return of capital for the year was $942 million, including more than $800 million from dividends. We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 32%, up from the 29% a year ago due to higher working capital needs due to rising commodity prices.
Capital spending for the year was about $820 million, in line with our guidance and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion. For 2021, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion.
Slide 5, please. Other Business results were substantially lower than the prior year quarter. ADM Investor Services earnings were impacted by drastically lower short-term interest rates. Captive insurance results were negatively impacted by $15 million more in net intracompany settlements compared to the prior year quarter. For 2021, we expect Other Business results to be in line with 2020.
In the Corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $278 million, were higher year-over-year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals, increased IT and project-related expenses and centralization of certain costs, including from Neovia. Other charges decreased due to lower railroad maintenance expenses partially offset by the absence of prior year investment gains. For 2021, Corporate unallocated should be overall similar to 2020.
Net interest expense for the quarter was lower than at last year due to lower short-term interest rates and liability management actions taken in 2020. For 2021, we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be similar to or slightly lower than 2020.
Slide 6, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year with record adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter. Ag Services results were significantly higher year-over-year. In North America, the team executed extremely well, capitalizing on strong global demand, particularly from China, to deliver higher export volumes and margins. 
South American origination was lower year-over-year after significantly accelerated farmer selling in the first half of 2020. Global Trade continued to do a great job, contributing to higher results by utilizing its global reach and managing risk well to meet customer demand. Approximately $80 million of prior timing effects reversed in the quarter as expected.
Crushing also delivered substantially higher results versus the prior year period. The business did a great job to capture higher margins in a continued environment of tight soybean supply and strong global demand for both meal and vegetable oils. There was approximately $125 million in net negative timing in the quarter, driven by basis impacts and improved softseed margins. 
Refined Products and Other results were higher year-over-year, absent the recognition of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year, with good results, driven primarily by solid South American margins. Wilmar's strong performance drove our equity earnings higher versus the prior year despite our slightly lower ownership stake. 
For the full year, Ag Services and Oilseeds delivered exceptional results of $2.1 billion, 9% higher than 2019. Its team achieved multiple records, including an all-time-high global crush volumes. In addition, we're proud of the team that brought our reserve export facility back online safely and ahead of schedule despite dealing with multiple severe weather events this year. Looking ahead, we expect the first quarter of 2021 results for Ag Services and Oilseeds to be significantly higher than the prior year first quarter, driven by extremely strong North American export demand and continued healthy crush margins.
Slide 7, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team again delivered substantially higher year-over-year results despite the impacts of lockdowns in key market segments. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment achieved significantly higher results, driven by lower net corn costs and intracompany insurance settlements. Earnings were partially offset by low results from corn oil and wet mill ethanol margins.
Vantage Corn Processors results were also better versus the prior year, though they continue to reflect the challenging ethanol industry environment. The team delivered higher year-over-year margins as they met increased demand for USP-grade alcohol, partially offset by fixed costs from the 2 temporarily idled dry mills.
Considering the impact of lockdowns in both driving miles and the food service sector, we're extremely proud of our Carbohydrate Solutions team for delivering full year results of $717 million, 11% higher than 2019. The team achieved record-high operating profits from starches in the year. They acted decisively by temporary idling production at our 2 VCP dry mill plants, helping address industry supply and demand balances. And the wheat milling business's modernization and optimization plan, including a new state-of-the-art mill in Mendota, Illinois, helped power a significant improvement over full year 2019 for that business.
Looking ahead, we expect Carbohydrate Solutions results in the first quarter to be significantly higher than last year's first quarter, which was negatively impacted by corn oil mark-to-market impacts, but below the fourth quarter 2020 levels due to the challenged industry ethanol margins.
Slide 8, please. The Nutrition team delivered 24% year-over-year growth in the quarter. In Human Nutrition, flavors delivered a strong quarter driven by good sales and product mix in North America, and EMEAI. Continued strength in plant proteins drove higher results in Specialty Ingredients. Health & Wellness delivered higher sales in probiotics, in natural health and nutrition. Prior year results included revenue and income related to the launch of the strategic Spiber relationship. Human Nutrition results for the quarter also included an intracompany insurance settlement. 
Animal Nutrition results were significantly higher year-over-year, driven by strong performances in Asia and EMEAI, and improvements in amino acid results, partially offset by currency effects in Latin America. We're continuing to make improvements in our amino acid business, including our announcement last month that we're discontinuing dry lysine production and transitioning to our liquid and encapsulated products in the first half of this year.
For the full year, Nutrition results were $574 million, 37% higher than 2019. The Nutrition team grew revenue 5% on a constant currency basis and continue to expand EBITDA margins. We exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We are truly seeing the benefits of our investments in Nutrition. 
Looking ahead, we expect Nutrition to solidly grow operating profits in 2021 calendar year. But the first quarter should be similar to the prior year period due to the timing of certain expenses over the year, including investments in projects to drive organic growth.

I'd like to congratulate the team once more on delivering great results in 2020. I'm proud of what we achieved, and I'm excited to see our work empowering us to reach even greater heights. 
In 2020, Ag Services and Oilseeds capitalized its unparalleled and flexible global footprint to meet strong demand. In 2021, we expect Ag Services and Oilseeds' strong execution; diverse and flexible crush capabilities, including an extensive softseed footprint; and important strategic work to continue to drive results. 
In addition, we expect the global demand environment for Ag Services and Oilseeds to remain strong. China should continue to be a significant buyer we see continued strong global growth in mill demand, and we expect increased demand for vegetable oil due to recovery in cooking oils for foodservice and growth in demand for biofuels, including renewable green diesel. That is why we are confident in another outstanding performance from Ag Services and Oilseeds in 2021. 
Carbohydrate Solutions is showing how we have embedded great execution into our operational structure and culture. The team is doing a great job strengthening their business by optimizing their plants and product mix. And their ability to adjust production in 2020 to quickly meet changes in demand showed how those strategic efforts are paying off. Now they are well positioned to use those same tools as the effect of lockdowns on the foodservice and transportation fuel sectors dissipates throughout 2021. We expect solid profit growth for the year for Carbohydrate Solutions.
Nutrition continued to harvest investments, lead in consumer growth trends areas and partner with customers to bring innovative, new products and solutions to market in 2020. Based on our current organic growth plans, we expect the Nutrition team to deliver solid revenue expansion and enter a period of an average 15% per annum operating profit growth, consistent with our strategic plan.
Across ADM, we are fulfilling our purpose and building on a foundation for steady, sustainable earnings growth. We are growing and leading in key trend areas, including food security, health and wellness and sustainability. Our continued advancements of readiness is benefiting the entire enterprise, and we're making investments in exciting growth innovation platforms, which we'll be talking more about in the future.
In 2021, we will remain focused on the drivers under our control, adding incremental returns as we focus on organic growth, advancing operational excellence initiatives to maximize returns from every business and every asset and continuing to generate benefits from Readiness. With a strong execution of these strategic initiatives and improving market conditions as the year progresses, we expect to build on a record 2020 with a strong growth in segment operating profit, and another record year of EPS in 2021.
With that, Shelby, please open the line for questions."

Listen, we expect 2021 to be a very, very strong year for Oilseeds and Ag Services, maybe with a different mix of earnings that we have in this year. If you think about 2021, we're starting with the tailwinds from 2020. So we're starting from a different position. And we're starting the year with improved global crush margins in Q1 versus Q1 last year. 
So we see a year in which we flex a little bit more our capabilities. We see a strong still soybean crush, but an exceptionally strong and recover after many years of softness in softseed crush. And I'll remind you that we have about 25% of our capacity in softseed, and we have about 15% of our capacity that is shifting. So that's a competitive advantage for ADM. 
We see a strong demand for mill, and we see also the vegetable story playing out with good global demand and prices that are today are about 20% higher than the same time last year. And not only coming from food demand but also from fuel. A new renewable green diesel capacity is having an impact in bean oil demand and margins. And we think that, that could be something about 0.5 billion pounds per year this year of extra demand. So all in all, we see tight balances, and we see a strong margin environment for the rest of the year."

And I know you talked about kind of seeing a pathway for growth there. Understanding kind of, especially in the first half of the year, there's some pretty easy comps in terms of capacity utilization and with weak volumes on the HFCS side. 
But help us think through some of the different pieces there. Ethanol in the first half of this year looks to be in a bit of a tougher spot. Obviously, corn prices have moved up pretty notably. Just trying to think about some of the different moving pieces and help us how we get to growth in that business in 2021."

Let me start here. So just -- it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right? Because 2020, when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19, the carb sol segment was the one most negatively",699,"Sure, Adam. Let me start here. So just -- it's useful to kind of refer to also how they manage 2020, right? Because 2020, when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19, the carb sol segment was the one most negatively impacted. Yet, in 2020, they grew earnings, right? 
So what they did was they really manage projects -- product mix extremely well, driving starches, driving industrial alcohol. They managed the ethanol production well and, frankly, had a positive impact on industry margins through the idling actions it took. 
But what a lot of people forget is we have an international business that's growing, right? So we're expanding capacity over in Europe, and the European operations almost doubled in profitability in 2020 compared to 2019, a big contributor there. And then the North America milling operations, their footprint optimization really paying off with 20% growth in profitability in '20 versus '19. 
So when you think about 2021, this playbook continues, right? So number one, we do expect stabilizations in the North American Starches and Sweetener business as the beginnings of recovery and demand for certain products occur with the dissipation of lockdowns. And secondly, they're continuing to drive great product portfolio mix. And so particularly in the area of liquid dextrose and mouthfeel dextrins and citric acid. Those are actually, from a product mix perspective, very beneficial. 
Thirdly, continued international growth. And so think about where sugar prices are around the world right now. Our European operations, whereby we've added capacity, continues to drive growth. They're going to be another contributor. And then lastly, we expect continued growth in terms of our milling operations and very pleased in terms of how their optimization plan is really playing out.
Now getting back to some of the comments on the year-over-year comparison, we start off the year with weaker margins in ethanol. But if you recall, in last year, margins actually hit a low of negative $0.45 in March. We don't see that, right? So when you think about year-over-year comparisons, we're going to start off on a challenged basis. 
But we do expect that the industry supply-demand balances in the ethanol industry get better balance as we move through the year for several reasons: Number one, China actually has been buying U.S. ethanol. That's something that they have not been doing over the past couple of years. And we believe that they have already made commitments already in the first half of the year for U.S. ethanol equal to the previous all-time high for the calendar year, roughly 200 million gallons. And so we'll have to see where China ends up in the calendar year in terms of imports of U.S. ethanol. 
Secondly, there has been announced reconfiguration of ethanol capacity by various competitors in the industry as they kind of focus their production away from transportation fuel ethanol towards other products. So that's going to have an impact in the industry supply and demand. 
Thirdly, the industry itself, there is about 10% to 15% of capacity that remained idle. And from our perspective, we're going to remain very disciplined in terms of when we actually restart the dry mills, because we'll want to see sustainable margins before we restart. And hopefully, sometime in the first half, we're going to see that. 
And then lastly, how the small refinery exemptions will play out in -- over the first part of the year as the Supreme Court rules on it, will have an impact, frankly, in terms of domestic demand for ethanol. And if you take a look at RINs pricing right now, there's an expectation in the U.S. that domestic ethanol demand is going to be strong over the course of this calendar year, given just the recovery in terms of driving miles as we go through the year. And then secondly, how the expectations in terms of how the SREs will play out.
So overall, Adam, we feel good about how we started the year in terms of the carb solutions businesses. But we do see, particularly in the area of ethanol, we see green shoots of recovery in 2021 for this business here."

What we are seeing is that, that inverse is bringing is that it's bringing clear seasons for exports for North America and South America, and we think that that's an advantage for the Ag Services business in which it brings better margins normally for export season. So you're going to see a little bit what happened last year, that Brazil sold everything, ran out of material. Then the tide shifted immediately for the U.S. 
The U.S. is starting from an extended window of exports because Brazil started a little bit late, the planting. So we are starting with good margins. We are starting good exports for the first quarter. For the first quarter, Vince, we expect U.S. record volumes for Q1.

We don't know exactly we're going to get to the same level. So we plan another outstanding year for Ag Services and Oilseeds in 2021.

And we think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that.

The other comment in terms of rising corn costs and also given really a strong demand environment for feed is you've seen whole product values go up. That's a benefit for our businesses as well.

So 2021 will be one of our peak years into the project, the 1ADM project. So we do have some capitalized, some incremental capitalized costs associated with the program. That's in part of our CapEx budget. 
Secondly, some -- with the pandemic in 2020, some projects got moved over, got pushed from 2020 into 2021. Some of them are growth projects, some of them are cost reduction projects. Some of them are just nondiscretionary expenditure projects. So there's a series of projects that we did push from 2020 to '21 just due to the pandemic and our ability to execute. 
And then thirdly, we do have growth projects. We mentioned organic growth, our focus in that area. So we do have organic growth projects going on in the course of 2021. So those are the 3 buckets as to why the number is increasing from the number that we finished up in '20 to 2021. Again, the range $900 million to $1 billion is a large range. A lot of it -- we haven't approved some of these projects. We're just putting it in terms of a placeholder. But part of our discipline is we will be evaluating the timing, the returns and determining, do we actually spend it in the course of '21 or not.

So Human Nutrition is much more related to specific innovation projects that are driven by customers in our pipeline, and we feel very strongly about that. Our pipeline continues to grow, and our win rates continue to grow. 
Animal Nutrition has been a little bit more affected by COVID in the sense that there are some parts of it, like aquaculture, where fish and shrimp are much more consumed in restaurants than at home. While, on the other hand, pet, with people spending more time at home, companion animals have become a little bit better. So I would say there are puts and takes there. It's difficult to judge ahead of time. 
I think the important thing about the Nutrition business is when you take a look at what's happening is that that's a business that is investing in growth, but is also has been able to grow returns and to grow margins during the year in both divisions, both in Animal and in Human Nutrition. And I think we're going to continue to see that with, as I said, the different path to growth: with Animal Nutrition, more in building organic growth for some of the projects, especially in Asia and in parts of Latin America; and then in Human Nutrition, with more specific customer innovation projects in North America and Europe."

I would say, that 2021 is a year of heavier investments, if you will, again, another round of investment. Some of those things are capabilities, whether it's customer insights and marketing, whether it's new digital connections to customers, new models to innovate virtually and even a lot of organic growth. We have -- we kind of went light in organic growth projects in Animal Nutrition during 2020 because we were working on the synergies. And to be honest, because the COVID environment didn't allow for a lot of project work, and now we are going into more of that. 
So you're going to see 2021 being a little bit heavier investments in that -- in capabilities and plants. And we see -- some of these, you don't see because it's building the foundations. We are a science-based nutrition company. But you see, for example, in the quarter, we got 2 awards. We got the FiE award for innovation in pea protein, and we got the BIG Innovation Award for BPL1, one of our probiotics. 
So we continue to invest in science, in customer insights and in organic growth in this business as we harvest. And the harvesting, you see in how our ROIC continues to grow in that business. And you see that success of our value proposition in how the EBITDA margins continue to grow in our business. 
So we are very happy. But Eric, we are at the early stages of building the best nutrition company out there. We are probably halfway through that build."

Can you -- it seems to me when you just put all the numbers together on a global basis, we are not going to rebuild these global supplies in a single year.

As you said, corn and oilseeds, I think they're going to touch pipeline balance sheet. Wheat is a little bit stronger, but the Black Sea has not had a great wheat season, although Australia has a wheat growing season. So we see this is going to take 18 to 24 months for this supply-demand balances to be rebuilt. So we see these conditions subsisting for the next couple of years.

So if we think about the CapEx in general, that $900 million to maybe $1 billion, which is clearly up from what we saw in the last 2 years, could you give us a little bit of an understanding how you allocate or how you plan to allocate within that CapEx to the different segments?

But the Nutrition has a different OP to capital sensitivity than the other businesses. These projects are -- so sometimes, you have big projects like Campo Grande for specialty proteins. But the rest of the projects, if you think that the commodity business have maybe a multiplier of -- you need 5 units of CapEx to get 1 unit of OP, sometimes in Nutrition, you get the 1-on-1. So I think the issue is that because it's a smaller business, sometimes this investment, these efforts have a higher impact in their P&L because they need to carry as they grow and as they build a smaller business. 
But I would say, the Nutrition is not a heavy capital-intensive business. So when you hear me speaking about Animal Nutrition, organic growth projects, those are a small projects. They are not in the hundreds of millions of dollars type of projects. 
So I will say we continue to emphasize them, but it's not a heavy burden on the capital. That's why we're growing so fast, and we still are not forecasting north of $1 billion, even when we're doing 1ADM and all that. So I think it's a very affordable growth from a capital perspective."

You also need to remember in this equation, sugar prices are an all-time high. So in Brazil, you make a choice. So it's different than the U.S. In Brazil, you make a choice how much you make of sugar and ethanol. And of course, sugar prices are a big temptation this year. So we expect higher exports, and maybe we expect a little bit of less pressure from Brazil in that sense."

This morning, I'm pleased to share with you results that demonstrate an outstanding start to 2021, building on our momentum from a record 2020. We reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.39, more than double the year ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, 86% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted OP growth. 
Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9%, 375 basis points higher than our 2021 annual WACC and significantly higher than the 7.6% in the year ago period. And our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.2 billion, 19% higher than the prior year period. I'm proud of our team, and they continue to deliver sustained strong growth, powered by their continued advancement of the strategic transformation of our business, outstanding execution and excellent risk management and commitment to serving the evolving needs of our customers in new and innovative ways. I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of the trends, developments and accomplishments from the first quarter. 
Turn to Slide 4, please. First, we are encouraged by many of the demand indicators we are seeing. From a geographic perspective, China was one of the first countries to emerge from COVID-related restrictions, and we are continuing to see significant export demand driven by its economic recovery. In the U.S. meat production is strong as exports and retail sales remain robust and restaurant dining expands. Vaccine rollout has been slower in EMEA but is accelerating now. And so we're optimistic that demand will recover there as the year progresses. Of course, some countries like Brazil and India are still in the midst of the pandemic and demand there may be slower to come back. 
From a product perspective, expectation of a progressive recovery in global foodservice will support demand for sweeteners, flower and other ingredients in 2021. And we are seeing a strong demand for beverages, alternative proteins and nutritional supplements, including expected sales growth of 12% for plant protein ingredients this year. In summary, recovery from COVID and demand improvements are occurring at varying paces depending on geography and products. Complete recovery will extend over multiple years, but we are seeing clear trends that are favorable for our broad portfolio. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Another area in which we are seeing positive demand indications is ethanol in the U.S. About a year ago, we made the difficult decision to idle ethanol production at our dry mills in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Columbus, Nebraska. We committed that we will not restart those facilities until we saw economic and market factors that would point to a sustainable recovery. 
As we move through the winter and into spring, we saw industry inventories falling almost 10% during the quarter, ending almost 20% lower year-over-year on March 31; mobility and driving miles increasing as COVID-related restrictions eased with recent gasoline consumption getting closer to pre-pandemic levels; support from the EPA for the renewable fuel standard; and China resuming purchases of U.S. ethanol in the first half of 2021. With all of these factors supporting demand growth and improving industry margins, we decided to restart production. At the same time, we are continuing to work with interested parties to complete the monetization of our dry mill ethanol assets. 
From a portfolio management perspective, we're still committed to reducing our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol. And as demand continues to grow for the wide range of innovative alternative products that can come from natural sources like corn, we expect to see additional interest from other parties in both in biomaterials and sustainable aviation fuel. 
Slide 6, please. One of the ways we are meeting growing and evolving demand is by introducing new technologies and innovations across our value chain. In Q1, Our Kovanis joint venture celebrated the commercial launch of its revolutionary blockchain platform to modernize the global agriculture ocean shipping industry. Similarly, in the U.S. we've led an effort with industry partners to launch the Barge digital transformation project, which uses new technologies to replace outdated, inefficient processes on our in-line water ways. 
We're also innovating to meet the demand for sustainable solutions. Over the last year, as growth of e-commerce drove demand for packaging, our biosolutions team worked proactively with customers to apply our corn-based native and modified starches to help increase the number of times cardboard boxes can be recycled. In Europe, our animal nutrition teams are using life cycle analysis of the complete supply chain from crops and ingredients to final animal products like milk, eggs and meat to help develop new feed supplements that improve animal health and reduce environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions. 
We're also continuing to innovate to improve the customer experience. Last year, as travel was restricted We launched new technologies designed to take our customers on collaborative virtual journeys that allowed us to share consumer insights, emerging trends and product solution opportunities including real-time tasting. Now as parts of the world reopen, we are continuing to expand our innovating customer capabilities. 
In March, we opened our completely renovated customer innovation center in Beijing, expanding our ability to support technical innovation and creation. And earlier this month, we were proud to celebrate the opening of the new cutting-edge plant-based customer innovation lab at our research hub in Singapore. These new facilities will propel our abilities to work with customers to create tailor-made solutions to meet evolving and growing consumer needs in the region. 
Slide 7, please. Finally, I want to speak about the very important issue of sustainability. Our commitment to sustainability expands our value chain. It includes our work with growers to implement responsible farming practices, including the 13 million acres we've enrolled in sustainable farming programs globally in recent years. It encompasses our Strive 35 goals to reduce the environmental impact of our processing operations, exemplified by the recent announcement of our partnership to help advance the proposed revolutionary zero emission power facility utilizing our carbon capture and storage facility adjacent to our operations indicator Elena. Sustainability is a key driver of our expanding portfolio of environmentally responsible plan derived products and our efforts to reduce hunger and support the communities in which we live and work. 
One critical pillar of our sustainability work for us and our customers is increasing the traceability of our supply chain. We joined the Brazilian soy moratorium in 2006. And in 2015, we introduced our first comprehensive no deforestation policy. Since then, we made impressive progress, including achieving 99% traceability to mill in our farms around supply chain and full traceability to farm for direct suppliers in 25 key municipalities in the Brazilian Cerrado. 
Now we are taking our efforts to a new level. Last month, we announced our new policy to protect forests, biodiversity and communities. As part of this ambitious plan, we aim to achieve full traceability throughout our direct and indirect South American soy supply chains by 2022 and have deforestation-free supply chains around the world by 2030. 
I'm proud of the work our team is doing to deliver on our sustainability commitments and capabilities. We know they are a key driver of consumer decisions and business success. But more importantly, they are one of the ways in which we are living up to our purpose and enriching the quality of life around the world. 
I'll come back later to talk about the next steps in our journey and our strategy. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Ray, who will take us through our business performance. Ray?"

Good morning, everyone. Slide 8, please. The ag services and weld feeds team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. Ag Services results were substantially hig",1110,"Yes. Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. Slide 8, please. The ag services and weld feeds team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. 
Ag Services results were substantially higher year-over-year. Results were driven by a record Q1 for our North American origination team, which executed extremely well to capitalize on strong Chinese demand. As expected, results in South America were significantly lower versus the prior year period. Farmer selling was lower versus the extremely aggressive pace in the year ago quarter. Lower margins, including the impacts from the slightly delayed harvest and higher freight costs also affected South American results. Results for the quarter were affected by about $75 million in negative timing related to ocean freight position. Those impacts will reverse as contracts execute in the coming quarters. 
Crushing delivered its best quarter ever as the business leverage its global footprint and diversified capabilities to capture strong execution margins in both soybean and softseed crushing, driven by robust vegetable oil demand and tight soybean stocks. Net timing impacts for the quarter in crush were minimal. 
Refined products and other results were higher year-over-year. While overall volumes were down due to pandemic impacts, margins were stronger in both North America and EMEA, refined oils. Global biodiesel results were lower year-over-year. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the prior year period. 
Looking ahead, we now expect full year calendar year results for Ag Services and royalties to be higher than the record 2020, with a particularly strong fourth quarter driven by potentially record global demand for North American agricultural products. For the second quarter, we expect results to be slightly stronger than the second quarter of 2020, but significantly lower than the record first quarter of 2021 with stronger crushing and RPO expectations compared to the second quarter of 2020, offsetting seasonably lower Ag Service results. 
Slide 9, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team again delivered significant year-over-year profit growth. Our Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes the wet mill ethanol production, achieved significantly higher results versus the first quarter of 2020. The business managed risks exceptionally well, capitalizing on rising prices in the ethanol complex and favorable coal product values in an industry environment of improving margins and falling inventories. Corn oil results were significantly higher than the previous year, which have been impacted by substantial mark-to-market effects. 
In general, though demand for sweeteners and flour by the foodservice sector remained below the prior year, there were signs of acceleration in the month of March. Starch sales volumes remained solid on demand from industrial applications like packaging materials. 
Vantage Corn Processor results were substantially higher, driven by improved margins on the distribution of fuel ethanol and strong performance in USP-grade industrial alcohol. 
Looking ahead, second quarter results for copper hydra solutions are expected to be in line with this first quarter of 2021, which would represent a significant year-over-year profit growth driven by the improved ethanol market environment, including the restart of our 2 VCP dry mills and the recovery of the Foodservice segment. 
Slide 10, please. The Nutrition team delivered 5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis and solid year-over-year operating profit growth. Human Nutrition results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter. Flavors had an exceptional quarter, driven by strong sales across various market segments, especially beverages. Favorable product mix in North America, improved margins in EMEA and accelerated income from a customer agreement also contributed to results, partially offset by certain specific expenses. 
Specialty and Greens results were lower primarily driven by demand factors, including the effect of pantry loading in the previous year quarter and shifts in demand for texturants. Health and Wellness had a strong start to the year, with robust demand for nutritional products driving higher results in probiotics and fibers. Animal Nutrition results were lower versus the first quarter of 2020 driven primarily by lower demand and higher input costs as a result of pandemic effects, primarily in South America. This was partially offset by favorable results in amino acids, driven by improved product mix. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong demand for flavors and proteins and improving demand for our animal nutrition products as restrictions ease to drive second quarter results that will be significantly higher than the prior year quarter, supporting the 15% per annum trend growth rate for the calendar year. 
Slide 11, please. Let me finish up with a few observations from the Other Segment as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were lower than the prior year quarter, driven by lower captive insurance underwriting results, partially offset by more favorable ADM Investor Services earnings. For the quarter, there were about $0.17 per share of adjusted items for EPS purposes, which are referenced in Slide 24 in the appendix. 
These adjustment items included. One, the settlement of the class action lawsuit against Golden Peanut to avoid the rising cost of a prolonged litigation, in a case in which we did not believe we violate any laws. Two, impairments and restructuring costs related to the exit of certain noncore product lines and inefficient assets in nutrition. And three, mark-to-market on the embedded option in the Wilmar exchangeable bond. 
In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of about $200 million were slightly higher year-over-year due primarily to our continued investments in IT and business transformation and transfers of costs from the business segments into the centralized centers of expertise in supply chain and operations. We are still on track for calendar year corporate unallocated costs to be overall similar to 2020. 
As expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased from the year-over-year period on lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was -- first quarter of 2021 was approximately 16% compared to the benefit of 4% in the prior year. We still anticipate our calendar year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. 
Our balance sheet remains solid despite the higher commodity price environment with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 33% and available liquidity of $7.7 billion. As part of our active management for pension liabilities, we did close on another U.S. pension liability transfer transaction on April 1 with about $0.7 billion of liabilities transferred to the U.S. insurance market. This effectively reduces our U.S. pension liabilities by close to 40% and will result in the U.S. pension plans more or less fully funded from a projected benefit obligation perspective. With that, I'll turn it back to Juan."

And I'm even more proud of the strategic work we have done to transform our company and enable our growing success. We began in 2011 by committing to specific strategic goals and financial metrics focused on what we call the 3 Cs: capital discipline, cost reduction and cash generation. 
We launched new initiatives like our $1 billion challenge with prioritized operational excellence, and we focused on returns as our primary financial metric. We call that getting fit for the journey. Once we were fit, we launch the next part of our strategy, focusing on 3 core pillars to enhance returns: deliver more predictable growth and strengthen our ability to control our results. 
During this time, our team has done a great job optimizing business performance, realigning our portfolio and building a global leader in nutrition, driving efficiencies through our operational excellence initiatives and expanding through organic growth investments, M&A and the broadening of our customer base and product offerings. 
Now we're moving into the next phase of our strategic transformation by sharpening our focus on 2 strategic pillars: productivity and innovation. Our productivity efforts will take many actions that were part of our optimized and drive focuses and boost them to the next level. The productivity pillar will include: advancing the roles of our centers of excellence or COEs in procurement, supply chain and operations to deliver additional efficiencies across the enterprise; the continued rollout of our One ADM business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes; and increasing our use of technology, analytics and automation at our production facilities in our offices and with our customers. 
Our innovation activities will help us accelerate growth and profitability, not just for the near term, but importantly, for the long term. We will expand and invest in improving the customer experience including leveraging our producer relationships and enhancing our use of state-of-the-art digital technology to help our customers grow; sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of our products, solutions, capabilities and commitments to serve our customers' needs; and growth initiatives, including organic growth to support additional capacity and meet growing demand, opportunistic M&A and increased leveraging of our very successful venture capital portfolio. 
We'll support both pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding our digital capabilities and investing further in product research and development. And of course, all of our efforts will continue to be strengthened by our ongoing commitment to revenues. 
As I look at our long-term plans and this evolution of our strategy, I'm very excited about the value creation opportunities ahead of us. Our teams are continuing to perform at the high level and doing a great job serving our customers. The demand outlook for our products is strong, driven by the pre and during global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. And we are delivering on our potential and our promise. That is why we are even more optimistic in our 2021 outlook today than we were 3 months ago, with expectations for significantly higher full year operating profit and EPS versus our record 2020. 
And as we look beyond 2021, we expect that our sharpened focus on productivity and innovation, combined with continuing demand expansion driven by the fundamental needs and evolving demands of our global customers and the multiyear COVID recovery will deliver sustained growth in earnings in the years to come. With that, Chris, please open the line for questions."

And we've been executing a similar plan. So now you're going to see it strengthen. And it has a more longer horizon reach, if you will, that's where we like about this sharpening. 
But all this is in the -- as supported by these 3 strong trends that we see in food security, health and well-being and sustainability. So let me give you a little bit of flavor there. We continue to see strong demand. You see food security, of course, as the global population grows. Protein demand continues to grow around the world as people increase their standards of living. And as countries come back from the pandemic on this demand that was, to a certain degree, suppressed. We see that in China, we see that in the U.S. And we believe that given the uneven vaccine recovery of vaccine rollout, this will take several years. So that's in an environment, Ken, as you know, a very tight supply/demand balances. So we expect an environment of good profits for the following years. 
Then when we look at health and well-being, that's propelling our Nutrition division and many of our other offerings in which we continue to see strong growth even exacerbated, if you will, with pandemics or other events. And we continue to see more demand for products made based on plans that what we call biosolutions, products that actually replace industrial products made from resources that are not renewable. We have a long list of interested parties in doing more of that and we continue to develop solutions for that. So again, when we see the trends, when we see the strong demand environment in a tight supply demand environment, plus the agenda of productivity and innovation, we feel very strong about our ability to deliver earnings growth from where we are today."

And as we think about, one, you can sort of see it already in the soybean oil market and what that's doing to crush margins. But as we think about the second half of the year into next year as some of the bigger capacities start to come on, how do we think about the earnings leverage, both in your crushing franchise, but also in the edible oils business with the refining that we -- a business that never really got that much attention hasn't grown much for a number of years given the move away from Transcat, but would seem to be kind of very strategic for a bunch of refiners who don't have pretreatment over the next couple of years?

The oil story, I mean, you can see that right now playing up, oil values that reach record levels, softseed margins that been the best in the last 8 years, if you will. So they are supporting very good soy crush margins and great softseed margins. We invested in this many years ago, remember, with all the switch capacity. We have about, give or take, 15% of our total crush capacity that can be switched from soybeans to softseed. So that's an advantage for us. And now all of a sudden, we are having this new demand that is coming because of all the sustainability trends that we discussed before with this in the form of renewable green diesel. So it just comes to strengthen our belief into this business that is very strategic for us.

And I'm just trying to think about kind of cash capital deployment from here. Obviously, you have to be very sensitive to the increase in commodity prices and the impact that has on readily marketable inventories. But I mean impressively, your credit capacity has actually gone up on a year-on-year basis despite the rising in RMI. And so I'm just trying to think about what would it take to see cash return to shareholders or more aggressive or offensive M&A moving forward? It seems like there's a lot of underlying cash generation in the business, and it doesn't seem like we've got a clear kind of target of where it's going at the moment."

And while inventories have actually increased 50% compared to March of last year, we still have significant available credit capacity to undertake actions, right? And so I think the first priority is continue to fund the working capital needs. It's not a surprise. Commodity prices continue to go up right now. And so therefore, we will use our balance sheet to kind of fund additional working capital requirements. And -- but secondly, we have flexibility to do whatever we need to do from a strategic perspective. As you know, in prior periods, during higher commodity prices, there are distressed assets in the marketplace. And so to the extent that there are distressed assets that make sense for us to acquire in order to consolidate, we'll look at those. That's one of the big advantages of our ADM balance sheet. 
So -- but we all know that eventually commodity prices will come down, and that will free up additional capital on the balance sheet. And then we can look at additional incremental returns on capital to our shareholders at that point in time. But again, the dividend, we've increased the dividend. That's an important element of return on capital to our shareholders. But I'm convinced that our balance sheet -- because we all know prices go through cycles, there will be a release of working capital at some juncture that will again free up significant capacity for us to take additional return of capital actions."

I would say we see -- as I said before, we have reasonable visibility into Q2 given the book of business we have. So we shouldn't see any surprises there, and we are expecting another good quarter of crush over there. So I mentioned before, we have our switch capacity. Softseed margins have been good.

And hence, we benefit from basically a very good procurement. And hence, net corn was a tailwind for us despite the fact that when you look at the board, corn costs are higher right now. 
With respect to the question on  disaggregating start us some sweeteners from ethanol. My only comment is one of the big improvements in starch and sweeteners in the quarter compared to last quarter, last year's first quarter was the fact that we didn't have the corn oil mark-to-market impact. If you recall last year, we had about a $50 million negative impact due to the corn oil divergence from soybean oil. We didn't have it this year. So that was clearly a tailwind in terms of our results. 
From a volume perspective, When you look at the Starches and Sweetener business right now, we're still -- I'm looking at corn -- high fructose corn syrup. In corn syrup, we're still down versus last year. So we are suffering from the impact of the pandemic and because the foodservice sector is not fully recovered. We indicated that we're starting to see elements of recovery in the month of March. But from a volume perspective, in the first quarter, total sweetener volumes are still down versus last year, right? So therefore, that's kind of like a headwind. But we expect that to progressively recover as we move through the year. 
So I guess, overall, I mean, we've been actually pretty pleased in terms of the performance. Given this particular headwind we had in the first quarter, we were very pleased in terms of how we manage the business, favorable net corn procurement, fab risk management. And frankly, even with the cold weather impacts that we had in the first quarter, we were able to keep on delivering to our customers, which is very, very important."

And they continue to have very strong forecast for the importation of grains to feed animals. So that's what we're seeing. Of course, corn prices have been expensive in China. And so China has been taking as much as wheat as they can from Europe to try to make a little bit of substitution. But they also don't have infinite wheat reserves.

I think that, of course, the farmer react to pricing. And although this may be too late to shift a lot of acres to corn given how late we are already, I think, first of all, they will try to plant as much as possible next year as well, given prices will continue to be elevated. I think, listen, as it gets tied the market, that's an advantage of our value chain. Our procurement, our long value chain, the fact that we have such a good coverage of everywhere. In a tight market, that's where our footprint shines and we get the competitive advantage, if you will. So we like to have more crops. But in periods in which crops are going to be tied, we have a good system to make sure we get our hands into the crops. And because of sometimes basis go up. But to be honest, given the strong demand and the good profitability of our customers, I think we will be able to price those in. So I think that we are looking constructively about in terms of margins for the future."

Two quick ones. So first of all, you gave a little bit of guidance into the different segments, but Could you elaborate first on the Ag Service piece within ASO, how you think about that turning into 2Q and particularly in light what we're seeing in your appendix on the cumulative crush deferred timing gains? Because I remember last call, you said the vast majority of the close to $300 million to likely reverse within the first half. And we haven't seen much in 1Q. So how do we think -- shall we think about those timing gains? And how shall we think about the underlying business within Ag Service in particular over the second quarter?"

I mean North America, we had a very strong Q1 in terms of North American exports. Again, partly as Juan indicated, a delayed South American harvest. It allowed the export window in North America to really benefit. And then we just had significant demand pull, which resulted in very strong elevation margins in the first quarter. So second quarter for Ag Services, it will revert back to more of a normal level here. The demand environment is still good, but it's not going to be as stellar as what we saw in the first quarter. 
On your question on timing differences, remember, this is a question, right? I mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's about $75 million related to global trade and ocean freight, that will reverse over the course of the year. In the appendix, the timing effects referred to in the appendix are related to crush. 
And just a reminder, in the first quarter, we didn't see much of a reversal in the first quarter despite the fact that we had at the end of 2020, about $295 million in timing effects. And the reason being is that while we're seeing some reversals occurring, we're also building up new timing effects. Because as you know, cash crush remains extremely strong. So some of the new contracts we're putting on, we're actually creating new timing effects. And so I just want to just kind of caution people that in this type of environment, even though there's about like $265 million of timing effects yet to unwind because of new timing effects that will likely occur over the course of the year, we may not see the full unwind occurred this year. So that's just my only caution I want to provide listeners to the call on these timing effects."

This morning, I'm pleased to share with you results that demonstrate an outstanding start to 2021, building on our momentum from a record 2020. We reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.39, more than double the year ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, 86% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted OP growth. 
Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9%, 375 basis points higher than our 2021 annual WACC and significantly higher than the 7.6% in the year ago period. And our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.2 billion, 19% higher than the prior year period. I'm proud of our team, and they continue to deliver sustained strong growth, powered by their continued advancement of the strategic transformation of our business, outstanding execution and excellent risk management and commitment to serving the evolving needs of our customers in new and innovative ways. I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of the trends, developments and accomplishments from the first quarter. 
Turn to Slide 4, please. First, we are encouraged by many of the demand indicators we are seeing. From a geographic perspective, China was one of the first countries to emerge from COVID-related restrictions, and we are continuing to see significant export demand driven by its economic recovery. In the U.S. meat production is strong as exports and retail sales remain robust and restaurant dining expands. Vaccine rollout has been slower in EMEA but is accelerating now. And so we're optimistic that demand will recover there as the year progresses. Of course, some countries like Brazil and India are still in the midst of the pandemic and demand there may be slower to come back. 
From a product perspective, expectation of a progressive recovery in global foodservice will support demand for sweeteners, flower and other ingredients in 2021. And we are seeing a strong demand for beverages, alternative proteins and nutritional supplements, including expected sales growth of 12% for plant protein ingredients this year. In summary, recovery from COVID and demand improvements are occurring at varying paces depending on geography and products. Complete recovery will extend over multiple years, but we are seeing clear trends that are favorable for our broad portfolio. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Another area in which we are seeing positive demand indications is ethanol in the U.S. About a year ago, we made the difficult decision to idle ethanol production at our dry mills in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Columbus, Nebraska. We committed that we will not restart those facilities until we saw economic and market factors that would point to a sustainable recovery. 
As we move through the winter and into spring, we saw industry inventories falling almost 10% during the quarter, ending almost 20% lower year-over-year on March 31; mobility and driving miles increasing as COVID-related restrictions eased with recent gasoline consumption getting closer to pre-pandemic levels; support from the EPA for the renewable fuel standard; and China resuming purchases of U.S. ethanol in the first half of 2021. With all of these factors supporting demand growth and improving industry margins, we decided to restart production. At the same time, we are continuing to work with interested parties to complete the monetization of our dry mill ethanol assets. 
From a portfolio management perspective, we're still committed to reducing our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol. And as demand continues to grow for the wide range of innovative alternative products that can come from natural sources like corn, we expect to see additional interest from other parties in both in biomaterials and sustainable aviation fuel. 
Slide 6, please. One of the ways we are meeting growing and evolving demand is by introducing new technologies and innovations across our value chain. In Q1, Our Kovanis joint venture celebrated the commercial launch of its revolutionary blockchain platform to modernize the global agriculture ocean shipping industry. Similarly, in the U.S. we've led an effort with industry partners to launch the Barge digital transformation project, which uses new technologies to replace outdated, inefficient processes on our in-line water ways. 
We're also innovating to meet the demand for sustainable solutions. Over the last year, as growth of e-commerce drove demand for packaging, our biosolutions team worked proactively with customers to apply our corn-based native and modified starches to help increase the number of times cardboard boxes can be recycled. In Europe, our animal nutrition teams are using life cycle analysis of the complete supply chain from crops and ingredients to final animal products like milk, eggs and meat to help develop new feed supplements that improve animal health and reduce environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions. 
We're also continuing to innovate to improve the customer experience. Last year, as travel was restricted We launched new technologies designed to take our customers on collaborative virtual journeys that allowed us to share consumer insights, emerging trends and product solution opportunities including real-time tasting. Now as parts of the world reopen, we are continuing to expand our innovating customer capabilities. 
In March, we opened our completely renovated customer innovation center in Beijing, expanding our ability to support technical innovation and creation. And earlier this month, we were proud to celebrate the opening of the new cutting-edge plant-based customer innovation lab at our research hub in Singapore. These new facilities will propel our abilities to work with customers to create tailor-made solutions to meet evolving and growing consumer needs in the region. 
Slide 7, please. Finally, I want to speak about the very important issue of sustainability. Our commitment to sustainability expands our value chain. It includes our work with growers to implement responsible farming practices, including the 13 million acres we've enrolled in sustainable farming programs globally in recent years. It encompasses our Strive 35 goals to reduce the environmental impact of our processing operations, exemplified by the recent announcement of our partnership to help advance the proposed revolutionary zero emission power facility utilizing our carbon capture and storage facility adjacent to our operations indicator Elena. Sustainability is a key driver of our expanding portfolio of environmentally responsible plan derived products and our efforts to reduce hunger and support the communities in which we live and work. 
One critical pillar of our sustainability work for us and our customers is increasing the traceability of our supply chain. We joined the Brazilian soy moratorium in 2006. And in 2015, we introduced our first comprehensive no deforestation policy. Since then, we made impressive progress, including achieving 99% traceability to mill in our farms around supply chain and full traceability to farm for direct suppliers in 25 key municipalities in the Brazilian Cerrado. 
Now we are taking our efforts to a new level. Last month, we announced our new policy to protect forests, biodiversity and communities. As part of this ambitious plan, we aim to achieve full traceability throughout our direct and indirect South American soy supply chains by 2022 and have deforestation-free supply chains around the world by 2030. 
I'm proud of the work our team is doing to deliver on our sustainability commitments and capabilities. We know they are a key driver of consumer decisions and business success. But more importantly, they are one of the ways in which we are living up to our purpose and enriching the quality of life around the world. 
I'll come back later to talk about the next steps in our journey and our strategy. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Ray, who will take us through our business performance. Ray?"

Ag Services results were substantially hig",1110,"Yes. Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. Slide 8, please. The ag services and weld feeds team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. 
Ag Services results were substantially higher year-over-year. Results were driven by a record Q1 for our North American origination team, which executed extremely well to capitalize on strong Chinese demand. As expected, results in South America were significantly lower versus the prior year period. Farmer selling was lower versus the extremely aggressive pace in the year ago quarter. Lower margins, including the impacts from the slightly delayed harvest and higher freight costs also affected South American results. Results for the quarter were affected by about $75 million in negative timing related to ocean freight position. Those impacts will reverse as contracts execute in the coming quarters. 
Crushing delivered its best quarter ever as the business leverage its global footprint and diversified capabilities to capture strong execution margins in both soybean and softseed crushing, driven by robust vegetable oil demand and tight soybean stocks. Net timing impacts for the quarter in crush were minimal. 
Refined products and other results were higher year-over-year. While overall volumes were down due to pandemic impacts, margins were stronger in both North America and EMEA, refined oils. Global biodiesel results were lower year-over-year. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the prior year period. 
Looking ahead, we now expect full year calendar year results for Ag Services and royalties to be higher than the record 2020, with a particularly strong fourth quarter driven by potentially record global demand for North American agricultural products. For the second quarter, we expect results to be slightly stronger than the second quarter of 2020, but significantly lower than the record first quarter of 2021 with stronger crushing and RPO expectations compared to the second quarter of 2020, offsetting seasonably lower Ag Service results. 
Slide 9, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team again delivered significant year-over-year profit growth. Our Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes the wet mill ethanol production, achieved significantly higher results versus the first quarter of 2020. The business managed risks exceptionally well, capitalizing on rising prices in the ethanol complex and favorable coal product values in an industry environment of improving margins and falling inventories. Corn oil results were significantly higher than the previous year, which have been impacted by substantial mark-to-market effects. 
In general, though demand for sweeteners and flour by the foodservice sector remained below the prior year, there were signs of acceleration in the month of March. Starch sales volumes remained solid on demand from industrial applications like packaging materials. 
Vantage Corn Processor results were substantially higher, driven by improved margins on the distribution of fuel ethanol and strong performance in USP-grade industrial alcohol. 
Looking ahead, second quarter results for copper hydra solutions are expected to be in line with this first quarter of 2021, which would represent a significant year-over-year profit growth driven by the improved ethanol market environment, including the restart of our 2 VCP dry mills and the recovery of the Foodservice segment. 
Slide 10, please. The Nutrition team delivered 5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis and solid year-over-year operating profit growth. Human Nutrition results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter. Flavors had an exceptional quarter, driven by strong sales across various market segments, especially beverages. Favorable product mix in North America, improved margins in EMEA and accelerated income from a customer agreement also contributed to results, partially offset by certain specific expenses. 
Specialty and Greens results were lower primarily driven by demand factors, including the effect of pantry loading in the previous year quarter and shifts in demand for texturants. Health and Wellness had a strong start to the year, with robust demand for nutritional products driving higher results in probiotics and fibers. Animal Nutrition results were lower versus the first quarter of 2020 driven primarily by lower demand and higher input costs as a result of pandemic effects, primarily in South America. This was partially offset by favorable results in amino acids, driven by improved product mix. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong demand for flavors and proteins and improving demand for our animal nutrition products as restrictions ease to drive second quarter results that will be significantly higher than the prior year quarter, supporting the 15% per annum trend growth rate for the calendar year. 
Slide 11, please. Let me finish up with a few observations from the Other Segment as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were lower than the prior year quarter, driven by lower captive insurance underwriting results, partially offset by more favorable ADM Investor Services earnings. For the quarter, there were about $0.17 per share of adjusted items for EPS purposes, which are referenced in Slide 24 in the appendix. 
These adjustment items included. One, the settlement of the class action lawsuit against Golden Peanut to avoid the rising cost of a prolonged litigation, in a case in which we did not believe we violate any laws. Two, impairments and restructuring costs related to the exit of certain noncore product lines and inefficient assets in nutrition. And three, mark-to-market on the embedded option in the Wilmar exchangeable bond. 
In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of about $200 million were slightly higher year-over-year due primarily to our continued investments in IT and business transformation and transfers of costs from the business segments into the centralized centers of expertise in supply chain and operations. We are still on track for calendar year corporate unallocated costs to be overall similar to 2020. 
As expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased from the year-over-year period on lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was -- first quarter of 2021 was approximately 16% compared to the benefit of 4% in the prior year. We still anticipate our calendar year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. 
Our balance sheet remains solid despite the higher commodity price environment with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 33% and available liquidity of $7.7 billion. As part of our active management for pension liabilities, we did close on another U.S. pension liability transfer transaction on April 1 with about $0.7 billion of liabilities transferred to the U.S. insurance market. This effectively reduces our U.S. pension liabilities by close to 40% and will result in the U.S. pension plans more or less fully funded from a projected benefit obligation perspective. With that, I'll turn it back to Juan."

And I'm even more proud of the strategic work we have done to transform our company and enable our growing success. We began in 2011 by committing to specific strategic goals and financial metrics focused on what we call the 3 Cs: capital discipline, cost reduction and cash generation. 
We launched new initiatives like our $1 billion challenge with prioritized operational excellence, and we focused on returns as our primary financial metric. We call that getting fit for the journey. Once we were fit, we launch the next part of our strategy, focusing on 3 core pillars to enhance returns: deliver more predictable growth and strengthen our ability to control our results. 
During this time, our team has done a great job optimizing business performance, realigning our portfolio and building a global leader in nutrition, driving efficiencies through our operational excellence initiatives and expanding through organic growth investments, M&A and the broadening of our customer base and product offerings. 
Now we're moving into the next phase of our strategic transformation by sharpening our focus on 2 strategic pillars: productivity and innovation. Our productivity efforts will take many actions that were part of our optimized and drive focuses and boost them to the next level. The productivity pillar will include: advancing the roles of our centers of excellence or COEs in procurement, supply chain and operations to deliver additional efficiencies across the enterprise; the continued rollout of our One ADM business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes; and increasing our use of technology, analytics and automation at our production facilities in our offices and with our customers. 
Our innovation activities will help us accelerate growth and profitability, not just for the near term, but importantly, for the long term. We will expand and invest in improving the customer experience including leveraging our producer relationships and enhancing our use of state-of-the-art digital technology to help our customers grow; sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of our products, solutions, capabilities and commitments to serve our customers' needs; and growth initiatives, including organic growth to support additional capacity and meet growing demand, opportunistic M&A and increased leveraging of our very successful venture capital portfolio. 
We'll support both pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding our digital capabilities and investing further in product research and development. And of course, all of our efforts will continue to be strengthened by our ongoing commitment to revenues. 
As I look at our long-term plans and this evolution of our strategy, I'm very excited about the value creation opportunities ahead of us. Our teams are continuing to perform at the high level and doing a great job serving our customers. The demand outlook for our products is strong, driven by the pre and during global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. And we are delivering on our potential and our promise. That is why we are even more optimistic in our 2021 outlook today than we were 3 months ago, with expectations for significantly higher full year operating profit and EPS versus our record 2020. 
And as we look beyond 2021, we expect that our sharpened focus on productivity and innovation, combined with continuing demand expansion driven by the fundamental needs and evolving demands of our global customers and the multiyear COVID recovery will deliver sustained growth in earnings in the years to come. With that, Chris, please open the line for questions."

And we've been executing a similar plan. So now you're going to see it strengthen. And it has a more longer horizon reach, if you will, that's where we like about this sharpening. 
But all this is in the -- as supported by these 3 strong trends that we see in food security, health and well-being and sustainability. So let me give you a little bit of flavor there. We continue to see strong demand. You see food security, of course, as the global population grows. Protein demand continues to grow around the world as people increase their standards of living. And as countries come back from the pandemic on this demand that was, to a certain degree, suppressed. We see that in China, we see that in the U.S. And we believe that given the uneven vaccine recovery of vaccine rollout, this will take several years. So that's in an environment, Ken, as you know, a very tight supply/demand balances. So we expect an environment of good profits for the following years. 
Then when we look at health and well-being, that's propelling our Nutrition division and many of our other offerings in which we continue to see strong growth even exacerbated, if you will, with pandemics or other events. And we continue to see more demand for products made based on plans that what we call biosolutions, products that actually replace industrial products made from resources that are not renewable. We have a long list of interested parties in doing more of that and we continue to develop solutions for that. So again, when we see the trends, when we see the strong demand environment in a tight supply demand environment, plus the agenda of productivity and innovation, we feel very strong about our ability to deliver earnings growth from where we are today."

Specifically, I want to think about on the oilseed franchise and the expansion of renewable diesel. And as we think about, one, you can sort of see it already in the soybean oil market and what that's doing to crush margins. But as we think about the second half of the year into next year as some of the bigger capacities start to come on, how do we think about the earnings leverage, both in your crushing franchise, but also in the edible oils business with the refining that we -- a business that never really got that much attention hasn't grown much for a number of years given the move away from Transcat, but would seem to be kind of very strategic for a bunch of refiners who don't have pretreatment over the next couple of years?

The oil story, I mean, you can see that right now playing up, oil values that reach record levels, softseed margins that been the best in the last 8 years, if you will. So they are supporting very good soy crush margins and great softseed margins. We invested in this many years ago, remember, with all the switch capacity. We have about, give or take, 15% of our total crush capacity that can be switched from soybeans to softseed. So that's an advantage for us. And now all of a sudden, we are having this new demand that is coming because of all the sustainability trends that we discussed before with this in the form of renewable green diesel. So it just comes to strengthen our belief into this business that is very strategic for us. 
And to be honest, very proud of the way the business is executing. These are not easy markets to navigate, with a lot of volatility, with very big values, and they are having touch wood and impeccable run. And they've done very well, given their sophistication and knowledge of -- and to be honest, also the visibility that being a full value chain supplier and a global supplier gives us.

And while inventories have actually increased 50% compared to March of last year, we still have significant available credit capacity to undertake actions, right? And so I think the first priority is continue to fund the working capital needs. It's not a surprise. Commodity prices continue to go up right now. And so therefore, we will use our balance sheet to kind of fund additional working capital requirements. And -- but secondly, we have flexibility to do whatever we need to do from a strategic perspective. As you know, in prior periods, during higher commodity prices, there are distressed assets in the marketplace. And so to the extent that there are distressed assets that make sense for us to acquire in order to consolidate, we'll look at those. That's one of the big advantages of our ADM balance sheet. 
So -- but we all know that eventually commodity prices will come down, and that will free up additional capital on the balance sheet. And then we can look at additional incremental returns on capital to our shareholders at that point in time. But again, the dividend, we've increased the dividend. That's an important element of return on capital to our shareholders. But I'm convinced that our balance sheet -- because we all know prices go through cycles, there will be a release of working capital at some juncture that will again free up significant capacity for us to take additional return of capital actions."

I would say we see -- as I said before, we have reasonable visibility into Q2 given the book of business we have. So we shouldn't see any surprises there, and we are expecting another good quarter of crush over there. So I mentioned before, we have our switch capacity. Softseed margins have been good.

I mean clearly, as we pointed out in the last earnings call, we actually procured a lot of our requirements at a very attractive price last year. And hence, we benefit from basically a very good procurement. And hence, net corn was a tailwind for us despite the fact that when you look at the board, corn costs are higher right now. 
With respect to the question on  disaggregating start us some sweeteners from ethanol. My only comment is one of the big improvements in starch and sweeteners in the quarter compared to last quarter, last year's first quarter was the fact that we didn't have the corn oil mark-to-market impact. If you recall last year, we had about a $50 million negative impact due to the corn oil divergence from soybean oil. We didn't have it this year. So that was clearly a tailwind in terms of our results. 
From a volume perspective, When you look at the Starches and Sweetener business right now, we're still -- I'm looking at corn -- high fructose corn syrup. In corn syrup, we're still down versus last year. So we are suffering from the impact of the pandemic and because the foodservice sector is not fully recovered. We indicated that we're starting to see elements of recovery in the month of March. But from a volume perspective, in the first quarter, total sweetener volumes are still down versus last year, right? So therefore, that's kind of like a headwind. But we expect that to progressively recover as we move through the year. 
So I guess, overall, I mean, we've been actually pretty pleased in terms of the performance. Given this particular headwind we had in the first quarter, we were very pleased in terms of how we manage the business, favorable net corn procurement, fab risk management. And frankly, even with the cold weather impacts that we had in the first quarter, we were able to keep on delivering to our customers, which is very, very important."

the data has grown in the first 3 months of the year. There are import of proteins, that's up like 20%. And they continue to have very strong forecast for the importation of grains to feed animals. So that's what we're seeing. Of course, corn prices have been expensive in China. And so China has been taking as much as wheat as they can from Europe to try to make a little bit of substitution. But they also don't have infinite wheat reserves. And during this year, we think that both coal reserves and wheat reserve needs to be replenished at one point in time.

South America, the weather in South America, of course, delayed a little bit the crop, and certainly, it's hurting a little bit the safrinha. We still expect -- traditionally, April and May are dry weather months in Brazil. So that's not great for this, and that's what putting a little bit of the premium in the weather premium on corn. So we expect that crop to be a little bit smaller. And Brazil exports about 35% of their corn production. So that is an impact in the market. 
What are we rooting for? We are rooting for larger crops. We like to move crops. So the soy crop is expected to be a good one, maybe 135 million, 136 million tons. So that's in check. And I think what Brazil is doing at the moment is maybe getting a little bit of corn from Argentina. Certainly, it's getting wheat to try to replace some of the corn in feeding. Because adjusted, as I said before, the B13 biodiesel to B10. So it's a year in which Brazil needs to navigate with -- on very tight stocks.

I mean North America, we had a very strong Q1 in terms of North American exports. Again, partly as Juan indicated, a delayed South American harvest. It allowed the export window in North America to really benefit. And then we just had significant demand pull, which resulted in very strong elevation margins in the first quarter. So second quarter for Ag Services, it will revert back to more of a normal level here. The demand environment is still good, but it's not going to be as stellar as what we saw in the first quarter. 
On your question on timing differences, remember, this is a question, right? I mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's about $75 million related to global trade and ocean freight, that will reverse over the course of the year. In the appendix, the timing effects referred to in the appendix are related to crush. 
And just a reminder, in the first quarter, we didn't see much of a reversal in the first quarter despite the fact that we had at the end of 2020, about $295 million in timing effects. And the reason being is that while we're seeing some reversals occurring, we're also building up new timing effects. Because as you know, cash crush remains extremely strong. So some of the new contracts we're putting on, we're actually creating new timing effects. And so I just want to just kind of caution people that in this type of environment, even though there's about like $265 million of timing effects yet to unwind because of new timing effects that will likely occur over the course of the year, we may not see the full unwind occurred this year. So that's just my only caution I want to provide listeners to the call on these timing effects."

China continues to be buying everything they can. They are buying corn, but they're buying wheat, as I said before, from several places. And we have certain weather spots in the world. Canada and France are too cold and too dry, that has put some pressure on wheat with all this demand. Australia's infrastructure is trying to recover from the cyclone. So the exportability of wheat there is also a little bit limited for loading, that has created some pressure. So for the moment, corn continues to be competitive. The U.S. is exporting corn. But very soon, it will become landed in China, a little bit more expensive than wheat. But then we're getting tighter because of the bad weather. So we are looking at all those dynamics.

We have, at the moment, maybe 25% of acres doing precision agriculture, which I think will increase yield without needing more land. And I think that there will be a discussion with the administration, and it will be a pressure between environmental long-term goals and short-term feeding needs of the world. The world needs the U.S. capacity as they need the Brazilian capacity. So these prices show that we need those acres. So I think that this cannot be automatic.

This morning, I'm pleased to share with you results that demonstrate an outstanding start to 2021, building on our momentum from a record 2020. We reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.39, more than double the year ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, 86% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted OP growth. 
Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9%, 375 basis points higher than our 2021 annual WACC and significantly higher than the 7.6% in the year ago period. And our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.2 billion, 19% higher than the prior year period. I'm proud of our team, and they continue to deliver sustained strong growth, powered by their continued advancement of the strategic transformation of our business, outstanding execution and excellent risk management and commitment to serving the evolving needs of our customers in new and innovative ways. I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of the trends, developments and accomplishments from the first quarter. 
Turn to Slide 4, please. First, we are encouraged by many of the demand indicators we are seeing. From a geographic perspective, China was one of the first countries to emerge from COVID-related restrictions, and we are continuing to see significant export demand driven by its economic recovery. 
In the U.S. meat production is strong as exports and retail sales remain robust and restaurant dining expands. Vaccine rollout has been slower in EMEA but is accelerating now. And so we're optimistic that demand will recover there as the year progresses. Of course, some countries like Brazil and India are still in the midst of the pandemic and demand there may be slower to come back. 
From a product perspective, expectation of a progressive recovery in global foodservice will support demand for sweeteners, flower and other ingredients in 2021. And we are seeing a strong demand for beverages, alternative proteins and nutritional supplements, including expected sales growth of 12% for plant protein ingredients this year. 
In summary, recovery from COVID and demand improvements are occurring at varying paces depending on geography and products. Complete recovery will extend over multiple years, but we are seeing clear trends that are favorable for our broad portfolio. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Another area in which we are seeing positive demand indications is ethanol in the U.S. About a year ago, we made the difficult decision to idle ethanol production at our dry mills in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Columbus, Nebraska. We committed that we will not restart those facilities until we saw economic and market factors that would point to a sustainable recovery. 
As we move through the winter and into spring, we saw industry inventories falling almost 10% during the quarter, ending almost 20% lower year-over-year on March 31. Mobility and driving miles increasing as COVID-related restrictions eased with recent gasoline consumption getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. Support from the EPA for the renewable fuel standard. And China resuming purchases of U.S. ethanol in the first half of 2021. With all of these factors supporting demand growth and improving industry margins, we decided to restart production. At the same time, we are continuing to work with interested parties to complete the monetization of our dry mill ethanol assets. 
From a portfolio management perspective, we're still committed to reducing our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol. And as demand continues to grow for the wide range of innovative alternative products that can come from natural sources like corn, we expect to see additional interest from other parties in both in biomaterials and sustainable aviation fuel. 
Slide 6, please. One of the ways we are meeting growing and evolving demand is by introducing new technologies and innovations across our value chain. In Q1, Our Covantis joint venture celebrated the commercial launch of its revolutionary blockchain platform to modernize the global agriculture ocean shipping industry. Similarly, in the U.S. we've led an effort with industry partners to launch the barge digital transformation project, which uses new technologies to replace outdated, inefficient processes on our in-line water ways. 
We're also innovating to meet the demand for sustainable solutions. Over the last year, as growth of e-commerce drove demand for packaging, our biosolutions team worked proactively with customers to apply our corn-based native and modified starches to help increase the number of times cardboard boxes can be recycled. In Europe, our animal nutrition teams are using life cycle analysis of the complete supply chain from crops and ingredients to final animal products like milk, eggs and meat to help develop new feed supplements that improve animal health and reduce environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions. 
We're also continuing to innovate to improve the customer experience. Last year, as travel was restricted, we launched new technologies designed to take our customers on collaborative virtual journeys that allowed us to share consumer insights, emerging trends and product solution opportunities, including real-time tasting. 
Now as parts of the world reopen, we are continuing to expand our innovating customer capabilities. In March, we opened our completely renovated customer innovation center in Beijing, expanding our ability to support technical innovation and creation. And earlier this month, we were proud to celebrate the opening of the new cutting-edge, plant-based customer innovation lab at our research hub in Singapore. These new facilities will propel our abilities to work with customers to create tailor-made solutions to meet evolving and growing consumer needs in the region. 
Slide 7, please. Finally, I want to speak about the very important issue of sustainability. Our commitment to sustainability expands our value chain. It includes our work with growers to implement responsible farming practices, including the 13 million acres we've enrolled in sustainable farming programs globally in recent years. It encompasses our Strive 35 goals to reduce the environmental impact of our processing operations, exemplified by the recent announcement of our partnership to help advance the proposed revolutionary zero emission power facility, utilizing our carbon capture and storage facility adjacent to our operations indicator [indiscernible]. 
Sustainability is a key driver of our expanding portfolio of environmentally responsible plan-derived products and our efforts to reduce hunger and support the communities in which we live and work. 
One critical pillar of our sustainability work for us and our customers is increasing the traceability of our supply chain. We joined the Brazilian soy moratorium in 2006. And in 2015, we introduced our first comprehensive no deforestation policy. Since then, we made impressive progress, including achieving 99% traceability to mill in our farms around supply chain and full traceability to farm for direct suppliers in 25 key municipalities in the Brazilian Cerrado. 
Now we are taking our efforts to a new level. Last month, we announced our new policy to protect forests, biodiversity and communities. As part of this ambitious plan, we aim to achieve full traceability throughout our direct and indirect South American soy supply chains by 2022 and have deforestation-free supply chains around the world by 2030. 
I'm proud of the work our team is doing to deliver on our sustainability commitments and capabilities. We know they are a key driver of consumer decisions and business success. But more importantly, they are one of the ways in which we are living up to our purpose and enriching the quality of life around the world. 
I'll come back later to talk about the next steps in our journey and our strategy. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Ray, who will take us through our business performance. Ray?"

Good morning, everyone. Slide 8, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. Ag Services results were substantially highe",1106,"Yes. Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. Slide 8, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. 
Ag Services results were substantially higher year-over-year. Results were driven by a record Q1 for our North American origination team, which executed extremely well to capitalize on strong Chinese demand. As expected, results in South America were significantly lower versus the prior year period. Farmer selling was lower versus the extremely aggressive pace in the year ago quarter. 
Lower margins, including the impacts from the slightly delayed harvest and higher freight costs also affected South American results. Results for the quarter were affected by about $75 million in negative timing related to ocean freight positions. Those impacts will reverse as contracts execute in the coming quarters. 
Crushing delivered its best quarter ever as the business leverage its global footprint and diversified capabilities to capture strong execution margins in both soybean and softseed crushing, driven by robust vegetable oil demand and tight soybean stocks. Net timing impacts for the quarter in crush were minimal. 
Refined products and other results were higher year-over-year. While overall volumes were down due to pandemic impacts, margins were stronger in both North America and EMEA, refined oils. Global biodiesel results were lower year-over-year. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the prior year period. 
Looking ahead, we now expect full year calendar year results for Ag Services and Oilseeds to be higher than the record 2020, with a particularly strong fourth quarter, driven by potentially record global demand for North American agricultural products. 
For the second quarter, we expect results to be slightly stronger than the second quarter of 2020, but significantly lower than the record first quarter of 2021 with stronger Crushing and RPO expectations compared to the second quarter of 2020, offsetting seasonably lower Ag Service results. 
Slide 9, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team again delivered significant year-over-year profit growth. Our Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes the wet mill ethanol production, achieved significantly higher results versus the first quarter of 2020. The business managed risks exceptionally well, capitalizing on rising prices in the ethanol complex and favorable coal product values in an industry environment of improving margins and falling inventories. Corn oil results were significantly higher than the previous year, which have been impacted by substantial mark-to-market effects. 
In general, though demand for sweeteners and flour by the foodservice sector remained below the prior year, there were signs of acceleration in the month of March. Starch sales volumes remained solid on demand from industrial applications like packaging materials. 
Vantage Corn Processor results were substantially higher, driven by improved margins on the distribution of fuel ethanol and strong performance in USP-grade industrial alcohol. 
Looking ahead, second quarter results for Carbohydrate Solutions are expected to be in line with this first quarter of 2021, which would represent a significant year-over-year profit growth driven by the improved ethanol market environment, including the restart of our 2 VCP dry mills and the recovery of the foodservice segment. 
Slide 10, please. The Nutrition team delivered 5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis and solid year-over-year operating profit growth. Human Nutrition results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter. Flavors had an exceptional quarter, driven by strong sales across various market segments, especially beverages. Favorable product mix in North America, improved margins in EMEA and accelerated income from a customer agreement also contributed results, partially offset by certain specific expenses. 
Specialty Ingredients results were lower, primarily driven by demand factors, including the effect of pantry loading in the previous year quarter and shifts in demand for texturants. 
Health and Wellness had a strong start to the year, with robust demand for nutritional products, driving higher results in probiotics and fibers. Animal Nutrition results were lower versus the first quarter of 2020, driven primarily by lower demand and higher input costs as a result of pandemic effects, primarily in South America. This was partially offset by favorable results in amino acids, driven by improved product mix. 
Looking ahead, we expect continued strong demand for flavors and proteins and improving demand for our animal nutrition products as restrictions ease to drive second quarter results that will be significantly higher than the prior year quarter, supporting the 15% per annum trend growth rate for the calendar year. 
Slide 11, please. Let me finish up with a few observations from the Other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were lower than the prior year quarter, driven by lower captive insurance underwriting results, partially offset by more favorable ADM investor services earnings. For the quarter, there were about $0.17 per share of adjusted items for EPS purposes, which are referenced in Slide 24 in the appendix. 
These adjustment items included: One, the settlement of the class action lawsuit against Golden Peanut to avoid the rising cost of a prolonged litigation, in a case in which we did not believe we violate any laws; two, impairments and restructuring costs related to the exit of certain noncore product lines and inefficient assets in nutrition; and three, mark-to-market on the embedded option in the Wilmar exchangeable bond. 
In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of about $200 million were slightly higher year-over-year, due primarily to our continued investments in IT and business transformation and transfers of costs from the business segments into the centralized centers of expertise in supply chain and operations. We are still on track for calendar year corporate unallocated costs to be overall similar to 2020. 
As expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased from the year-over-year period on lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was -- first quarter of 2021 was approximately 16% compared to the benefit of 4% in the prior year. We still anticipate our calendar year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. 
Our balance sheet remains solid despite the higher commodity price environment with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 33% and available liquidity of $7.7 billion. As part of our active management for pension liabilities, we did close on another U.S. pension liability transfer transaction on April 1 with about $0.7 billion of liabilities transferred to the U.S. insurance market. This effectively reduces our U.S. pension liabilities by close to 40% and will result in the U.S. pension plans more or less fully funded from a projected benefit obligation perspective. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Juan."

And I'm even more proud of the strategic work we have done to transform our company and enable our growing success. We began in 2011 by committing to specific strategic goals and financial metrics focused on what we call the 3 Cs: capital discipline, cost reduction and cash generation. 
We launched new initiatives like our $1 billion challenge with prioritized operational excellence, and we focused on returns as our primary financial metric. We call that getting fit for the journey. Once we were fit, we launch the next part of our strategy, focusing on 3 core pillars to enhance returns, deliver more predictable growth and strengthen our ability to control our results. 
During this time, our team has done a great job optimizing business performance, realigning our portfolio and building a global leader in nutrition, driving efficiencies through our operational excellence initiatives and expanding through organic growth investments, M&A and the broadening of our customer base and product offerings. 
Now we're moving into the next phase of our strategic transformation by sharpening our focus on 2 strategic pillars: productivity and innovation. Our productivity efforts will take many actions that were part of our optimized and drive focuses and boost them to the next level. The productivity pillar will include: advancing the roles of our centers of excellence or COEs in procurement, supply chain and operations to deliver additional efficiencies across the enterprise; the continued rollout of our One ADM business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes; and increasing our use of technology, analytics and automation at our production facilities in our offices and with our customers. 
Our innovation activities will help us accelerate growth and profitability, not just for the near term, but importantly, for the long term. We'll expand and invest in improving the customer experience, including leveraging our producer relationships and enhancing our use of state-of-the-art digital technology to help our customers grow; sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of our products, solutions, capabilities and commitments to serve our customers' needs; and growth initiatives, including organic growth to support additional capacity and meet growing demand, opportunistic M&A and increased leveraging of our very successful venture capital portfolio. 
We'll support both pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding our digital capabilities and investing further in product research and development. And of course, all of our efforts will continue to be strengthened by our ongoing commitment to revenues. 
As I look at our long-term plans and this evolution of our strategy, I'm very excited about the value creation opportunities ahead of us. Our teams are continuing to perform at the high level and doing a great job serving our customers. The demand outlook for our products is strong, driven by the pre and during global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. And we are delivering on our potential and our promise. That is why we are even more optimistic in our 2021 outlook today than we were 3 months ago, with expectations for significantly higher full year operating profit and EPS versus our record 2020. 
And as we look beyond 2021, we expect that our sharpened focus on productivity and innovation, combined with continuing demand expansion driven by the fundamental needs and evolving demands of our global customers and the multiyear COVID recovery, will deliver sustained growth in earnings in the years to come. 
With that, Chris, please open the line for questions."

Listen, as I was referring in my remarks, we see the future with a lot of optimism. I mean we think that fundamentally, we have, as you know, a strong agenda of both now productivity and innovation where there are things that we can control, that we drive under our control. And we've been executing a similar plan. So now you're going to see it strengthen. And it has a more longer horizon reach, if you will, that's where we like about this sharpening. 
But all this is in the -- as supported by these 3 strong trends that we see in food security, health and well-being and sustainability. So let me give you a little bit of flavor there. We continue to see strong demand. You see food security, of course, as the global population grows. Protein demand continues to grow around the world as people increase their standards of living. 
And as countries come back from the pandemic on this demand that was, to a certain degree, suppressed. We see that in China, we see that in the U.S. And we believe that given the uneven vaccine recovery of vaccine rollout, this will take several years. So that's in an environment, Ken, as you know, a very tight supply/demand balances. So we expect an environment of good profits for the following years. 
Then when we look at health and well-being, that's propelling our Nutrition division and many of our other offerings in which we continue to see strong growth even exacerbated, if you will, with pandemics or other events. And we continue to see more demand for products made based on plans that what we call biosolutions. So products that actually replace industrial products made from resources that are not renewable. We have a long list of interested parties in doing more of that and we continue to develop solutions for that. 
So again, when we see the trends, when we see the strong demand environment in a tight supply/demand environment, plus the agenda of productivity and innovation, we feel very strong about our ability to deliver earnings growth from where we are today."

Specifically, I want to think about on the Oilseeds franchise and the expansion of renewable diesel. 
And as we think about, one, you can sort of see it already in the soybean oil market and what that's doing to crush margins. But as we think about the second half of the year into next year as some of the bigger capacities start to come on, how do we think about the earnings leverage, both in your Crushing franchise, but also in the edible oils business with the refining that we -- a business that never really got that much attention, hasn't grown much for a number of years given the move away from trans fat, but would seem to be kind of very strategic for a bunch of refiners who don't have pretreatment over the next couple of years?

So they are supporting very good soy crush margins and great softseed margins. 
We invested in this many years ago, remember, with all the switch capacity. We have about, give or take, 15% of our total crush capacity that can be switched from soybeans to softseed. So that's an advantage for us. And now all of a sudden, we are having this new demand that is coming because of all the sustainability trends that we discussed before with this in the form of renewable green diesel. So it just comes to strengthen our belief into this business that is very strategic for us.

And while inventories have actually increased 50% compared to March of last year, we still have significant available credit capacity to undertake actions, right? 
And so I think the first priority is continue to fund the working capital needs. It's not a surprise. Commodity prices continue to go up right now. And so therefore, we will use our balance sheet to kind of fund additional working capital requirements. And -- but secondly, we have flexibility to do whatever we need to do from a strategic perspective. As you know, in prior periods, during higher commodity prices, there are distressed assets in the marketplace. 
And so to the extent that there are distressed assets that makes sense for us to acquire in order to consolidate, we'll look at those. That's one of the big advantages of our ADM balance sheet. 
So -- but we all know eventually commodity prices will come down, and that will free up additional capital on the balance sheet. And then we can look at additional incremental returns on capital to our shareholders at that point in time. But again, the dividend, we've increased the dividend. That's an important element of return on capital to our shareholders. But I'm convinced that our balance sheet -- because we all know prices go through cycles, there will be a release of working capital at some juncture that will again free up significant capacity for us to take additional return of capital actions."

I would say, of course, we knew when green diesel customers are starting to show in demand. So we see that increased demand. So in general, we see a strong demand. 
In terms of disruption of demand, we haven't seen that to any degree. Probably the only example I can pinpoint is Brazil with biodiesel that reduced from B13 to B10. That's probably the only thing you can say. Things have become expensive, at least. And Brazil, as I made -- as I've mentioned in my onset remarks, Brazil is having a very difficult time with COVID. So I think the overall economy is suffering. And I think the government is trying to alleviate some -- to alleviate a little bit the pressure on inflation there. So -- but that's probably the only example I can pinpoint to at this point of demand disruption."

When we started the year, we were planning to start the year, as I said, kind of flattish versus -- and the business continue to show strength. 
How that strength come part is revenue growth. 
Part of my confidence is given by the pipeline. We have a strong pipeline. We are very -- the team is very disciplined and religious in looking at the pipeline and looking at customer by customer and the projects. And that pipeline continues to grow, and our win rate continues to grow. So those are very positive indicators that your value proposition is very appreciated by your customers. 
Certainly, another thing that we do is that the team manage the product mix very well. And that allows us to increase profitability, even in excess of the revenue growth that we see. And there are different parts, well, for example, for flavors and for plant-based proteins and certainly for probiotics is much more a revenue growth story. 
For parts like Animal Nutrition, it's more like a margin recovery story. And so we have different ways to manage this portfolio that we call Nutrition, but it's a very complex portfolio. But that complexity also brings a lot of growth opportunities. And that's why we would have the confidence that It's a very balanced business from an opportunity perspective, supported by a very strong pipeline."

There's nothing that you should know about other than cash crush margins remain very healthy. We have a strong product demand from both meal and specialty oil. And these margins remain considerably stronger than what board crush indicates, particularly in North America and Europe. If you look at board crush in North America or Europe per month is about $25 per ton, and then we see margins on a cash basis of around $40 per ton. So there is a significant difference there. 
I would say we see -- as I said before, we have reasonable visibility into Q2 given the book of business we have. So we shouldn't see any surprises there, and we are expecting another good quarter of crush over there. So I mentioned before, we have our switch capacity. Softseed margins have been good. They moderated a little bit since Q1, but they continue to be very good. So oil values continue to be strong. And demand for our customers in mill in North America, our customers are enjoying good margins at this point in time. So they are trying to produce as much as they can. So we see strong demand from both lakes of the crush. So we feel good about it at the moment."

So let me do a reverse order. So net corn cost was a tailwind for us. I mean clearly, as we pointed out in the last earnings call, we actually procured a lot of our requirements at a very attractive price last year. And hence, we benefit from basically a very good procurement. And hence, net corn was a tailwind for us despite the fact that when you look at the board, corn costs are higher right now. 
With respect to the question on that disaggregating Starches and Sweeteners from ethanol. My only comment is one of the big improvements in Starches and Sweeteners in the quarter compared to last quarter -- last year's first quarter was the fact that we didn't have the corn oil mark-to-market impact. If you recall last year, we had about a $50 million negative impact due to the corn oil divergence from soybean oil. We didn't have it this year. So that was clearly a tailwind in terms of our results. 
From a volume perspective, When you look at the Starches and Sweeteners business right now, we're still -- I'm looking at corn -- high fructose corn syrup. And corn syrup is still down versus last year. So we are suffering from the impact of the pandemic and because the food service sector is not fully recovered. We indicated that we're starting to see elements of recovery in the month of March. 
But from a volume perspective, in the first quarter, total sweetener volumes are still down versus last year, right? So therefore, that's kind of like a headwind. But we expect that to progressively recover as we move through the year. 
So I guess, overall, I mean, we've been actually pretty pleased in terms of the performance. Given this particular headwind we had in the first quarter, we were very pleased in terms of how we manage the business, favorable net corn procurement, favorable risk management. And frankly, even with the cold weather impacts that we had in the first quarter, we were able to keep on delivering to our customers, which is very, very important."

the data grown in the first 3 months of the year. There are import of proteins that's up like 20%. And they continue to have very strong forecast for the importation of grains to feed animals. So that's what we're seeing. 
Of course, corn prices have been expensive in China. And so China has been taking as much as wheat as they can from Europe to try to make a little bit of substitution. But they also don't have infinite wheat reserves. And during this year, we think that both corn reserves and wheat reserves needs to be replenished at one point in time. We don't think that that's happening now. Nobody is replenishing inventories in the face of an inverse. But we think that, that may happen later in the year."

I mean North America, we had a very strong Q1 in terms of North American exports. Again, partly as Juan indicated, a delayed South American harvest.

So second quarter for Ag Services, it will revert back to more of a normal level here. The demand environment is still good, but it's not going to be as stellar as what we saw in the first quarter. 
On your question on timing differences, remember, this is Crushing, right? I mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's about $75 million related to global trade and ocean freight. That will reverse over the course of the year. In the appendix, the timing effects referred to in the appendix are related to crush. 
And just a reminder, in the first quarter, we didn't see much of a reversal in the first quarter despite the fact that we had, at the end of 2020, about $295 million in timing effects. And the reason being is that while we're seeing some reversals occurring, we're also building up new timing effects. Because as you know, cash crush remains extremely strong. So some of the new contracts we're putting on, we're actually creating new timing effects. 
And so I just want to just kind of caution people that in this type of environment, even though there's about like $265 million of timing effects yet to unwind because of new timing effects that will likely occur over the course of the year, we may not see the full unwind occurred this year.

China continues to be buying everything they can. They are buying corn, but they're buying wheat, as I said before, from several places. 
And we have certain weather spots in the world. Canada and France are too cold and too dry. That has put some pressure on wheat with all this demand. Australia's infrastructure is trying to recover from the cyclone. So the exportability of wheat there is also a little bit limited for loading, that has created some pressure. So for the moment, corn continues to be competitive. The U.S. is exporting corn. But pretty soon, it will become landed in China, a little bit more expensive than wheat.

At the same time, increase the CRP program. Does that mean that we're in a land grab here? I know we're in early stages. Does the Fed buy land? Do we encourage people to put it aside?

I think that we need to start working, and it's important to work very closely with the farmers to try to listen, to -- the farmer understand the responsibility. We have, at the moment, maybe 25% of acres doing precision agriculture, which I think will increase yield without needing more land. 
And I think that there will be a discussion with the administration, and it will be a pressure between environmental long-term goals and short-term feeding needs of the world. The world needs the U.S. capacity as they need the Brazilian capacity. So these prices show that we need those acres. So I think that this cannot be automatic. It's something that we will have to work out, balancing all the stakeholders, people that need the food with the long-term needs for conserving the planet."

This morning, I'm pleased to share with you results that demonstrate an outstanding start to 2021, building on our momentum from a record 2020. We reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.39, more than double the year ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, 86% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted OP growth. 
 Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9%, 375 basis points higher than our 2021 annual WACC and significantly higher than the 7.6% in the year ago period. And our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.2 billion, 19% higher than the prior year period. I'm proud of our team, and they continue to deliver sustained strong growth, powered by their continued advancement of the strategic transformation of our business, outstanding execution and excellent risk management and commitment to serving the evolving needs of our customers in new and innovative ways. I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of the trends, developments and accomplishments from the first quarter. 
 Turn to Slide 4, please. First, we are encouraged by many of the demand indicators we are seeing. From a geographic perspective, China was one of the first countries to emerge from COVID-related restrictions, and we are continuing to see significant export demand driven by its economic recovery. 
 In the U.S. meat production is strong as exports and retail sales remain robust and restaurant dining expands. Vaccine rollout has been slower in EMEA but is accelerating now. And so we're optimistic that demand will recover there as the year progresses. Of course, some countries like Brazil and India are still in the midst of the pandemic and demand there may be slower to come back. 
 From a product perspective, expectation of a progressive recovery in global foodservice will support demand for sweeteners, flower and other ingredients in 2021. And we are seeing a strong demand for beverages, alternative proteins and nutritional supplements, including expected sales growth of 12% for plant protein ingredients this year. 
 In summary, recovery from COVID and demand improvements are occurring at varying paces depending on geography and products. Complete recovery will extend over multiple years, but we are seeing clear trends that are favorable for our broad portfolio. 
 Please turn to Slide 5.  Another area in which we are seeing positive demand indications is ethanol in the U.S. About a year ago, we made the difficult decision to idle ethanol production at our dry mills in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Columbus, Nebraska. We committed that we will not restart those facilities until we saw economic and market factors that would point to a sustainable recovery. 
 As we move through the winter and into spring, we saw industry inventories falling almost 10% during the quarter, ending almost 20% lower year-over-year on March 31. Mobility and driving miles increasing as COVID-related restrictions eased with recent gasoline consumption getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. Support from the EPA for the renewable fuel standard. And China resuming purchases of U.S. ethanol in the first half of 2021. With all of these factors supporting demand growth and improving industry margins, we decided to restart production. At the same time, we are continuing to work with interested parties to complete the monetization of our dry mill ethanol assets. 
 From a portfolio management perspective, we're  still committed to reducing our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol. And as demand continues to grow for the wide range of innovative alternative products that can come from natural sources like corn, we expect to see additional interest from other parties in both in biomaterials and sustainable aviation fuel. 
 Slide 6, please. One of the ways we are meeting growing and evolving demand is by introducing new technologies and innovations across our value chain. In Q1, Our Covantis joint venture celebrated the commercial launch of its revolutionary blockchain platform to modernize the global agriculture ocean shipping industry. Similarly, in the U.S. we've led an effort with industry partners to launch the barge digital transformation project, which uses new technologies to replace outdated, inefficient processes on our in-line water ways. 
 We're also innovating to meet the demand for sustainable solutions. Over the last year, as growth of e-commerce drove demand for packaging, our biosolutions team worked proactively with customers to apply our corn-based native and modified starches to help increase the number of times cardboard boxes can be recycled. In Europe, our animal nutrition teams are using life cycle analysis of the complete supply chain from crops and ingredients to final animal products like milk, eggs and meat to help develop new feed supplements that improve animal health and reduce environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions. 
 We're also continuing to innovate to improve the customer experience. Last year, as travel was restricted, we launched new technologies designed to take our customers on collaborative virtual journeys that allowed us to share consumer insights, emerging trends and product solution opportunities, including real-time tasting. 
 Now as parts of the world reopen, we are continuing to expand our innovating customer capabilities. In March, we opened our completely renovated customer innovation center in Beijing, expanding our ability to support technical innovation and creation. And earlier this month, we were proud to celebrate the opening of the new cutting-edge, plant-based customer innovation lab at our research hub in Singapore. These new facilities will propel our abilities to work with customers to create tailor-made solutions to meet evolving and growing consumer needs in the region. 
 Slide 7, please. Finally, I want to speak about the very important issue of sustainability. Our commitment to sustainability expands our value chain. It includes our work with growers to implement responsible farming practices, including the 13 million acres we've enrolled in sustainable farming programs globally in recent years. It encompasses our Strive 35 goals to reduce the environmental impact of our processing operations, exemplified by the recent announcement of our partnership to help advance the proposed revolutionary zero emission power facility, utilizing our carbon capture and storage facility adjacent to our operations indicator [indiscernible]. 
 Sustainability is a key driver of our expanding portfolio of environmentally responsible plan-derived products and our efforts to reduce hunger and support the communities in which we live and work. 
 One critical pillar of our sustainability work for us and our customers is increasing the traceability of our supply chain. We joined the Brazilian soy moratorium in 2006. And in 2015, we introduced our first comprehensive no deforestation policy. Since then, we made impressive progress, including achieving 99% traceability to mill in our farms around supply chain and full traceability to farm for direct suppliers in 25 key municipalities in the Brazilian Cerrado. 
 Now we are taking our efforts to a new level. Last month, we announced our new policy to protect forests, biodiversity and communities. As part of this ambitious plan, we aim to achieve full traceability throughout our direct and indirect South American soy supply chains by 2022 and have deforestation-free supply chains around the world by 2030. 
 I'm proud of the work our team is doing to deliver on our sustainability commitments and capabilities. We know they are a key driver of consumer decisions and business success. But more importantly, they are one of the ways in which we are living up to our purpose and enriching the quality of life around the world. 
 I'll come back later to talk about the next steps in our journey and our strategy. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Ray, who will take us through our business performance. Ray?"

Ag Services results were substantially hig",1106,"Yes. Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. Slide 8, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds  team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. 
 Ag Services results were substantially higher year-over-year. Results were driven by a record Q1 for our North American origination team, which executed extremely well to capitalize on strong Chinese demand. As expected, results in South America were significantly lower versus the prior year period. Farmer selling was lower versus the extremely aggressive pace in the year ago quarter. 
 Lower margins, including the impacts from the slightly delayed harvest and higher freight costs also affected South American results. Results for the quarter were affected by about $75 million in negative timing related to ocean freight positions. Those impacts will reverse as contracts execute in the coming quarters. 
 Crushing delivered its best quarter ever as the business leverage its global footprint and diversified capabilities to capture strong execution margins in both soybean and softseed crushing,  driven by robust vegetable oil demand and tight soybean stocks. Net timing impacts for the quarter in crush were minimal. 
 Refined products and other results were higher year-over-year. While overall volumes were down due to pandemic impacts, margins were stronger in both North America and EMEA, refined oils. Global biodiesel results were lower year-over-year. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the prior year period. 
 Looking ahead, we now expect full year calendar year results for Ag Services and Oilseeds to be higher than the record 2020, with a particularly strong fourth quarter, driven by potentially record global demand for North American agricultural products. 
 For the second quarter, we expect results to be slightly stronger than the second quarter of 2020, but significantly lower than the record first quarter of 2021  with stronger Crushing and RPO expectations compared to the second quarter of 2020, offsetting seasonably lower Ag Service results. 
 Slide 9, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team again delivered significant year-over-year profit growth. Our Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes the wet mill ethanol production, achieved significantly higher results versus the first quarter of 2020. The business managed risks exceptionally well, capitalizing on rising prices in the ethanol complex and favorable coal product values in an industry environment of improving margins and falling inventories. Corn oil results were significantly higher than the previous year, which have been impacted by substantial mark-to-market effects. 
 In general, though demand for sweeteners and flour by the foodservice sector remained below the prior year, there were signs of acceleration in the month of March. Starch sales volumes remained solid on demand from industrial applications like packaging materials. 
 Vantage Corn Processor results were substantially higher, driven by improved margins on the distribution of fuel ethanol and strong performance in USP-grade industrial alcohol. 
 Looking ahead, second quarter results for Carbohydrate Solutions are expected to be in line with this first quarter of 2021, which would represent a significant year-over-year profit growth driven by the improved ethanol market environment, including the restart of our 2 VCP dry mills and the recovery of the foodservice segment. 
 Slide 10, please. The Nutrition team delivered 5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis and solid year-over-year operating profit growth. Human Nutrition results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter. Flavors had an exceptional quarter, driven by strong sales across various market segments, especially beverages. Favorable product mix in North America, improved margins in EMEA and accelerated income from a customer agreement also contributed  results, partially offset by certain specific expenses. 
 Specialty Ingredients  results were lower, primarily driven by demand factors, including the effect of pantry loading in the previous year quarter and shifts in demand for texturants. 
 Health and Wellness had a strong start to the year, with robust demand for nutritional products, driving higher results in probiotics and fibers. Animal Nutrition results were lower versus the first quarter of 2020, driven primarily by lower demand and higher input costs as a result of pandemic effects, primarily in South America. This was partially offset by favorable results in amino acids, driven by improved product mix. 
 Looking ahead, we expect continued strong demand for flavors and proteins and improving demand for our animal nutrition products as restrictions ease to drive second quarter results that will be significantly higher than the prior year quarter, supporting the 15% per annum trend growth rate for the calendar year. 
 Slide 11, please. Let me finish up with a few observations from the Other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were lower than the prior year quarter, driven by lower captive insurance underwriting results, partially offset by  more favorable ADM investor services earnings. For the quarter, there were about $0.17 per share of adjusted items for EPS purposes, which are referenced in Slide 24 in the appendix. 
 These adjustment items included: One, the settlement of the class action lawsuit against Golden Peanut to avoid the rising cost of a prolonged litigation, in a case in which we did not believe we violate any laws; two, impairments and restructuring costs related to the exit of certain noncore product lines and inefficient assets in nutrition; and three, mark-to-market on the embedded option in the Wilmar exchangeable bond. 
 In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of about $200 million were slightly higher year-over-year, due primarily to our continued investments in IT and business transformation and transfers of costs from the business segments into the centralized centers of expertise in supply chain and operations. We are still on track for calendar year corporate unallocated costs to be overall similar to 2020. 
 As expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased from the year-over-year period on lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was -- first quarter of 2021 was approximately 16% compared to the benefit of 4% in the prior year. We still anticipate our calendar year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. 
 
 Our balance sheet remains solid despite the higher commodity price environment with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 33% and available liquidity of $7.7 billion. As part of our active management for pension liabilities, we did close on another U.S. pension liability transfer transaction on April 1 with about $0.7 billion of liabilities transferred to the U.S. insurance market. This effectively reduces our U.S. pension liabilities by close to 40% and will result in the U.S. pension plans more or less fully funded from a projected benefit obligation perspective. 
 With that, I'll turn it back to Juan."

And I'm even more proud of the strategic work we have done to transform our company and enable our growing success. We began in 2011 by committing to specific strategic goals and financial metrics focused on what we call the 3 Cs: capital discipline, cost reduction and cash generation. 
 We launched new initiatives like our $1 billion challenge with prioritized operational excellence, and we focused on returns as our primary financial metric. We call that getting fit for the journey. Once we were fit, we launch the next part of our strategy, focusing on 3 core pillars to enhance returns, deliver more predictable growth and strengthen our ability to control our results. 
 During this time, our team has done a great job optimizing business performance, realigning our portfolio and building a global leader in nutrition, driving efficiencies through our operational excellence initiatives and expanding through organic growth investments, M&A and the broadening of our customer base and product offerings. 
 Now we're moving into the next phase of our strategic transformation by sharpening our focus on 2 strategic pillars: productivity and innovation. Our productivity efforts will take many actions that were part of our optimized and drive focuses and boost them to the next level. The productivity pillar will include: advancing the roles of our centers of excellence or COEs in procurement, supply chain and operations to deliver additional efficiencies across the enterprise; the continued rollout of our One ADM business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes; and increasing our use of technology, analytics and automation at our production facilities in our offices and with our customers. 
 Our innovation activities will help us accelerate growth and profitability, not just for the near term, but importantly, for the long term. We'll  expand and invest in improving the customer experience, including leveraging our producer relationships and enhancing our use of state-of-the-art digital technology to help our customers grow; sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of our products, solutions, capabilities and commitments to serve our customers' needs; and growth initiatives, including organic growth to support additional capacity and meet growing demand, opportunistic M&A and increased leveraging of our very successful venture capital portfolio. 
 We'll support both pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding our digital capabilities and investing further in product research and development. And of course, all of our efforts will continue to be strengthened by our ongoing commitment to revenues. 
 As I look at our long-term plans and this evolution of our strategy, I'm very excited about the value creation opportunities ahead of us. Our teams are continuing to perform at the high level and doing a great job serving our customers. The demand outlook for our products is strong, driven by the pre and during global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. And we are delivering on our potential and our promise. That is why we are even more optimistic in our 2021 outlook today than we were 3 months ago, with expectations for significantly higher full year operating profit and EPS versus our record 2020. 
 And as we look beyond 2021, we expect that our sharpened focus on productivity and innovation, combined with continuing demand expansion driven by the fundamental needs and evolving demands of our global customers and the multiyear COVID recovery, will deliver sustained growth in earnings in the years to come.

And we've been executing a similar plan. So now you're going to see it strengthen. And it has a more longer horizon reach, if you will, that's where we like about this sharpening. 
 But all this is in the -- as supported by these 3  strong trends that we see in food security, health and well-being and sustainability. So let me give you a little bit of flavor there. We continue to see strong demand. You see food security, of course, as the global population grows. Protein demand continues to grow around the world as people increase their standards of living. 
 And as countries come back from the pandemic on this demand that was, to a certain degree, suppressed. We see that in China, we see that in the U.S. And we believe that given the uneven vaccine recovery of vaccine rollout, this will take several years. So that's in an environment, Ken, as you know, a very tight supply/demand balances. So we expect an environment of good profits for the following years. 
 Then when we look at health and well-being, that's propelling our Nutrition division and many of our other offerings in which we continue to see strong growth even exacerbated, if you will, with pandemics or other events. And we continue to see more demand for products made based on plans that what we call biosolutions. So products that actually replace industrial products made  from resources that are not renewable. We have a long list of interested parties in doing more of that and we continue to develop solutions for that. 
 So again, when we see the trends, when we see the strong demand environment in a tight supply/demand  environment, plus the agenda of productivity and innovation, we feel very strong about our ability to deliver earnings growth from where we are today."

Specifically, I want to think about on the Oilseeds franchise and the expansion of renewable diesel. 
 And as we think about, one, you can sort of see it already in the soybean oil market and what that's doing to crush margins. But as we think about the second half of the year into next year as some of the bigger capacities start to come on, how do we think about the earnings leverage, both in your Crushing franchise, but also in the edible oils business with the refining that we -- a business that never really got that much attention, hasn't grown much for a number of years given the move away from trans-fat, but would seem to be kind of very strategic for a bunch of refiners who don't have pretreatment over the next couple of years? And then I got a capital allocation question afterwards."

It's a business that was built traditionally in one leg, if you will, from the mill supporting all these, and we were always waiting for the oil story. The oil story, I mean, you can see that right now playing up, oil values that reach record levels, softseed margins that been the best in the last 8 years, if you will. So they are supporting very good soy crush margins and great softseed margins. 
 We invested in this many years ago, remember, with all the switch capacity. We have about, give or take, 15% of our total crush capacity that can be switched from soybeans to softseed.  So that's an advantage for us. And now all of a sudden, we are having this new demand that is coming because of all the sustainability trends that we discussed before with this in the form of renewable green diesel. So it just comes to strengthen our belief into this business that is very strategic for us. 
 And to be honest, very proud of the way the business is executing. These are not easy markets to navigate with a lot of volatility, with very big values, and they are having touch wood and impeccable run. And they've done very well, given their sophistication and knowledge of -- and to be honest, also the visibility that being a full value chain supplier and a global supplier gives us. So continue to work very close with our food and fuel customers and staying close to them to make sure we can read what's coming down the pipe.

And while inventories have actually increased 50% compared to March of last year, we still have significant available credit capacity to undertake actions, right? 
 And so I think the first priority is continue to fund the working capital needs. It's not a surprise. Commodity prices continue to go up right now. And so therefore, we will use our balance sheet to kind of fund additional working capital requirements. And -- but secondly, we have flexibility to do whatever we need to do from a strategic perspective. As you know, in prior periods, during higher commodity prices, there are distressed assets in the marketplace. 
 And so to the extent that there are distressed assets that makes sense for us to acquire in order to consolidate, we'll look at those. That's one of the big advantages of our ADM balance sheet. 
 So -- but we all know  eventually commodity prices will come down, and that will free up additional capital on the balance sheet. And then we can look at additional incremental returns on capital to our shareholders at that point in time. But again, the dividend, we've increased the dividend. That's an important element of return on capital to our shareholders. But I'm convinced that our balance sheet -- because we all know prices go through cycles, there will be a release of working capital at some juncture that will again free up significant capacity for us to take additional return of capital actions."

When we started the year, we were planning to start  the year, as I said, kind of flattish versus -- and the business continue to show strength. 
 How that strength come part is revenue growth. 
 Part of my confidence is given by the pipeline. We have a strong pipeline. We are very -- the team is very disciplined and religious in looking at the pipeline and looking at customer by customer and the projects. And that pipeline continues to grow, and our win rate continues to grow. So those are very positive indicators that your value proposition is very appreciated by your customers. 
 Certainly, another thing that we do is that the team manage the product mix very well. And that allows us to increase profitability, even in excess of the revenue growth that we see. And  there are different parts, well, for example, for flavors and for plant-based proteins and certainly for probiotics is much more a revenue growth story. 
 For parts like Animal Nutrition, it's more like a margin recovery story. And so we have different ways to manage this portfolio that we call Nutrition, but it's a very complex portfolio.

 I would say we see -- as I said before, we have reasonable visibility into Q2 given the book of business we have. So we shouldn't see any surprises there, and we are expecting another good quarter of crush over there. So I mentioned before, we have our switch capacity. Softseed margins have been good.

And hence, we benefit from basically a very good procurement. And hence, net corn was a tailwind for us despite the fact that when you look at the board, corn costs are higher right now. 
 With respect to the question on that disaggregating Starches and Sweeteners from ethanol. My only comment is one of the big improvements in Starches and Sweeteners in the quarter compared to last quarter -- last year's first quarter was the fact that we didn't have the corn oil mark-to-market impact. If you recall last year, we had about a $50 million negative impact due to the corn oil divergence from  soybean oil. We didn't have it this year. So that was clearly a tailwind in terms of our results. 
 From a volume perspective, When you look at the Starches and Sweeteners business right now, we're still --  I'm looking at corn -- high fructose corn syrup. And corn syrup is still down versus last year. So we are suffering from the impact of the pandemic and because the food service sector is not fully recovered. We indicated that we're starting to see elements of recovery in the month of March. 
 But from a volume perspective, in the first quarter, total sweetener volumes are still down versus last year, right? So therefore, that's kind of like a headwind. But we expect that to progressively recover as we move through the year. 
 So I guess, overall, I mean, we've been actually pretty pleased in terms of the performance. Given this particular headwind we had in the first quarter, we were very pleased in terms of how we manage the business, favorable net corn procurement, favorable risk management. And frankly, even with the cold weather impacts that we had in the first quarter, we were able to keep on delivering to our customers, which is very, very important."

No. Of course, the recovery of Chinese demand for all agricultural products is an important driver in all these cycle as we've seen. The ASF, we see the rebuild of the curve is progressing and continues, although maybe a bit delayed during the -- because of the recent resurgence in the North. But we think that probably that delay is -- maybe it took a couple of quarters of delays, but nothing has changed. So we may get to the full [ herd ] by some time in 2022. I think that it's something that, of course, the industry is monitoring. There are a lot of measures that have been taken in China, including some of the parceling of the region, so to make sure that the disease doesn't contaminate the whole country. And I think that we will be watching what happened with the Southern provinces now in the summer very closely. 
But I will say, in general, the recovery continues unabated, and you can see that on the demand. Demand in China continues to be strong. You see that they have grown in the first 3 months of the year. There are import of proteins that's up like 20%. And they continue to have very strong forecast for the importation of grains to feed animals. So that's what we're seeing. 
 Of course, corn prices have been expensive in China. And so China has been taking as much as wheat as they can from Europe to try to make a little bit of substitution. But they also don't have infinite wheat reserves. And during this year, we think that both corn reserves and wheat reserves needs to be replenished at one point in time. We don't think that that's happening now. Nobody is replenishing inventories in the face of an inverse. But we think that, that may happen later in the year."

South America, the weather in South America, of course, delayed a little bit the crop, and certainly, it's hurting a little bit the safrinha. We still expect -- traditionally, April and May are dry weather months in Brazil. So that's not great for this, and that's what putting a little bit of the premium in -- the weather premium on corn. So we expect that crop to be a little bit smaller. And Brazil exports about 35% of their corn production. So that is an impact in the market. 
 What are we rooting for? We are rooting for larger crops. We like to move crops. So the soy crop is expected to be a good one, maybe 135 million, 136 million tons. So that's in check. And I think what Brazil is doing at the moment is maybe  getting a little bit of corn from Argentina. Certainly, it's getting wheat to try to replace some of the corn in feeding. Because  adjusted, as I said before, the B13 biodiesel to B10. 
 
 So it's a year in which Brazil needs to navigate with -- on very tight stocks. And so it's going to be a difficult year and a year of heavy management for the Brazilian, the crush and the grain side of things."

 Because I remember last call, you said the vast majority of the close to $300  million is likely to reverse within the first half. And we haven't seen much in 1Q.

I mean North America, we had a very strong Q1 in terms of North American exports. Again, partly as Juan indicated, a delayed South American harvest. It allowed the export window in North America to really benefit. And then we just had significant demand pull, which resulted in very strong elevation margins in the first quarter. So second quarter for Ag Services, it will revert back to more of a normal level here. The demand environment is still good, but it's not going to be as stellar as what we saw in the first quarter. 
 On your question on timing differences, remember, this is Crushing, right? I mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's about $75 million related to global trade and ocean freight. That will reverse over the course of the year. In the appendix, the timing effects referred to in the appendix are related to crush. 
 And just a reminder, in the first quarter, we didn't see much of a reversal in the first quarter despite the fact that we had, at the end of 2020, about $295 million in timing effects. And the reason being is that while we're seeing some reversals occurring, we're also building up new timing effects. Because as you know, cash crush remains extremely strong. So some of the new contracts we're putting on, we're actually creating new timing effects. 
 And so I just want to just kind of caution people that in this type of environment, even though there's about like $265 million of timing effects yet to unwind because of new timing effects that will likely occur over the course of the year, we may not see the full unwind occurred this year.

China continues to be buying everything they can. They are buying corn, but they're buying wheat, as I said before, from several places. 
 And we have certain weather spots in the world. Canada and France are too cold and too dry. That has put some pressure on wheat with all this demand. Australia's infrastructure is trying to recover from the cyclone. So the exportability of wheat there is also a little bit limited for loading, that has created some pressure. So for the moment, corn continues to be competitive. The U.S. is exporting corn. But pretty soon, it will become landed in China, a little bit more expensive than wheat. But then wheat is getting tighter because of the bad weather. So we are looking at all those dynamics. So it's very difficult to answer the spot question specifically, but that's what our team does all day, is looking at all those dynamics and making sure we alter our product flows to fit the best origin."

 And I think that there will be a discussion with the administration, and it will be a pressure between environmental long-term goals and short-term feeding needs of the world.

Slide 4, please. Over the last decade, we made cultural, technology and process changes that help us revolutionize how we do our work every day.

But we will categorize our efforts going forward as either productivity or innovation. Productivity is about using new technologies and thinking to automate, digitize and standardize our processes. It's a lever under our control that allows us to enhance efficiencies and manage costs.
One great example of our productivity work is the digitalization of our procurement center of excellence. We're implementing best-in-breed technology that's standardizing processes and reducing costs in our indirect procurement. Most importantly, this advancement is unleashing our colleagues to drive even greater value by transforming their work from tactical to strategic. That's just one example of the kind of initiatives we are pursuing under productivity. Across the enterprise, our productivity efforts collectively are expected to deliver about $200 million in savings in calendar year 2021.
Please turn to Slide 5. The other pillar of our strategy is innovation. Innovation is how we are delivering profitable growth. And one of the key ways we will support and propel our innovation work is through an initiative we launched this year called ISD. ISD is a fundamental realignment of our human nutrition business, commercial organization and go-to-market approach from a product-driven focus to a more customer-centric market segment-driven structure focused on 3 global market segments: Global Foods, global beverages, global health and values.
We are now able to move from consumer insight to concept to prototype to final solution more efficiently than before. Already, is enabling us to expand our sales pipelines and register record win rates. And this is only the start. ISD is a broad and ambitious effort encompassing talent development, digital analytics and sales enabling tools and streamlined product development processes.  All designed to better match our vast country and technical development capabilities to our customers' needs and accelerate our speed to market.
Slide 6, please. All of our strategic work is being supported and strengthened by our unique opportunity to use ADM's integrated value chain to advance the decarbonization of our range. For example, late last year, our theater-based carbon capture and storage partnership, the world's first large-scale project to store carbon from a biofuel source, surpassed 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide safely and permanently stored more than a mile under the earth surface. That's the equivalent of removing about 650,000 cars from the road for the full year.
And our efforts are continuing. We expect to sequester an additional 2.5 million tons -- million metric tons every -- over the next 5 years, and we have the ability to do even more. This project is a game changer, a valuable and unique asset in our efforts to decarbonize our production footprint and reduce the carbon intensity of our products, as demonstrated by our intention to work with 8 Rivers to help build an innovative zero-emission power plant that will utilize this carbon capture capability.
Next slide, please. Our reorganization efforts span the entire ag value chain, including transportation. Plant-based liquid fuels will continue to play a growing role in transportation, both on the ground and in the air, and we are investing to ensure we can meet that expanding demand.
In the second quarter, we were proud to announce the construction of North Dakota's first-ever dedicated soybean processing complex. We expect our new Spirit wood facility 600 million pounds of annual oil production to help support fast expanding production of renewable green diesel. We've already broken ground on the North Dakota complex, and we plan for it to be operational in 2023 in time to meet growing demand. We expect the demand for U.S. green diesel to continue can higher rate of growth, increasing by about 1 billion gallons per year and reaching up to 5 billion gallons by 2025.
Vegetable oils will be a key feedstock to meet that growing demand. And when you consider that it takes about 7.5 pounds of soybean oil to produce 1 gallon of renewable green diesel, you can appreciate the large potential opportunity. and why we are investing to grow our participation, both in North Dakota and with our expanded oil refining capacity in Quincy, Illinois.
Slide 8, please. Another area in which our Farm [ 2 4 ] (sic) capabilities are helping us meet demand for more sustainable products is plant-based proteins. We made substantial investments in this space. from our Campo Grande soy protein complex to our protein facility in North Dakota to our PlantPlus Foods joint venture. And as the opportunity for plant-based proteins accelerates by 12% a year, we are investing further to expand our participation.
Yesterday, we announced an agreement to purchase Soy Protein, Southern Europe's largest producer of soy-based protein products. Soy Protein is a perfect fit for our growth strategy. It represents a strategic addition to our global protein production capacity. It is a successful growing company with 2020 sales of more than $100 million, and an extensive list of customers in 65 countries in the mid-alternative, confectionery, protein bar, pharmaceutical, pet food and animal feed segments. And it's locally sourced, exclusively non-GMO products are closely aligned with European consumer preferences.
When I look back on this accomplishment, I see our ongoing strategic transformation is delivering at an accelerated pace. Our productivity and innovation focuses are powering performance and growth in large and fast-growing market opportunities, particularly those being propelled by strong consumer sentiment around sustainability. That's painting a bright future for ADM, which I will talk more about at the end of this call.
But first, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk about our business performance. Gray?"

The Ag Services and Royal seeds team followed up on their exceptional first quarter with another outstanding quarter. Ag Services results were higher year-over-year. The North American Origination business delivered an outstanding second quarter, managing its positions effectively in a dynamic pricing environment. and also achieved significantly higher export volumes, driven by corn sales to China.
South American origination was significantly lower than the previous year's quarter, driven by slower farmer selling and high commodity prices, which impacted contract fulfillment. Global trade performance was lower than the second -- strong second quarter of 2020 when customers were building inventories in mid-COVID-19. Results were also impacted by timing impacts that should reverse.
Crushing had substantially higher year-over-year results. The business executed well in an environment of strong vegetable oil demand to deliver higher execution margins in North America soy and EU soft seeds. Results were partially offset by weaker soybean crush margins in South America, driven by lower demand for biodiesel. In addition, there were about $70 million in net incremental negative timing effects which should reverse in the coming quarters.
Refined products and other results were significantly higher than the prior year period, driven by continued recovery in food service as well as positive timing effects in North America, partially offset by the effects of the reduction in the Brazilian biodiesel mandates. Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher year-over-year.
Now looking ahead, we expect Q3 performance for Ag Services and Oilseeds to be higher than the third quarter of 2020, driven by stronger results in crushing. We continue to anticipate full year results that will be significantly higher than 2020's very strong performance.
Slide 10, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team did a great job delivering results that were almost double those of the prior year period. Starches and sweeteners, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered substantially higher year-over-year results in a highly dynamic pricing environment driven by about $90 million in positioning gains across the ethanol complex as well as more normalized results from corn oil.
Sweetener volumes were higher, reflecting the beginnings of a recovery in demand from the foodservice channel. Ethanol margins improved versus the prior year period, driven by a resurgence in driving miles in the United States. Vantage corn processor results were much higher than the second quarter of 2020 and supported by the resumption of production of our 2 dry mills, improved fuel ethanol margins and favorable performance in USP grade industrial alcohol from our Peoria complex.
Now looking ahead, we expect tightening corn markets and their effects on ethanol margins to result in a third quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions that is lower compared to the third quarter of 2020, which included strong risk management gains. However, we expect full year Carbohydrate Solutions results to be substantially higher than 2020.
Slide 11, please. Nutrition delivered record sales and profits with 15% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis, an operating profit of more than $200 million. In Human Nutrition, revenue was 13% higher than the second quarter of last year on a constant currency basis and operating profits were up 24%.
In North America and EMEA, the Flavors business delivered strong volumes and improved product mix, particularly in the beverage segment. Specialty Ingredients delivered strong sales growth in specialty proteins. The results were lower due to certain onetime costs, mainly in texturants. In health and wellness, stronger sales and margins in probiotics were offset by higher cost in fibers due to planned facility downtime.
Animal Nutrition revenue growth was 17% higher year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and profits were up 44% as improved demand in margins in amino acids strengthened feed additives and ingredients and better performance in EMEA more than offset COVID-19 and labor-related impacts in other regions.
Now looking ahead, we expect Nutrition, once again, to deliver higher year-over-year results in the third quarter. And with continued strong demand, product innovation and great go-to-market execution by the team, we are raising our expectations for full year profit growth to 20%.
Slide 12, please. So let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were substantially lower than the prior year period, driven primarily by captive insurance underwriting losses, most of which were offset by corresponding recoveries in the other business segments. As expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased year-over-year on lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year.
In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate cost of $248 million were driven primarily by higher performance-related compensation accruals, higher IT offering and project-related costs and transfers of costs from the business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations. In other corporate, results included a valuation gain in our ADM Ventures portfolio. Looking at total corporate costs, including net interest, corporate unallocated and other corporate we are still on track for the calendar year to be overall similar to 2020.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 was approximately 14%. We still anticipate our calendar year effective tax rate to be in a range of 14% to 16%. Our balance sheet remains solid despite a higher commodity price environment with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 29%, and available liquidity of almost $9.5 billion.
With that, I'll turn it back to Juan."

Slide 13, please. When I look back on our outstanding first half results following a record 2020, I see a team that is executing at a high level and a strategy that is delivering according to our plan.
We have been constantly refreshing our portfolio, divesting from nonstrategic businesses and redeploying capital consistent with our strategy. In doing so, we've built industry-leading capabilities to meet customer and consumer needs in high-growth categories such as mid alternatives, a category we expect to reach more than $100 billion in sales worldwide by 2030, and in which our PlantPlus Foods joint venture now is participating, selling consumer products across Brazil and ready in its North American launch. Another example is diet supplements segment on track to have $80 billion in sales globally by 2025. And in which we're constantly expanding our product portfolio, including our recently introduced Biocult Brighton, which includes ingredients to reduce tiredness and fatigue. And then there is pet food, which is forecast to grow to more than $130 billion globally by 2025. And an area in which we launched our new premium cat food in Mexico earlier this year.
The list goes on, renewable green diesel pharmaceuticals and personal care, beverages all large high-growth opportunities powered by macro consumer trends like sustainability and health and wellbeing. And in each of those segments and more, our unparalleled global footprint, fully integrated value chain, customer insight, broad portfolio and speed to market are setting us ahead of the competition and fueling our growth. That's why we are so optimistic about our path forward.
Of course, there are always going to be short-term factors for us to navigate. But those are not things that will impact our long-term success. Our confidence is rooted in the transformation we began a decade ago and which continues with our work in productivity and innovation as well as our expanding participation in large and fast-growing market opportunities.
So to conclude, we have a great start of the year, and we expect to continue our momentum in the second half to deliver very strong 2021 earnings. As we've discussed, we are moving to a new phase of our strategic growth plan. With what we have accomplished over the years on capital discipline, targeted cost reductions and cash generation. And moving through our portfolio transformation and our efforts to optimize business performance, drive efficiencies and expand strategically. I believe we have successfully increased our base earnings power from $3 a share back in 2015 to a range of $4 to $4.50 this year.
And now as we enter the next stage of our growth, leveraging the key macro trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability with our continued focus on productivity and innovation and with future targeted investments, we believe our medium-term annual earnings trend growth rate will be in the high single-digit percentages from these $4 to $4.50 per share baseline.

It seems like especially in China, the soy meal demand has waned a little bit with the lead substitution, and it seems like the global industry is really crushing for veg oil given all the R&D demand around the world. Can you just help us think about kind of how that rolls forward as we think, especially with -- for you more heavily weighted towards soybeans and some pressure in terms of soft seed crop availability on the oil side as we go through the balance of the year into '22?"

So listen, we are very optimistic about the prospects for crash for the rest of the year and into next year. And if I go by geography, as I always do, from a North American perspective, margin remains exceptionally strong in North America in the $45 to $50 range. As you said, with a strong vegetable oil demand in part driven by RGD, but we had already a very good oil demand. And we see more recovery about food services and more reopening of the economy. And that continues to enhance, of course, the oil share of the crush contribution.
And also the tightening supplies and logistical issues in South America are allowing also U.S. soybean meal to be a little bit more competitive in global markets. We see some compression in European soy margins, maybe $10 to $20 as prices basically from South America oil imports are pressuring crush margins, especially, this is the time of the year in which Argentina and Brazil are the most competitive. They are in the middle of the harvest. And of course, they have reduced their biodiesel mandate, so there is more oil exportable, if you will. Although the beauty of our long supply chain is that as crush margins have softened in Europe, we got the benefit in biodiesel and the RPV given that.
Brazil margins continue to remain solid for domestic plants with maybe $25 to $35, despite the B10 biodiesel situation. And they are expected to remain solid as they move to higher B12 blend rates in the future, starting, I think, in September.
China margins are low due to high bean prices and lower soybean in demand. The heard this going through a rebalance there. And at the moment, there is a lot of wheat feed being said. And -- but we're going to go through the harvest of wheat. And I think that's something that we see with optimism going forward is that if you look at all the substitutes that we were facing last year, whether it was Sorgen or canola or sun or wheat, they have increased their inclusion in the Russians. And now all those things are having either weather issues or which is going to go through the harvest. So we see now the ability of soybean meal and corn inclusions to go up and that's positive as we go forward.
As you mentioned on our watch list is the canola margins. They have weakened. They were very strong in the first -- during the first half, but they have weakened on concerns of a short drop driven by the dryness in Canada. And canola margins are probably going to remain volatile until there is more certainty around the Canadian crop side. So 2 factors that we feel good about here is how valuable our switch capacity is in this dynamic environment, margins have shifted. And also how important it is our integration, our long value chain. If you think North America today is captured in it in crush, and maybe less so in biodiesel in Europe, we don't capture that much in crush, but we capture it in biodiesel. So all this ability of our footprint will allow us to follow the margin as it moves through the value chain has been very, very beneficial in these very volatile times.
Adam, maybe on the first question that you mentioned, again, the $4 to $4.50, as I said before, just to clarify, is our baseline will run the exercise because that was the land in a spot of our previous strategy, and it's not a forecast or guidance for this year."

Second, as we explained before, we have very good risk management. The team positioned very well on corn and on the ethanol complex. And certainly, sweeteners volumes came back versus last year as customers were preparing for the summer. And to a certain degree, you might have to take both Q2 and Q3 together from a sweetener perspective because I think that a lot of customers both in anticipation of refilling their pipeline given the summer and the openness with COVID that we will go in to experience in the U.S. So it was a strong volume month as well."

As we look at, as I said before, at our plan going forward, the contribution between productivity and innovation is equal. It's about 50-50. And it's mainly driven by all these opportunities that I mentioned, not only nutrition, but all the other things that we're seeing, whether it's biomaterials or renewable green diesel and all the other things that we've done.
Again, when we look at our plan, when we start from this again, theoretical $4 to $4.50 range, and we apply all these projects that are included in productivity and innovation we see our program over the next 5 years growing in the high single-digit percentage every year in operating profit. So we feel very good about that. we will be having, Ken, in Q4, an Investor Day, where we will be disclosing much more details and much more granularity about all these.
But you can see some of the things that we're doing already, whether we are invested in spearwood or the acquisition of soya protein or the expansions of our plant in Valencia with Biopolis and microbiome. So all these areas are receiving organic growth dollars. This will be, as we go forward, Ken, and you look at this plan, this is more an investment plan that maybe the previous period was. So you will see a little bit more CapEx and a little bit more investment given the size of the opportunities. When I was mentioning some of the sizes of these addressable markets we have, if you added some of the things I was saying, these are markets north of $300 billion in which we have positioned ourselves very, very well, and we think that we're going to capture a nice share of those.

The Ag Services and Oilseeds part, part of that has been our own improvement, part of that has been the industry. There has been some consolidations and the industry margins are strong. And there has been a strong demand, and we trust that that's going to continue to be a strong demand. There are 400 million people in the middle class in China that are consuming very much like U.S. type of consumer. And that's driving health and wellness, that's driving improving diets. And then there is sustainability that is driving a lot of the things that we're doing, not only RGD because remember that before RGD, we were already having a very tight oil market based on food, on food oil. So I think part are structural issues and part is our own improvements that we have done over this year."

Our enthusiasm is not only for the categories in which we are positioned, but also on the win rates and the customer engagement our customer engagement as of -- in 2021 have doubled our customer engagement last year. And as the economy is reopening and food service become more active, customers are more willing to launch new promotions and new products, something that they were not doing before. So we see that acceleration, whether it's in beverages or in health and wellness or alternative proteins.

Yes, there's been a lot of news regarding the recent Supreme Court ruling and some of the comments from the EPA. When you kind of cut through all the headlines and trying to understand like what's fundamentally happening. We still believe the buying administration and the EPA is committed to finding climate change and also decarbonizing the economy and biofuels, frankly, is in a very important part of that agenda. So the Biden administration has made it very clear that they don't intend to grant SREs or these small refinery exemptions like in the prior administrations. And as President Biden himself has said, he said that we should be insisting not exempting. So we do expect the Biden EPA to take a very balanced approach towards granting future SREs.
So when you look at supply-demand balances going forward, if you take a look at the RINs balances, and you think about the recovery of driving miles as we move through the pandemic. Our expectation is looking at supply/demand for ethanol, for gasoline and then which translates to ethanol. We believe that it is going to result in a reasonably constructive ethanol environment for the industry over the medium term.
Now at the same time, Mike, it is important to note that in the case of our -- we've made a strategic decision to monetize our dry mills. And so we kind of halted that process during the pandemic, frankly, because ethanol demand was very weak. But during that period, we did look at alternatives. We took advantage to, frankly, explore other options. And there's, frankly, as Jon talked about on the issue of sustainability. There's growing interest in sustainable materials and sustainable solutions. And it appears that there may be some opportunities for us to explore non-vehicle uses of ethanol and leveraging ethanol as a sustainable feedstock for other products.
And so one of the promising areas is the sustainable aviation for SAF, with the airline industry moving towards effectively a low carbon or net 0 future SAF appears to be an important component of how they will get there. And just for perspective, the U.S. airline industry before the pandemic consumed 30 billion gallons of aviation fuel a year. So we are looking at the possibility of leveraging our Decatur carbon sequestration site, which Juan talked about, with our corn processing output as a feedstock for SAS to get towards a low-carbon SAF product.
So in addition to looking at potential monetization of dry mills, we are looking at the SAF concept, which, frankly, may give us in our option for finding another use of the dry mills and then taking those ethanol gallons off the vehicle market."

They have recovered. So they have the consumer and they have the animals to actually consume. Of course, they are very strategic in their purchases. And right now, it's not the time to be buying a lot of things because beams are expensive and there is a crop in the U.S. coming. And we think that that's where when they're going to come.
You also have to remember a couple of things, Tom. Over the last 2 or 3 weeks, we lost 15 million tons of production around the world due to weather issues, whether it was the drought in Canada with -- that impacted canola and wheat, whether it was Russia, whether it was the impact was on sand and in wheat and whether it was the corn crop in Brazil because of drought. All these products are competitive products in the Russian to soybean meal. So those products will not be available to compete with soybean meal, which will give soybean meal a higher inclusion in duration.
And in our estimate, given the small canola crop in Canada, we think that China will have to probably import 2 million tons of extra soybean -- soybeans to offset that canola gap that they have right now. So all in all, we feel that we're still going to have strong exports -- export volumes in the Q4 of this year from North America."

Rob, the way we thought about it when we put together the plan is -- and I think I expressed some of that before is, of course, we look at the things that we can see into the future. You can argue the magnitude, but we give our forecast forward and we add inflation to that. And we say, some of these things may come back to the middle, if you will, or reverse to the means or whatever you want to call it. So let's put the negative side there. So we consider some of that.
And then we look at our productivity and innovation, and we said, can we build a robust enough agenda in productivity and innovation that actually can offset some of those headwinds. Whether there are headwinds on ethanol, where there are whatever your favorite crush margin into the future or whether it's inflation. And we look at that and the result of that exercise is that productivity and innovation earnings stream coming forward offset all that potential decline that we have estimated and offset it and giving us a result that high single-digit growth rate in profits over the next 5 years.
So that's the way we think about it. So this is not a scenario in which everything goes perfect, and margins are at a peak level for 5 years. In our scenario, margins normalize, we have inflation, and then we are able to offset a lot of that through growth and through productivity. That's what we are saying in terms of our new base."

So we need a full time full-fledged plant every couple of years just to keep up with demand and to be able to supply the growth.

It has been a tough year for Brazil this first half of the year, in general. We expect second half of the year to have the possibility to be a little better. Biodiesel is V12 now, and that has been confirmed. We will have to see the first auctions there. So crush margins are better. Domestic margins as are $25 to $30 per ton, export is about $10. Bottle oil and volumes and prices are better in the last 2 months, we started the year tough there. Remember that this is a society that is going through the tougher parts of COVID. So demand is difficult there. But we have seen an improvement.
Domestic meal, the market is also paying for the higher soybeans. So that's good. We have -- Brazil has reduced exports of corn, of course, because of the drought. But the domestic market is paying the premium. So Brazil is not going to run out of corn, and it's important a little bit from Brazil.
So I would say, in general, with oil -- domestic oil being supported and the volumes being there and with biodiesel going back to V12, we expect the second half of the year to be a little bit better than maybe what the first half was."

In terms of what is easier to integrate, I think that sometimes bolt-ons are a little bit this year. We find they fit better in a business that is already structured. Where you bring a large company, you need more adjustments on both sides, if you will. If you think about some of these companies have continued to operate in ADM almost like with the same agility they were operating before, whether you say [indiscernible] or Biopolis and some of these companies.

So on the -- I know we're short on time, I'll make this question pretty quick and pretty direct. It's really going back, I think, a little to maybe Adam's first question, maybe drilling down on some demand functions here in the near term. Obviously, you've addressed the global biodiesel markets, what's going on there, the U.S. ethanol, all the job owning of RFS and all that stuff. But people are talking about some chinks in the armor and some of the Chinese demand, at least in the near term, they've walked away a little bit of corn imports in July, which has bought a symbol pool. And I think it spooked the market. But I think the real issue here is ASF in China have they had a major setback in that? And we just don't know what to kind of believe what's coming out of there. And how you've had the floods in China that's impacted about 10% of their growing area has killed a lot of hogs. Is that -- is some of the near-term demand function a piece of the Chinese AFS problems that they're having?"

But the reality is that pork prices have come down, that will incentivate demand. But you also need to understand that in the -- during the ASF, people get to eat more poultry as well. And we have seen that demand growth.
We think that when we have a better supply and cheaper supply of soybeans, things will come back a little bit more to normal. When we check with our customers over there, fundamentally, nothing has changed. And if you look at the, as I said, the middle class in China and you look at the indicators of that, which is the consumption of the Big 4 protein, they are all higher than pre-pandemic levels. So the consumer is there, the animals are there to be fed.
And I think that the rest is just a matter of tactical approaches, whether we had the big run-up in hog prices in China then the government intervened to try to control that. Now they are lower. They said more wheat. I think that's going to shift to include more soybean in the portfolio in the inclusion. So we think that at the end of the day, there may be many monthly gyrations, but over time, protein consumption continues to go up and they will import more soybeans to actually satisfy that demand. So we feel very confident about the future of the demand in China."

I'm pleased to share with you results that continue to demonstrate our success in delivering strong and sustained earnings growth. This morning, we reported record second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.33. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, up 44% versus the second quarter of 2020.  
Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.5 billion, almost $900 million more than a year ago. And I'm proud to report that our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9.7%, which is both significantly higher than the 8.1% of the prior year period and also represents the achievement of our 10% objective.  
I'm proud of the entire ADM team for their great results this quarter. We're living up to our promises and our purpose. And the continuing execution of our strategy is delivering impressive, ongoing growth for our company, our customers and our shareholders. 
I'd like to take a moment to highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter.  Slide 4, please. Over the last decade, we made cultural, technology and process changes that help us revolutionize how we do our work every day. We started with operational excellence, added to that performance excellence and expanded into readiness, which encompassed a broader array of specific actions within our control to drive value creation, including profitable growth.  
Now as we enter the next phase of our strategic transformation, the concept of readiness will continue to be embedded in everything we do, but we will categorize our efforts going forward as either productivity or innovation. Productivity is about using new technologies and thinking to automate, digitize and standardize our processes. It's a lever under our control that allows us to enhance efficiencies and manage costs.  
One great example of our productivity work is the digitalization of our procurement center of excellence. We're implementing best-in-breed technology that's standardizing processes and reducing costs in our indirect procurement. Most importantly, this advancement is unleashing our colleagues to drive even greater value by transforming their work from tactical to strategic. That's just one example of the kind of initiatives we're pursuing under productivity.  Across the enterprise, our productivity efforts collectively are expected to deliver about $200 million in savings in calendar year 2021.  
Please turn to Slide 5. The other pillar of our strategy is innovation. Innovation is how we are delivering profitable growth. And one of the key ways we will support and propel our innovation work is through an initiative we launched this year called IFD. IFD is a fundamental realignment of our Human Nutrition business, commercial organization and go-to-market approach from a product-driven focus to a more customer-centric market; a segment-driven structure focused on 3 global market segments: global foods, global beverages, global health and wellness. We are now able to move from consumer insight to concept to prototype to final solution more efficiently than before. 
Already, IFD is enabling us to expand our sales pipelines and register record win rates. And this is only the start. IFD is a broad and ambitious effort, encompassing talent development, digital analytic and sales-enabling tools and streamlined product development processes, all designed to better match our vast pantry and technical development capabilities to our customers' needs and accelerate our speed to market.  
Slide 6, please. All of our strategic work is being supported and strengthened by our unique opportunity to use ADM's integrated value chain to advance the decarbonization of our industry. For example, late last year, our Decatur-based carbon capture and storage partnership, the world's first large-scale project to store carbon from a biofuel source, surpassed 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide safely and permanently stored more than a mile under the Earth's surface. That's the equivalent of removing about 650,000 cars from the road for a full year.  
And our efforts are continuing. We expect to sequester an additional 2.5 million tons -- million metric tons every -- over the next 5 years, and we have the ability to do even more. This project is a game changer, a valuable and unique asset in our efforts to decarbonize our production footprint and reduce the carbon intensity of our products, as demonstrated by our intention to work with 8 Rivers to help build an innovative zero-emission power plant that will utilize this carbon capture capability.  
Next slide, please. Our reorganization efforts span the entire ag value chain, including transportation. Plant-based liquid fuels will continue to play a growing role in transportation, both on the ground and in the air, and we are investing to ensure we can meet that expanding demand.  
In the second quarter, we were proud to announce the construction of North Dakota's first-ever dedicated soybean processing complex. We expect our new Spiritwood facility 600 million pounds of annual oil production to help support fast expanding production of renewable green diesel. We've already broken ground on the North Dakota complex, and we plan for it to be operational in 2023, in time to meet growing demand. We expect the demand for U.S. green diesel to continue securing higher rate of growth, increasing by about 1 billion gallons per year and reaching up to 5 billion gallons by 2025.  
Vegetable oils will be a key feedstock to meet that growing demand. And when you consider that it takes about 7.5 pounds of soybean oil to produce 1 gallon of renewable green diesel, you can appreciate the large potential opportunity and why we are investing to grow our participation both in North Dakota and with our expanded oil refining capacity in Quincy, Illinois.  
Slide 8, please. Another area in which our on-farm storage capabilities are helping us meet demand for more sustainable products is plant-based proteins. We made substantial investments in this space from our Campo Grande soy protein complex to our pea protein facility in North Dakota to our PlantPlus Foods joint venture. 
And as the opportunity for plant-based proteins accelerates by 12% a year, we are investing further to expand our participation.  Yesterday, we announced an agreement to purchase Sojaprotein, Southern Europe's largest producer of soy-based protein products. Sojaprotein is a perfect fit for our growth strategy. It represents a strategic addition to our global protein production capacity. It is a successful growing company with 2020 sales of more than $100 million and an extensive list of customers in 65 countries in the meat alternative, confectionery, protein bar, pharmaceutical, pet food and animal feed segments. And it's locally sourced. Exclusively non-GMO products are closely aligned with European consumer preferences.  
When I look back on these accomplishments, I see our ongoing strategic transformation is delivering at an accelerated pace. Our productivity and innovation focuses are powering performance and growth in large and fast-growing market opportunities, particularly those being propelled by strong consumer sentiment around sustainability. That's painting a bright future for ADM, which I will talk more about at the end of this call.  
But first, I'll turn it over to Ray to talk about our business performance. Ray?"

Move to Slide 9, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team followed up on their exceptional first quarter with another outstanding quarter. Ag Services results were higher year-over-year. 
The North American origination business delivered an outstanding second quarter, managing its positions effectively in a dynamic pricing environment and also achieved significantly higher export volumes driven by corn sales to China. South American origination was significantly lower than the previous year's quarter driven by slower farmer selling and high commodity prices, which impacted contract fulfillment. 
Global trade performance was lower than the second -- strong second quarter of 2020 when customers were building inventories in mid-COVID-19. Results were also impacted by timing impacts that should reverse.  
Crushing had substantially higher year-over-year results. The business executed well in an environment of strong vegetable oil demand to deliver higher execution margins in North America soy and EU softseeds. Results were partially offset by weaker soybean crush margins in South America driven by lower demand for biodiesel. In addition, there were about $70 million in net incremental negative timing effects, which should reverse in the coming quarters.  
Refined Products and Other results were significantly higher than the prior year period driven by continued recovery in foodservice as well as positive timing effects in North America, partially offset by the effects of the reduction in the Brazilian biodiesel mandates. Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher year-over-year. 
Now looking ahead, we expect Q3 performance for Ag Services and Oilseeds to be higher than the third quarter of 2020 driven by stronger results in crushing. We continue to anticipate full year results that will be significantly higher than 2020's very strong performance.  
Slide 10, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team did a great job delivering results that were almost double those of the prior year period. 
Starches and Sweeteners, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered substantially higher year-over-year results in a highly dynamic pricing environment driven by about $90 million in positioning gains across the ethanol complex as well as more normalized results from corn oil.  Sweetener volumes were higher, reflecting the beginnings of a recovery in demand from the foodservice channel. Ethanol margins improved versus the prior year period driven by a resurgence in driving miles in the United States. 
Vantage corn processor results were much higher than the second quarter of 2020, supported by the resumption of production of our 2 dry mills, improved fuel ethanol margins and favorable performance in USP-grade industrial alcohol from our Peoria complex.  
Now looking ahead, we expect tightening corn markets and their effects on ethanol margins to result in a third quarter for Carbohydrates Solutions that is lower compared to the third quarter of 2020, which included strong risk management gains. However, we expect full year Carbohydrate Solutions results to be substantially higher than 2020.  
Slide 11, please. Nutrition delivered record sales and profits with 15% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis and operating profit of more than $200 million. 
In Human Nutrition, revenue was 13% higher than the second quarter of last year on a constant currency basis and operating profits were up 24%. In North America and EMEA, the flavors business delivered strong volumes and improved product mix, particularly in the beverage segment. Specialty Ingredients delivered strong sales growth in specialty proteins, though results were lower due to certain onetime costs, mainly in texturants. In Health & Wellness, stronger sales and margins in probiotics were offset by higher cost in fibers due to planned facility downtime.  
Animal Nutrition revenue growth was 17% higher year-over-year on a constant currency basis and profits were up 44% as improved demand and margins in amino acids, strength in feed additives and ingredients and better performance in EMEA more than offset COVID-19 and labor-related impacts in other regions.  
Now looking ahead, we expect Nutrition, once again, to deliver higher year-over-year results in the third quarter. And with continued strong demand, product innovation and great go-to-market execution by the team, we are raising our expectations for full year profit growth to 20%. 
Slide 12, please. So let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. 
Other business results were substantially lower than the prior year period driven primarily by captive insurance underwriting losses, most of which were offset by corresponding recoveries in the other business segments. As expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased year-over-year on lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year.  
In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $248 million were driven primarily by higher performance-related compensation accruals, higher IT offering and project-related costs and transfers of costs from the business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations. In other corporate, results included a valuation gain in our ADM Ventures portfolio. 
Looking at total corporate costs, including net interest, corporate unallocated and other corporate, we are still on track for the calendar year to be overall similar to 2020.  
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 was approximately 14%. We still anticipate our calendar year effective tax rate to be in a range of 14% to 16%.  Our balance sheet remains solid despite a higher commodity price environment with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 29% and available liquidity of almost $9.5 billion.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Juan."

Slide 13, please. When I look back on our outstanding first half results following a record 2020, I see a team that is executing at a high level and a strategy that is delivering according to our plan. 
We have been constantly refreshing our portfolio, divesting from nonstrategic businesses and redeploying capital, consistent with our strategy. In doing so, we've built industry-leading capabilities to meet customer and consumer needs in high-growth categories, such as meat alternatives, a category we expect to reach more than $100 billion in sales worldwide by 2030 and in which our PlantPlus Foods joint venture now is participating, selling consumer products across Brazil and ready in its North American launch. 
Another example is dietary supplements, a segment on track to have $80 billion in sales globally by 2025; and in which, we're constantly expanding our product portfolio, including our recently introduced Bio-Kult Brighten, which includes ingredients to reduce tiredness and fatigue. And then there is pet food, which is forecast to grow to more than $130 billion globally by 2025, and an area in which we launched our new premium cat food in Mexico earlier this year. 
The list goes on. Renewable green diesel, pharmaceuticals and personal care, beverages, all large high-growth opportunities powered by macro consumer trends like sustainability and health and wellbeing. And in each of those segments and more, our unparalleled global footprint, fully integrated value chain, customer insight, broad portfolio and speed to market are setting us ahead of the competition and fueling our growth. That's why we are so optimistic about our path forward.
Of course, there are always going to be short-term factors for us to navigate. But those are not things that will impact our long-term success. Our confidence is rooted in the transformation we began a decade ago and which continues with our work in productivity and innovation as well as our expanding participation in large and fast-growing market opportunities.
So to conclude, we have a great start of the year, and we expect to continue our momentum in the second half to deliver very strong 2021 earnings. As we've discussed, we are moving to a new phase of our strategic growth plan. With what we have accomplished over the years on capital discipline, targeted cost reductions and cash generation and moving through our portfolio transformation and our efforts to optimize business performance, drive efficiencies and expand strategically, I believe we have successfully increased our base earnings power from $3 a share back in 2015 to a range of $4 to $4.50 this year.
And now as we enter the next stage of our growth, leveraging the key macro trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability with our continued focus on productivity and innovation and with future targeted investments, we believe our medium-term annual earnings trend growth rate will be in the high single-digit percentages from these $4 to $4.50 per share baseline.

As we started to see those goals in sight, we started on the development of the new phase of the strategy. So we took that base of $4 to $4.50, and we created a 5-year plan. When we put together that plan with all these opportunities that I highlighted and focused on productivity and innovation, that plan shows that from that base of $4 to $4.50 will grow over the next 5 years at the rate of high single-digit growth per year.

Just we've seen some volatility in oilseed crush margins around the world of late. It seems like, especially in China, the soy meal demand has waned a little bit with the wheat substitution, and it seems like the global industry is really crushing for veg oil given all the RD demand around the world. Can you just help us think about kind of how that rolls forward as we think, especially with -- for you more heavily weighted towards soybeans and some pressure in terms of softseed crop availability on the oil side as we go through the balance of the year and into '22?"

So listen, we are very optimistic about the prospects for crush for the rest of the year and into next year. And if I go by geography, as I always do, from a North American perspective, margin remains exceptionally strong in North Am",562,"Yes. Thank you, Adam. So listen, we are very optimistic about the prospects for crush for the rest of the year and into next year. And if I go by geography, as I always do, from a North American perspective, margin remains exceptionally strong in North America in the $45 to $50 range. As you said, with a strong vegetable oil demand in part driven by RGD, but we had already a very good oil demand and we see more recovery of our foodservices and more reopening of the economy. And that continues to enhance, of course, the oil share of the crush contribution.
And also, the tightening supplies and logistical issues in South America are allowing also U.S. soybean meal to be a little bit more competitive in global markets. We see some compression in European soy margins maybe to $10 to $20 as prices basically from South America oil imports are pressuring crush margins, especially, this is the time of the year in which Argentina and Brazil are the most competitive. They are in the middle of the harvest. And of course, they have reduced their biodiesel mandate, so there is more oil exportable, if you will. Although the beauty of our long supply chain is that as crush margins have softened in Europe, we got the benefit in biodiesel and the RPV given that.
Brazil margins continue to remain solid for domestic plants with maybe $25 to $35 despite the B10 biodiesel situation. And they are expected to remain solid as they move to higher B12 blend rates in the future, starting I think in September.
China margins are low due to high bean prices and lower soybean in demand. The herd is going through a rebalance there. And at the moment, there is a lot of wheat feed being fed. And -- but we're going to go through the harvest of wheat. And I think that's something that we see with optimism going forward is that if you look at all the substitutes that we were facing last year, whether it was sorghum or canola or sun or wheat, they have increased their inclusion in the Russians. And now all those things are having either weather issues or which is going to go through the harvest. So we see now the ability of soybean meal and corn inclusions to go up, and that's positive as we go forward.
As you mentioned, on our watch list is canola margins. They have weakened. They were very strong in the first -- during the first half and -- but they have weakened on concern of a short drop driven by the dryness in Canada. And canola margins are probably going to remain volatile until there is more certainty around the Canadian crop side. 
So 2 factors that we feel good about here is how valuable our switch capacity is in this dynamic environment, margins have shifted and also how important it is our integration, our long value chain. If you think North America today is capturing it in crush and maybe less so in biodiesel in Europe, we don't capture that much in crush, but we capture it in biodiesel. So all this ability of our footprint to allow us to follow the margin as it moves through the value chain has been very, very beneficial in these very volatile times."

Second, as we explained before, we have very good risk management that the team positioned very well on corn and on the ethanol complex. And certainly, sweeteners volumes came back versus last year as customers were preparing for the summer. And to a certain degree, you might have to take both Q2 and Q3 together from a sweetener perspective because I think that a lot of customers bought in anticipation of refilling their pipeline given the summer and the openness with COVID that we will go into experience in the U.S. So it was a strong volume month as well."

Again, when we look at our plan, when we start from this again, theoretical, $4 to $4.50 range, and we apply all these projects that are included in productivity and innovation, we see our program over the next 5 years growing in the high single-digit percentage every year in operating profit. 
So we feel very good about that. We will be having, Ken, in Q4 an Investor Day where we will be disclosing much more details and much more granularity about all these.  
But you can see some of the things that we're doing already, whether we are invested in Spiritwood or the acquisition of Sojaprotein or the expansions of our plant in Valencia with Biopolis and microbiome. So all these areas are receiving organic growth dollars. This will be -- as we go forward, Ken, and you look at this plan, this is more an investment plan than maybe the previous period was. 
So you will see a little bit more CapEx and a little bit more investment given the size of the opportunities. When I was mentioning some of the sizes of these addressable markets we have, if you added some of the things I was saying, these are markets north of $300 billion in which we have positioned ourselves very, very well, and we think that we're going to capture a nice share of those.

Yes, there's been a lot of news regarding the recent Supreme Court ruling and some of the comments from the EPA. When you kind of cut through all the headlines and try to understand like what's fundamentally happening, we still believe the Biden administration and the EPA is committed to fighting climate change and also decarbonizing the economy. And biofuels, frankly, is in a very important part of that agenda. So the Biden administration has made it very clear that they don't intend to grant SREs, or these small refinery exemptions, like in the prior administrations. And as President Biden himself has said, he said that we should be insisting not exempting. So we do expect the Biden EPA to take a very balanced approach towards granting future SREs.
So when you look at supply-demand balances going forward and you take a look at the RINs balances and you think about the recovery of driving miles as we move through the pandemic, our expectation is looking at supply/demand for ethanol -- for gasoline and then which translates to ethanol, we believe that it is going to result in a reasonably constructive ethanol environment for the industry over the medium term.
Now at the same time, Mike, it is important to note that in the case of our -- we've made a strategic decision to monetize our dry mills. And so we kind of halted that process during the pandemic, frankly, because ethanol demand was very weak. But during that period, we did look at alternatives. We took advantage to, frankly, explore other options. And there's -- frankly, as Juan talked about on the issue of sustainability, there's growing interest in sustainable materials and sustainable solutions. And it appears that there may be some opportunities for us to explore non-vehicle uses of ethanol and leveraging ethanol as a sustainable feedstock for other products.
And so one of the promising areas is the sustainable aviation fuel, SAF. With the airline industry moving towards effectively a low-carbon or a net-zero future, SAF appears to be an important component of how they will get there. And just for perspective, the U.S. airline industry before the pandemic consumed 30 billion gallons of aviation fuel a year. So we are looking at the possibility of leveraging our Decatur carbon sequestration site, which Juan talked about, with our corn processing output as a feedstock for SAF to get towards a low-carbon SAF product.
So in addition to looking at potential monetization of dry mills, we are looking at the SAF concept, which, frankly, may give us another option for finding another use of the dry mills and then taking those ethanol gallons off the vehicle market."

Now with this, we have bought -- we have acquired the largest producer in Europe, which, again, has a great footprint of -- in the middle of the non-GMO soybean harvest area, but also it has a very nice set of products and they sell to 65 different countries in many, many applications.
So we continue to build the capabilities. This will not be the last one that you're going to hear in terms of announcements for specialty protein. Again, this is -- these are early days, but it's a fast-growing market in which we have a leadership position, and we pretend to -- we intend to expand."

Listen, I think that we are maybe more optimistic about China medium term than maybe with the news are giving right now. China has done an exceptional job of controlling COVID. And as such, they have recovered from that very successfully. So there is a lot of economic activity and hence, demand. They have done a terrific job in coming back from the ASF pandemic. They have recovered. So they have the consumer and they have the animals to actually consume. Of course, they are very strategic in their purchases. And right now, it's not the time to be buying a lot of beans because beans are expensive and there is a crop in the U.S. coming. And we think that that's where -- when they're going to come.
You also have to remember a couple of things, Tom. Over the last 2 or 3 weeks, we lost 15 million tons of production around the world due to weather issues. Whether it was the drought in Canada with -- that impacted canola and wheat, whether it was Russia, whether it was the impact was on sand and in wheat and whether it was the corn crop in Brazil because of drought, all these products are competitive products in the Russian to soybean meal. 
So those products will not be available to compete with soybean meal, which will give soybean meal a higher inclusion in the ration.  And in our estimate, given the small canola crop in Canada, we think that China will have to probably import 2 million tons of extra soybean -- soybeans to offset that canola gap that they have right now.  
So all in all, we feel that we're still going to have strong exports -- export volumes in the Q4 of this year from North America."

Rob, the way we thought about it when we put together the plan is -- and I think I expressed some of that before is, of course, we look at the things that we can see into the future. You can argue the magnitude, but we give our forecast forward and we add inflation to that. And we say, some of these things may come back to the middle, if you will, or reverse to the means or whatever you want to call it. So let's put the negative side there. So we consider some of that.
And then we look at our productivity and innovation, and we said, ""Can we build a robust enough agenda in productivity and innovation that actually can offset some of those headwinds, whether they are headwinds on ethanol or whether they are whatever your favorite crush margin into the future or whether it's inflation?"" And we look at that and the result of that exercise is that productivity and innovation earnings stream coming forward offset all that potential decline that we have estimated and offset it and giving us a result that high single-digit growth rate in profits over the next 5 years.
So that's the way we think about it. So this is not a scenario in which everything goes perfect and margins are at peak level for 5 years. In our scenario, margins normalize, we have inflation and then we are able to offset a lot of that through growth and through productivity. That's what we are saying in terms of our new base."

So we need a full-time, full-fledged plant every couple of years just to keep up with demand and to be able to supply the growth. So we don't think that any of these build is excessive.

And when you just talk about managing risk is both managing the risks of the inputs and the outputs.

So it's a combination of how they're managing the corn, how they're managing ethanol, how they're managing RINs, all these positions. And as you know, it was a very volatile quarter when you looked at the prices of corn and ethanol and RINs, but they managed exceptionally well. And so $90 million, normally, they would generate risk management gains. We highlighted it this quarter because this was an exceptional quarter.  And by the way, it wasn't just an exceptional quarter. It was an exceptional first half of the year because when you take a look at the first half of the year, they probably had positioning gains roughly with a similar amount in the first quarter as well.

So crush margins are better. Domestic margins are $25 to $30 per ton, export is about $10. Bottle oil and volumes and prices are better in the last 2 months. We started the year tough there. Remember that this is a society that is going through the tougher parts of COVID. So demand is difficult there. But we have seen an improvement.
Domestic meal, the market is also paying for the higher soybeans. So that's good. We have -- Brazil has reduced exports of corn, of course, because of the drought. But the domestic market is paying the premium. So Brazil is not going to run out of corn and it's importing a little bit from Brazil.

When you bring a large company, you need more adjustments on both sides, if you will, if you think about some of these companies that have continued to operate in ADM almost like with the same agility they were operating before, whether you say Protexin or Biopolis and some of these companies.

We think that when we have a better supply and cheaper supply of soybeans, things will come back a little bit more to normal. When we check with our customers over there, fundamentally, nothing has changed. And if you look at the -- as I said, the middle class in China and you look at the indicators of that, which is the consumption of the big 4 protein, they are all higher than prepandemic levels. 
So the consumer is there, the animals are there to be fed.  And I think that the rest is just a matter of tactical approaches, whether we had the big run-up in hog prices in China, then the government intervened to try to control that. Now they are lower. They said more wheat. I think that's going to shift to include more soybean in the portfolio -- in the inclusion. So we think that at the end of the day, there may be many monthly gyrations, but over time, protein consumption continues to go up and they will import more soybeans to actually satisfy that demand.

This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.97. That is a 9% year-over-year improvement despite a higher tax rate.

That is a 9% year-over-year improvement despite a higher tax rate. And our year-to-date adjusted EPS of $3.69 is already above our full year 2020 adjusted EPS. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1 billion, up 18% versus the third quarter of 2020 and our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year OP growth.
Our trailing 4-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.6 billion, almost $1 billion more than a year ago. And our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9.6%, significantly higher versus the year ago period. I remain proud to lead a global team that is delivering robust returns and sustained growth in profits. Our strong quarter and our ongoing upward trajectory are a testament to our team's execution and agility and the consistent implementation of our strategic plan.
I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter. Slide 4, please. I'd like to start by talking about our approach to portfolio management. Our starting point is the belief that in order to thrive and create value, the company needs to have a dynamic view of its business portfolio. So when we talk about the dramatic transformation of our portfolio over the last 10 years, it's not a discrete event. It's a representation of our continuous work to identify opportunities for growth and improvement. Of course, those opportunities maybe -- must be the right ones.
The enduring trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability provide unique and stable opportunities for ADM to expand our existing capabilities. And we are focusing our efforts on identifying high-growth, on-trend areas with attractive margins and which are adjacent to our existing capabilities. That focus informed the building of our global nutrition business. The acquisition of WILD gave us entry into flavors and a global taste platform. We then used bolt-on acquisitions to add adjacent capabilities and build a one-stop shop with an industry-leading pantry of ingredients and solutions for Human Nutrition.
We do the same for Animal Nutrition with the acquisition of Neovia, and we continue to do the same today across our business. In order to meet growing demand for sustainable solutions, we have announced a joint venture and offtake agreement with Marathon Oil Company to support the production of renewable diesel.
We are continuing to invest in key nutrition categories. As demand for alternative protein grows from $10 billion to $30 billion over the next decade, we are further enhancing our capabilities with the acquisition of Sojaprotein. And with global demand for pet food growing to $140 billion in the coming years, we are continuing our growth with a 75% ownership stake in PetDine.
In the area of microbiome, we've signed an agreement with Vland Biotech to launch a joint venture that we're perfectly positioned to help meet $1 billion in retail demand for probiotics in China. These are just some examples of how we are dynamically positioned in our portfolio to continue driving growth for years to come. There will be more to come, and you can expect an increased level of investments to support our sustainable earnings growth and further expand our capacity and capabilities.
Please turn to Slide 5. As part of our portfolio management approach, we're working to evolve our Carbohydrate Solutions business, expanding our array of solutions to meet growing customer demand driven by the enduring trend of sustainability. We made significant progress recently focused on 2 areas: new opportunities for our alcohol production and our growing BioSolutions platform. Let me start with alcohol. Last Thursday, we announced that we reached an agreement, which we expect to close at the end of the month, to sell our ethanol facility in Pori. And yesterday, we announced a memorandum of understanding with Gevo to explore potential joint ventures, one of which will include our Columbus and Cedar Rapids dry mills and our ethanol assets indicator, transitioning 900 million gallons of ethanol production to support growing demand for low-carbon sustainable aviation fuel. These actions represent our commitment to a process that we began when we first announced the strategic review of our dry mills.
Taken together, they will allow us to significantly reduce our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol while using our expertise and assets to capitalize on new opportunities. SAF is one of those opportunities. The U.S. and EU have set goals that together would support almost 4 billion gallons of annual sustainable aviation fuel production by 2030 and more than 45 billion by 2050.
The other focus area for our Carbohydrate Solutions evolution is our BioSolutions growth platform. BioSolutions, which we launched about a year ago, is an effort focused on using our product streams to expand our participation in sustainable, higher-margin solutions for attractive end markets like pharmaceuticals and personal care. This is an area of significant potential, and our team is doing a great job identifying new and exciting opportunities.
Earlier this fall, for example, we signed an MOU with LG Chem for the production of lactic and polylactic acid for bioplastics and other plant-based products. These efforts are enabling BioSolutions to deliver 10% annualized revenue growth, including more than $80 million in new revenue wins in the first 9 months of this year, and we believe there are many new opportunities to come.
So from the transformation of our dry mills to our growing BioSolutions platform, our work to evolve our Carbohydrate Solutions' capabilities is a perfect example of how we're managing our portfolio and delivering a smart strategic growth and one of the many reasons we remain convinced on our ability to deliver sustainable earnings growth in the years to come. We'll talk a little bit more about our business outlook at the end of our call. And of course, we'll be going into much more detail at our Global Investor Day on December 10.
But in the meantime, I will turn the call to -- over to Ray to talk about our business performance. Ray?"
251704,1684524922,2412602,"Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Archer-Daniels-Midland Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Juan. Slide 6, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team continued their outstanding year with another quarter of substantial profit growth. In Ag Services, we're proud of the hole team executed in a challenging environment, including a swift",900,"Yes. Thanks, Juan. Slide 6, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team continued their outstanding year with another quarter of substantial profit growth. In Ag Services, we're proud of the hole team executed in a challenging environment, including a swift return to operation after Hurricane Ida. Overall results were significantly lower versus the prior year quarter, driven by approximately $50 million in net timing effects that should reverse in coming quarters as well as $54 million in insurance settlement recorded in the prior year period and lower export volumes caused by Hurricane Ida. Global Trade continues its strong performance.
The Crushing team delivered substantially higher year-over-year results, executed well, delivering stronger margins in a dynamic environment that includes strong demand for vegetable oils to support our existing food customers as well as the increasing production of renewable diesel. Results were also driven by about $70 million in net positive timing effects in the quarter.
Refined Products and Other results were significantly higher than prior year period, driven by positive timing effects of approximately $80 million that are expected to reverse in future quarters. Strong execution in EMEA and North American biodiesel and strong refining premiums due to demand for renewable diesel and foodservice recovery in North America also contributed to the results. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower year-over-year.
Now looking ahead, we expect to see continued fundamental demand strength for Ag Service and Oilseeds products, including from China, as well as solid global soybean crush margin environment in the fourth quarter, partially offset by some higher manufacturing costs. In addition, RPO will be negatively impacted by timing reversals. All told, we expect results in the fourth quarter to be significantly higher than the third quarter of this year.
Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solution results were lower year-over-year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, showed their agility by managing through dynamic market conditions and optimizing mix between sweeteners and ethanol production through the quarter. Year-over-year results were significantly lower primarily due to higher input costs. Vantage corn processor results were much higher versus the third quarter of 2020, supported by the resumption of production at our 2 dry mills and improved fuel ethanol margins, particularly late in the quarter.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the solid fundamentals from the end of the third quarter to continue for Carbohydrate Solutions, with good ethanol margins extending through the quarter due to industry supply-demand balance and solid demand for corn oil and starches, offset by higher manufacturing costs, particularly in Europe, as well as the absence of the Peoria dry mill. All told, fourth quarter results for the segment should be similar to the previous year fourth quarter.
On Slide 8, the Nutrition business remains on its solid growth trajectory with 17% higher revenues and 15% on a constant currency basis and 20% higher profits year-over-year and continued strong EBITDA margins. The Human Nutrition team delivered revenue growth of 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, helping to drive 9% higher profits. Higher volume, improved product mix, particular strength in beverage drove strong flavor results in EMEA and North America, partially offset by lower results in APAC. Specialty Ingredients continued to benefit from strong demand for alternative road teams offset by some higher costs. Health & Wellness results were higher on robust sales growth in bioactives and fiber.
Animal Nutrition profits were nearly double the year ago period, and sales were up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the strength in the meal assets as well as feed advise and ingredients, partially offset by higher costs in Lat Am and slower demand recovery in APAC.
Looking ahead, we expect Nutrition to continue on its impressive growth path, with strength across the Human and Animal Nutrition leading to strong year-over-year earnings expansion in the fourth quarter and a 20% full year growth versus 2020.
Slide 9, please. Let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were substantially lower than the prior year period, driven primarily by captive insurance underwriting losses, most of which were offset by corresponding recoveries in the other business segments. We expect fourth quarter to have some additional insurance underwriting losses, resulting in a break-even other business for the fourth quarter.
As expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased year-over-year on lower interest rates and to favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $230 million were driven primarily by higher IT offering and project-related costs and transfers of costs from business segments into the centralized Centers of Excellence in supply chain and operations.
Looking at total corporate costs, including net interest, corporate unallocated and other corporate, we are still on track for the calendar year to be overall similar to 2020. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was approximately 18%. We anticipate our calendar year adjusted effective tax rate to be the upper end of our previously communicated range of 14% to 16% and potentially a bit higher, depending upon the geographic mix in the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 26% and available liquidity of about $11.5 billion.
With that, I'll turn it back to Juan."

From consistent sustained profit growth to the ongoing management of our business and product portfolio, our team has a lot to be proud of. And there's one other thing we achieved last quarter that I want to mention. We had many team members impacted when Hurricane Ida hit in late August. So we provided temporary housing arrangements, portable generators, food and water and more. In fact, many ADM colleagues travel to the region and spend time helping repair their coworkers' damaged homes. I'm very proud of that. I'm very thankful to our team.
I'll keep the rest of my closing short as we plan to go into our outlook in far more depth on our December 10 Global Investor Day. As I look back at the third quarter and all of the last 9 months, I continue to see a team and a company that are delivering on our goals and our purpose. We are closing out 2021 with great momentum. We're on track for a strong fourth quarter and a second consecutive year of record earnings per share. And as we look ahead to 2022, we see another strong year for ADM.
A robust global demand environment will continue to offer opportunities for us to leverage our indispensable global origination, processing and logistics capabilities. And Nutrition will continue on its strong growth trajectory, in line with our 15% per annum trend rate goals and on its way to $1 billion in operating profit in the coming years.
Of course, there are things we continue to watch, including energy costs and inflation more widely. But thanks to our unique value chain and global footprint, our unmatched abilities to meet needs in the enduring trend areas of food security, health and well-being and sustainability and a truly unparalleled team of nearly 40,000 colleagues around the world, we remain very optimistic in a strong year to come.

So on the announcement yesterday, congratulations. A couple of questions. One is when you think about the total opportunity for SAF, obviously, the embedded demand is significant given SAF seems like one of the most pertinent ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the jet fuel market. The economics for producers, though, are unclear at this time. So I'm curious, as you think about engaging with Gevo on this partnership, one, what got you comfortable to commit these facilities to this end market ultimately? And then help us think about kind of the evolution of how the agreement will mature because it's a memorandum of understanding. Why did you go with that initially versus a more legally binding agreement? And then if you could just talk just bigger picture about how you feel about the ultimate demand and the implications for the ethanol markets, that would be helpful. I know a lot in there, but I'd love to hear you talk about it."

Listen, we've been looking at options for the dry mills for a very, very long time. So we've been studying the opportunities for the ADM shareholders to -- as we try to divest these assets.
Certainly, when we look at the sustainability trends and the opportunities, remember, one of the issues with these assets are they are very large, which become -- which became a little bit of an issue at the time of divesting them. So we were looking for opportunities that are sizable, where that size turns into a competitive advantage. So certainly, when you look at all industries trying to decarbonize, the aviation industry is a massive industry that contributes to CO2. And we have identified and we have checked with partners, strategic partners, people in the industry, that SAF is the solution.
And I think we see also concurrently that both the U.S. and the European governments are looking at SAF and are trying to incentivize the demand for that. So you heard President Biden or Secretary Grana making statements about that. So we see a very positive environment developing for this, a very sizable addressable market for us. And when you combine our size with our raw material procurements and our cost and the ability to decarbonize based on our carbon capture and sequestration that, as you recall, we've been running since 2017, allows that complex to provide very competitive low-CI fuels for the industry.
There are going to be a lot of discussions from here on. That's why -- but this is significant for us, so we decided to announce this. There is -- there are many opportunities and options here. So we have announced what potentially could happen, which is the creation of these 2 joint ventures. In one of those joint ventures, ADM's contribution will be the 2 dry mills as our objective is, as you know, to deconsolidate these 2.
So again -- but there's still many discussions to happen and many, many partners to join us into this. We are thinking over time to have a minority position in this and having probably strategic or financial partners to join us. So -- but overall, you can be assured, this is a better outcome for our shareholders in terms of the realization of value from these 2 drivers. So we're very excited about the opportunities."

We are estimating exports from the U.S. in volumes similar to last year. So -- and if you think about the capacity situation last year, we didn't have reserve this year. Unfortunately, one of our competitors' plant is down because of Ida. So kind of about the same situation.
And then we continue to see Nutrition growing at 15% to 20%. So of course, we have inflation. We have energy issues that the team is dealing with it and trying to mitigate, but we are coming into Q4 and into Q1 with a strong momentum. If you look at Q1, we feel very strong about crush margins. Our export window, given that in September, we didn't export that much, is probably going to be extended into January and February, a little bit like -- maybe even longer than last year. So we're still very good at the moment. But again, with an environment that there are supply chain issues, there are energy inflation rising, so we will have to manage all that.

So -- but of course, we're going to have some exposure to ethanol on a long-term basis because we still own the wet mills. But what you have to think about it is that in our analysis, the supply/demand fundamentals change for ethanol. First of all, remember, we always said we didn't like the undifferentiated nature of dry mills. In wet mills, we have more options to protect margins and to protect returns.
But second is by taking all this capacity out of the market basically, the 900 million gallons in about 2 years are going to move from vehicle ethanol to SAF feedstock, then we think that the supply-demand fundamentals and the margin environment of ethanol will change. So we feel that, that concludes our strategic assessment. Of course, we need to now execute on this transaction. We still have a lot to be discussed."

At the same time, you're right, in the ethanol margins that we're seeing right now, the market are extremely healthy. And that's just reflective of a very tight supply-demand situation right now. And industry inventories have fallen down to 20 million barrels right now.
And when you take a look at driving miles and gasoline demand, we're basically back to pre-pandemic levels of demand again. And so on the positive side, I would have to say the ethanol margins are pretty robust.
On the issue of sweeteners and starches, what's interesting is, while a lot of people kind of focus on the HFCS side of the business, the other parts of our business are doing extremely well, the non-HFCS business, for example, citric acid demand. It's extremely strong. Starches demand, extremely strong.

Some of these deals, you have to understand, are just bolt-ons where we plug some capacity where we don't have, like in Sojaproteins, things like that. And some other ones become more platforms that actually give us a pivot to accelerate even more our growth rates.
So -- But we will continue in an investment phase on Nutrition because the opportunities are there. Our customers are reacting positively to our value proposition. And we see our pipeline and our quarterly wins continue to grow.

So we think that the volumes, although maybe slightly in a different way than last year, right now, consumers are a little bit more -- short term, more hand to mouth, if you will, because they were expecting from a little bit of a correction in prices as we were hitting the harvest. But we've seen Chinese buyers come to the U.S. in the last few weeks, and we feel very good about this export season.
You have to remember that we were in a tight situation from a supply-demand perspective given these import numbers.

So in Asia Pacific, we've been players in flavors for a while, and this is just an expansion. This is not about an hour away from a big center of consumption. So we feel very good from a raw material perspective. We feel very good from an access to a big consumption base, and this will be very important for our customers.
Our participation in Asia was limited to one plant for flavors and about a handful of plants for Animal Nutrition. And we continue to build that position in Animal Nutrition. We feel very good about it. And then in this opportunity in flavors, we will enhance our capabilities, not just production but also market development capabilities for customer innovation centers.
So you will see us going and putting more flags on the world in the developing areas, whether it's Asia Pacific or South America, as we need to go and support our global customers. These are our customers that we do business every day here, and some of them are represented there. But also, we have a lot of new local customers that are requiring these capabilities.

So at this point in time, soy is the main driver for us. OP is a little bit like an additive or a supplement or a differentiator. So from a volume perspective, it's not a big impact. So we haven't felt any impact in our plan at all."

When we think about BioSolutions, our objective, Vince, is to make maybe the first derivative, so the first liquid, if you will, and that to have an ownership position. But when we start making chemicals or other products that require application technology and all that, we cannot become a chemical company. So in that, we'll let the partner take a predominant position.
So we make corn grind plus one, if you will, and then we let our partners take it from there. It's just a matter of optimized capital for us and not invest in areas where we are not -- that are not core for us. Core areas for us will continue to be food and feed and beverages. When we go into these materials, if you will, we're going to produce on liquid that makes sense, and then we have the partner doing the rest."

As a follow-up, on the fertilizer issue, obviously, the availability concerns, but it seems like it's happening is that the high prices are deferring fertilizer purchases, particularly in South America, and pess, the big soy groups, outliner farmers to buy less fertilizer, et cetera? And do your slide showing that farmer sales are, I guess, at a 5-year average, which is probably okay, but they're well below last year and probably the year before. So what impact does that have on your Origination business?

But this is a start, if you will. All these companies that are promising decarbonization by 2050, 2060, 2040, whatever that is, as they are looking back at their portfolio, they need to clean their portfolios, if you will. And one of their ways to do that is through recycling. The other way to do it is to going plant-based. So we are receiving a lot of inbound requests on that. And we're looking at our assets, our ability to produce plant-based products and our carbon capture and sequestration that provides an opportunity to make lower-CI products.
And we are trying to maximize the opportunity for ADM on all these. So some of these things may not be that well defined because we are in the process of optimizing all that value. for the ADM shareholders. But it's a great opportunity for us.

That is a 9% year-over-year improvement despite a higher tax rate. And our year-to-date adjusted EPS of $3.69 is already above our full year 2020 adjusted EPS. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1 billion, up 18% versus the third quarter of 2020 and our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year OP growth.
Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.6 billion, almost $1 billion more than a year ago. And our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9.6%, significantly higher versus the year ago period. I remain proud to lead a global team that is delivering robust returns and sustained growth in profits. Our strong quarter and our ongoing upward trajectory are a testament to our team's execution and agility and the consistent implementation of our strategic plan.
I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter. Slide 4, please. I'd like to start by talking about our approach to portfolio management. Our starting point is the belief that in order to thrive and create value, the company needs to have a dynamic view of its business portfolio. So when we talk about the dramatic transformation of our portfolio over the last 10 years, it's not a discrete event. It's a representation of our continuous work to identify opportunities for growth and improvement. Of course, those opportunities maybe -- must be the right ones.
The enduring trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability provide unique and stable opportunities for ADM to expand our existing capabilities. And we are focusing our efforts on identifying high-growth, on-trend areas with attractive margins and which are adjacent to our existing capabilities. That focus informed the building of our global nutrition business. The acquisition of WILD gave us entry into flavors and a global taste platform. We then used bolt-on acquisitions to add adjacent capabilities and build a one-stop shop with an industry-leading pantry of ingredients and solutions for Human Nutrition.
We did the same for Animal Nutrition with the acquisition of Neovia, and we continue to do the same today across our business. In order to meet growing demand for sustainable solutions, we have announced a joint venture and offtake agreement with Marathon Oil Company to support the production of renewable diesel.
We are continuing to invest in key nutrition categories. As demand for alternative protein grows from $10 billion to $30 billion over the next decade, we are further enhancing our capabilities with the acquisition of Sojaprotein. And with global demand for pet food growing to $140 billion in the coming years, we are continuing our growth with a 75% ownership stake in PetDine.
In the area of microbiome, we've signed an agreement with Vland Biotech to launch a joint venture that will perfectly position to help meet $1 billion in retail demand for probiotics in China. These are just some examples of how we are dynamically positioning our portfolio to continue driving growth for years to come. There will be more to come, and you can expect an increased level of investments to support our sustainable earnings growth and further expand our capacity and capabilities.
Please turn to Slide 5. As part of our portfolio management approach, we're working to evolve our Carbohydrate Solutions business, expanding our array of solutions to meet growing customer demand, driven by the enduring trend of sustainability. We made significant progress recently focused on 2 areas: new opportunities for our alcohol production and our growing biosolutions platform. Let me start with alcohol. Last Thursday, we announced that we reached an agreement, which we expect to close at the end of the month, to sell our ethanol facility in Peoria. And yesterday, we announced a memorandum of understanding with Gevo to explore potential joint ventures, one of which will include our Columbus and Cedar Rapids dry mills and our ethanol assets indicator, transitioning 900 million gallons of ethanol production to support growing demand for low-carbon sustainable aviation fuel. These actions represent our commitment to a process that we began when we first announced the strategic review of our dry mills.
Taken together, they will allow us to significantly reduce our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol while using our expertise and assets to capitalize on new opportunities. SAF is one of those opportunities. The U.S. and EU have set goals that together would support almost 4 billion gallons of annual sustainable aviation fuel production by 2030 and more than 45 billion by 2050.
The other focus area for our Carbohydrate Solutions evolution is our biosolutions growth platform. Biosolutions, which we launched about a year ago, is an effort focused on using our product streams to expand our participation in sustainable, higher-margin solutions for attractive end markets like pharmaceuticals and personal care. This is an area of significant potential, and our team is doing a great job identifying new and exciting opportunities.
Earlier this fall, for example, we signed an MOU with LG Chem for the production of lactic and polylactic acid for bioplastics and other plant-based products. These efforts are enabling biosolutions to deliver 10% annualized revenue growth, including more than $80 million in new revenue wins in the first 9 months of this year, and we believe there are many new opportunities to come.
So from the transformation of our dry mills to our growing biosolutions platform, our work to evolve our Carbohydrate Solutions capabilities is a perfect example of how we're managing our portfolio and delivering a smart strategic growth and one of the many reasons we remain convinced on our ability to deliver sustainable earnings growth in the years to come. I'll talk a little bit more about our business outlook at the end of our call. And of course, we'll be going into much more detail at our Global Investor Day on December 10.
But in the meantime, I will turn the call to -- over to Ray to talk about our business performance. Ray?"

The Ag Services and Oilseeds team continued their outstanding year with another quarter of substantial profit growth. In Ag Services, we're proud of how the team executed in a challenging environment, including a swift return to operation after Hurricane Ida. Overall results were significantly lower versus the prior year quarter driven by approximately $50 million in net timing effects that should reverse in coming quarters as well as $54 million in insurance settlement recorded in the prior year period and lower export volumes caused by Hurricane Ida. Global trade continues its strong performance.
The Crushing team delivered substantially higher year-over-year results, executed well, delivering stronger margins in a dynamic environment that includes strong demand for vegetable oils to support our existing food customers as well as the increasing production of renewable diesel. Results were also driven by about $70 million in net positive timing effects in the quarter.
Refined Products and Other results were significantly higher than prior year period, driven by positive timing effects of approximately $80 million that are expected to reverse in future quarters. Strong execution in EMEA and North American biodiesel and strong refining premiums due to demand for renewable diesel and food service recovery in North America also contributed to the results. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower year-over-year.
Now looking ahead, we expect to see continued fundamental demand strength for Ag Services and Oilseeds products, including from China, as well as solid global soybean crush margin environment in the fourth quarter, partially offset by some higher manufacturing costs. In addition, RPO will be negatively impacted by timing reversals. All told, we expect results in the fourth quarter to be significantly higher than the third quarter of this year.
Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were lower year-over-year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, showed their agility by managing through dynamic market conditions and optimizing mix between sweeteners and ethanol production through the quarter. Year-over-year results were significantly lower primarily due to higher input costs. Vantage Corn Processor results were much higher versus the third quarter of 2020, supported by the resumption of production at our 2 dry mills and improved fuel ethanol margins, particularly late in the quarter.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the solid fundamentals from the end of the third quarter to continue for Carbohydrate Solutions, with good ethanol margins extending through the quarter due to industry supply-demand balance and solid demand for corn oil and starches, offset by higher manufacturing costs, particularly in Europe, as well as the absence of the Peoria dry mill. All told, fourth quarter results for the segment should be similar to the previous year fourth quarter.
On Slide 8, the Nutrition business remains on its solid growth trajectory with 17% higher revenues and 15% on a constant currency basis and 20% higher profits year-over-year and continued strong EBITDA margins. The Human Nutrition team delivered revenue growth of 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, helping to drive 9% higher profits. Higher volume, improved product mix, particular strength in beverage drove strong flavor results in EMEA and North America, partially offset by lower results in APAC. Specialty Ingredients continued to benefit from strong demand for alternative proteins, offset by some higher costs. Health & Wellness results were higher on robust sales growth in bioactives and fiber.
Animal Nutrition profits were nearly double the year ago period, and sales were up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the strength in amino acids as well as feed additives and ingredients, partially offset by higher costs in Lat Am and slower demand recovery in APAC.
Looking ahead, we expect Nutrition to continue on its impressive growth path, with strength across the Human and Animal Nutrition leading to strong year-over-year earnings expansion in the fourth quarter and a 20% full year growth versus 2020.
Slide 9, please. Let me finish up with a few observations from the Other segment as well as some of the Corporate line items. Other Business results were substantially lower than the prior year period, driven primarily by captive insurance underwriting losses, most of which were offset by corresponding recoveries in the other business segments. We expect fourth quarter to have some additional insurance underwriting losses, resulting in a break-even Other Business for the fourth quarter.
As expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased year-over-year on lower interest rates and to favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. In the Corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $230 million were driven primarily by higher IT offering and project-related costs and transfers of costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations.
Looking at total corporate costs, including net interest, corporate unallocated and other corporate, we are still on track for the calendar year to be overall similar to 2020. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was approximately 18%. We anticipate our calendar year adjusted effective tax rate to be the upper end of our previously communicated range of 14% to 16% and potentially a bit higher, depending upon the geographic mix in the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 26% and available liquidity of about $11.5 billion.
With that, I'll turn it back to Juan."

From consistent sustained profit growth to the ongoing management of our business and product portfolio, our team has a lot to be proud of. And there's one other thing we achieved last quarter that I want to mention. We had many team members impacted when Hurricane Ida hit in late August. So we provided temporary housing arrangements, portable generators, food and water and more. In fact, many ADM colleagues traveled to the region and spent time helping repair their coworkers' damaged homes. I'm very proud of that. I'm very thankful to our team.
I'll keep the rest of my closing short as we plan to go into our outlook in far more depth on our December 10 Global Investor Day. As I look back at the third quarter and all of the last 9 months, I continue to see a team and a company that are delivering on our goals and our purpose. We are closing out 2021 with great momentum. We're on track for a strong fourth quarter and a second consecutive year of record earnings per share. And as we look ahead to 2022, we see another strong year for ADM.
A robust global demand environment will continue to offer opportunities for us to leverage our indispensable global origination, processing and logistics capabilities. And Nutrition will continue on its strong growth trajectory, in line with our 15% per annum trend rate goals and on its way to $1 billion in operating profit in the coming years.
Of course, there are things we continue to watch, including energy costs and inflation more widely. But thanks to our unique value chain and global footprint, our unmatched abilities to meet needs in the enduring trend areas of food security, health and well-being and sustainability and a truly unparalleled team of nearly 40,000 colleagues around the world, we remain very optimistic in a strong year to come.
With that, Emily, please open the line for questions."

So on the announcement yesterday, congratulations. A couple of questions. One is when you think about the total opportunity for SAF, obviously, the embedded demand is significant given SAF seems like one of the most pertinent ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the jet fuel market. The economics for producers, though, are unclear at this time. So I'm curious, as you think about engaging with Gevo on this partnership, one, what got you comfortable to commit these facilities to this end market ultimately?
And then help us think about kind of the evolution of how the agreement will mature because it's a memorandum of understanding. Why did you go with that initially versus a more legally binding agreement? And then if you could just talk just bigger picture about how you feel about the ultimate demand and the implications for the ethanol markets, that would be helpful. I know a lot in there, but I'd love to hear you talk about it."

Listen, we've been looking at options for the dry mills for a very, very long time. So we've been studying the opportunities for the ADM shareholders to -- as we try to divest these assets.
Certainly, when we look at the sustainability trends and the opportunities, remember, one of the issues with these assets are they are very large, which become -- which became a little bit of an issue at the time of divesting them. So we were looking for opportunities that are sizable, where that size turns into a competitive advantage. So certainly, when you look at all industries trying to decarbonize, the aviation industry is a massive industry that contributes to CO2. And we have identified and we have checked with partners, strategic partners, people in the industry that SAF is the solution.
And I think we see also concurrently that both the U.S. and the European governments are looking at SAF and are trying to incentivize the demand for that. So you heard President Biden or Secretary Granholm making statements about that. So we see a very positive environment developing for this, a very sizable addressable market for us. And when you combine our size with our raw material procurements and our cost and the ability to decarbonize based on our carbon capture and sequestration that, as you recall, we've been running since 2017, allows that complex to provide very competitive low-CI fuels for the industry.
There are going to be a lot of discussions from here on. That's why -- but this is significant for us so we decided to announce this. There is -- there are many opportunities and options here. So we have announced what potentially could happen, which is the creation of these 2 joint ventures. In one of those joint ventures, ADM's contribution will be the 2 dry mills as our objective is, as you know, to deconsolidate these 2.
So again -- but still, many discussions to happen and many, many partners to join us into this. We are thinking over time to have a minority position in this and having probably strategic or financial partners to join us. So -- but overall, you can be assured, this is a better outcome for our shareholders in terms of the realization of value from these 2 drivers. So we're very excited about the opportunities."

Is that -- are those kind of the goalposts we should be thinking about? That's part one. And then question 2 within that is export demand looks strong for next year. Obviously, renewable diesel is continuing to gain steam. How do you feel about Ag Services and Crushing and that broader Ag Services and Oilseeds segments as we go into 2022?"

So Ben, listen, as we think about Q4 for ADM and when we say we expect a strong Q4, we look at strong crush margins. Demand is strong for proteins, but also the demand for oilseed is very strong and tight, and then you add RGD on top of that. We are facing an improved ethanol environment as we enter the Q4. We are estimating exports from the U.S. in volumes similar to last year. So -- and if you think about the capacity situation last year, we didn't have reserve this year. Unfortunately, one of our competitors' plant is down because of Ida. So kind of about the same situation.
And then we continue to see Nutrition growing at 15% to 20%. So of course, we have inflation, we have energy issues that the team is dealing with it and trying to mitigate, but we are coming into Q4 and into Q1 with a strong momentum. If you look at Q1, we feel very strong about crush margins. Our export window, given that in September, we didn't export that much, is probably going to be extended into January and February, a little bit like -- maybe even longer than last year. So we're still very good at the moment. But again, with an environment that there are supply chain issues, there are energy inflation rising, so we will have to manage all that. But from a demand perspective, we feel very good about it."

So -- but of course, we're going to have some exposure to ethanol on a long-term basis because we still own the wet mills. But what you have to think about it is that in our analysis, the supply-demand fundamentals change for ethanol. First of all, remember, we always said we didn't like the undifferentiated nature of dry mills. In wet mills, we have more options to protect margins and to protect returns.
But second is by taking all this capacity out of the market basically, the 900 million gallons in about 2 years are going to move from vehicle ethanol to SAF feedstock, then we think that supply-demand fundamentals and the margin environment of ethanol will change. So we feel that, that concludes our strategic assessment. Of course, we need to now execute on this transaction. We still have a lot to be discussed."

We're going to have some higher input costs, which is energy costs, and particularly over in Europe. So that's a little bit of a headwind. At the same time, you're right, in the ethanol margins that we're seeing right now, the market are extremely healthy. And that's just reflective of a very tight supply-demand situation right now. And industry inventories have fallen down to 20 million barrels right now.
And when you take a look at driving miles and gasoline demand, we're basically back to prepandemic levels of demand again. And so on the positive side, I would have to say the ethanol margins are pretty robust.
On the issue of sweeteners and starches, what's interesting is, while a lot of people kind of focus on the HFCS side of the business, the other parts of our business are doing extremely well, the non-HFCS business, for example, citric acid demand. It's extremely strong. Starches demand, extremely strong.
So when we put it all together, that's the reason why we provide the guidance that there are some puts and takes, but we expect our fourth quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions to be similar to where we were last year."

Some of these deals, you have to understand, are just bolt-ons where we plug some capacity where we don't have, like in Sojaprotein, things like that. And some other ones become more platforms that actually give us a pivot to accelerate even more our growth rates.
So -- but we will continue in an investment phase on Nutrition because the opportunities are there. Our customers are reacting positively to our value proposition.

Listen, we still believe that protein demand is very strong. And when we look and we check with our team in China, we still believe that China will need to import about 100 million tons, give or take, of soybeans and about 25 million tons of corn. So of that corn, the majority will come from the U.S., a little bit from Ukraine.
So we think that the volumes, although maybe slightly in a different way than last year, right now, consumers are a little bit more short term, more hand to mouth, if you will, because they were expecting from a little bit of a correction in prices as we were hitting the harvest. But we've seen Chinese buyers come to the U.S. in the last few weeks, and we feel very good about this export season.
You have to remember that we were in a tight situation from a supply-demand perspective given these import numbers. And then when you add that some of that capacity has been taken out, this will make it for a tight export season. That will probably have rolled forward maybe a month since in October -- at the beginning of October, we -- all these facilities, we're still trying to recover power."

So in Asia Pacific, we've been players in flavors for a while, and this is just an expansion. This is just about an hour away from a big center of consumption. So we feel very good from a raw material perspective. We feel very good from an access to a big consumption base, and this will be very important for our customers.
Our participation in Asia was limited to one plant for flavors and about a handful of plants for Animal Nutrition. And we continue to build that position in Animal Nutrition. We feel very good about it. And then with this opportunity in flavors, we will enhance our capabilities, not just production but also market development capabilities for customer innovation centers.
So you will see us going and putting more flags on the world in the developing areas, whether it's Asia Pacific or South America, as we need to go and support our global customers. These are our customers that we do business every day here, and some of them are represented there. But also, we have a lot of new local customers that are requiring these capabilities.

And then just a quick point of clarification.

The teams are looking at this. There is a lot -- there are a lot of numbers. There are a lot of things that could still change. There are a lot of discussions. So I wouldn't like to venture that much since the teams are still discussing with LG Chem, and we need to create this.
This -- but this is a start, if you will. All these companies that are promising decarbonization by 2050, 2060, 2040, whatever that is, as they are looking back at their portfolio, they need to clean their portfolios, if you will. And one of their ways to do that is through recycling. The other way to do it is to going plant-based. So we are receiving a lot of inbound requests on that. And we're looking at our assets, our ability to produce plant-based products and our carbon capture and sequestration that provides an opportunity to make lower-CI products.
And we are trying to maximize the opportunity for ADM on all these. So some of these things may not be that well defined because we are in the process of optimizing all that value for the ADM shareholders. But it's a great opportunity for us. And we will be mindful of returns, and we're not going to veer into areas that we shouldn't be putting capital. The capital will be reserved for our main thrust of the strategy, which is to continue to grow in food and feed and beverages."

So Juan, the one question that I have for you is related to Gevo and kind of the whole transaction. And I know that one of your -- maybe not to put a bad word in it, one of your dislikes that you've had with ethanol over the years is the extreme volatility of the earnings and some of the factors, your lack of ability to control some of those factors. And when we talked about the dry mills in the past, one of the things was trying to reduce your earnings volatility.
So in the economics of how you've -- we don't know much about the economics that you have here with SAF. But have you been able to -- do you think you've been able to ink an agreement that actually gives you more sustainability or, I guess, less volatility of earnings on the economics of SAF going forward relative to ethanol?"

I can't disclose that much at this -- early on. But I think what you need to also think is that over time, we will try to become a minority partner in all this. And the objective of all this is to deconsolidate and take all those assets out of our participation.
So to a certain degree, we are acting here as a facilitator to create this. But in reality, we don't want to be owners long term of this. That's why I talked before about strategic partners or financial partners. I think we're going to be able to deconsolidate. We're going to be able to monetize some amounts and if there is some upside to that, hopefully participate in all that. But you are correct. The objective is not to participate in things that add to volatility but actually that dampen volatility. And we've been very consistent in that over the last 10 years."

And so there, we can probably start looking back at return of capital that we've looked at in the past.
So I think a lot of it is a function of funding the investments that we talked about, but importantly, making sure that the working capital environment reverts back to normalized levels, which I think [ ascends ]. Assuming a normal South American crop, a normal U.S. crop next year, I see opportunities to look at return of capital."
