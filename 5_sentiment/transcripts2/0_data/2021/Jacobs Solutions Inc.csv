And thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and strategy update. 
It's been about a year since the pandemic started and we hope everyone is safe and healthy as COVID-19 continues to impact all facets of our daily lives. At Jacobs, in addition to keeping our people safe, we're continuing to support national governments and industry and their production and distribution of critical vaccines. 
Turning to Slide 4 to discuss our first quarter results. 
It's important to review our strategy, which is foundational to an investment in Jacobs. We believe the transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created a compelling multi-decade investment opportunity for our current and potential shareholders based on 3 key tenets. 
First, we have transformed our culture aligned -- around a common purpose of creating a connected, sustainable world, underpinned by strong values, but we do things right. We challenge the accepted. We aim higher, and we live inclusion. This culture permeates through our more than 50,000 people, the solutions we deliver for our clients, and the engagement in our communities where we live and work. Our purpose-driven culture has also enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in market conditions while also staying focused on our long-term vision of being a technology-enabled solutions provider. 
Second, we have a portfolio of solutions aligned to a diverse set of global opportunities, such as space exploration, cyber readiness, climate change, and modernizing and digitizing our infrastructure. Our thematic growth areas are global, allowing us to address them efficiently, effectively and competitively at scale through our integrated global platform of technology, our talented resources, domain expertise and enhanced brand awareness. 
Finally, our Jacobs management team has demonstrated the ability to strategically allocate capital, including successfully executing acquisitions. 
Our continued focus on strategy and execution has resulted in a strong start to fiscal 2021, even while continuing to manage the headwinds from the global pandemic. 
First quarter net revenue increased 3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew 8%. Our backlog ended the first quarter up 11% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Given the strong momentum, we're increasing the midpoint of our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and EPS outlook. 
Our cash flow generation was strong during the first quarter and our balance sheet remains healthy. In the near term, we do expect to deploy excess cash towards paying down debt. 
Last quarter, we announced a strategic majority investment in PA Consulting. And we are happy to share that the transaction was overwhelmingly approved on February 4, with 99.8% of PA shareholders voting in favor of the transaction. Particularly exciting was the fact that the voluntary election for management rollover was fully subscribed and new partner hiring has also been very successful post announcement, indicating the enthusiasm and commitment of PA partners and employees about the future growth opportunity of this partnership. Confirmation of the scheme of arrangement is awaiting regulatory approval by the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., and we expect to close the investment by the end of this current quarter. 
PA's performance for calendar 2020 exceeded our expectations, and their pipeline of strategic and technical consulting work continues to grow. This includes a new engagement with the U.K.'s Department of International Trade, advising on project defense and U.K. supply chain resilience to underpin economic and national security, along with reaching a key milestone with the National Institute for Health Research, where they completed a U.K. public sector first delivery of Google cloud search to upgrade research platforms. Once we complete the transaction, we expect significant benefit for the clients of our firms, driven by the complementary solutions offering of PA and Jacobs. 
Now looking further into fiscal 2021 and beyond, we believe Jacobs has a compelling organic growth opportunity. And as appropriate, we will further accelerate that growth through thoughtful strategic acquisitions that offer a higher return versus our alternative of repurchasing shares of Jacobs. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'd like to review some recent ESG actions. 
As a company, we're committed to delivering results to all our stakeholders: our employees, our clients, our investors and our communities. Delivering on this includes our commitment to our sustainability strategy called Plan Beyond and our climate action plan launched last year. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a net 0 carbon, including 100% renewable energy, for our operations in 2020. And our carbon reduction targets have been formally approved by the science-based target initiative. The climate agenda will continue to be front and center in 2021, with the United States rejoining the Paris Agreement and the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties or COP 26 being held in November. In support, Jacobs announced our pledge to action, a campaign inviting our clients and suppliers around the globe to take measurable actions to tackle climate change before the opening of COP 26. And we are also leveraging the power of our Jacobs people and making a positive impact. We launched our Climate Countdown Challenge, where employees can join a new mission each month to tackle the climate crisis. Through both of these initiatives, we hope to raise awareness, inspire and motivate individuals and companies, and demonstrate the collective power of organizations taking actions now to make an impact for generations to come. 
Moving to Slide 6. 
At Jacobs, we intend to lead from the front in the transformation to a net 0 economy. In combination with the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change remains the major global driver for ecological, social and economic disruption, impacting every person, community, business and governments around the world. It's also a major disruptor, advancing technology-enabled innovation and sustainable business models for addressing decarbonization, the global energy transition and resource scarcity. Jacobs is uniquely positioned to support our clients and communities in developing and deploying solutions and technologies across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including renewable energy and clean power, carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency and energy storage, green buildings, sustainable transport, circular economy, carbon management, mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as adaptation and resilience for all facets of infrastructure. This includes developing technology solutions, like our recently announced launch of Jacobs Travel Service Optimization solution, which transforms the home to school travel experience for special educational needs and disabilities children and young people. This solution combines our deep domain knowledge with the latest advances in data analytics to determine the most efficient ride-sharing experience, while supporting decarbonization and our long-term transition to a net 0 economy. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

And now moving on to Slide 7 to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. 
During the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance despite the continued high levels of COVID-19 cases. Our workforce and clients have addressed the primary challenges of physical distancing and continued to execute on our contracts regardless of work location at approximately 95% of normal operating levels. Total CMS backlog is at $9.7 billion, representing a 14% year-over-year growth and up 4% on a pro forma basis. 
The CMS strategy is focused on both revenue growth and margin expansion by aligning to our go-to-market strategy towards critical national priorities of digital modernization, strategic data utilization, lower orbit satellites, hypersonics and cyber. I'll discuss each in greater detail. 
Beginning with digital modernization trends. Our global government clients face the current task of transforming their digital stack of information, communications and security systems in order to maintain their national security. We are on this transformation journey with our clients as we develop and operate their next-generation digital systems. In December, we cleared the protest period on the navy's Kings Bay Intelligent Asset Management award, and we were awarded another new digital modernization project for the army's Intelligence and Security Command. 
In addition to digital modernization, a second key growth driver for our business is the DoD's increased focus on strategic data utilization. The DoD is becoming a data-centric organization, combining edge computing with data intelligence and analysis at hyper speed and scale. Data is considered a strategic asset similar to the priority given to weapon systems. And it is increasingly central to war fighter advantage in and out of theater. As an example, our Intelligent Surveillance and Reconnaissance team was recently awarded a seat on the 10-year $950 million ceiling IDQ to provide various unmanned aircraft solutions and satellite payload services for the Air Force's Advanced Battlefield Management System. ABMS allows a joint force to use cutting-edge methods and technologies to rapidly collect, analyze and share intelligence information and make decisions in real time. 
Moving on to low earth orbit satellite. These satellites play a key role in advanced communications, military reconnaissance, intelligence and other imaging applications. Jacobs began a new era in advanced based radar payloads with the successful launch of its Mango 1 satellite. Our approach enables government and commercial customers to proliferate space-based sensors that see in the dark and through clouds to provide near continuous monitoring, gathering valuable, actionable intelligence in the ground, sea, air and space domain. 
And now on to hypersonics. Hypersonic offensive and defensive weapons technology is unquestionably one of the highest priorities for our government clients. Jacobs through its decades of supporting the Air Force and NASA is a clear leader in hypersonic solution. During the quarter, CMS was awarded a hypersonic test cell contract from the Air Force at Arnold Engineering Development Complex to transform the facility into a unique, large scale, clean air, variable mock number test facility with extended run time capability. 
A final trend is to discuss cyber. The recent solar wind sunburst advanced persistent attack continues to make headlines giving its sophistication and dwelling time. In fact, the Biden administration has requested a $9 billion plus increase in spending for cyber and modernization. And as mentioned on our call last quarter, the British government also approved its largest military investment increase in 30 years, by GBP 16.5 billion or 10% per year over the next 4 years in defense areas, including cybersecurity. 
CMS' Cyber & Intelligence business has grown over the past several years to more than 3,300 professionals today. Part of our growth strategy is to continue to add adjacent capabilities and customers. The Buffalo Group acquisition, which closed in November, posted strong initial performance and is a catalyst for achieving immediate scale and deep client access with a strong majority of the U.S. Intelligence Agency and Combatant Command. 
In summary, we continue to see strong structural demand for our solutions. Supporting this, the CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the [ next ] 18-month qualified new business pipeline remaining above $30 billion, including over $10 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile. 
Now on to Slide 8. I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. 
Last quarter, we conveyed optimism around our balanced portfolio and our ability to remain resilient through economic and geopolitical volatility. This is demonstrated by strong P&L performance in the quarter as well as 9% year-over-year backlog growth. After a steady pipeline in 2020 and momentum in government funding strategies, timing remains uncertain in our focused geographies, such as in the U.S. and U.K. We anticipate further improvement to our pipeline as government solidify their budget. 
I'll discuss 4 trends impacting the macroeconomic environment and our sectors. All of which we are well positioned to capitalize on: first, climate change and decarbonization of the economy, driving sustainability and resilience for public and private entities; second, economic stimulus for long-term job growth and economic relief; third, the pandemic, and continued growth in health, life sciences and cloud computing; and fourth, modernization of infrastructure and the digitization of the industry. 
Beginning with climate change and the decarbonization of the economy. The environmental sector is experiencing growth as governments, the investment community, companies and citizens confirm their commitment to climate action, act on their decarbonization agenda and increase focus on PFAS and emerging. We generated the largest growth in this sector year-over-year and anticipate our investment in PA Consulting to further strengthen our decarbonization solutions offering. These solutions, such as advising our clients on their climate action goals, developing strategy and policy, assisting in program implementation and providing intelligent asset management, are embedded in all our geographies and sectors. A great example of this is our recent win in Orange County, Florida to develop innovative, resilient and sustainable waste management systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations for cleaner electricity use. Recent awards for the Marinus linked electricity interconnector linking the states of Victoria and Tasmania in Australia, and a project to connect one of the world's largest lithium-ion batteries are key elements supporting Australia's renewable energy transition. 
In the Middle East, where we had a program manager to Expo 2020 Dubai, the sustainability pavilion, known as Terra, premiers this month. Leveraging our industry-leading sustainability expertise, Terra is designed to be a net 0 carbon driving during full operations and provides a glimpse of what is to come when Expo fully opens later this year. 
Next, I'll discuss economic stimulus spend aimed at long-term job growth and economic relief. 
In the U.S., the current administration is pursuing an aggressive agenda that aligns directly with the long-term growth of our markets. We have every reason to believe that focus will continue as the administration and Congress address COVID relief, climate change, environmental justice, resilience, and the need to create long-term job growth and economic recovery through infrastructure modernization. As activity on these issues progress, we anticipate funding to support our clients' projects at the federal, state and local level, which we are uniquely positioned to support through long-term historical framework agreements. 
In the U.K., we are well positioned for stimulus and a leveling up agenda to rebalance the economy across the country, and are supporting our clients with smart integrated solutions with tangible social, environmental and economic benefits for the communities they serve. 
In our Asia Pacific geography, particularly in India, Singapore and Australia, we expect an infrastructure-led economic revival around transportation and green recovery, largely centered on large-scale renewables and energy to catalyze the economy over the coming year. 
Moving to the impact of the pandemic and continued growth in health, life sciences and the cloud computing supply chain. 
COVID vaccine production is progressing to increase capacity and distribution as well as increased demand from contract manufacturing companies, with an acute focus on biotechnology. And we expect our investment in PA Consulting to strengthen our end-to-end delivery in this sector. 
Demand for cloud computing continues to drive our data center business globally. We remain agile and are diversifying our client base to adjust to market trends in semiconductor manufacturing. Building on established relationships and industry-leading leadership, we are in negotiations for several new life sciences and electronics projects. In the build environment sector, we are gaining momentum with our clients focused on the global health care prices. We were selected to lead the programming in engineering efforts for a new campus for the California -- University of California Davis Health Center as well as the Royal Prince Albert Hospital redevelopment in Australia, where investment in technology and physical infrastructure support new trends in virtual care. 
Finally, I'll talk about modernization and infrastructure and the digitization of the industry. 
Infrastructure modernization remains a priority investment across all sectors and geographies. Transportation continues, with a heavy focus on highways and rail. We were awarded the engineering services project for the Houston metro intercat bus rapid transit system as well as the new rapid transit project in Southeast Asia that will enable the workforce to adapt to public transport, representing another example of how we support our clients with solutions that improve sustainability of our cities and places. 
Water sector trends are steady, with implementation of digital technologies and a focus on the water energy nexus and resiliency. Using Replica, Jacobs proprietary digital twin platform, we developed a digital twin of the watershed for municipal water district in California for the evaluation of water supply scenarios while balancing water quality and operational resilience. 
In summary, the foundation of our P&P business remains strong, with our long-term client base and frameworks in place to move rapidly when government funding is solidified. Positioned extremely well for the near-term secular trends, we expect a steady growth trajectory, with profitability improving as we continue to move higher on the value chain. 
I will now turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail."

And now turning over to Slide 9. 
First quarter gross revenue increased 1% year-over-year, with pro forma net revenue flat. Revenue for CMS increased 3% on a pro forma basis, and P&PS net revenue was down 3%. The P&PS decline was mainly attributed to slower revenue burn, although the outlook for the business remains strong, with backlog up 9% year-over-year. In the near term, we expect reported net revenue growth to be flat to up slightly year-over-year, then gain additional momentum in the second half of fiscal 2021. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.1%, down 110 basis points year-over-year. The lower gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by 2 factors: a tough compare from Q1 2020 that benefited from a favorable impact from lower benefit costs carried in corporate; and a higher mix of CMS revenue, which carries lower gross margins but also has a lower G&A as a percentage of revenue. 
CMS gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by almost 100 basis points as we benefited from a mix of higher-margin revenue from acquisitions and new business wins. P&PS gross margin saw some modest pressure in Q1 due to a higher amount of America's program management and O&M revenue. 
Lower consolidated G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 170 basis points year-over-year to 13.6% more than offset the gross margin impacts. As it pertains to G&A, the first quarter continued to benefit from our ability to proactively manage our cost structure, the CMS mix benefit previously stated, and some Focus 2023 savings from lower real estate costs, lower travel and lower COVID-related employee medical costs. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in the management of our G&A cost. 
GAAP operating profit was $214 million and included $22 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, the majority associated with our recently announced Focus 2023 initiative, and $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $259 million, up 10%, with both lines of business posting double-digit percent increases in operating profit. As a result, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 9.5%, up 60 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. 
GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $257 million and $1.96 per share, and included a benefit of $0.54, driven by mark-to-market adjustments for our equity stake, a $0.47 benefit related to a mark-to-market investment in AI software provider, C3 AI, $0.16 share of after-tax charges, primarily related to Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs, a $0.17 charge related to the impairment of our awe management investment, and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.13. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.41, up 17%. 
Let me provide some detail on our investment in AI software provider, C3 AI. In 2010, we made a small investment in the company, which recently completed an IPO. Today, our investment represents more than 750,000 shares in the company. Due to our lockup requirements surrounding our ownership, we applied a discount to the quarter-end value of our interest in the company, resulting in the investment valued at $85 million on our quarter-end balance sheet. At today's price, our interest represents a greater than 20x return on our original investment. 
Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $280 million and was up 8% year-over-year, reaching 10.3% of net revenue. 
Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.2x for Q1, driven by strong book-to-bill in P&PS. From a pipeline standpoint, we continue to grow the CMS pipeline, both on a pro forma and reported basis. The timing of when this robust CMS pipeline will convert into backlog is weighted more towards the second half of fiscal 2021, resulting in our projected backlog exhibiting year-over-year growth for the year. 
The P&PS overall sales pipeline has increased as well, driven by a pro environmental Biden administration, broader potential infrastructure stimulus in the U.S. and an improving economic outlook. The exact timing of when many of these new stimulus-related opportunities will convert to bookings will become clear over the coming months and will help support backlog growth for the year. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. 
Starting with CMS. Revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis. CMS operating profit was $110 million, up 22% and up 15% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year to 8.5%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities, such as our recent NORAD win, which is now fully ramped. We also some additional benefit from favorable project closeouts. 
As we progress through fiscal 2021, we expect low single-digit CMS reported revenue growth as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the Wood Nuclear acquisition and continue to ramp new wins, more than offsetting the revenue headwind from fully transitioning of 2 large lower-margin projects previously discussed, which account for a nearly $600 million headwind in annual revenue in 2021. Given the strategy to capture higher value businesses via both acquisitions and organic efforts, we continue to expect reported and pro forma operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year. 
Moving to P&PS. Q1 net revenue was down 3% year-over-year, driven by a lower short-term burn rate, as bookings growth remained strong and backlog was up 9% year-over-year, with a 1.3x book-to-bill. We continued to see solid revenue growth in our Americas business, offset by some timing-related slowdown in our advanced facilities in Europe and Middle East businesses. P&PS operating profit was up 10% year-over-year and as a percentage of net revenue was 13.7% for the quarter, up 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by disciplined management of G&A costs. 
Looking forward, we continue to project P&PS revenue to be up low single-digits for fiscal 2021, with improving year-over-year growth as we progress through the year. We expect operating profit margin as a percentage of net revenue to moderate from Q1 levels, but still increase from fiscal 2020, driven by strong operating profit growth. 
Our nonallocated corporate costs were $47 million for the quarter. While this figure was supported by strong cost discipline, we continue to expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by inflation in medical costs, enhanced employee benefits and increases in discretionary medical procedures that were put on hold during fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns. 
Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A integrations. 
We continue to make strong progress on our strategic initiative, Focus 2023, that we believe will: 1, lead to enhanced employee and customer experience; 2, improve our ability to capture emerging high-growth margin opportunities; and 3, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall longer-term profitability. 
During the quarter, we incurred an additional $10 million charge and cash outflows of approximately $30 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. These investments were mainly related to improving the utilization of our physical spaces, deploying new tools and technology for better efficiency in our business and strategically leaning out the organization. 
Turning to our recent acquisition of the Buffalo Group. The company had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth. We continue to expect that the acquisition will deliver $0.08 to $0.10 adjusted EPS accretion during fiscal 2021. Regarding PA Consulting, we are pleased with the preliminary results for calendar year 2020, which are tracking ahead of our expectations. We are also optimistic about their calendar year 2021 growth plan. And after the transaction close up later this quarter, we look forward to discussing the results and growth plan in more detail. We continue to expect $0.52 to $0.57 of adjusted EPS accretion from PA Consulting for fiscal 2022. And finally, when including all integration and restructuring initiatives, as well as the AWE charge, but excluding PA Consulting, we now expect a total of approximately $100 million of P&L charges and $110 million in related cash outflows in fiscal 2021. When including an additional nonrecurring headwind associated with the payment of 2020 related U.K. VAT tax payments in the current quarter, we expect a total of approximately $150 million of onetime cash outflows in fiscal year 2021. We will update these estimates to include PA Consulting after we closed the transaction. 
Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. 
During the first quarter, we generated $96 million in reported free cash flow, a significant improvement versus the level seen in the last several Q1 periods, primarily a result of an improvement of 3 days in DSO versus a year ago, other working capital benefits and less headwinds from cash restructuring. The strong Q1 cash flow included a net negative of $44 million of onetime costs associated with Focus 2020 restructuring and other items. 
Regarding the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $837 million and a gross debt of $1.8 billion, resulting in $1 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worli and C3 AI equity. Treating the Worley and C3 AI equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 0.4x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. 
During our current fiscal second quarter, we finalized a new delayed draw term loan-related to our PA Consulting investment. Post PA close, we expect our balance sheet to have continued financial flexibility. However, we will be prudent to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment over the short term. 
And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for Slide #13."

And we invested in this, and it's now in space, gathering data. It is kind of a right of entry to some of the higher end, both intelligence agencies as well as other applications platforms. And it's going to put us in a really unique position for some of the -- not only ongoing pursuits, but even for offerings that come in the future. So I'd say that the programs, the projects that we've talked about, project in and all kinds of other tropical fruits that we refer to these programs by, it puts us in a very much differentiated position to further strengthen our win ratio. There's only a few that happen."

Look, Jamie, thanks for the question. First thing is, on the P&PS margin profile, we actually saw a good solid gross margin performance, but really, the fundamental margin profile driven primarily by the very disciplined management of our G&A costs. Of course, some of that has been driven already by some of the work that we did when we announced some of the activities relative to our reduction in footprint on real estate, some of the travel reductions that we've been doing. But there's also been a fairly significant actions, proactive actions taken in terms of managing our labor costs appropriately relative to the current situation regarding the pandemic. We're closely monitoring that. And as we think about how our business starts to come back, which is fully anticipated over the course of this year, some of those costs will come back into play as it relates to the business, but that's going to be associated with higher gross profit as well. So ultimately, margin profile will continue to be robust, maybe not at the same level as Q1, but certainly, well above what we would have expected to see in 2020, what we did see in 2020. So feeling very good about that opportunity. 
In terms of the margin profile between the 2 businesses, we've said that we believe actually margin profile can improve on both sides with both of the businesses. And consequently, a big focus in 2021 is starting to reduce in a more tangible way the margin profile difference between the 2 businesses, and we've been communicating that CMS margins should be strong improvement this year. And I think we started to see that in the first quarter, and we would expect that to continue to play out over the balance of 2021."

So we are a company that is always active and making sure we're exploring all opportunities globally, and we're going to continue to do that. We have recently executed on some acquisitions with the Buffalo Group and PA Consulting most recently. And Wood Nuclear is fairly new. So for us, our top priority is to execute on those recent acquisitions and demonstrate continued success. We feel proud of what we achieved with a major one of CH2M back in 2017 and have successfully executed and exceeded expectations. And so we want to focus on that. Right now, as I mentioned in my remarks, over the next months, our primary capital deployment is going to be to pay down debt. However, when we look at the pipeline of opportunities and our strategy, there are several bolt-on opportunities, even within PA Consulting. When we think about what we have initiated there, we're coming together with PA. They've been a very successful firm in doing bolt-on acquisitions that help them create value, and we want to continue to support that. And together, we think that there's going to be some real interesting things that we can do in that whole consulting arena, which is higher margin, higher value business. And then, of course, anything that we can do to just accelerate our digital modernization, strategic data utilization as we have done with the series of cyber acquisitions, including most recently, KeyW and the Buffalo Group. And so we'll continue to be active on the government services space and any other bolt-on acquisitions that can strengthen our P&PS business as well. 
And the final thing I'll say is there's some geographic expansion opportunities when you look at our mix of business. is still majority. The majority of our revenue comes from the U.S. and U.K., and then it drops down significantly from there. And so we think there's some great geographic expansion initiatives over the coming years."

So I think those remain strong. 
As far as what we see coming out of the funding, I really -- I'm sorry, the year-on-year piece, I'd really kind of point to the sustainability of our work due to the framework and the position we have with our clients. So yes, there has been a bit of a revenue decline, but it wasn't a drop off the cliff. And we were able to -- there was a bit of a drop in Q3 of last year, and we've been able to sustain it. Remember, comparison to last year quarter-on-quarter -- I'm sorry, year-on-year, we weren't in the pandemic.

When we talked about the P&PS business, clearly, what's driving our pipeline are the things that Bob talked about initially. And that is the whole digital modernization and strategic data utilization across the -- all of our clients and buildings, infrastructure, advanced facilities. The whole climate change arena is clearly going to be ramping up with the change in administration in the U.S., but just a global priority that's going on there. And when we talk about climate change, it's the things we're already doing in solar and wind and now hydrogen is kicking in and the energy storage with batteries and the whole resiliency strength that we have, which we've been doing for the last several years around flooding and sea level rise and a whole host of other things, PFAS, et cetera. And then the whole opportunity around the advanced facilities business with regard to what the pandemic has accelerated in the life sciences business and the electronics business. Because on the life science side, there's now a pent-up demand on non-COVID activity. Obviously, the priority is COVID vaccines and therapeutics. But oncology, diabetes, emerging cell and gene therapy and also the fact that there's more need for capacity. So there's a huge contract total manufacturing opportunity that's now presenting itself, and then the whole health care side with hospitals and what's going on globally there. And then the electronics with the future of work, with everything from 5G to data centers to the semiconductor, there's clearly a wave of growth in that business as well. So -- and then on top of all that is what countries are doing around the world, starting with the U.S., around stimulating their economies coming out of the pandemic. Clearly, we're seeing positive momentum in the U.S. We expect to see something soon with this first COVID relief package. But we're anxious to see what comes out over the coming months in the whole infrastructure stimulus, which will benefit Jacobs, it's upside. This is '22 and beyond when we talk about infrastructure stimulus. It's our current year is not dependent on it. And then from a standpoint of U.K., very positive momentum. And many of the other countries are also kicking in with their infrastructure initiatives, economic initiatives. So real positive momentum on the P&PS side.

And then the last 2 big steps have been the rebranding to really make our clients more aware a lot of the stuff we were doing for certain clients in one part of Jacobs, most of the rest of our clients didn't really know that we have that capability, and that brand initiative that we launched last year was a key step. And then PA Consulting is now going to take it the whole new level around the end-to-end solutions that we can provide. 
When you look at the IP that we have, it's pretty impressive across the board. And then the technology hubs that we focus on, geospatial, predictive analytics, cyber, Internet of Things, intelligent asset management. And when you put it all together, the real differentiation for Jacobs is that we have both the domain knowledge, decades of experience working on all of these end markets and clients.

Our actual net debt is probably in the neighborhood once we closed is probably in the area of 2x. So still quite nice in terms of our position. We still have substantive levels of cash at that particular point in time. So we have some flexibility as it relates to that. Our gross debt levels will be a little bit higher. So our idea is that we will kind of in the very short term, reduce some of that gross debt level with incremental cash generation that we're going to be seeing. But we feel like we still have really good flexibility as it relates to how we will look to deploy capital, not in the necessarily immediate term, but certainly, as we progress through the next few months and into later 2021, we'll be able to have some greater levels of flexibility there. So really quite well positioned relative to our debt structure even after the amount of funds that are going to be paid out. It's appropriately -- it's approximately about $1.8 billion.

And certainly, the sustainability comment that Bob had made is important because of the particular for a stimulus package that's being considered right now provides that opportunity to do so. I think if you combine it all together with Focus 2023, and our continued efforts to drive effectiveness across the globe, and with the continuation of an improving economic picture, we still think there is an ability to have great growth in 2022 and beyond, and that would be double-digit. Obviously, if there is a large infrastructure build, that would be augmenting some of those numbers. 
I think as it relates to both CMS and PPS with -- P&PS, we feel good about the growth prospects of both of the business long-term. Both are aligned with really strong growth trends, critical mission areas, as outlined by Bob. And then, of course, People & Places aligned with secular long-term growth trends.

And thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and strategy update.  
It's been about a year since the pandemic started and we hope everyone is safe and healthy as COVID-19 continues to impact all facets of our daily lives. At Jacobs, in addition to keeping our people safe, we're continuing to support national governments and industry and their production and distribution of critical vaccines.  
Turning to Slide 4 to discuss our first quarter results. It's important to review our strategy, which is foundational to an investment in Jacobs. We believe the transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created a compelling multi-decade investment opportunity for our current and potential shareholders based on 3 key tenets.  
First, we have transformed our culture aligned -- around a common purpose of creating a connected, sustainable world, underpinned by strong values. But we do things right. We challenge the accepted. We aim higher, and we live inclusion. This culture permeates through our more than 50,000 people, the solutions we deliver for our clients and the engagement in our communities where we live and work. Our purpose-driven culture has also enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in market conditions while also staying focused on our long-term vision of being a technology-enabled solutions provider.
Second, we have a portfolio of solutions aligned to a diverse set of global opportunities, such as space exploration, cyber readiness, climate change and modernizing and digitizing our infrastructure. Our thematic growth areas are global, allowing us to address them efficiently, effectively and competitively at scale through our integrated global platform of technology, our talented resources, domain expertise and enhanced brand awareness. 
Finally, our Jacobs management team has demonstrated the ability to strategically allocate capital, including successfully executing acquisitions. Our continued focus on strategy and execution has resulted in a strong start to fiscal 2021, even while continuing to manage the headwinds from the global pandemic.  
First quarter net revenue increased 3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew 8%. Our backlog ended the first quarter up 11% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Given the strong momentum, we're increasing the midpoint of our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and EPS outlook. Our cash flow generation was strong during the first quarter and our balance sheet remains healthy. In the near term, we do expect to deploy excess cash towards paying down debt. 
Last quarter, we announced a strategic majority investment in PA Consulting. And we are happy to share that the transaction was overwhelmingly approved on February 4, with 99.8% of PA shareholders voting in favor of the transaction. Particularly exciting was the fact that the voluntary election for management rollover was fully subscribed and new partner hiring has also been very successful post announcement, indicating the enthusiasm and commitment of PA partners and employees about the future growth opportunity of this partnership. Confirmation of the scheme of arrangement is awaiting regulatory approval by the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., and we expect to close the investment by the end of this current quarter.  
PA's performance for calendar 2020 exceeded our expectations, and their pipeline of strategic and technical consulting work continues to grow. This includes a new engagement with the U.K.'s Department of International Trade, advising on Project Defend and U.K.'s supply chain resilience to underpin economic and national security, along with reaching a key milestone with the National Institute for Health Research, where they completed a U.K. public sector first delivery of Google cloud search to upgrade research platforms. Once we complete the transaction, we expect significant benefit for the clients of our firms, driven by the complementary solutions offering of PA and Jacobs.  
Now looking further into fiscal 2021 and beyond, we believe Jacobs has a compelling organic growth opportunity. And as appropriate, we will further accelerate that growth through thoughtful strategic acquisitions that offer a higher return versus our alternative of repurchasing shares of Jacobs. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'd like to review some recent ESG actions. As a company, we're committed to delivering results to all our stakeholders: our employees, our clients, our investors and our communities. Delivering on this includes our commitment to our sustainability strategy called PlanBeyond and our climate action plan launched last year. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a net 0 carbon, including 100% renewable energy for our operations in 2020. And our carbon reduction targets have been formally approved by the science-based target initiative. 
The climate agenda will continue to be front and center in 2021, with the United States rejoining the Paris Agreement and the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties or COP26 being held in November. In support, Jacobs announced our pledge to action, a campaign inviting our clients and suppliers around the globe to take measurable actions to tackle climate change before the opening of COP26. And we are also leveraging the power of our Jacobs people and making a positive impact. 
We launched our climate countdown challenge, where employees can join a new mission each month to tackle the climate crisis. Through both of these initiatives, we hope to raise awareness, inspire and motivate individuals and companies, and demonstrate the collective power of organizations taking actions now to make an impact for generations to come. 
Moving to Slide 6. At Jacobs, we intend to lead from the front in the transformation to a net 0 economy. In combination with the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change remains the major global driver for ecological, social and economic disruption, impacting every person, community, business and governments around the world. It's also a major disruptor, advancing technology-enabled innovation and sustainable business models for addressing decarbonization, the global energy transition and resource scarcity. 
Jacobs is uniquely positioned to support our clients and communities in developing and deploying solutions and technologies across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including renewable energy and clean power, carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency and energy storage, green buildings, sustainable transport, circular economy, carbon management, mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as adaptation and resilience for all facets of infrastructure. 
This includes developing technology solutions, like our recently announced launch of Jacobs Travel Service Optimization solution, which transforms the home to school travel experience for special educational needs and disabilities children and young people. This solution combines our deep domain knowledge with the latest advances in data analytics to determine the most efficient ride-sharing experience, while supporting decarbonization and our long-term transition to a net 0 economy.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

And now moving on to Slide 7 to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. During the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance despite the continued high levels of COVID-19 cases. Our workfor",1660,"Thank you, Steve. And now moving on to Slide 7 to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. During the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance despite the continued high levels of COVID-19 cases. Our workforce and clients have addressed the primary challenges of physical distancing and continued to execute on our contracts regardless of work location at approximately 95% of normal operating levels. Total CMS backlog is at $9.7 billion, representing a 14% year-over-year growth and up 4% on a pro forma basis.  
The CMS strategy is focused on both revenue growth and margin expansion by aligning to our go-to-market strategy towards critical national priorities of digital modernization, strategic data utilization, lower orbit satellites, hypersonics and cyber. I'll discuss each in greater detail.  
Beginning with digital modernization trends. Our global government clients face the current task of transforming their digital stack of information, communications and security systems in order to maintain their national security. We are on this transformation journey with our clients as we develop and operate their next-generation digital systems. In December, we cleared the protest period on the Navy's Kings Bay Intelligent Asset Management award, and we were awarded another new digital modernization project for the Army's Intelligence and Security Command. 
In addition to digital modernization, a second key growth driver for our business is the DoD's increased focus on strategic data utilization. The DoD is becoming a data-centric organization, combining edge computing with data intelligence and analysis at hyper speed and scale. Data is considered a strategic asset similar to the priority given to weapon systems. And it is increasingly central to war fighter advantage in and out of theater. As an example, our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance team was recently awarded a seat on the 10-year $950 million ceiling IDIQ to provide various unmanned aircraft solutions and satellite payload services for the Air Force's Advanced Battlefield Management system. ABMS allows a joint force to use cutting-edge methods and technologies to rapidly collect, analyze and share intelligence information and make decisions in real time.  
Moving on to low earth orbit satellite. These satellites play a key role in advanced communications, military reconnaissance, intelligence and other imaging applications. Jacobs began a new era in advanced space radar payloads with the successful launch of its Mango One satellite. Our approach enables government and commercial customers to proliferate space-based sensors that see in the dark and through clouds to provide near continuous monitoring, gathering valuable, actionable intelligence in the ground, sea, air and space domain.  
And now on to hypersonics. Hypersonic offensive and defensive weapons technology is unquestionably one of the highest priorities for our government clients. Jacobs through its decades of supporting the Air Force and NASA is a clear leader in hypersonic solution. During the quarter, CMS was awarded a hypersonic test cell contract from the Air Force at Arnold Engineering Development Complex to transform the facility into a unique, large scale, clean air, variable mach number test facility with extended run time capability. 
A final trend is to discuss cyber. The recent solar wind sunburst advanced persistent attack continues to make headlines giving its sophistication and dwelling time. In fact, the Biden administration has requested a $9 billion plus increase in spending for cyber and modernization. And as mentioned on our call last quarter, the British government also approved its largest military investment increase in 30 years, by GBP 16.5 billion or 10% per year over the next 4 years in defense areas, including cybersecurity.  
CMS' cyber and intelligence business has grown over the past several years to more than 3,300 professionals today. Part of our growth strategy is to continue to add adjacent capabilities and customers. The Buffalo Group acquisition, which closed in November, posted strong initial performance and is a catalyst for achieving immediate scale and deep client access with a strong majority of the U.S. Intelligence Agency and Combatant Command.  
In summary, we continue to see strong structural demand for our solutions. Supporting this, the CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business pipeline remaining above $30 billion, including over $10 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile.  
Now on to Slide 8. I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Last quarter, we conveyed optimism around our balanced portfolio and our ability to remain resilient through economic and geopolitical volatility. This is demonstrated by strong P&L performance in the quarter as well as 9% year-over-year backlog growth. After a steady pipeline in 2020 and momentum in government funding strategy, timing remains uncertain in our focused geographies, such as in the U.S. and U.K. We anticipate further improvement to our pipeline as government solidify their budget.  
I'll discuss 4 trends impacting the macroeconomic environment and our sectors, all of which we are well positioned to capitalize on. First, climate change and decarbonization of the economy, driving sustainability and resilience for public and private entities; second, economic stimulus for long-term job growth and economic relief; third, the pandemic, and continued growth in health, life sciences and cloud computing; and fourth, modernization of infrastructure and the digitization of the industry. 
Beginning with climate change and the decarbonization of the economy. The environmental sector is experiencing growth as governments, the investment community, companies and citizens confirm their commitment to climate action, act on their decarbonization agenda and increase focus on PFAS and emerging contaminants. We generated the largest growth in this sector year-over-year and anticipate our investment in PA Consulting to further strengthen our decarbonization solutions offering. 
These solutions, such as advising our clients on their climate action goals, developing strategy and policy, assisting in program implementation and providing intelligent asset management, are embedded in all our geographies and sectors. A great example of this is our recent win in Orange County, Florida to develop innovative, resilient and sustainable waste management systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations for cleaner electricity use. Recent awards for the Marinus Link electricity interconnector linking the states of Victoria and Tasmania in Australia, and a project to connect one of the world's largest lithium-ion batteries are key elements supporting Australia's renewable energy transition.  
In the Middle East, where we had a program manager to Expo 2020 Dubai, the sustainability pavilion, known as Terra, premiers this month. Leveraging our industry-leading sustainability expertise, Terra is designed to be a net 0 carbon-driving during full operations and provides a glimpse of what is to come when Expo fully opens later this year.  
Next, I'll discuss economic stimulus spend aimed at long-term job growth and economic relief. In the U.S., the current administration is pursuing an aggressive agenda that aligns directly with the long-term growth of our markets. We have every reason to believe that focus will continue as the administration and Congress address COVID relief, climate change, environmental justice, resilience, and the need to create long-term job growth and economic recovery through infrastructure modernization. As activity on these issues progress, we anticipate funding to support our clients' projects at the federal, state and local level, which we are uniquely positioned to support through long-term historical framework agreements.  
In the U.K., we are well positioned for stimulus and a leveling up agenda to rebalance the economy across the country, and are supporting our clients with smart integrated solutions with tangible social, environmental and economic benefits for the communities they serve. 
In our Asia Pacific geography, particularly in India, Singapore and Australia, we expect an infrastructure-led economic revival around transportation and green recovery, largely centered on large-scale renewables and energy to catalyze the economy over the coming year.  
Moving to the impact of the pandemic and continued growth in health, life sciences and the cloud computing supply chain. COVID vaccine production is progressing to increase capacity and distribution as well as increased demand from contract manufacturing companies, with an acute focus on biotechnology. And we expect our investment in PA Consulting to strengthen our end-to-end delivery in this sector. 
Demand for cloud computing continues to drive our data center business globally. We remain agile and are diversifying our client base to adjust to market trends in semiconductor manufacturing. Building on established relationships and industry-leading leadership, we are in negotiations for several new life sciences and electronics projects. In the built environment sector, we are gaining momentum with our clients focused on the global health care prices. We were selected to lead the programming in engineering efforts for a new campus for the California -- University of California Davis Health Center as well as the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital redevelopment in Australia, where investment in technology and physical infrastructure support new trends in virtual care.  
Finally, I'll talk about modernization and infrastructure and the digitization of the industry. Infrastructure modernization remains a priority investment across all sectors and geographies. Transportation continues with a heavy focus on highways and rail. We were awarded the engineering services project for the Houston Metro Inter Katy bus rapid transit system as well as the new rapid transit project in Southeast Asia that will enable the workforce to adapt to public transport, representing another example of how we support our clients with solutions that improve sustainability of our cities and places.  
Water sector trends are steady, with implementation of digital technologies and a focus on the water energy nexus and resiliency. Using Replica, Jacobs' proprietary digital twin platform, we developed a digital twin of the watershed for Las Virgenes municipal water district in California for the evaluation of water supply scenarios while balancing water quality and operational resilience. 
In summary, the foundation of our P&P business remains strong, with our long-term client base and frameworks in place to move rapidly when government funding is solidified. Positioned extremely well for the near-term secular trends, we expect a steady growth trajectory, with profitability improving as we continue to move higher on the value chain. 
I will now turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail."

First quarter gross revenue increased 1% year-over-year, with pro forma net revenue flat. Revenue for CMS increased 3% on a pro forma basis, and P&PS net revenue was down 3%. The P&PS decline was mainly attributed to slower revenue burn, although the outlook for the business remains strong with backlog up 9% year-over-year. In the near term, we expect reported net revenue growth to be flat to up slightly year-over-year, then gain additional momentum in the second half of fiscal 2021. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.1%, down 110 basis points year-over-year. The lower gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by 2 factors: a tough compare from Q1 2020 that benefited from a favorable impact from lower benefit costs carried in corporate; and a higher mix of CMS revenue, which carries lower gross margins but also has a lower G&A as a percentage of revenue. 
CMS gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by almost 100 basis points as we benefited from a mix of higher margin revenue from acquisitions and new business wins. P&PS gross margin saw some modest pressure in Q1 due to a higher amount of America's program management and O&M revenue. 
Lower consolidated G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 170 basis points year-over-year to 13.6% more than offset the gross margin impacts. As it pertains to G&A, the first quarter continued to benefit from our ability to proactively manage our cost structure, the CMS mix benefit previously stated, and some Focus 2023 savings from lower real estate costs, lower travel and lower COVID-related employee medical costs. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in the management of our G&A cost. 
GAAP operating profit was $214 million and included $22 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, the majority associated with our recently announced Focus 2023 initiative and $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $259 million, up 10%, with both lines of business posting double-digit percent increases in operating profit. As a result, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 9.5%, up 60 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. 
GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $257 million and $1.96 per share, and included a benefit of $0.54 driven by mark-to-market adjustments for our Worley equity stake; a $0.47 benefit related to a mark-to-market investment in AI software provider, C3.ai; $0.16 share of after-tax charges, primarily related to Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs; a $0.17 charge related to the impairment of our AWE Management investment; and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.13. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.41, up 17%. 
Let me provide some detail on our investment in AI software provider, C3.ai. In 2010, we made a small investment in the company, which recently completed an IPO. Today, our investment represents more than 750,000 shares in the company. Due to our lockup requirements surrounding our ownership, we applied a discount to the quarter-end value of our interest in the company, resulting in the investment valued at $85 million on our quarter-end balance sheet. At today's price, our interest represents a greater than 20x return on our original investment.  
Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $280 million and was up 8% year-over-year, reaching 10.3% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.2x for Q1, driven by strong book-to-bill in P&PS. 
From a pipeline standpoint, we continue to grow the CMS pipeline, both on a pro forma and reported basis. The timing of when this robust CMS pipeline will convert into backlog is weighted more towards the second half of fiscal 2021, resulting in our projected backlog exhibiting year-over-year growth for the year. 
The P&PS overall sales pipeline has increased as well, driven by a pro environmental Biden administration, broader potential infrastructure stimulus in the U.S. and an improving economic outlook. The exact timing of when many of these new stimulus-related opportunities will convert to bookings will become clear over the coming months and will help support backlog growth for the year.  
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS. Revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis. CMS operating profit was $110 million, up 22% and up 15% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year to 8.5%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities, such as our recent NORAD win, which is now fully ramped. We also some additional benefit from favorable project closeouts. 
As we progress through fiscal 2021, we expect low single-digit CMS reported revenue growth as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the Wood Nuclear acquisition and continue to ramp new wins, more than offsetting the revenue headwind from fully transitioning of 2 large lower-margin projects previously discussed, which account for a nearly $600 million headwind in annual revenue in 2021. Given the strategy to capture higher value businesses via both acquisitions and organic efforts, we continue to expect reported and pro forma operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year. 
Moving to P&PS. Q1 net revenue was down 3% year-over-year, driven by a lower short-term burn rate, as bookings growth remained strong and backlog was up 9% year-over-year, with a 1.3x book-to-bill. We continued to see solid revenue growth in our Americas business, offset by some timing-related slowdown in our advanced facilities in Europe and Middle East businesses. P&PS operating profit was up 10% year-over-year and as a percentage of net revenue was 13.7% for the quarter, up 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by disciplined management of G&A costs. 
Looking forward, we continue to project P&PS revenue to be up low single-digits for fiscal 2021, with improving year-over-year growth as we progress through the year. We expect operating profit margin as a percentage of net revenue to moderate from Q1 levels, but still increase from fiscal 2020, driven by strong operating profit growth.
Our nonallocated corporate costs were $47 million for the quarter. While this figure was supported by strong cost discipline, we continue to expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by inflation in medical costs, enhanced employee benefits and increases in discretionary medical procedures that were put on hold during fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns. 
Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A integrations. We continue to make strong progress on our strategic initiative, Focus 2023, that we believe will: one, lead to enhanced employee and customer experience; two, improve our ability to capture emerging high-growth margin opportunities; and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall longer-term profitability. 
During the quarter, we incurred an additional $10 million charge and cash outflows of approximately $30 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. These investments were mainly related to improving the utilization of our physical spaces, deploying new tools and technology for better efficiency in our business and strategically leaning out the organization. 
Turning to our recent acquisition of the Buffalo Group. The company had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth. We continue to expect that the acquisition will deliver $0.08 to $0.10 adjusted EPS accretion during fiscal 2021. 
Regarding PA Consulting. We are pleased with the preliminary results for calendar year 2020, which are tracking ahead of our expectations. We are also optimistic about their calendar year 2021 growth plan. And after the transaction close up later this quarter, we look forward to discussing the results and growth plan in more detail. We continue to expect $0.52 to $0.57 of adjusted EPS accretion from PA Consulting for fiscal 2022. 
And finally, when including all integration and restructuring initiatives, as well as the AWE charge but excluding PA Consulting, we now expect a total of approximately $100 million of P&L charges and $110 million in related cash outflows in fiscal 2021. When including an additional nonrecurring headwind associated with the payment of 2020 related U.K. VAT tax payments in the current quarter, we expect a total of approximately $150 million of onetime cash outflows in fiscal year 2021. We will update these estimates to include PA Consulting after we closed the transaction. 
Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the first quarter, we generated $96 million in reported free cash flow, a significant improvement versus the level seen in the last several Q1 periods, primarily a result of an improvement of 3 days in DSO versus a year ago, other working capital benefits and less headwinds from cash restructuring. The strong Q1 cash flow included a net negative of $44 million of onetime costs associated with Focus 2023 restructuring and other items.  
Regarding the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $837 million and a gross debt of $1.8 billion, resulting in $1 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley and C3.ai equity. Treating the Worley and C3.ai equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 0.4x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. 
During our current fiscal second quarter, we finalized a new delayed draw term loan related to our PA Consulting investment. Post-PA close, we expect our balance sheet to have continued financial flexibility. However, we will be prudent to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment over the short term. 
And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for Slide #13."

Look, Jamie, thanks for the question. First thing is, on the P&PS margin profile, we actually saw a good solid gross margin performance, but really, the fundamental margin profile driven primarily by the very disciplined management of our G&A costs. Of course, some of that has been driven already by some of the work that we did when we announced some of the activities relative to our reduction in footprint on real estate, some of the travel reductions that we've been doing. But there's also been a fairly significant actions, proactive actions, taken in terms of managing our labor costs appropriately relative to the current situation regarding the pandemic. 
We're closely monitoring that. And as we think about how our business starts to come back, which is fully anticipated over the course of this year, some of those costs will come back into play as it relates to the business, but that's going to be associated with higher gross profit as well. So ultimately, margin profile will continue to be robust, maybe not at the same level as Q1, but certainly, well above what we would have expected to see in 2020, what we did see in 2020. So feeling very good about that opportunity.
In terms of the margin profile between the 2 businesses, we've said that we believe actually margin profile can improve on both sides with both of the businesses. And consequently, a big focus in 2021 is starting to reduce in a more tangible way the margin profile difference between the 2 businesses, and we've been communicating that CMS margins should be strong improvement this year. And I think we started to see that in the first quarter, and we would expected that to continue to play out over the balance of 2021."

So we are a company that is always active and making sure we're exploring all opportunities globally, and we're going to continue to do that. We have recently executed on some acquisitions with the Buffalo Group and PA Consulting most recently. And Wood Nuclear is fairly new. So for us, our top priority is to execute on those recent acquisitions and demonstrate continued success. We feel proud of what we achieved with a major one of CH2M back in 2017 and have successfully executed and exceeded expectations. And so we want to focus on that right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, over the next months, our primary capital deployment is going to be to pay down debt. 
However, when we look at the pipeline of opportunities and our strategy, there are several bolt-on opportunities, even within PA Consulting. When we think about what we have initiated there with coming together with PA, they've been a very successful firm in doing bolt-on acquisitions that help them create value, and we want to continue to support that. And together, we think that there's going to be some real interesting things that we can do in that whole consulting arena, which is higher margin, higher value business. 
And then, of course, anything that we can do to just accelerate our digital modernization, strategic data utilization as we have done with the series of cyber acquisitions, including most recently, KeyW and the Buffalo Group. And so we'll continue to be active on the government services space and any other bolt-on acquisitions that can strengthen our P&PS business as well. 
And the final thing I'll say is there's some geographic expansion opportunities when you look at our mix of business. It really is still majority, the majority of our revenue comes from the U.S. and U.K., and then it drops down significantly from there. And so we think there's some great geographic expansion initiatives over the coming years."

So I think those remain strong. 
As far as what we see coming out of the funding, I really -- I'm sorry, the year-on-year piece. I'd really kind of point to the sustainability of our work due to the framework and the position we have with our clients. So yes, there has been a bit of a revenue decline, but it wasn't a drop off a cliff. And we were able to -- there was a bit of a drop in Q3 of last year, and we've been able to sustain it. Remember, comparison to last year quarter-on-quarter -- I'm sorry, year-on-year, we weren't in the pandemic.

When we talked about the P&PS business, clearly, what's driving our pipeline are the things that Bob talked about initially. And that is the whole digital modernization and strategic data utilization across the -- all of our clients and buildings, infrastructure, advanced facilities. The whole climate change arena is clearly going to be ramping up with the change in administration in the U.S., but just a global priority that's going on there. And when we talk about climate change, it's the things we're already doing in solar and wind, and now hydrogen is kicking in and the energy storage with batteries and the whole resiliency strength that we have, which we've been doing for the last several years around flooding and sea level rise and a whole host of other things, PFAS, et cetera. 
And then the whole opportunity around the advanced facilities business with regard to what the pandemic has accelerated in the life sciences business and the electronics business. Because on the life science side, there's now a pent-up demand on non-COVID activity. Obviously, the priority is COVID vaccines and therapeutics. But oncology, diabetes, emerging cell and gene therapy and also the fact that there's more need for capacity. So there's a huge contract toward manufacturing opportunity that's now presenting itself, and then the whole health care side with hospitals and what's going on globally there. 
And then the electronics with the future of work, with everything from 5G to data centers to the semiconductor, there's clearly a wave of growth in that business as well. So -- and then on top of all that is what countries are doing around the world, starting with the U.S. around stimulating their economies coming out of the pandemic. Clearly, we're seeing positive momentum in the U.S. We expect to see something soon with this first COVID relief package. But we're anxious to see what comes out over the coming months in the whole infrastructure stimulus, which will benefit Jacobs, its upside. This is '22 and beyond when we talk about infrastructure stimulus. It's -- our current year is not dependent on it. And then from a standpoint of U.K., very positive momentum. And many of the other countries are also kicking in with their infrastructure initiatives, economic initiatives. So real positive momentum on the P&PS side.

And then with the KeyW acquisition, and some of the other initiatives that we've done both organically and bolted on, is that this whole lower orbit space intelligence that Bob just talked about that we're very excited about, most of it, very highly classified work. So that's now going to, we believe, is going to be a very high growth add on to our whole space initiatives. 
So -- and then with the adjacency work that comes with our intelligence work and relationship with the space community is the whole hypersonics area that is going to be something that is big for us starting in the sort of the consulting, research development and then getting into some of the big programs there. So well over $1 billion today and one that we expect a high-growth block going forward."

But when you look at the last several years, the CH2M acquisition was -- the combination has really accelerated our capability. The things that CH2M brought, like Digital Twins, that we talk about and several other packeted capabilities. And then we go into the whole strategy that we unleashed over the last several years around the Jacobs Connected Enterprise and now the -- taking it to a higher level and the culture that we put in. The talent attraction that we've had a very focused talent attraction on, making sure that we bring in all the subject matter expertise and the digital capabilities, it's been impressive and really tapping into the -- some of the most innovative companies to bring some of their talent to Jacobs. 
And then the last 2 big steps have been the rebranding to really make our clients more aware. A lot of the stuff we were doing for certain clients in one part of Jacobs, most of the rest of our clients didn't really know that we have that capability, and that brand initiative that we launched last year was a key step. And then PA Consulting is now going to take it to whole new level around the end-to-end solutions that we can provide. 
When you look at the IP that we have, it's pretty impressive across the board. And then the technology hubs that we focus on, geospatial, predictive analytics, cyber, Internet of things, intelligent asset management. And when you put it all together, the real differentiation for Jacobs is that we have both the domain knowledge, decades of experience working on all of these end markets and clients. And we have the state-of-the-art technology skill set and bringing digital solutions. So when you put that together, we feel like we're in a unique differentiated position."

I think with a lot of the work that Steve just alluded to in our strategy over the last several years has positioned us very, very well from a balance sheet perspective to be able to execute against the PA transaction. Our actual net debt is probably in the neighborhood once we close is probably in the area of 2x. So still quite nice in terms of our position. We still have substantive levels of cash at that particular point in time. So we have some flexibility as it relates to that. 
Our gross debt levels will be a little bit higher. So our idea is that we will, kind of in the very short term, reduce some of that gross debt level with incremental cash generation that we're going to be seeing. But we feel like we still have really good flexibility as it relates to how we will look to deploy capital, not in the necessarily immediate term, but certainly, as we progress through the next few months and into later 2021. We'll be able to have some greater levels of flexibility there. So really quite well positioned relative to our debt structure even after the amount of funds that are going to be paid out. It's appropriately -- it's approximately about $1.8 billion. So we'll be doing well even with that in terms of our leverage factors. 
Relative to the other equity matters, we said that these are good strategic investments and that we'll continue to think about what that means longer term."

And certainly, the sustainability comment that Bob had made is important because of the particular stimulus package that's being considered right now provides that opportunity to do so. I think if you combine it all together with Focus 2023, and our continued efforts to drive effectiveness across the globe, and with the continuation of an improving economic picture, we still think there is an ability to have great growth in 2022 and beyond, and that would be double-digit. Obviously, if there is a large infrastructure build, that would be augmenting some of those numbers. 
I think as it relates to both CMS and PPS with -- P&PS, we feel good about the growth prospects of both of the business long-term. Both are aligned with really strong growth trends, critical mission areas, as outlined by Bob. And then, of course, People & Places aligned with secular long-term growth trends.

And thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and strategy update.  
It's been about a year since the pandemic started and we hope everyone is safe and healthy as COVID-19 continues to impact all facets of our daily lives. At Jacobs, in addition to keeping our people safe, we're continuing to support national governments and industry and their production and distribution of critical vaccines.  
Turning to Slide 4 to discuss our first quarter results. It's important to review our strategy, which is foundational to an investment in Jacobs. We believe the transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created a compelling multi-decade investment opportunity for our current and potential shareholders based on 3 key tenets.  
First, we have transformed our culture aligned -- around a common purpose of creating a connected, sustainable world, underpinned by strong values. But we do things right. We challenge the accepted. We aim higher, and we live inclusion. This culture permeates through our more than 50,000 people, the solutions we deliver for our clients and the engagement in our communities where we live and work. Our purpose-driven culture has also enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in market conditions while also staying focused on our long-term vision of being a technology-enabled solutions provider.
Second, we have a portfolio of solutions aligned to a diverse set of global opportunities, such as space exploration, cyber readiness, climate change and modernizing and digitizing our infrastructure. Our thematic growth areas are global, allowing us to address them efficiently, effectively and competitively at scale through our integrated global platform of technology, our talented resources, domain expertise and enhanced brand awareness. 
Finally, our Jacobs management team has demonstrated the ability to strategically allocate capital, including successfully executing acquisitions. Our continued focus on strategy and execution has resulted in a strong start to fiscal 2021, even while continuing to manage the headwinds from the global pandemic.  
First quarter net revenue increased 3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew 8%. Our backlog ended the first quarter up 11% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Given the strong momentum, we're increasing the midpoint of our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and EPS outlook. Our cash flow generation was strong during the first quarter and our balance sheet remains healthy. In the near term, we do expect to deploy excess cash towards paying down debt. 
Last quarter, we announced a strategic majority investment in PA Consulting. And we are happy to share that the transaction was overwhelmingly approved on February 4, with 99.8% of PA shareholders voting in favor of their transaction. Particularly exciting was the fact that the voluntary election for management rollover was fully subscribed and new partner hiring has also been very successful post announcement, indicating the enthusiasm and commitment of PA partners and employees about the future growth opportunity of this partnership. Confirmation of the scheme of arrangement is awaiting regulatory approval by the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., and we expect to close the investment by the end of this current quarter.  
PA's performance for calendar 2020 exceeded our expectations, and their pipeline of strategic and technical consulting work continues to grow. This includes a new engagement with the U.K.'s Department of International Trade (sic) [U.K.'s Department for International Trade], advising on Project Defend and U.K.'s supply chain resilience to underpin economic and national security, along with reaching a key milestone with the National Institute for Health Research, where they completed a U.K. public sector first delivery of Google cloud search to upgrade research platforms. Once we complete the transaction, we expect significant benefit for the clients of our firms, driven by the complementary solutions offering of PA and Jacobs.  
Now looking further into fiscal 2021 and beyond, we believe Jacobs has a compelling organic growth opportunity. And as appropriate, we will further accelerate that growth through thoughtful strategic acquisitions that offer a higher return versus our alternative of repurchasing shares of Jacobs. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'd like to review some recent ESG actions. As a company, we're committed to delivering results to all our stakeholders: our employees, our clients, our investors and our communities. Delivering on this includes our commitment to our sustainability strategy called PlanBeyond and our Climate Action Plan launched last year. I'm pleased to report that we achieved a net 0 carbon, including 100% renewable energy for our operations in 2020. And our carbon reduction targets have been formally approved by the Science Based Target Initiative. 
The climate agenda will continue to be front and center in 2021, with the United States rejoining the Paris Agreement and the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties or COP26 being held in November. In support, Jacobs announced our Pledge to Action, a campaign inviting our clients and suppliers around the globe to take measurable actions to tackle climate change before the opening of COP26. And we are also leveraging the power of our Jacobs people and making a positive impact. 
We launched our Climate Countdown Challenge, where employees can join a new mission each month to tackle the climate crisis. Through both of these initiatives, we hope to raise awareness, inspire and motivate individuals and companies, and demonstrate the collective power of organizations taking actions now to make an impact for generations to come. 
Moving to Slide 6. At Jacobs, we intend to lead from the front in the transformation to a net 0 economy. In combination with the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change remains the major global driver for ecological, social and economic disruption, impacting every person, community, business and governments around the world. It's also a major disruptor, advancing technology-enabled innovation and sustainable business models for addressing decarbonization, the global energy transition and resource scarcity. 
Jacobs is uniquely positioned to support our clients and communities in developing and deploying solutions and technologies across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including renewable energy and clean power, carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency and energy storage, green buildings, sustainable transport, circular economy, carbon management, mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as adaptation and resilience for all facets of infrastructure. 
This includes developing technology solutions, like our recently announced launch of Jacobs Travel Service Optimization solution, which transforms the home to school travel experience for special educational needs and disabilities children and young people. This solution combines our deep domain knowledge with the latest advances in data analytics to determine the most efficient ride-sharing experience, while supporting decarbonization and our long-term transition to a net 0 economy.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."
282159,701173278,2244104,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. And now moving on to Slide 7 to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. During the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance despite the continued high levels of COVID-19 cases. Our workfor",1661,"Thank you, Steve. And now moving on to Slide 7 to review the quarterly performance for Critical Mission Solutions. During the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance despite the continued high levels of COVID-19 cases. Our workforce and clients have addressed the primary challenges of physical distancing and continued to execute on our contracts regardless of work location at approximately 95% of normal operating levels. Total CMS backlog is at $9.7 billion, representing a 14% year-over-year growth and up 4% on a pro forma basis.  
The CMS strategy is focused on both revenue growth and margin expansion by aligning to our go-to-market strategy towards critical national priorities of digital modernization, strategic data utilization, lower orbit satellites, hypersonics and cyber. I'll discuss each in greater detail.  
Beginning with digital modernization trends. Our global government clients face the current task of transforming their digital stack of information, communications and security systems in order to maintain their national security. We are on this transformation journey with our clients as we develop and operate their next-generation digital systems. In December, we cleared the protest period on the Navy's Kings Bay Intelligent Asset Management award, and we were awarded another new digital modernization project for the Army's Intelligence and Security Command. 
In addition to digital modernization, a second key growth driver for our business is the DoD's increased focus on strategic data utilization. The DoD is becoming a data-centric organization, combining edge computing with data intelligence and analysis at hyper speed and scale. Data is considered a strategic asset similar to the priority given to weapon systems. And it is increasingly central to war fighter advantage in and out of theater. 
As an example, our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance team was recently awarded a seat on the 10-year $950 million ceiling IDQ (sic) [IDIQ] to provide various unmanned aircraft solutions and satellite payload services for the Air Force's Advanced Battlefield Management System. ABMS allows a joint force to use cutting-edge methods and technologies to rapidly collect, analyze and share intelligence information and make decisions in real time.  
Moving on to low earth orbit satellite. These satellites play a key role in advanced communications, military reconnaissance, intelligence and other imaging applications. Jacobs began a new era in advanced space radar payloads with the successful launch of its Mango One satellite. Our approach enables government and commercial customers to proliferate space-based sensors that see in the dark and through clouds to provide near continuous monitoring, gathering valuable, actionable intelligence in the ground, sea, air and space domain.  
And now on to hypersonics. Hypersonic offensive and defensive weapons technology is unquestionably one of the highest priorities for our government clients. Jacobs through its decades of supporting the Air Force and NASA, the clear leader in hypersonic solution. During the quarter, CMS was awarded a hypersonic test cell contract from the Air Force at Arnold Engineering Development Complex to transform the facility into a unique, large scale, clean air, variable mach number test facility with extended run time capability. 
A final trend is to discuss cyber. The recent solar wind sunburst advanced persistent attack continues to make headlines giving its sophistication and dwelling time. In fact, the Biden administration has requested a $9 billion plus increase in spending for cyber and modernization. And as mentioned on our call last quarter, the British government also approved its largest military investment increase in 30 years, by GBP 16.5 billion or 10% per year over the next 4 years in defense areas, including cybersecurity.  
CMS' cyber and intelligence business has grown over the past several years to more than 3,300 professionals today. Part of our growth strategy is to continue to add adjacent capabilities and customers. The Buffalo Group acquisition, which closed in November, posted strong initial performance and is a catalyst for achieving immediate scale and deep client access with a strong majority of the U.S. Intelligence Agency and Combatant Command.  
In summary, we continue to see strong structural demand for our solutions. Supporting this, the CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business pipeline remaining above $30 billion, including over $10 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile.  
Now on to Slide 8. I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Last quarter, we conveyed optimism around our balanced portfolio and our ability to remain resilient through economic and geopolitical volatility. This is demonstrated by strong P&L performance in the quarter as well as 9% year-over-year backlog growth. After a steady pipeline in 2020 and momentum in government funding strategy, timing remains uncertain in our focused geographies, such as in the U.S. and U.K. We anticipate further improvement to our pipeline as governments solidify their budget.  
I'll discuss 4 trends impacting the macroeconomic environment and our sectors, all of which we are well positioned to capitalize on. First, climate change and decarbonization of the economy, driving sustainability and resilience for public and private entities; second, economic stimulus for long-term job growth and economic relief; third, the pandemic, and continued growth in health, life sciences and cloud computing; and fourth, modernization of infrastructure and the digitization of the industry. 
Beginning with climate change and the decarbonization of the economy. The environmental sector is experiencing growth as governments, the investment community, companies and citizens confirm their commitment to climate action, act on their decarbonization agenda and increase focus on PFAS and emerging contaminants. We generated the largest growth in this sector year-over-year and anticipate our investment in PA Consulting to further strengthen our decarbonization solutions offering. 
These solutions, such as advising our clients on their climate action goals, developing strategy and policy, assisting in program implementation and providing intelligent asset management, are embedded in all our geographies and sectors. A great example of this is our recent win in Orange County, Florida to develop innovative, resilient and sustainable waste management systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations for cleaner electricity use. Recent awards for the Marinus Link electricity interconnector linking the states of Victoria and Tasmania in Australia, and a project to connect one of the world's largest lithium-ion batteries are key elements supporting Australia's renewable energy transition.  
In the Middle East, where we had a program manager to Expo 2020 Dubai, the sustainability pavilion, known as Terra, premiers this month. Leveraging our industry-leading sustainability expertise, Terra is designed to be a net 0 carbon-driving during full operations and provides a glimpse of what is to come when Expo fully opens later this year.  
Next, I'll discuss economic stimulus spend aimed at long-term job growth and economic relief. In the U.S., the current administration is pursuing an aggressive agenda that aligns directly with the long-term growth of our markets. We have every reason to believe that focus will continue as the administration and Congress address COVID relief, climate change, environmental justice, resilience, and the need to create long-term job growth and economic recovery through infrastructure modernization. As activity on these issues progress, we anticipate funding to support our clients' projects at the federal, state and local level, which we are uniquely positioned to support through long-term historical framework agreements.  
In the U.K., we are well positioned for stimulus and a leveling up agenda to rebalance the economy across the country, and are supporting our clients with smart integrated solutions with tangible social, environmental and economic benefits for the communities they serve. 
In our Asia Pacific geography, particularly in India, Singapore and Australia, we expect an infrastructure-led economic revival around transportation and green recovery, largely centered on large-scale renewables and energy to catalyze the economy over the coming year.  
Moving to the impact of the pandemic and continued growth in health, life sciences and the cloud computing supply chain. COVID vaccine production is progressing to increase capacity and distribution as well as increased demand from contract manufacturing companies, with an acute focus on biotechnology. And we expect our investment in PA Consulting to strengthen our end-to-end delivery in this sector. 
Demand for cloud computing continues to drive our data center business globally. We remain agile and are diversifying our client base to adjust to market trends in semiconductor manufacturing. Building on established relationships and industry-leading leadership, we are in negotiations for several new life sciences and electronics projects. In the built environment sector, we are gaining momentum with our clients focused on the global health care prices. 
We were selected to lead the programming and engineering efforts for a new campus for the California -- University of California Davis Health Center as well as the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital redevelopment in Australia, where investment in technology and physical infrastructure support new trends in virtual care.  
Finally, I'll talk about modernization and infrastructure and the digitization of the industry. Infrastructure modernization remains a priority investment across all sectors and geographies. Transportation continues with a heavy focus on highways and rail. We were awarded the engineering services project for the Houston Metro Inter Katy bus rapid transit system as well as the new rapid transit project in Southeast Asia that will enable the workforce to adapt to public transport, representing another example of how we support our clients with solutions that improve sustainability of our cities and places.  
Water sector trends are steady, with implementation of digital technologies and a focus on the water energy nexus and resiliency. Using Replica, Jacobs' proprietary digital twin platform, we developed a digital twin of the watershed for Las Virgenes municipal water district in California for the evaluation of water supply scenarios while balancing water quality and operational resilience. 
In summary, the foundation of our P&P business remains strong, with our long-term client base and frameworks in place to move rapidly when government funding is solidified. Positioned extremely well for the near-term secular trends, we expect a steady growth trajectory, with profitability improving as we continue to move higher on the value chain. 
I will now turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our financial performance in more detail."

First quarter gross revenue increased 1% year-over-year, with pro forma net revenue flat. Revenue for CMS increased 3% on a pro forma basis, and P&PS net revenue was down 3%. The P&PS decline was mainly attributed to slower revenue burn, although the outlook for the business remains strong with backlog up 9% year-over-year. In the near term, we expect reported net revenue growth to be flat to up slightly year-over-year, then gain additional momentum in the second half of fiscal 2021. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.1%, down 110 basis points year-over-year. The lower gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by 2 factors: a tough compare from Q1 2020 that benefited from a favorable impact from lower benefit costs carried in corporate; and a higher mix of CMS revenue, which carries lower gross margins but also has a lower G&A as a percentage of revenue. 
CMS gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by almost 100 basis points as we benefited from a mix of higher margin revenue from acquisitions and new business wins. P&PS gross margin saw some modest pressure in Q1 due to a higher amount of America's program management and O&M revenue. 
Lower consolidated G&A as a percentage of net revenue of 170 basis points year-over-year to 13.6% more than offset the gross margin impacts. As it pertains to G&A, the first quarter continued to benefit from our ability to proactively manage our cost structure, the CMS mix benefit previously stated, and some Focus 2023 savings from lower real estate costs, lower travel and lower COVID-related employee medical costs. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in the management of our G&A cost. 
GAAP operating profit was $214 million and included $22 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, the majority associated with our recently announced Focus 2023 initiative and $23 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $259 million, up 10%, with both lines of business posting double-digit percent increases in operating profit. As a result, our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 9.5%, up 60 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. 
GAAP net earnings and EPS from continuing operations were $257 million and $1.96 per share, and included a benefit of $0.54 driven by mark-to-market adjustments for our Worley equity stake; a $0.47 benefit related to a mark-to-market investment in AI software provider, C3.ai; $0.16 per share of after-tax charges, primarily related to Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs; a $0.17 charge related to the impairment of our AWE Management investment; and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.13. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.41, up 17%. 
Let me provide some detail on our investment in AI software provider, C3.ai. In 2010, we made a small investment in the company, which recently completed an IPO. Today, our investment represents more than 750,000 shares in the company. Due to our lockup requirements surrounding our ownership, we applied a discount to the quarter-end value of our interest in the company, resulting in the investment valued at $85 million on our quarter-end balance sheet. At today's price, our interest represents a greater than 20x return on our original investment.  
Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $280 million and was up 8% year-over-year, reaching 10.3% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.2x for Q1, driven by strong book-to-bill in P&PS. 
From a pipeline standpoint, we continue to grow the CMS pipeline, both on a pro forma and reported basis. The timing of when this robust CMS pipeline will convert into backlog is weighted more towards the second half of fiscal 2021, resulting in our projected backlog exhibiting year-over-year growth for the year. 
The P&PS overall sales pipeline has increased as well, driven by a pro environmental Biden administration, broader potential infrastructure stimulus in the U.S. and an improving economic outlook. The exact timing of when many of these new stimulus-related opportunities will convert to bookings will become clear over the coming months and will help support backlog growth for the year.  
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS. Revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis. CMS operating profit was $110 million, up 22% and up 15% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating profit margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year to 8.5%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities, such as our recent NORAD win, which is now fully ramped. We also saw additional benefit from favorable project closeouts. 
As we progress through fiscal 2021, we expect low single-digit CMS reported revenue growth as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the Wood Nuclear acquisition and continue to ramp new wins, more than offsetting the revenue headwind from fully transitioning of 2 large lower-margin projects previously discussed, which account for a nearly $600 million headwind in annual revenue in 2021. Given the strategy to capture higher value businesses via both acquisitions and organic efforts, we continue to expect reported and pro forma operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year. 
Moving to P&PS. Q1 net revenue was down 3% year-over-year, driven by a lower short-term burn rate, as bookings growth remained strong and backlog was up 9% year-over-year, with a 1.3x book-to-bill. We continue to see solid revenue growth in our Americas business, offset by some timing-related slowdown in our advanced facilities in Europe and Middle East businesses. P&PS operating profit was up 10% year-over-year and as a percentage of net revenue was 13.7% for the quarter, up 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by disciplined management of G&A costs. 
Looking forward, we continue to project P&PS revenue to be up low single-digits for fiscal 2021, with improving year-over-year growth as we progress through the year. We expect operating profit margin as a percentage of net revenue to moderate from Q1 levels, but still increase from fiscal 2020, driven by strong operating profit growth.
Our nonallocated corporate costs were $47 million for the quarter. While this figure was supported by strong cost discipline, we continue to expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by inflation in medical costs, enhanced employee benefits and increases in discretionary medical procedures that were put on hold during fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns. 
Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A integrations. We continue to make strong progress on our strategic initiative, Focus 2023, that we believe will: one, lead to enhanced employee and customer experience; two, improve our ability to capture emerging high-growth margin opportunities; and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall longer-term profitability. 
During the quarter, we incurred an additional $10 million charge and cash outflows of approximately $30 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. These investments were mainly related to improving the utilization of our physical spaces, deploying new tools and technology for better efficiency in our business and strategically leaning out the organization. 
Turning to our recent acquisition of the Buffalo Group. The company had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth. We continue to expect that the acquisition will deliver $0.08 to $0.10 adjusted EPS accretion during fiscal 2021. 
Regarding PA Consulting. We are pleased with the preliminary results for calendar year 2020, which are tracking ahead of our expectations. We are also optimistic about their calendar year 2021 growth plan. And after the transaction closes later this quarter, we look forward to discussing the results and growth plan in more detail. We continue to expect $0.52 to $0.57 of adjusted EPS accretion from PA Consulting for fiscal 2022. 
And finally, when including all integration and restructuring initiatives, as well as the AWE charge but excluding PA Consulting, we now expect a total of approximately $100 million of P&L charges and $110 million in related cash outflows in fiscal 2021. When including an additional nonrecurring headwind associated with the payment of 2020 related U.K. VAT tax payments in the current quarter, we expect a total of approximately $150 million of onetime cash outflows in fiscal year 2021. We will update these estimates to include PA Consulting after we close the transaction. 
Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the first quarter, we generated $96 million in reported free cash flow, a significant improvement versus the level seen in the last several Q1 periods, primarily a result of an improvement of 3 days in DSO versus a year ago, other working capital benefits and less headwinds from cash restructuring. The strong Q1 cash flow included a net negative of $44 million of onetime costs associated with Focus 2023 restructuring and other items.  
Regarding the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $837 million and a gross debt of $1.8 billion, resulting in $1 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of the Worley and C3.ai equity. Treating the Worley and C3.ai equity as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 0.4x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. 
During our current fiscal second quarter, we finalized a new delayed draw term loan related to our PA Consulting investment. Post-PA close, we expect our balance sheet to have continued financial flexibility. However, we will be prudent to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment over the short term. 
And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Steve for Slide #13."

Look, Jamie, thanks for the question.

Look, Jamie, thanks for the question. First thing is, on the P&PS margin profile, we actually saw a good solid gross margin performance, but really, the fundamental margin profile driven primarily by the very disciplined management of our G&A costs. Of course, some of that has been driven already by some of the work that we did when we announced some of the activities relative to our reduction in footprint on real estate, some of the travel reductions that we've been doing. But there's also been a fairly significant actions, proactive actions, taken in terms of managing our labor costs appropriately relative to the current situation regarding the pandemic. 
We're closely monitoring that. And as we think about how our business starts to come back, which is fully anticipated over the course of this year, some of those costs will come back into play as it relates to the business, but that's going to be associated with higher gross profit as well. So ultimately, margin profile will continue to be robust, maybe not at the same level as Q1, but certainly, well above what we would have expected to see in 2020, what we did see in 2020. So feeling very good about that opportunity.
In terms of the margin profile between the 2 businesses, we've said that we believe actually margin profile can improve on both sides with both of the businesses. And consequently, a big focus in 2021 is starting to reduce in a more tangible way the margin profile difference between the 2 businesses, and we've been communicating that CMS margins should be strong improvement this year. And I think we started to see that in the first quarter, and we would expect that that to continue to play out over the balance of 2021."

So we are a company that is always active and making sure we're exploring all opportunities globally, and we're going to continue to do that. We have recently executed on some acquisitions with the Buffalo Group and PA Consulting most recently. And Wood Nuclear is fairly new. So for us, our top priority is to execute on those recent acquisitions and demonstrate continued success. We feel proud of what we achieved with a major one of CH2M back in 2017 and have successfully executed and exceeded expectations. And so we want to focus on that right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, over the next months, our primary capital deployment is going to be to pay down debt. 
However, when we look at the pipeline of opportunities and our strategy, there are several bolt-on opportunities, even within PA Consulting. When we think about what we have initiated there with coming together with PA, they've been a very successful firm in doing bolt-on acquisitions that's helped them create value, and we want to continue to support that. And together, we think that there's going to be some real interesting things that we can do in that whole consulting arena, which is higher margin, higher value business. 
And then, of course, anything that we can do to just accelerate our digital modernization, strategic data utilization as we have done with the series of cyber acquisitions, including most recently, KeyW and the Buffalo Group. And so we'll continue to be active on the government services space and any other bolt-on acquisitions that can strengthen our P&PS business as well. 
And the final thing I'll say is there's some geographic expansion opportunities when you look at our mix of business. It really is still majority, the majority of our revenue comes from the U.S. and U.K., and then it drops down significantly from there. And so we think there's some great geographic expansion initiatives over the coming years."

Look, on the number going from the $80 million to the $100 million, that's effectively driven by the AWE item that is a noncash charge. We highlighted that there was a current evaluation that was occurring during our Q4 call, you might recall. And so we basically had to write down our AWE investment that was made several years ago. So no real difference in terms of restructuring. Of course, we have not yet included any of the dynamics associated with PA, and there will be some costs obviously there. And that will be further clarified after we actually have PA come on into the fold, hopefully expected by the end of this quarter. So no real fundamental change at this particular point in time other than the AWE charge, noncash charge."

When we talked about the P&PS business, clearly, what's driving our pipeline are the things that Bob talked about initially. And that is the whole digital modernization and strategic data utilization across the -- all of our clients and buildings, infrastructure, advanced facilities. The whole climate change arena is clearly going to be ramping up with the change in administration in the U.S., but just a global priority that's going on there. 
And when we talk about climate change, it's the things we're already doing in solar and wind, and now hydrogen is kicking in and the energy storage with batteries and the whole resiliency strength that we have, which we've been doing for the last several years around flooding and sea level rise and a whole host of other things, PFAS, et cetera. 
And then the whole opportunity around the advanced facilities business with regard to what the pandemic has accelerated in the life sciences business and the electronics business. Because on the life science side, there's now a pent-up demand on non-COVID activity. Obviously, the priority is COVID vaccines and therapeutics. But oncology, diabetes, emerging cell and gene therapy and also the fact that there's more need for capacity. So there's a huge contract [ toll ] manufacturing opportunity that's now presenting itself, and then the whole health care side with hospitals and what's going on globally there. 
And then the electronics with the future of work, with everything from 5G to data centers to semiconductor, there's clearly a wave of growth in that business as well. So -- and then on top of all that is what countries are doing around the world, starting with the U.S. around stimulating their economies coming out of the pandemic. Clearly, we're seeing positive momentum in the U.S. We expect to see something soon with this first COVID relief package. But we're anxious to see what comes out over the coming months in the whole infrastructure stimulus, which will benefit Jacobs, its upside. This is '22 and beyond when we talk about infrastructure stimulus. It's -- our current year is not dependent on it. And then from a standpoint of U.K., very positive momentum. And many of the other countries are also kicking in with their infrastructure initiatives, economic initiatives. So real positive momentum on the P&PS side.

But when you look at the last several years, the CH2M acquisition was -- the combination has really accelerated our capability. The things that CH2M brought, like Digital Twins, that we talk about and several other packeted capabilities. And then we go into the whole strategy that we unleashed over the last several years around the Jacobs Connected Enterprise and now the -- taking it to a higher level and the culture that we put in. The talent attraction that we've had a very focused talent attraction on, making sure that we bring in all the subject matter expertise and the digital capabilities, it's been impressive and really tapping into the -- some of the most innovative companies to bring some of their talent to Jacobs. 
And then the last 2 big steps have been the rebranding to really make our clients more aware. A lot of the stuff we were doing for certain clients in one part of Jacobs, most of the rest of our clients didn't really know that we have that capability, and that brand initiative that we launched last year was a key step. And then PA Consulting is now going to take it to a whole new level around the end-to-end solutions that we can provide. 
When you look at the IP that we have, it's pretty impressive across the board. And then the technology hubs that we focus on, geospatial, predictive analytics, cyber, Internet of Things, intelligent asset management. And when you put it all together, the real differentiation for Jacobs is that we have both the domain knowledge, decades of experience working on all of these end markets and clients. And we have the state-of-the-art technology skill set and bringing digital solutions. So when you put that together, we feel like we're in a unique differentiated position."

Our actual net debt is probably in the neighborhood once we close, is probably in the area of 2x. So still quite nice in terms of our position. We still have substantive levels of cash at that particular point in time. So we have some flexibility as it relates to that. 
Our gross debt levels will be a little bit higher. So our idea is that we will, kind of in the very short term, reduce some of that gross debt level with incremental cash generation that we're going to be seeing. But we feel like we still have really good flexibility as it relates to how we will look to deploy capital, not in the necessarily immediate term, but certainly, as we progress through the next few months and into later 2021. We'll be able to have some greater levels of flexibility there. So really quite well positioned relative to our debt structure even after the amount of funds that are going to be paid out. It's appropriately -- it's approximately about $1.8 billion. So we'll be doing well even with that in terms of our leverage factors. 
Relative to the other equity matters, we said that these are good strategic investments and that we'll continue to think about what that means longer term."

And our view, however, is that we will start to see an ability to start to see incremental momentum in the back half of 2021. And certainly, the sustainability comment that Bob had made is important because of the particular stimulus package that's being considered right now provides that opportunity to do so. 
I think if you combine it all together with Focus 2023, and our continued efforts to drive effectiveness across the globe, and with the continuation of an improving economic picture, we still think there is an ability to have great growth in 2022 and beyond, and that would be double-digit. Obviously, if there is a large infrastructure build, that would be augmenting some of those numbers. 
I think as it relates to both CMS and PPS with -- P&PS, we feel good about the growth prospects of both of the business long-term. Both are aligned with really strong growth trends, critical mission areas, as outlined by Bob. And then, of course, People & Places aligned with secular long-term growth trends.

And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance at key initiatives.

And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance at key initiatives. As the pandemic lessens its impact here in the United States, it's vital to recognize the significant struggles that are still occurring throughout the world, especially in India. Jacobs made an immediate donation to the United Way in New Delhi for critical medical supply. And I'm particularly proud of our company and employees who together have donated $200,000 through our internal giving platform collectively. We have and will continue to support those that are still being impacted by the pandemic. including, for example, our operations in the Philippines. 
Turning to Slide 4. Before discussing our second quarter results, it's important to continue to reiterate how we think about our business by aligning and executing against our long-term strategy to drive superior value for our stakeholders. We take a multiyear approach to our rigorous strategy formation. This long-term mindset involves proactively assessing and aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. The transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created significant value measured by relative total shareholder return. 
As you have seen from our recent organic actions, the PA Consulting investment and the acquisition of the Buffalo Group, we believe there's a significant opportunity to deliver differentiated, digitally-enabled solutions as the world accelerates its efforts to modernize infrastructure, improve global supply chain and enhance national security. 
We have started the development of our new corporate strategy for fiscal year 2022 to '24, which we will present to the investor community later this year. 
As to our financial results, I'm pleased with our strong second quarter performance with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 27%. Backlog ended the second quarter up 10% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Our strategic investment in PA Consulting closed on March 2 and demonstrated higher-than-expected results in the March quarter with 19% revenue growth in sterling, up 28%, including the benefit of FX. We are also excited by the revenue synergies our joint Jacobs PA teams are creating, resulting in a robust pipeline in line with our deal model expectations. 
Given the stronger performance across Jacobs and the early closing of the PA investment, we are increasing our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we see the potential for 1 of the most attractive periods for growth in our company's history, activated through alignment of our portfolio to numerous secular growth opportunities in the expected infrastructure stimulus across the globe. 
Turning to Slide 5. Sustainability at Jacobs is reflected in our company's purpose of delivering solutions for a more connected sustainable world as well as through our values. We do things right, we challenged the accepted, we aim higher, and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. I'm proud of our efforts over the last few years as we are now being recognized by various external governance groups. 
For example, ISS recently updated their ESG assessment of Jacobs. where we are now approaching top decile in both environmental and social categories. These results are a credit to our people and their focus on our purpose and values. 
And of course, on an external basis, ESG is a significant growth opportunity for Jacobs. Building on the success of our sustainability strategy launched in 2019, Plan Beyond 2.0 reinforces our commitment to driving to a net 0 economy through furthering our sustainable business offerings. We are in the early stages of a significant business growth opportunity to partner with our global customers and communities to provide solutions with their net 0 carbon commitments. 
Now with our investment in PA Consulting, Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. For example, we're implementing the first bio geochemical reactor pilot plant project for PFAS remediation in the U.S. supporting Germany's transition to significant net 0 power generation and distribution by 2030. 
We're teaming up water utilities in Australia to support decarbonization, working with industrial clients globally on their energy and resource management programs for advanced manufacturing facilities and many other projects, including those shared in the appendix to this presentation. 
Altogether, sustainable solutions is a high-growth business opportunity for Jacobs today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which, by the way, makes Jacob's one of the largest ESG solutions providers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business, During the second quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance and our workforce is executing at pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 vaccines are administered broadly across our operational sphere. Total CMS backlog is at $9.8 billion, representing a 7% year-over-year growth and up 6% pro forma, excluding the lower-margin hampered and classified procurement contract we have previously discussed. The CMS strategy is focused on revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. 
Similar to last quarter, I will discuss 4 notable market trends positively impacting our CMS business: space exploration intelligence, all-source intelligence, digital modernization and clean energy. 
Beginning with space exploration and intelligence, From idea to operations, Jacobs delivers know-how and value to every stage of the space system life cycle for our civil and national security space plan. NASA leads this global exploration and development of deep space with its Artemis program that will carry astronauts to and from the moon surface and beyond. As NASA's largest service provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of the Artemis mission, including the space launch system, the Orion spacecraft in the exploration ground systems based at Kennedy Space Center. We are proud to have expanded our NASA support to the Wallace Flight facility located in Virginia. and are now providing full life cycle operations and testing that deploy expertise we have developed at other NASA centers. 
We remain heavily engaged in the NASA mission portfolio, including the recent support of the SLS hot fire test in the design, fabrication and full deployment of the calibration device on the Perseverance Rover now exploring Mars. NASA continues to enjoy strong bipartisan progressional support with preliminary FY '22 budget, including a 6% increase over 2021. We also support the DoD's joint all domain intelligence initiative, utilizing satellite connectivity in space and adding more capacity for intel analysis, such as our successful Mango One launch earlier this year. Overall, defense base spending was up 28% in FY '21 and is expected to show strong growth in FY '22 as well. 
Moving on to all source intelligence. Today's threat levels require intelligence analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial and measurement and signature to allow for better decision-making in real time. The Buffalo Group acquisition greatly expanded Jacobs' all-source intelligence capability. We were awarded 2 exciting wins from the Defense Intelligence Agency in the quarter. Jacobs will provide counterterrorism analytical expertise for the defense Combating Terrorism Center, CTC, and integrated intelligence centers and direct support of war fighters around the globe. 
We were also awarded a prime seat on the $12.6 billion solutions for the Information Technology enterprise, Or site 3, IDIQ to address the evolving IT requirements vital to the security of the United States. All those specific classified budget details were not provided in the preliminary budget, redirection of funds towards emerging cyber and intelligence threats from state [indiscernible]. 
Now turning to digital modernization. In order for government agencies to run effectively and transform how they accomplish their missions, they require a full spectrum of digital enterprise solutions, including engineering operations, digital services such as cloud services, dev tech ops, cyber and data analytics. Contract obligations for digital modernization services have grown significantly over the past 5 years with strong continued growth expected as government agencies upgrade their data networks. 
Recently, our software engineering team won a 10-year contract to continue to develop and sustain terrain awareness and warning system software for the U.S. Air Force C-17 fleet to help ensure pilot safety. A final trend is in clean energy or energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydro power and nuclear energy, all of which are critical to transitioning global economies away from fossil fuel. 
Across our CMS new portfolio, our unique blend and depth of technical and program management capabilities allows us to provide life cycle support to our clients such as the delivery of Hinkley Point C, a large-scale nuclear power plant in the U.K. that will provide low carbon electricity for approximately 6 million homes, developing small modular reactors and advanced modular reactors for delivering sustainable products such as green hydrogen or synthetic fuels and working with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability. 
Specifically, in the U.S., the DoE has been allocated a 10% increase in the preliminary FY '22 budget for decommissioning and new clean energy investments, including Fusion. 
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in fiscal year 2021 and beyond under the Biden administration. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, with over $10 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile. 
Now on Slide 7, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Starting with an overview of the benefit of global stimulus, we anticipate a direct investment in our key industry sectors and geographies that align with global trends and emerging governmental focus on climate change, infrastructure modernization, digital transformation and advanced facility. We are uniquely positioned to provide world-class service to significant areas of stimulus, including the anticipated U.S. infrastructure bill. Our global delivery model connected across geographies and markets, combined with our digitized delivery approach ensures efficient and seamless support anywhere in the world. Our existing contracting framework with the primary recipients of the stimulus funding will allow us to unlock capacity to capture these emerging opportunities. 
As an example of our engagement, we are hosting a global webinar with our water sector clients on May 12 to help them navigate and access available funding sources through the U.S. stimulus legislation. 
As we look to increase operating leverage through our Focus 2023 efforts, we are accelerating growth in both core and new sectors. We've engaged our partners from PA Consulting to catalyze these efforts by applying their business formation expertise around the world. 
[Audio Gap] stimulus is focused as green stimulus, underpinning all infrastructure meets increasingly seeking solutions that embrace ESG principles. We are a leading provider in this space, delivering innovative solutions that support our clients' decarbonization and resiliency goals, such as mass transit and fleet electrification work that we are delivering across the globe. 
A great example is the Cambridgeshire Autonomous Metro in the U.K., where in collaboration with PA Consultant, we are delivering an end-to-end solution for the implementation of autonomous electric vehicle infrastructure. 
Infrastructure monetization and digital transformation is driving growth in the mid and long term. Our global program management team continues to deliver iconic programs for clients across major metropolitan areas on 5 continents. A clear demonstration of our efforts to modernize infrastructure by increasing mobility and improving journey time and nearly doubling road capacity is the recent award at Highways England's lower chems crossing program, one of the U.K.'s most ambitious and largest road project ever. 
As a result of our leading expertise in the water sector, our recent win, the [indiscernible] Minnesota water treatment plant demonstrates our ability to implement solutions for aging infrastructure to maintain reliable service, enhance water quality, improve operations and maintenance and provide a sustainable utility. 
Additionally, we won the Changi New Water Factory 3 project with the Public Utility Board in Singapore as a result of our technology efficient design that reduces operational costs. The first in-service solution features reverse flow technology to maximize reverse osmosis recovery and exemplifies our solutions and technology differentiator. The global semiconductor chip shortage is driving industry growth levels above historical averages. This shortage is being driven by a unique convergence of demand use and applications from areas such as smartphones, cloud computing and data storage. Coupled with the rebalancing of global supply chain, we are engaged with multiple clients to accelerate capital projects and increase capacity. We continue to see robust spending in the life sciences sector driven by our clients' redistribution of their product portfolio. 
Additionally, contract manufacturing organizations are embarking on an unprecedented amount of biologic capacity to support global demand. Leveraging our industry leadership and long-standing client relationships, we have secured the Fujifilm Dion bio project in the Southeastern United States and other large confidential programs globally. 
In summary, our balanced portfolio of industry sectors and geographies continues to strengthen our P&PS pipeline. 
Turning to Slide 8. This is a very successful quarter for PA Consulting, building on a strong full calendar year of 2020. PA's revenue growth at 28% year-over-year. PA is involved in a wide range of digital transformation projects, including the vaccine rollout program globally. Peace Backlog was up 36% year-over-year. This positive sales growth as well as continued investment in partner hiring in 2020 and 2021 gives increased confidence for the full year and beyond. We have seen solid performance across all sectors with strong wins in life sciences and U.K. public services. 
On the sustainability front, we've built on our global delivery partnership with the innovative start-up full pack, signing numerous new consumer clients to replace single-use plastics in their products. PA continues to secure a wide range of digitalization project programs including the wins highlighted on the slide. 
PA's strategy is to focus on growth in the private sector with an acute focus in the U.S. and further diversification in end markets globally. 
We are working in partnership with PA to accelerate that strategy through joint engagements in key sectors, including energy and utility, Health and Life Sciences and Defense & Security. 
I will now turn it over to Kevin to speak to our financial performance."
282159,710880440,2278179,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 10, 2021",2021-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob.

Second quarter gross revenue increased 4% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%. This was driven by solid underlying business performance, offset by the timing of advanced facilities projects. Acquisitions and FX benefits continue to grow to growth by more than offsetting the burn-off of 2 lower margin previously disclosed contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. 
For the second half of fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up in the low double digits year-over-year. On a pro forma basis for acquisitions, we expect second half revenue up low to mid-single digits versus a year ago as growth from the acquisitions and CMS and P&PS growth From a weaker second half 2020 compare more than offset continued headwinds in CMS from the lower-margin contracts coming to an end. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by 3 factors: improvements in CMS gross margin as we continue to remix the portfolio to higher-margin business, a favorable impact from lower benefit costs and the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile versus the rest of the portfolio. 
From a line of business standpoint, TMS gross margins increased strongly on a year-over-year basis as we benefited from higher margin revenue in the base business, new wins and improved portfolio mix. PMT gross margin was up slightly year-over-year. 
Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up slightly year-over-year to 15%. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in management of our G&A costs, but do expect an increase in G&A as a percentage of revenue as a result of an expected rebound in labor-related medical costs, IT-related investments as we move to a flexible workforce and other investments to drive growth. 
GAAP operating profit was a negative $41 million and was mainly impacted by a $267 million cost related to the closing of the PA Consulting transaction that we called out in our press release filed this morning. Let me provide additional detail on the nature of this cost. 
The $267 million represents a portion of the aggregate purchase price consideration for our investment in PA. That per GAAP accounting is treated as compensation given retention-related requirements and distribution of this amount post closing. We still view the total investment consideration unchanged at GBP 1.4 billion. I'll discuss the cash flotation of the $267 million later in my remarks. 
In addition, we had $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA consulting investment. $13 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, including the Focus 2023 initiative and $31 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. 
Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $311 million, up 32%, with both lines of business showing strong organic profit growth. 
In addition, PA Consulting posted strong double-digit growth in operating profit during their quarter ending April 2, 2021. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.5%, and up 200 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and was effectively 10% without the benefit from PA, a record for the company. EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0 per share and included 86% -- $0.86 per share from the PA investment consideration being treated as compensation previously mentioned, net of the associated tax impact, a $0.37 cost related to the mark-to-market investment in Worley and AR software provider, C3.ai, which included the impact of monetizing a portion of our C3.ai investment; $0.17 in deal and other PA consulting-related costs; $0.09 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other miscellaneous restructuring costs and $0.17 of amortization of acquired intangibles. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.66, up 19% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, PA contributed $0.09 of accretion, net of incremental interest We now expect $0.32 to $0.34 of 2021 accretion from PA. 
For modeling purpose, we fully consolidate the impact of the P&A investment in our operating results, with a 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. 
Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $332 million and was up 27% year-over-year, reaching 11.2% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA Consulting. Even excluding the strong double-digit growth of PA, pro forma EBITDA growth was up 16% year-over-year. 
Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.06 for Q2 with over onetime book-to-bills across each business. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 5.3% year-over-year on a reported basis but down 2% pro forma when the acquisitions of Wood and the Buffalo Group are considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off 2 lower margin contracts, which represented $115 million year-over-year revenue headwind during the quarter. When excluding the runoff headwinds, FX benefits and pro forma acquisitions, CMS base revenue growth was actually up 6% year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year headwinds and from these 2 contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
CMS operating profit was $114 million, up 35% and up 27% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, even when factoring in the headwinds noted earlier. Operating margin was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities and the benefit from the higher-margin Buffalo Group business. 
For the second half fiscal 2021 We expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue growth when compared to the second half of fiscal year 2020. As we continue to ramp new wins that when combined with the benefits from the Buffalo Group acquisition, are expected to offset the revenue headwind previously discussed. 
Given the strategy to capture higher-value business via both acquisitions and organic efforts, We continue to expect reported operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year in the second half versus the year ago period. 
Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by continued solid performance in the Americas and a rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. This growth is partially offset by year-over-year declines in our Advanced Facilities business due to the timing of contracts. P&PS is now seeing strong pipeline growth as both our life sciences and electronics customers move forward with previously paused projects. 
Total PMPs operating profit was up 7% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 12.9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by a slight increase in gross margin and disciplined G&A cost management. 
In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $98 million in revenue and $28 million in operating profit for the stub period, which has been consolidated in our results. On a pro forma basis for a full quarter results, revenue grew 28% on a reported basis and 19% year-over-year in local currency. 
Full quarter adjusted operating profit for PA was also significantly up year-over-year, representing strong adjusted OP margin as a percentage of revenue. 
Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, driven by continued strong cost discipline and favorable benefit costs. For the second half of fiscal year 2021, we expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by expected increases in medical costs, increased IT and other expenses, including travel and entertainment, as we begin to position the company for developing growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A activities. I'm excited to share that we accelerated our focused 2023 strategic initiatives by formally bringing on board a dedicated team from PA Consulting to partner in our work streams. Focus 2023, again, is a strategic initiative that we believe will lead to enhanced employee and customer experience, improve our ability to capture emerging high-growth, high-margin opportunities and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall long-term profitability. 
During the quarter, we incurred an additional $5 million charge in cash flows of approximately $12 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. Charges from previous acquisitions and other items fell to $13 million consistent with our guidance regarding these costs falling over the course of 2021. 
Additionally, we incurred approximately $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA consulting investment. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect another $50 million in P&L charges related to transaction, integration and other onetime costs, consistent with our previous guidance. 
From a cash flow standpoint, for the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect approximately $65 million of cash flow associated with the earlier noted items. Please also note that the $260 million of PA price consideration will flow through cash flow from operations in our Q3 period even though this cash flow represents effectively a part of our investment consideration in PA, which remains unchanged, again at GBP 1.4 billion. 
Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated $209 million on reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The strong Q2 cash flow included a $42 million repayment of the U.K. VAT tax benefit from fiscal year '20 and a net negative of $74 million of costs associated with PA and Focus 2023 restructuring and other items. Please note that PA represented a net cash outflow of approximately $15 million in the stub period given the timing of certain cash taxes paid and transaction-related stamp duties. We continue to expect PA on a stand-alone basis to deliver strong free cash flow to adjusted net income on a rolling 12-month basis. 
Our transformation of the company is now delivering the expected improvements in free cash flow. It is net worthy that the free cash flow of the company has totaled over $1 billion over the last trailing 12-month period, even 1 including net onetime headwinds. We expect continued strong underlying cash flow through the balance of the year with full year cash conversion now expected to be over 100% when excluding onetime items and the $26 million investment consideration now characterized as a P&L charge and included in free cash flow in the third quarter. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $893 million and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulted in $2.6 billion of net debt for attributing the benefits of the OE and C3 AI equity. Treating these items as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.7x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. 
Regardless, we will continue in the near term to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment given our higher gross debt levels. 
Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, We remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased to 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve."

There's going to be a lot of opportunity for a lot of the companies out there. And I think for us being a margin-focused company and seeing the evolution of what we've been doing over the last few years, is the 2 things for us is that as there's a need for resources, we have the best global integrated capability to bring the resources to the right place and to really focus on the highest margin opportunities as that unfolds in both businesses and P&PS at CMS.

But as far as the U.S. infrastructure stimulus opportunity, I think we're extremely well positioned with the organic capability we have today.

But as you look at the growth going forward, it's going to be everything from how do we help our clients adapt and mitigate. So whether it's C-level rise or flooding or push buyers and droughts, the whole energy transition equation moving away from fossil fuels into clean energy, and that's both working with our government and private clients.

So if you look and take away the $0.09 and kind of go to your remaining kind of, let's call it, $0.04 a month for the remaining 6 months. It is basically that number. We think that, that is really strong performance consistent with what we had in our deal model. And ultimately, we're hoping given the strong start that maybe there could be some opportunity to improve on that over the balance of the year. But so far, they started strong. And Steve mentioned the comment about their current work being really, really strong in the first quarter.

But I think the other way to think about it is if we can get that growth and afford ourselves the same ability not to hire at the same level that we've had to in past growth spurts, that's going to be really, really strong for us. So there obviously is a war for talent. And to the extent that we're going to be able to supply that incremental growth with less headcount having to be added to support it.

But I guess just, Kevin, I just want to make sure we understand the new guidance correctly. I look at about 10 months of contribution of the EBITDA numbers that you previously talked about with PA, equates about $130 million. Again, regardless of seasonality, it's kind of a rough and tough number. Your guidance, the EBITDA side is up roughly that amount. Is this a way of kind of saying like, hey, the organic outlook is still good, but it's largely unchanged with most of the EBITDA raise from the acquisition. 
And then on the EPS side, was there anything below the line that allowed you to take up the lower end of that EPS range a little bit more. Just maybe if you could talk about that. And then just on the free cash flow, it's just worth clarifying the cash flow from operations, there was a $230 million benefit in the quarter on accrued liabilities. I'm guessing that might be associated with the -- the $267 million that's going to be a cash outflow next quarter, but I don't know.

The $267 million is a dynamic where the total consideration was reduced by the $267 million and now that $26 million flows through the P&L ultimately in the third quarter. So effectively, that dynamic is occurring. So you're right relative to how that works. Total consideration doesn't change. We're still at the [ GBP 1.4 billion ] on sterling. So note that. I think that's important to know, Andy. 
Second point, in terms of the guide, no, there's -- look, the guide is effectively We took the $0.09, and we felt like the guide that we previously provided was appropriate. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, while their first quarter of their year was really strong. They got to giddy up and go relative to the pipeline that's in front of them, booking that and then burning that. And so effectively, we'll see how that plays out over the balance year. Let's hope that they do that. And in fact, if they kind of continue at that rate, that was in Q1, obviously, there's going to be some upside, but I think we're being prudent relative to that. Remember, this business NPA is a book-and-burn business. So they got to always continue to drive towards that. So that's one thing. 
So back to the base business, yes, we had good performance in Q2. And effectively, that was a primary driver to our increase in the base business guide is how I would characterize it. And look, I think at the end of the day, given the investments that I talked about on the G&A side that we're looking at the balance I think that, that will offset any potential pending momentum that we got on the top line that may come to fruition. Pipeline is looking good relative to our, I would say, our state and local and government clients. I think that, that's positive. The pipeline is building on the advanced facilities. So we'll see how that all plays out. But we really see this coming together more in terms of our late fiscal 2021, which positions us better for 2022 than 2021."

And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance at key initiatives. As the pandemic lessens its impact here in the United States, it's vital to recognize the significant struggles that are still occurring throughout the world, especially in India. Jacobs made an immediate donation to the United Way in New Delhi for critical medical supply. And I'm particularly proud of our company and employees who together have donated $200,000 through our internal giving platform collectively. We have and will continue to support those that are still being impacted by the pandemic. including, for example, our operations in the Philippines. 
Turning to Slide 4. Before discussing our second quarter results, it's important to continue to reiterate how we think about our business by aligning and executing against our long-term strategy to drive superior value for our stakeholders. We take a multiyear approach to our rigorous strategy formation. This long-term mindset involves proactively assessing and aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. The transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created significant value measured by relative total shareholder return. 
As you have seen from our recent organic actions, the PA Consulting investment and the acquisition of the Buffalo Group, we believe there's a significant opportunity to deliver differentiated, digitally-enabled solutions as the world accelerates its efforts to modernize infrastructure, improve global supply chain and enhance national security. 
We have started the development of our new corporate strategy for fiscal year 2022 to '24, which we will present to the investor community later this year. 
As to our financial results, I'm pleased with our strong second quarter performance with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 27%. Backlog ended the second quarter up 10% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Our strategic investment in PA Consulting closed on March 2 and demonstrated higher-than-expected results in the March quarter with 19% revenue growth in sterling, up 28%, including the benefit of FX. We are also excited by the revenue synergies our joint Jacobs PA teams are creating, resulting in a robust pipeline in line with our deal model expectations. 
Given the stronger performance across Jacobs and the early closing of the PA investment, we are increasing our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we see the potential for 1 of the most attractive periods for growth in our company's history, activated through alignment of our portfolio to numerous secular growth opportunities in the expected infrastructure stimulus across the globe. 
Turning to Slide 5. Sustainability at Jacobs is reflected in our company's purpose of delivering solutions for a more connected sustainable world as well as through our values. We do things right, we challenged the accepted, we aim higher, and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. I'm proud of our efforts over the last few years as we are now being recognized by various external governance groups. 
For example, ISS recently updated their ESG assessment of Jacobs. where we are now approaching top decile in both environmental and social categories. These results are a credit to our people and their focus on our purpose and values. 
And of course, on an external basis, ESG is a significant growth opportunity for Jacobs. Building on the success of our sustainability strategy launched in 2019, Plan Beyond 2.0 reinforces our commitment to driving to a net 0 economy through furthering our sustainable business offerings. We are in the early stages of a significant business growth opportunity to partner with our global customers and communities to provide solutions with their net 0 carbon commitments. 
Now with our investment in PA Consulting, Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. For example, we're implementing the first bio geochemical reactor pilot plant project for PFAS remediation in the U.S. supporting Germany's transition to significant net 0 power generation and distribution by 2030. 
We're teaming up water utilities in Australia to support decarbonization, working with industrial clients globally on their energy and resource management programs for advanced manufacturing facilities and many other projects, including those shared in the appendix to this presentation. 
Altogether, sustainable solutions is a high-growth business opportunity for Jacobs today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which, by the way, makes Jacob's one of the largest ESG solutions providers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business, During the second quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance and our workforce is executing at pre-pandemic levels as C",1717,"Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business, During the second quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance and our workforce is executing at pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 vaccines are administered broadly across our operational sphere. Total CMS backlog is at $9.8 billion, representing a 7% year-over-year growth and up 6% pro forma, excluding the lower-margin hampered and classified procurement contract we have previously discussed. The CMS strategy is focused on revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. 
Similar to last quarter, I will discuss 4 notable market trends positively impacting our CMS business: space exploration intelligence, all-source intelligence, digital modernization and clean energy. 
Beginning with space exploration and intelligence, From idea to operations, Jacobs delivers know-how and value to every stage of the space system life cycle for our civil and national security space plan. NASA leads this global exploration and development of deep space with its Artemis program that will carry astronauts to and from the moon surface and beyond. As NASA's largest service provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of the Artemis mission, including the space launch system, the Orion spacecraft in the exploration ground systems based at Kennedy Space Center. We are proud to have expanded our NASA support to the Wallace Flight facility located in Virginia. and are now providing full life cycle operations and testing that deploy expertise we have developed at other NASA centers. 
We remain heavily engaged in the NASA mission portfolio, including the recent support of the SLS hot fire test in the design, fabrication and full deployment of the calibration device on the Perseverance Rover now exploring Mars. NASA continues to enjoy strong bipartisan progressional support with preliminary FY '22 budget, including a 6% increase over 2021. We also support the DoD's joint all domain intelligence initiative, utilizing satellite connectivity in space and adding more capacity for intel analysis, such as our successful Mango One launch earlier this year. Overall, defense base spending was up 28% in FY '21 and is expected to show strong growth in FY '22 as well. 
Moving on to all source intelligence. Today's threat levels require intelligence analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial and measurement and signature to allow for better decision-making in real time. The Buffalo Group acquisition greatly expanded Jacobs' all-source intelligence capability. We were awarded 2 exciting wins from the Defense Intelligence Agency in the quarter. Jacobs will provide counterterrorism analytical expertise for the defense Combating Terrorism Center, CTC, and integrated intelligence centers and direct support of war fighters around the globe. 
We were also awarded a prime seat on the $12.6 billion solutions for the Information Technology enterprise, Or site 3, IDIQ to address the evolving IT requirements vital to the security of the United States. All those specific classified budget details were not provided in the preliminary budget, redirection of funds towards emerging cyber and intelligence threats from state [indiscernible]. 
Now turning to digital modernization. In order for government agencies to run effectively and transform how they accomplish their missions, they require a full spectrum of digital enterprise solutions, including engineering operations, digital services such as cloud services, dev tech ops, cyber and data analytics. Contract obligations for digital modernization services have grown significantly over the past 5 years with strong continued growth expected as government agencies upgrade their data networks. 
Recently, our software engineering team won a 10-year contract to continue to develop and sustain terrain awareness and warning system software for the U.S. Air Force C-17 fleet to help ensure pilot safety. A final trend is in clean energy or energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydro power and nuclear energy, all of which are critical to transitioning global economies away from fossil fuel. 
Across our CMS new portfolio, our unique blend and depth of technical and program management capabilities allows us to provide life cycle support to our clients such as the delivery of Hinkley Point C, a large-scale nuclear power plant in the U.K. that will provide low carbon electricity for approximately 6 million homes, developing small modular reactors and advanced modular reactors for delivering sustainable products such as green hydrogen or synthetic fuels and working with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability. 
Specifically, in the U.S., the DoE has been allocated a 10% increase in the preliminary FY '22 budget for decommissioning and new clean energy investments, including Fusion. 
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in fiscal year 2021 and beyond under the Biden administration. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, with over $10 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile. 
Now on Slide 7, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Starting with an overview of the benefit of global stimulus, we anticipate a direct investment in our key industry sectors and geographies that align with global trends and emerging governmental focus on climate change, infrastructure modernization, digital transformation and advanced facility. We are uniquely positioned to provide world-class service to significant areas of stimulus, including the anticipated U.S. infrastructure bill. Our global delivery model connected across geographies and markets, combined with our digitized delivery approach ensures efficient and seamless support anywhere in the world. Our existing contracting framework with the primary recipients of the stimulus funding will allow us to unlock capacity to capture these emerging opportunities. 
As an example of our engagement, we are hosting a global webinar with our water sector clients on May 12 to help them navigate and access available funding sources through the U.S. stimulus legislation. 
As we look to increase operating leverage through our Focus 2023 efforts, we are accelerating growth in both core and new sectors. We've engaged our partners from PA Consulting to catalyze these efforts by applying their business transformation expertise to further optimize Jacobs' global delivery model. Combining our subject manner experts with technology-enabled tools for a full solution offering is a competitive differentiator, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters. 
Our continued financial resilience, driven by our balanced geographic and market portfolio, resulted in strong P&L performance in the quarter and 10% year-over-year backlog growth. Our pipeline remains healthy, and we anticipate continued growth as U.S. infrastructure bill materializes. 
I'll now discuss the key global trends and themes aligned with our P&PS. Climate change is a macro and multi-decade driver for clients around the world. Much of the economic stimulus is focused as green stimulus, underpinning all infrastructure modernization. Private sector clients are accelerating their transition to a net 0 economy, increasingly seeking solutions that embrace ESG principles. We are a leading provider in this space, delivering innovative solutions that support our clients' decarbonization and resiliency goals, such as mass transit and fleet electrification work that we are delivering across the globe. 
A great example is the Cambridgeshire Autonomous Metro in the U.K., where in collaboration with PA Consultant, we are delivering an end-to-end solution for the implementation of autonomous electric vehicle infrastructure. 
Infrastructure monetization and digital transformation is driving growth in the mid and long term. Our global program management team continues to deliver iconic programs for clients across major metropolitan areas on 5 continents. A clear demonstration of our efforts to modernize infrastructure by increasing mobility and improving journey time and nearly doubling road capacity is the recent award at Highways England's lower chems crossing program, one of the U.K.'s most ambitious and largest road project ever. 
As a result of our leading expertise in the water sector, our recent win, the [indiscernible] Minnesota water treatment plant demonstrates our ability to implement solutions for aging infrastructure to maintain reliable service, enhance water quality, improve operations and maintenance and provide a sustainable utility. 
Additionally, we won the Changi New Water Factory 3 project with the Public Utility Board in Singapore as a result of our technology efficient design that reduces operational costs. The first in-service solution features reverse flow technology to maximize reverse osmosis recovery and exemplifies our solutions and technology differentiator. The global semiconductor chip shortage is driving industry growth levels above historical averages. This shortage is being driven by a unique convergence of demand use and applications from areas such as smartphones, cloud computing and data storage. Coupled with the rebalancing of global supply chain, we are engaged with multiple clients to accelerate capital projects and increase capacity. We continue to see robust spending in the life sciences sector driven by our clients' redistribution of their product portfolio. 
Additionally, contract manufacturing organizations are embarking on an unprecedented amount of biologic capacity to support global demand. Leveraging our industry leadership and long-standing client relationships, we have secured the Fujifilm Dion bio project in the Southeastern United States and other large confidential programs globally. 
In summary, our balanced portfolio of industry sectors and geographies continues to strengthen our P&PS pipeline. 
Turning to Slide 8. This is a very successful quarter for PA Consulting, building on a strong full calendar year of 2020. PA's revenue growth at 28% year-over-year. PA is involved in a wide range of digital transformation projects, including the vaccine rollout program globally. Peace Backlog was up 36% year-over-year. This positive sales growth as well as continued investment in partner hiring in 2020 and 2021 gives increased confidence for the full year and beyond. We have seen solid performance across all sectors with strong wins in life sciences and U.K. public services. 
On the sustainability front, we've built on our global delivery partnership with the innovative start-up full pack, signing numerous new consumer clients to replace single-use plastics in their products. PA continues to secure a wide range of digitalization project programs including the wins highlighted on the slide. 
PA's strategy is to focus on growth in the private sector with an acute focus in the U.S. and further diversification in end markets globally. 
We are working in partnership with PA to accelerate that strategy through joint engagements in key sectors, including energy and utility, Health and Life Sciences and Defense & Security. 
I will now turn it over to Kevin to speak to our financial performance."

Second quarter gross revenue increased 4% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%. This was driven by solid underlying business performance, offset by the timing of advanced facilities projects. Acquisitions and FX benefits continue to grow to growth by more than offsetting the burn-off of 2 lower margin previously disclosed contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. 
For the second half of fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up in the low double digits year-over-year. On a pro forma basis for acquisitions, we expect second half revenue up low to mid-single digits versus a year ago as growth from the acquisitions and CMS and P&PS growth From a weaker second half 2020 compare more than offset continued headwinds in CMS from the lower-margin contracts coming to an end. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by 3 factors: improvements in CMS gross margin as we continue to remix the portfolio to higher-margin business, a favorable impact from lower benefit costs and the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile versus the rest of the portfolio. 
From a line of business standpoint, TMS gross margins increased strongly on a year-over-year basis as we benefited from higher margin revenue in the base business, new wins and improved portfolio mix. PMT gross margin was up slightly year-over-year. 
Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up slightly year-over-year to 15%. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in management of our G&A costs, but do expect an increase in G&A as a percentage of revenue as a result of an expected rebound in labor-related medical costs, IT-related investments as we move to a flexible workforce and other investments to drive growth. 
GAAP operating profit was a negative $41 million and was mainly impacted by a $267 million cost related to the closing of the PA Consulting transaction that we called out in our press release filed this morning. Let me provide additional detail on the nature of this cost. 
The $267 million represents a portion of the aggregate purchase price consideration for our investment in PA. That per GAAP accounting is treated as compensation given retention-related requirements and distribution of this amount post closing. We still view the total investment consideration unchanged at GBP 1.4 billion. I'll discuss the cash flotation of the $267 million later in my remarks. 
In addition, we had $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA consulting investment. $13 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, including the Focus 2023 initiative and $31 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. 
Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $311 million, up 32%, with both lines of business showing strong organic profit growth. 
In addition, PA Consulting posted strong double-digit growth in operating profit during their quarter ending April 2, 2021. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.5%, and up 200 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and was effectively 10% without the benefit from PA, a record for the company. EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0 per share and included 86% -- $0.86 per share from the PA investment consideration being treated as compensation previously mentioned, net of the associated tax impact, a $0.37 cost related to the mark-to-market investment in Worley and AR software provider, C3.ai, which included the impact of monetizing a portion of our C3.ai investment; $0.17 in deal and other PA consulting-related costs; $0.09 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other miscellaneous restructuring costs and $0.17 of amortization of acquired intangibles. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.66, up 19% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, PA contributed $0.09 of accretion, net of incremental interest We now expect $0.32 to $0.34 of 2021 accretion from PA. 
For modeling purpose, we fully consolidate the impact of the P&A investment in our operating results, with a 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. 
Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $332 million and was up 27% year-over-year, reaching 11.2% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA Consulting. Even excluding the strong double-digit growth of PA, pro forma EBITDA growth was up 16% year-over-year. 
Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.06 for Q2 with over onetime book-to-bills across each business. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 5.3% year-over-year on a reported basis but down 2% pro forma when the acquisitions of Wood and the Buffalo Group are considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off 2 lower margin contracts, which represented $115 million year-over-year revenue headwind during the quarter. When excluding the runoff headwinds, FX benefits and pro forma acquisitions, CMS base revenue growth was actually up 6% year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year headwinds and from these 2 contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
CMS operating profit was $114 million, up 35% and up 27% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, even when factoring in the headwinds noted earlier. Operating margin was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities and the benefit from the higher-margin Buffalo Group business. 
For the second half fiscal 2021 We expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue growth when compared to the second half of fiscal year 2020. As we continue to ramp new wins that when combined with the benefits from the Buffalo Group acquisition, are expected to offset the revenue headwind previously discussed. 
Given the strategy to capture higher-value business via both acquisitions and organic efforts, We continue to expect reported operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year in the second half versus the year ago period. 
Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by continued solid performance in the Americas and a rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. This growth is partially offset by year-over-year declines in our Advanced Facilities business due to the timing of contracts. P&PS is now seeing strong pipeline growth as both our life sciences and electronics customers move forward with previously paused projects. 
Total PMPs operating profit was up 7% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 12.9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by a slight increase in gross margin and disciplined G&A cost management. 
In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $98 million in revenue and $28 million in operating profit for the stub period, which has been consolidated in our results. On a pro forma basis for a full quarter results, revenue grew 28% on a reported basis and 19% year-over-year in local currency. 
Full quarter adjusted operating profit for PA was also significantly up year-over-year, representing strong adjusted OP margin as a percentage of revenue. 
Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, driven by continued strong cost discipline and favorable benefit costs. For the second half of fiscal year 2021, we expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by expected increases in medical costs, increased IT and other expenses, including travel and entertainment, as we begin to position the company for developing growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A activities. I'm excited to share that we accelerated our focused 2023 strategic initiatives by formally bringing on board a dedicated team from PA Consulting to partner in our work streams. Focus 2023, again, is a strategic initiative that we believe will lead to enhanced employee and customer experience, improve our ability to capture emerging high-growth, high-margin opportunities and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall long-term profitability. 
During the quarter, we incurred an additional $5 million charge in cash flows of approximately $12 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. Charges from previous acquisitions and other items fell to $13 million consistent with our guidance regarding these costs falling over the course of 2021. 
Additionally, we incurred approximately $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA consulting investment. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect another $50 million in P&L charges related to transaction, integration and other onetime costs, consistent with our previous guidance. 
From a cash flow standpoint, for the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect approximately $65 million of cash flow associated with the earlier noted items. Please also note that the $260 million of PA price consideration will flow through cash flow from operations in our Q3 period even though this cash flow represents effectively a part of our investment consideration in PA, which remains unchanged, again at GBP 1.4 billion. 
Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated $209 million on reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The strong Q2 cash flow included a $42 million repayment of the U.K. VAT tax benefit from fiscal year '20 and a net negative of $74 million of costs associated with PA and Focus 2023 restructuring and other items. Please note that PA represented a net cash outflow of approximately $15 million in the stub period given the timing of certain cash taxes paid and transaction-related stamp duties. We continue to expect PA on a stand-alone basis to deliver strong free cash flow to adjusted net income on a rolling 12-month basis. 
Our transformation of the company is now delivering the expected improvements in free cash flow. It is net worthy that the free cash flow of the company has totaled over $1 billion over the last trailing 12-month period, even 1 including net onetime headwinds. We expect continued strong underlying cash flow through the balance of the year with full year cash conversion now expected to be over 100% when excluding onetime items and the $26 million investment consideration now characterized as a P&L charge and included in free cash flow in the third quarter. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $893 million and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulted in $2.6 billion of net debt for attributing the benefits of the OE and C3 AI equity. Treating these items as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.7x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. 
Regardless, we will continue in the near term to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment given our higher gross debt levels. 
Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, We remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased to 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve."

And Steve mentioned the comment about their current work being really, really strong in the first quarter. And -- but some of that's going to go away over there second, third and fourth calendar quarters for their year. And they have to do a really good job on replacing that over the balance of the year. So we feel good about the guidance we've provided. And ultimately, hopefully, that pipeline will continue to translate into incremental backlog, which could result in potentially being a little bit higher. But I think we're being prudent in terms of our guidance for PA at this point in time."

And so we do see that having a positive effect on Jacobs. I don't know if it's necessarily 6 months. It's probably got a longer tail on that and eased through the next 12 to 24 months, but that's It's a strong trend, and it's both not only on the logic side, but it's also on memory chips and some of the lower-end chips that you're hearing from automotive issues that are going around. 
Online sciences, that is probably more global as it pertains to us And that is the rebalancing of the product portfolio, all of this attention has been placed on vaccines, specifically around the coronavirus. great development that's happening within the oncology world. And as I said in the remarks, that's driving a real need for contract manufacturing, probably like nothing we've seen in history because of the volumes that are needed and the speed to market around these new therapies.

So don't think of this as being something that's going to be a big challenge for us, but we do find it necessary to make these investments. I think the next comment I would make is that's what Focus 2023 is really all about to ensure that we get improved operating leverage through the process and system enhancements that we're talking about, which will allow us as the growth dynamic begins to accelerate, which we talked about, assuming it's going to happen in 2022, and that's going to be a really important for 2 reasons: one, to get the operating leverage. But I think the other way to think about it is if we can get that growth and afford ourselves the same ability not to hire at the same level that we've had to in past growth spurts, that's going to be really, really strong for us. So there obviously is a war for talent. And to the extent that we're going to be able to supply that incremental growth with less headcount having to be added to support it. That's going to be a big positive for us."

I look at about 10 months of contribution of the EBITDA numbers that you previously talked about with PA, equates about $130 million. Again, regardless of seasonality, it's kind of a rough and tough number. Your guidance, the EBITDA side is up roughly that amount. Is this a way of kind of saying like, hey, the organic outlook is still good, but it's largely unchanged with most of the EBITDA raise from the acquisition. 
And then on the EPS side, was there anything below the line that allowed you to take up the lower end of that EPS range a little bit more. Just maybe if you could talk about that. And then just on the free cash flow, it's just worth clarifying the cash flow from operations, there was a $230 million benefit in the quarter on accrued liabilities. I'm guessing that might be associated with the -- the $267 million that's going to be a cash outflow next quarter, but I don't know. So I was wondering if you could just clarify that benefit to this quarter's cash flow from operations."

The $267 million is a dynamic where the total consideration was reduced by the $267 million and now that $26 million flows through the P&L ultimately in the third quarter.

I think that's important to know, Andy. 
Second point, in terms of the guide, no, there's -- look, the guide is effectively We took the $0.09, and we felt like the guide that we previously provided was appropriate. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, while their first quarter of their year was really strong. They got to giddy up and go relative to the pipeline that's in front of them, booking that and then burning that. And so effectively, we'll see how that plays out over the balance year. Let's hope that they do that. And in fact, if they kind of continue at that rate, that was in Q1, obviously, there's going to be some upside, but I think we're being prudent relative to that. Remember, this business NPA is a book-and-burn business. So they got to always continue to drive towards that. So that's one thing. 
So back to the base business, yes, we had good performance in Q2. And effectively, that was a primary driver to our increase in the base business guide is how I would characterize it. And look, I think at the end of the day, given the investments that I talked about on the G&A side that we're looking at the balance I think that, that will offset any potential pending momentum that we got on the top line that may come to fruition. Pipeline is looking good relative to our, I would say, our state and local and government clients. I think that, that's positive. The pipeline is building on the advanced facilities. So we'll see how that all plays out. But we really see this coming together more in terms of our late fiscal 2021, which positions us better for 2022 than 2021."

And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance at key initiatives. As the pandemic lessens its impact here in the United States, it's vital to recognize the significant struggles that are still occurring throughout the world, especially in India. Jacobs made an immediate donation to the United Way in New Delhi for critical medical supply. And I'm particularly proud of our company and employees who together have donated $200,000 through our internal giving platform collectively. We have and will continue to support those that are still being impacted by the pandemic. including, for example, our operations in the Philippines.  
Turning to Slide 4. Before discussing our second quarter results, it's important to continue to reiterate how we think about our business by aligning and executing against our long-term strategy to drive superior value for our stakeholders. We take a multiyear approach to our rigorous strategy formation. This long-term mindset involves proactively assessing and aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. The transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created significant value measured by relative total shareholder return.  
As you have seen from our recent organic actions, the PA Consulting investment and the acquisition of the Buffalo Group, we believe there's a significant opportunity to deliver differentiated, digitally enabled solutions as the world accelerates its efforts to modernize infrastructure, improve global supply chain and enhance national security.  
We have started the development of our new corporate strategy for fiscal year 2022 to '24, which we will present to the investor community later this year. As to our financial results, I'm pleased with our strong second quarter performance with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 27%. Backlog ended the second quarter up 10% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Our strategic investment in PA Consulting closed on March 2 and demonstrated higher-than-expected results in the March quarter, with 19% revenue growth in sterling, up 28%, including the benefit of FX. We are also excited by the revenue synergies our joint Jacobs PA teams are creating, resulting in a robust pipeline in line with our deal model expectations.  
Given the stronger performance across Jacobs and the early closing of the PA investment, we are increasing our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we see the potential for one of the most attractive periods for growth in our company's history, activated through alignment of our portfolio to numerous secular growth opportunities in the expected infrastructure stimulus across the globe.  
Turning to Slide 5. Sustainability at Jacobs is reflected in our company's purpose of delivering solutions for a more connected sustainable world as well as through our values. We do things right, we challenge the accepted, we aim higher, and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people, to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. I'm proud of our efforts over the last few years as we are now being recognized by various external governance groups.  
For example, ISS recently updated their ESG assessment of Jacobs, where we are now approaching top decile in both environmental and social categories. These results are a credit to our people and their focus on our purpose and values.  
And of course, on an external basis, ESG is a significant growth opportunity for Jacobs. Building on the success of our sustainability strategy launched in 2019, PlanBeyond 2.0 reinforces our commitment to driving to a net 0 economy through furthering our sustainable business offerings. We are in the early stages of a significant business growth opportunity to partner with our global customers and communities to provide solutions with their net 0 carbon commitments.  
Now with our investment in PA Consulting, Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. For example, we're implementing the first bio geochemical reactor pilot plant project for PFAS remediation in the U.S. supporting Germany's transition to significant net 0 power generation and distribution by 2030.  
We're teaming up water utilities in Australia to support decarbonization, working with industrial clients globally on their energy and resource management programs for advanced manufacturing facilities and many other projects, including those shared in the appendix to this presentation.  
Altogether, sustainable solutions is a high-growth business opportunity for Jacobs, today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which, by the way, makes Jacob's one of the largest ESG solutions providers.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business. During the second quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance and our workforce is executing at pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 vaccines are administered broadly across our operational sphere. Total CMS backlog is at $9.8 billion, representing a 7% year-over-year growth and up 6% pro forma, excluding the lower-margin hampered and classified procurement contract we have previously discussed. The CMS strategy is focused on revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes.  
Similar to last quarter, I will discuss 4 notable market trends positively impacting our CMS business: space exploration intelligence, all-source intelligence, digital modernization and clean energy.  
Beginning with space exploration and intelligence. From idea to operations, Jacobs delivers know-how and value to every stage of the space system life cycle for our civil and national security space plan. NASA leads this global exploration and development of deep space with its Artemis program that will carry astronauts to and from the moon surface and beyond. As NASA's largest service provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of the Artemis mission, including the space launch system, the Orion spacecraft and the exploration ground systems based at Kennedy Space Center. We are proud to have expanded our NASA support to the Wallops Flight facility located in Virginia, and are now providing full life cycle operations and testing that deploy expertise we have developed at other NASA centers.  
We remain heavily engaged in the NASA mission portfolio, including the recent support of the SLS hot-fire test in the design, fabrication and full deployment of the calibration device on the Perseverance Rover now exploring Mars. NASA continues to enjoy strong bipartisan congressional support with preliminary FY '22 budget, including a 6% increase over 2021. We also support the DoD's joint all-domain intelligence initiative, utilizing satellite connectivity in space and adding more capacity for intel analysis, such as our successful Mango One launch earlier this year. Overall, defense base spending was up 28% in FY '21 and is expected to show strong growth in FY '22 as well.  
Moving on to all source intelligence. Today's threat levels require intelligence analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial and measurement and signature to allow for better decision-making in real time. The Buffalo Group acquisition greatly expanded Jacobs' all-source intelligence capability. We were awarded 2 exciting wins from the Defense Intelligence Agency in the quarter. Jacobs will provide counterterrorism analytical expertise for the Defense Combating Terrorism Center, DCTC, and integrated intelligence centers and direct support of war fighters around the globe.  
We were also awarded a prime seat on the $12.6 billion solutions for the Information Technology enterprise, Or Site III IDIQ to address the evolving IT requirements vital to the security of the United States. All those specific classified budget details were not provided in the preliminary budget. Redirection of funds towards emerging cyber and intelligence threats from state actors are anticipated.
Now turning to digital modernization. In order for government agencies to run effectively and transform how they accomplish their missions, they require a full spectrum of digital enterprise solutions, including engineering operations, digital services such as cloud services, dev tech ops, cyber and data analytics. Contract obligations for digital modernization services have grown significantly over the past 5 years, with strong continued growth expected as government agencies upgrade their data networks.  
Recently, our software engineering team won a 10-year contract to continue to develop and sustain terrain awareness and warning system software for the U.S. Air Force C-17 fleet to help ensure pilot safety. 
A final trend is in clean energy or energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydro power and nuclear energy, all of which are critical to transitioning global economies away from fossil fuel.  
Across our CMS nuclear portfolio, our unique blend and depth of technical and program management capabilities allows us to provide life cycle support to our clients such as the delivery of Hinkley Point C, a large-scale nuclear power plant in the U.K. that will provide low-carbon electricity for approximately 6 million homes, developing small modular reactors and advanced modular reactors for delivering sustainable products such as green hydrogen or synthetic fuels and working with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability.  
Specifically, in the U.S., the DoE has been allocated a 10% increase in the preliminary FY '22 budget for decommissioning and new clean energy investments, including Fusion.  
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in fiscal year 2021 and beyond under the Biden administration. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, with over $10 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile.  
Now on Slide 7, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Starting with an overview of the benefit of global stimulus, we anticipate a direct investment in our key industry sectors and geographies that align with global trends and emerging governmental focus on climate change, infrastructure modernization, digital transformation and advanced facility. We are uniquely positioned to provide world-class service to significant areas of stimulus, including the anticipated U.S. infrastructure bill. Our global delivery model connected across geographies and markets, combined with our digitized delivery approach ensures efficient and seamless support anywhere in the world. Our existing contracting framework with the primary recipients of the stimulus funding will allow us to unlock capacity to capture these emerging opportunities.  
As an example of our engagement, we are hosting a global webinar with our water sector clients on May 12 to help them navigate and access available funding sources through the U.S. stimulus legislation.  
As we look to increase operating leverage through our Focus 2023 efforts, we are accelerating growth in both core and new sectors. We've engaged our partners from PA Consulting to catalyze these efforts by applying their business transformation expertise to further optimize Jacob's global delivery model. Combining our subject-matter experts with technology-enabled tools for a full solution offering, is a competitive differentiator, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters. 
Our continued financial resilience, driven by our balanced geographic and market portfolio, resulted in strong P&L performance in the quarter and 10% year-over-year backlog growth. Our pipeline remains healthy, and we anticipate continued growth as U.S. infrastructure bill materializes. 
I'll now discuss the key global trends and themes aligned with our P&PS. Climate change is a macro and multi-decade driver for clients around the world. Much of the economic stimulus is focused as green stimulus, underpinning all infrastructure modernization. Private sector clients are accelerating their transition to a net 0 economy, increasingly seeking solutions that embrace ESG principles. We are a leading provider in this space, delivering innovative solutions that support our clients' decarbonization and resiliency goals, such as mass transit and fleet electrification work that we are delivering across the globe. 
A great example is the Cambridgeshire Autonomous Metro in the U.K., where in collaboration with PA Consultant, we are delivering an end-to-end solution for the implementation of autonomous electric vehicle infrastructure. 
Infrastructure monetization and digital transformation is driving growth in the mid and long term. Our global program management team continues to deliver iconic programs for clients across major metropolitan areas on 5 continents. A clear demonstration of our efforts to modernize infrastructure by increasing mobility and improving journey time and nearly doubling road capacity is the recent award at Highways England's lower chems crossing program, one of the U.K.'s most ambitious and largest road project ever. 
As a result of our leading expertise in the water sector, our recent win, the Saint Paul Minnesota water treatment plant demonstrates our ability to implement solutions for aging infrastructure to maintain reliable service, enhance water quality, improve operations and maintenance and provide a sustainable utility. 
Additionally, we won the Changi NEWater Factory 3 project with the Public Utility Board in Singapore as a result of our technology-efficient design that reduces operational costs. The first in-service solution features reverse flow technology to maximize reverse osmosis recovery and exemplifies our solutions and technology differentiator. 
The global semiconductor chip shortage is driving industry growth levels above historical averages. This shortage is being driven by a unique convergence of demand use and applications from areas such as smartphones, cloud computing and data storage. Coupled with the rebalancing of global supply chain, we are engaged with multiple clients to accelerate capital projects and increase capacity. We continue to see robust spending in the life sciences sector driven by our clients' redistribution of their product portfolio. 
Additionally, contract manufacturing organizations are embarking on an unprecedented amount of biologic capacity to support global demand. Leveraging our industry leadership and long-standing client relationships, we have secured the Fujifilm Diosynth Bio project in the Southeastern United States and other large confidential programs globally. 
In summary, our balanced portfolio of industry sectors and geographies continues to strengthen our P&PS pipeline. 
Turning to Slide 8. This is a very successful quarter for PA Consulting, building on a strong full calendar year of 2020. PA's revenue growth at 28% year-over-year. PA is involved in a wide range of digital transformation projects, including the vaccine rollout program globally. PA's backlog was up 36% year-over-year. This positive sales growth as well as continued investment in partner hiring into 2020 and 2021 gives increased confidence for the full year and beyond. We have seen solid performance across all sectors with strong wins in life sciences and U.K. public services. 
On the sustainability front, we've built on our global delivery partnership with the innovative start-up, PulPac, signing numerous new consumer clients to replace single-use plastics in their products. PA continues to secure a wide range of digitalization project programs, including the wins highlighted on the slide. 
PA's strategy is to focus on growth in the private sector with an acute focus in the U.S. and further diversification in end markets globally. 
We are working in partnership with PA to accelerate that strategy through joint engagements in key sectors, including energy & utility, health & life sciences and defense & security. 
I will now turn it over to Kevin to speak to our financial performance."

Second quarter gross revenue increased 4% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%. This was driven by solid underlying business performance, offset by the timing of advanced facilities projects. Acquisitions and FX benefits continue to grow to growth by more than offsetting the burn-off of 2 lower margin previously disclosed contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. 
For the second half of fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up in the low double digits year-over-year. On a pro forma basis for acquisitions, we expect second half revenue up low to mid-single digits versus a year ago as growth from the acquisitions and CMS and P&PS growth from a weaker second half 2020 compare more than offset continuous headwinds in CMS from the lower-margin contracts coming to an end. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by 3 factors: improvements in CMS gross margin as we continue to remix the portfolio to higher-margin business; a favorable impact from lower benefit costs; and the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile versus the rest of the portfolio. 
From a line of business standpoint, CMS gross margins increased strongly on a year-over-year basis as we benefited from higher-margin revenue in the base business, new wins and improved portfolio mix. P&P gross margin was up slightly year-over-year. 
Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up slightly year-over-year to 15%. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in management of our G&A costs, but do expect an increase in G&A as a percentage of revenue as a result of the expected rebound in labor-related medical costs, IT-related investments as we move to a flexible workforce and other investments to drive growth.
GAAP operating profit was a negative $41 million and was mainly impacted by a $267 million cost related to the closing of the PA Consulting transaction that we called out in our press release filed this morning. Let me provide additional detail on the nature of this cost. 
The $267 million represents a portion of the aggregate purchase price consideration for our investment in PA. That per GAAP accounting is treated as compensation, given retention-related requirements and distribution of this amount post closing. We still view the total investment consideration unchanged at GBP 1.4 billion. I'll discuss the cash flow, on page 10, of the $267 million later in my remarks. 
In addition, we had $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA Consulting investment; $13 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, including the Focus 2023 initiative; and $31 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. 
Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $311 million, up 32%, with both lines of business showing strong organic profit growth. 
In addition, PA Consulting posted strong double-digit growth in operating profit during their quarter ending April 2, 2021. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.5%, up 200 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and was effectively 10% without the benefit from PA, a record for the company. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0 per share and included 86% -- $0.86 per share from the PA investment consideration being treated as compensation previously mentioned, net of the associated tax impact, a $0.37 cost related to the mark-to-market investment in Worley and AI software provider, C3.ai, which included the impact of monetizing a portion of our C3.ai investment; $0.17 in deal and other PA consulting-related costs; $0.09 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other miscellaneous restructuring costs and $0.17 of amortization of acquired intangibles. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.66, up 19% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, PA contributed $0.09 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.32 to $0.34 of 2021 accretion from PA. For modeling purpose, we fully consolidate the impact of the P&A investment in our operating results, with a 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. 
Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $332 million and was up 27% year-over-year, reaching 11.2% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA Consulting. Even excluding the strong double-digit growth of PA, pro forma EBITDA growth was up 16% year-over-year. 
Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.06 for Q2, with over onetime book-to-bills across each business. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 5.3% year-over-year on a reported basis but down 2% pro forma when the acquisitions of Wood and the Buffalo Group are considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off 2 lower margin contracts, which represented $115 million year-over-year revenue headwind during the quarter. When excluding the runoff headwinds, FX benefits and pro forma acquisitions, CMS base revenue growth was actually up 6% year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year headwinds and from these 2 contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
CMS operating profit was $114 million, up 35% and up 27% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, even when factoring in the headwinds noted earlier. Operating margin was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities and the benefit from the higher-margin Buffalo Group business. 
For the second half fiscal 2021, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue growth when compared to the second half of fiscal year 2020. As we continue to ramp new wins that when combined with the benefits from the Buffalo Group acquisition, are expected to offset the revenue headwind previously discussed. 
Given the strategy to capture higher-value business via both acquisitions and organic efforts, we continue to expect reported operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year in the second half versus the year ago period. 
Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by continued solid performance in the Americas and a rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. This growth is partially offset by year-over-year declines in our Advanced Facilities business due to the timing of contracts. P&PS is now seeing strong pipeline growth as both our life sciences and electronics customers move forward with previously paused projects. 
Total P&PS operating profit was up 7% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 12.9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by a slight increase in gross margin and disciplined G&A cost management. 
In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $98 million in revenue and $28 million in operating profit for the stub period, which has been consolidated in our results. On a pro forma basis for a full quarter results, revenue grew 28% on a reported basis and 19% year-over-year in local currency. 
Full quarter adjusted operating profit for PA was also significantly up year-over-year, representing strong adjusted OP margin as a percentage of revenue. 
Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, driven by continued strong cost discipline and favorable benefit costs. For the second half of fiscal year 2021, we expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by expected increases in medical costs, increased IT and other expenses, including travel and entertainment, as we begin to position the company for developing growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A activities. I'm excited to share that we accelerated our Focus 2023 strategic initiatives by formally bringing on board a dedicated team from PA Consulting to partner in our work streams. Focus 2023, again, is a strategic initiative that we believe will lead to enhanced employee and customer experience; improve our ability to capture emerging high-growth, high-margin opportunities; and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall long-term profitability.
During the quarter, we incurred an additional $5 million charge in cash flows of approximately $12 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. Charges from previous acquisitions and other items fell to $13 million consistent with our guidance regarding these costs falling over the course of 2021. 
Additionally, we incurred approximately $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA Consulting investment. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect another $50 million in P&L charges related to transaction, integration and other onetime costs, consistent with our previous guidance. 
From a cash flow standpoint, for the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect approximately $65 million of cash flow associated with the earlier noted items. Please also note that the $260 million of PA price consideration will flow through cash flow from operations in our Q3 period even though this cash flow represents effectively a part of our investment consideration in PA, which remains unchanged, again at GBP 1.4 billion. 
Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated $209 million on reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The strong Q2 cash flow included a $42 million repayment of the U.K. VAT tax benefit from fiscal year '20 and a net negative of $74 million of costs associated with PA and Focus 2023 restructuring and other items. Please note that PA represented a net cash outflow of approximately $15 million in the stub period given the timing of certain cash taxes paid and transaction-related stamp duties. We continue to expect PA on a stand-alone basis to deliver strong free cash flow to adjusted net income on a rolling 12-month basis. 
Our transformation of the company is now delivering the expected improvements in free cash flow. It is net worthy that the free cash flow of the company has totaled over $1 billion over the last trailing 12-month period, even 1 including net onetime headwinds. We expect continued strong underlying cash flow through the balance of the year with full year cash conversion now expected to be over 100% when excluding onetime items and the $267 million investment consideration now characterized as a P&L charge and included in free cash flow in the third quarter. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $893 million and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulted in $2.6 billion of net debt for attributing the benefits of the Worley and C3.ai equity. Treating these items as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.7x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. 
Regardless, we will continue in the near term to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment given our higher gross debt levels. 
Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, We remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased to 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve."

When you look at what we paid for that compared to what it's generating today, extremely attractive financially. But obviously, Jamie helps us position to be a big winner. But then you on top of that, the PA Consulting acquisition, which now provides end-to-end capability from front-end consulting all the way through delivery and ultimately things like O&M, et cetera. So from a climate change step. So as far as other M&A, we're going to continue to look at things that can move us up the food chain from a margin standpoint, possibly some geographic expansion. But as far as the U.S. infrastructure stimulus opportunity, I think we're extremely well positioned with the organic capability we have today. 
And on the climate change side, when you look at the $5 billion, it's really wide ranging of what we're in. But as you look at the growth going forward, it's going to be everything from how do we help our clients adapt and mitigate. So whether it's C-level rise or flooding or push buyers and droughts, the whole energy transition equation moving away from fossil fuels into clean energy, and that's both working with our government and private clients. Everyone is looking to reduce their carbon footprint. That's where we come in around the whole decarbonization and eliminating or reducing greenhouse gases and then things like natural resource stewardship, which is critical across the globe. It's a global opportunity. We're positioned well as an end-to-end solutions provider and bringing some unique tools and innovation because it's going to require digital transformation to achieve these type of climate change transformative expectations by our clients."

So I think that that's one thing to recognize.
So if you look and take away the $0.09 and kind of go to your remaining kind of, let's call it, $0.04 a month for the remaining 6 months. It is basically that number. We think that, that is a really strong performance consistent with what we had in our deal model. And ultimately, we're hoping, given the strong start, that maybe there could be some opportunity to improve on that over the balance of the year. But so far, they started strong. And Steve mentioned the comment about their current work being really, really strong in the first quarter. And -- but some of that's going to go away over their second, third and fourth calendar quarters for their year. And they have to do a really good job on replacing that over the balance of the year.

Online sciences, that is probably more global as it pertains to us.

Again, regardless of seasonality, it's kind of a rough and tough number. Your guidance, the EBITDA side is up roughly that amount. Is this a way of kind of saying like, hey, the organic outlook is still good, but it's largely unchanged with most of the EBITDA raise from the acquisition. 
And then on the EPS side, was there anything below the line that allowed you to take up the lower end of that EPS range a little bit more. Just maybe if you could talk about that. And then just on the free cash flow, it's just worth clarifying the cash flow from operations, there was a $230 million benefit in the quarter on accrued liabilities.

I think that's important to know, Andy. 
Second point, in terms of the guide. No, there's -- look, the guide is effectively -- we took the $0.09, and we felt like the guide that we previously provided was appropriate. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, while their first quarter of their year was really strong, they got to giddy up and go relative to the pipeline that's in front of them, booking that and then burning that. And so effectively, we'll see how that plays out over the balance year. Let's hope that they do that. And in fact, if they kind of continue at that rate, that was in Q1, obviously, there's going to be some upside, but I think we're being prudent relative to that. Remember, this business, [ NPA ],is a book-and-burn business. So they got to always continue to drive towards that. So that's one thing. 
So back to the base business, yes, we had good performance in Q2. And effectively, that was a primary driver to our increase in the base business guide, is how I would characterize it. And look, I think at the end of the day, given the investments that I talked about on the G&A side that we're looking at the balance, I think that, that will offset any potential pending momentum that we got on the top line that may come to fruition. Pipeline is looking good relative to our, I would say, our state and local and government clients. I think that, that's positive. The pipeline is building on the advanced facilities. So we'll see how that all plays out. But we really see this coming together more in terms of our late fiscal 2021, which positions us better for 2022 than 2021."

So I think the -- we're feeling good about everything that we've talked about with regard to the -- where we're aligned with the growth trends, even though there's a flat defense budget. The things like Space Intelligence and hypersonics and several of the other items that we mentioned are actually growing nicely. And so there's a lot of shift in funding. Even the DoD climate change initiatives to modernize their infrastructure in the Department of Defense that's helping us. And so overall, we're very pleased with the revenue growth and Critical Mission Solutions."

282159,710880440,2286912,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 10, 2021",2021-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jon. And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance at key initiatives.

And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance at key initiatives. As the pandemic lessens its impact here in the United States, it's vital to recognize the significant struggles that are still occurring throughout the world, especially in India. Jacobs made an immediate donation to the United Way in New Delhi for critical medical supply. And I'm particularly proud of our company and employees who together have donated $200,000 through our internal giving platform collectively. We have and will continue to support those that are still being impacted by the pandemic. including, for example, our operations in the Philippines.  
Turning to Slide 4. Before discussing our second quarter results, it's important to continue to reiterate how we think about our business by aligning and executing against our long-term strategy to drive superior value for our stakeholders. We take a multiyear approach to our rigorous strategy formation. This long-term mindset involves proactively assessing and aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. The transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created significant value measured by relative total shareholder return.  
As you have seen from our recent organic actions, the PA Consulting investment and the acquisition of the Buffalo Group, we believe there's a significant opportunity to deliver differentiated, digitally enabled solutions as the world accelerates its efforts to modernize infrastructure, improve global supply chain and enhance national security.  
We have started the development of our new corporate strategy for fiscal year 2022 to '24, which we will present to the investor community later this year. As to our financial results, I'm pleased with our strong second quarter performance with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 27%. Backlog ended the second quarter up 10% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Our strategic investment in PA Consulting closed on March 2 and demonstrated higher-than-expected results in the March quarter, with 19% revenue growth in sterling, up 28%, including the benefit of FX. We are also excited by the revenue synergies our joint Jacobs PA teams are creating, resulting in a robust pipeline in line with our deal model expectations.  
Given the stronger performance across Jacobs and the early closing of the PA investment, we are increasing our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we see the potential for one of the most attractive periods for growth in our company's history, activated through alignment of our portfolio to numerous secular growth opportunities in the expected infrastructure stimulus across the globe.  
Turning to Slide 5. Sustainability at Jacobs is reflected in our company's purpose of delivering solutions for a more connected sustainable world as well as through our values. We do things right, we challenge the accepted, we aim higher, and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people, to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. I'm proud of our efforts over the last few years as we are now being recognized by various external governance groups.  
For example, ISS recently updated their ESG assessment of Jacobs, where we are now approaching top decile in both environmental and social categories. These results are a credit to our people and their focus on our purpose and values.  
And of course, on an external basis, ESG is a significant growth opportunity for Jacobs. Building on the success of our sustainability strategy launched in 2019, PlanBeyond 2.0 reinforces our commitment to driving to a net 0 economy through furthering our sustainable business offerings. We are in the early stages of a significant business growth opportunity to partner with our global customers and communities to provide solutions with their net 0 carbon commitments.  
Now with our investment in PA Consulting, Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. For example, we're implementing the first bio geochemical reactor pilot plant project for PFAS remediation in the U.S. supporting Germany's transition to significant net 0 power generation and distribution by 2030.  
We're teaming up water utilities in Australia to support decarbonization, working with industrial clients globally on their energy and resource management programs for advanced manufacturing facilities and many other projects, including those shared in the appendix to this presentation.  
Altogether, sustainable solutions is a high-growth business opportunity for Jacobs, today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which, by the way, makes Jacob's one of the largest ESG solutions providers.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business.

Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business. During the second quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance and our workforce is executing at pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 vaccines are administered broadly across our operational sphere. Total CMS backlog is at $9.8 billion, representing a 7% year-over-year growth and up 6% pro forma, excluding the lower-margin hampered and classified procurement contract we have previously discussed. The CMS strategy is focused on revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes.  
Similar to last quarter, I will discuss 4 notable market trends positively impacting our CMS business: space exploration intelligence, all-source intelligence, digital modernization and clean energy.  
Beginning with space exploration and intelligence. From idea to operations, Jacobs delivers know-how and value to every stage of the space system life cycle for our civil and national security space plan. NASA leads this global exploration and development of deep space with its Artemis program that will carry astronauts to and from the moon surface and beyond. As NASA's largest service provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of the Artemis mission, including the space launch system, the Orion spacecraft and the exploration ground systems based at Kennedy Space Center. We are proud to have expanded our NASA support to the Wallops Flight facility located in Virginia, and are now providing full life cycle operations and testing that deploy expertise we have developed at other NASA centers.  
We remain heavily engaged in the NASA mission portfolio, including the recent support of the SLS hot-fire test in the design, fabrication and full deployment of the calibration device on the Perseverance Rover now exploring Mars. NASA continues to enjoy strong bipartisan congressional support with preliminary FY '22 budget, including a 6% increase over 2021. We also support the DoD's joint all-domain intelligence initiative, utilizing satellite connectivity in space and adding more capacity for intel analysis, such as our successful Mango One launch earlier this year. Overall, defense base spending was up 28% in FY '21 and is expected to show strong growth in FY '22 as well.  
Moving on to all source intelligence. Today's threat levels require intelligence analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial and measurement and signature to allow for better decision-making in real time. The Buffalo Group acquisition greatly expanded Jacobs' all-source intelligence capability. We were awarded 2 exciting wins from the Defense Intelligence Agency in the quarter. Jacobs will provide counterterrorism analytical expertise for the Defense Combating Terrorism Center, DCTC, and integrated intelligence centers and direct support of war fighters around the globe.  
We were also awarded a prime seat on the $12.6 billion solutions for the Information Technology enterprise, Or Site III IDIQ to address the evolving IT requirements vital to the security of the United States. All those specific classified budget details were not provided in the preliminary budget. Redirection of funds towards emerging cyber and intelligence threats from state actors are anticipated.
Now turning to digital modernization. In order for government agencies to run effectively and transform how they accomplish their missions, they require a full spectrum of digital enterprise solutions, including engineering operations, digital services such as cloud services, dev tech ops, cyber and data analytics. Contract obligations for digital modernization services have grown significantly over the past 5 years, with strong continued growth expected as government agencies upgrade their data networks.  
Recently, our software engineering team won a 10-year contract to continue to develop and sustain terrain awareness and warning system software for the U.S. Air Force C-17 fleet to help ensure pilot safety. 
A final trend is in clean energy or energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydro power and nuclear energy, all of which are critical to transitioning global economies away from fossil fuel.  
Across our CMS nuclear portfolio, our unique blend and depth of technical and program management capabilities allows us to provide life cycle support to our clients such as the delivery of Hinkley Point C, a large-scale nuclear power plant in the U.K. that will provide low-carbon electricity for approximately 6 million homes, developing small modular reactors and advanced modular reactors for delivering sustainable products such as green hydrogen or synthetic fuels and working with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability.  
Specifically, in the U.S., the DoE has been allocated a 10% increase in the preliminary FY '22 budget for decommissioning and new clean energy investments, including Fusion.  
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in fiscal year 2021 and beyond under the Biden administration. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, with over $10 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile.  
Now on Slide 7, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Starting with an overview of the benefit of global stimulus, we anticipate a direct investment in our key industry sectors and geographies that align with global trends and emerging governmental focus on climate change, infrastructure modernization, digital transformation and advanced facility. We are uniquely positioned to provide world-class service to significant areas of stimulus, including the anticipated U.S. infrastructure bill. Our global delivery model connected across geographies and markets, combined with our digitized delivery approach ensures efficient and seamless support anywhere in the world. Our existing contracting framework with the primary recipients of the stimulus funding will allow us to unlock capacity to capture these emerging opportunities.  
As an example of our engagement, we are hosting a global webinar with our water sector clients on May 12 to help them navigate and access available funding sources through the U.S. stimulus legislation.  
As we look to increase operating leverage through our Focus 2023 efforts, we are accelerating growth in both core and new sectors. We've engaged our partners from PA Consulting to catalyze these efforts by applying their business transformation expertise to further optimize Jacob's global delivery model. Combining our subject-matter experts with technology-enabled tools for a full solution offering, is a competitive differentiator, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters. 
Our continued financial resilience, driven by our balanced geographic and market portfolio, resulted in strong P&L performance in the quarter and 10% year-over-year backlog growth. Our pipeline remains healthy, and we anticipate continued growth as U.S. infrastructure bill materializes. 
I'll now discuss the key global trends and themes aligned with our P&PS. Climate change is a macro and multi-decade driver for clients around the world. Much of the economic stimulus is focused as green stimulus, underpinning all infrastructure modernization. Private sector clients are accelerating their transition to a net 0 economy, increasingly seeking solutions that embrace ESG principles. We are a leading provider in this space, delivering innovative solutions that support our clients' decarbonization and resiliency goals, such as mass transit and fleet electrification work that we are delivering across the globe. 
A great example is the Cambridgeshire Autonomous Metro in the U.K., where in collaboration with PA Consultant, we are delivering an end-to-end solution for the implementation of autonomous electric vehicle infrastructure. 
Infrastructure monetization and digital transformation is driving growth in the mid and long term. Our global program management team continues to deliver iconic programs for clients across major metropolitan areas on 5 continents. A clear demonstration of our efforts to modernize infrastructure by increasing mobility and improving journey time and nearly doubling road capacity is the recent award at Highways England's lower Thames crossing program, one of the U.K.'s most ambitious and largest road project ever. 
As a result of our leading expertise in the water sector, our recent win, the Saint Paul Minnesota water treatment plant demonstrates our ability to implement solutions for aging infrastructure to maintain reliable service, enhance water quality, improve operations and maintenance and provide a sustainable utility. 
Additionally, we won the Changi NEWater Factory 3 project with the Public Utility Board in Singapore as a result of our technology-efficient design that reduces operational costs. The first in-service solution features reverse flow technology to maximize reverse osmosis recovery and exemplifies our solutions and technology differentiator. 
The global semiconductor chip shortage is driving industry growth levels above historical averages. This shortage is being driven by a unique convergence of demand use and applications from areas such as smartphones, cloud computing and data storage. Coupled with the rebalancing of global supply chain, we are engaged with multiple clients to accelerate capital projects and increase capacity. We continue to see robust spending in the life sciences sector driven by our clients' redistribution of their product portfolio. 
Additionally, contract manufacturing organizations are embarking on an unprecedented amount of biologic capacity to support global demand. Leveraging our industry leadership and long-standing client relationships, we have secured the Fujifilm Diosynth Bio project in the Southeastern United States and other large confidential programs globally. 
In summary, our balanced portfolio of industry sectors and geographies continues to strengthen our P&PS pipeline. 
Turning to Slide 8. This is a very successful quarter for PA Consulting, building on a strong full calendar year of 2020. PA's revenue growth at 28% year-over-year. PA is involved in a wide range of digital transformation projects, including the vaccine rollout program globally. PA's backlog was up 36% year-over-year. This positive sales growth as well as continued investment in partner hiring into 2020 and 2021 gives increased confidence for the full year and beyond. We have seen solid performance across all sectors with strong wins in life sciences and U.K. public services. 
On the sustainability front, we've built on our global delivery partnership with the innovative start-up, PulPac, signing numerous new consumer clients to replace single-use plastics in their products. PA continues to secure a wide range of digitalization project programs, including the wins highlighted on the slide. 
PA's strategy is to focus on growth in the private sector with an acute focus in the U.S. and further diversification in end markets globally. 
We are working in partnership with PA to accelerate that strategy through joint engagements in key sectors, including energy & utility, health & life sciences and defense & security. 
I will now turn it over to Kevin to speak to our financial performance."

Second quarter gross revenue increased 4% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%. This was driven by solid underlying business performance, offset by the timing of advanced facilities projects. Acquisitions and FX benefits continue to grow to growth by more than offsetting the burn-off of 2 lower margin previously disclosed contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. 
For the second half of fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up in the low double digits year-over-year. On a pro forma basis for acquisitions, we expect second half revenue up low to mid-single digits versus a year ago as growth from the acquisitions and CMS and P&PS growth from a weaker second half 2020 compare more than offset continuous headwinds in CMS from the lower-margin contracts coming to an end. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by 3 factors: improvements in CMS gross margin as we continue to remix the portfolio to higher-margin business; a favorable impact from lower benefit costs; and the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile versus the rest of the portfolio. 
From a line of business standpoint, CMS gross margins increased strongly on a year-over-year basis as we benefited from higher-margin revenue in the base business, new wins and improved portfolio mix. P&P gross margin was up slightly year-over-year. 
Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up slightly year-over-year to 15%. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in management of our G&A costs, but do expect an increase in G&A as a percentage of revenue as a result of the expected rebound in labor-related medical costs, IT-related investments as we move to a flexible workforce and other investments to drive growth.
GAAP operating profit was a negative $41 million and was mainly impacted by a $267 million cost related to the closing of the PA Consulting transaction that we called out in our press release filed this morning. Let me provide additional detail on the nature of this cost. 
The $267 million represents a portion of the aggregate purchase price consideration for our investment in PA. That per GAAP accounting is treated as compensation, given retention-related requirements and distribution of this amount post closing. We still view the total investment consideration unchanged at GBP 1.4 billion. I'll discuss the cash flow, on page 10, of the $267 million later in my remarks. 
In addition, we had $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA Consulting investment; $13 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, including the Focus 2023 initiative; and $31 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. 
Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $311 million, up 32%, with both lines of business showing strong organic profit growth. 
In addition, PA Consulting posted strong double-digit growth in operating profit during their quarter ending April 2, 2021. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.5%, up 200 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and was effectively 10% without the benefit from PA, a record for the company. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0 per share and included 86% -- $0.86 per share from the PA investment consideration being treated as compensation previously mentioned, net of the associated tax impact, a $0.37 cost related to the mark-to-market investment in Worley and AI software provider, C3.ai, which included the impact of monetizing a portion of our C3.ai investment; $0.17 in deal and other PA consulting-related costs; $0.09 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other miscellaneous restructuring costs and $0.17 of amortization of acquired intangibles. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.66, up 19% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, PA contributed $0.09 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.32 to $0.34 of 2021 accretion from PA. For modeling purpose, we fully consolidate the impact of the P&A investment in our operating results, with a 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. 
Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $332 million and was up 27% year-over-year, reaching 11.2% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA Consulting. Even excluding the strong double-digit growth of PA, pro forma EBITDA growth was up 16% year-over-year. 
Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.06 for Q2, with over onetime book-to-bills across each business. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 5.3% year-over-year on a reported basis but down 2% pro forma when the acquisitions of Wood and the Buffalo Group are considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off 2 lower margin contracts, which represented $115 million year-over-year revenue headwind during the quarter. When excluding the runoff headwinds, FX benefits and pro forma acquisitions, CMS base revenue growth was actually up 6% year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year headwinds and from these 2 contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
CMS operating profit was $114 million, up 35% and up 27% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, even when factoring in the headwinds noted earlier. Operating margin was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities and the benefit from the higher-margin Buffalo Group business. 
For the second half fiscal 2021, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue growth when compared to the second half of fiscal year 2020. As we continue to ramp new wins that when combined with the benefits from the Buffalo Group acquisition, are expected to offset the revenue headwind previously discussed. 
Given the strategy to capture higher-value business via both acquisitions and organic efforts, we continue to expect reported operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year in the second half versus the year ago period. 
Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by continued solid performance in the Americas and a rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. This growth is partially offset by year-over-year declines in our Advanced Facilities business due to the timing of contracts. P&PS is now seeing strong pipeline growth as both our life sciences and electronics customers move forward with previously paused projects. 
Total P&PS operating profit was up 7% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 12.9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by a slight increase in gross margin and disciplined G&A cost management. 
In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $98 million in revenue and $28 million in operating profit for the stub period, which has been consolidated in our results. On a pro forma basis for a full quarter results, revenue grew 28% on a reported basis and 19% year-over-year in local currency. 
Full quarter adjusted operating profit for PA was also significantly up year-over-year, representing strong adjusted OP margin as a percentage of revenue. 
Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, driven by continued strong cost discipline and favorable benefit costs. For the second half of fiscal year 2021, we expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by expected increases in medical costs, increased IT and other expenses, including travel and entertainment, as we begin to position the company for developing growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A activities. I'm excited to share that we accelerated our Focus 2023 strategic initiatives by formally bringing on board a dedicated team from PA Consulting to partner in our work streams. Focus 2023, again, is a strategic initiative that we believe will lead to enhanced employee and customer experience; improve our ability to capture emerging high-growth, high-margin opportunities; and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall long-term profitability.
During the quarter, we incurred an additional $5 million charge in cash flows of approximately $12 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. Charges from previous acquisitions and other items fell to $13 million consistent with our guidance regarding these costs falling over the course of 2021. 
Additionally, we incurred approximately $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA Consulting investment. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect another $50 million in P&L charges related to transaction, integration and other onetime costs, consistent with our previous guidance. 
From a cash flow standpoint, for the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect approximately $65 million of cash flow associated with the earlier noted items. Please also note that the $260 million of PA price consideration will flow through cash flow from operations in our Q3 period even though this cash flow represents effectively a part of our investment consideration in PA, which remains unchanged, again at GBP 1.4 billion. 
Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated $209 million on reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The strong Q2 cash flow included a $42 million repayment of the U.K. VAT tax benefit from fiscal year '20 and a net negative of $74 million of costs associated with PA and Focus 2023 restructuring and other items. Please note that PA represented a net cash outflow of approximately $15 million in the stub period given the timing of certain cash taxes paid and transaction-related stamp duties. We continue to expect PA on a stand-alone basis to deliver strong free cash flow to adjusted net income on a rolling 12-month basis. 
Our transformation of the company is now delivering the expected improvements in free cash flow. It is net worthy that the free cash flow of the company has totaled over $1 billion over the last trailing 12-month period, even 1 including net onetime headwinds. We expect continued strong underlying cash flow through the balance of the year with full year cash conversion now expected to be over 100% when excluding onetime items and the $267 million investment consideration now characterized as a P&L charge and included in free cash flow in the third quarter. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $893 million and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulted in $2.6 billion of net debt for attributing the benefits of the Worley and C3.ai equity. Treating these items as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.7x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. 
Regardless, we will continue in the near term to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment given our higher gross debt levels.

So if you look and take away the $0.09 and kind of go to your remaining kind of, let's call it, $0.04 a month for the remaining 6 months. It is basically that number. We think that, that is a really strong performance consistent with what we had in our deal model.

And Steve mentioned the comment about their current work being really, really strong in the first quarter.

It's probably more focused in on the U.S. for us right now when I say U.S., U.S. clients as well as Asian clients that are building in the U.S. You're even seeing it in the stimulus bill with President Biden's efforts in order to increase that capacity here on U.S., as lobal supply chains have been kind of rigider, and so we do see that having a positive effect on Jacobs. I don't know if it's necessarily 6 months. It's probably got a longer tail on that and eased through the next 12 to 24 months, but that's a strong trend, and it's both not only on the logic side, but it's also on memory chips and some of the lower-end chips that you're hearing from automotive issues that are going around. 
Online sciences, that is probably more global as it pertains to us. And that is just the rebalancing of the product portfolio, all of this attention that's in place on vaccines, specifically around the coronavirus. Great development that's happening within the oncology world. And as I said in the remarks, that's driving a real need for contract manufacturing, probably like nothing we've seen in history because of the volumes that are needed and the speed to market around these new therapies. So overall, really, really solid picture for at least the next couple of years."

Or the initiatives around the margin, is it really all set to really expand incrementals in 2023 and beyond. Just curious how we should think about that trade-off with a better growth outlook and some inflationary pressures that'd be building as we think of the double digit and beyond for 2022 and 2023?"

So don't think of this as being something that's going to be a big challenge for us, but we do find it necessary to make these investments. I think the next comment I would make is that's what Focus 2023 is really all about to ensure that we get improved operating leverage through the process and system enhancements that we're talking about, which will allow us, as the growth dynamic begins to accelerate, which we talked about, assuming it's going to happen in 2022, and that's going to be really important for 2 reasons: one, to get the operating leverage; but I think the other way to think about it is if we can get that growth and afford ourselves the same ability not to hire at the same level that we've had to in past growth spurts, that's going to be really, really strong for us. So there obviously is a war for talent. And to the extent that we're going to be able to supply that incremental growth with less headcount having to be added to support it, that's going to be a big positive for us."

I look at about 10 months of contribution of the EBITDA numbers that you previously talked about with PA, it equates about $130 million. Again, regardless of seasonality, it's kind of a rough and tough number. Your guidance, the EBITDA side is up roughly that amount. Is this a way of kind of saying like, hey, the organic outlook is still good, but it's largely unchanged with most of the EBITDA raise from the acquisition. 
And then on the EPS side, was there anything below the line that allowed you to take up the lower end of that EPS range a little bit more. Just maybe if you could talk about that. And then just on the free cash flow, it's just worth clarifying the cash flow from operations, there was a $230 million benefit in the quarter on accrued liabilities. I'm guessing that might be associated with the -- the $267 million that's going to be a cash outflow next quarter, but I don't know.

The $267 million is a dynamic where the total consideration was reduced by the $267 million, and now that $267 million flows through the P&L ultimately in the third quarter. So effectively, that dynamic is occurring. So you're right relative to how that works. Total consideration doesn't change. We're still at the GBP 1.4 billion. So note that. I think that's important to know, Andy. 
Second point, in terms of the guide. No, there's -- look, the guide is effectively -- we took the $0.09, and we felt like the guide that we previously provided was appropriate. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, while their first quarter of their year was really strong, they got to giddy up and go relative to the pipeline that's in front of them, booking that and then burning that. And so effectively, we'll see how that plays out over the balance year. Let's hope that they do that. And in fact, if they kind of continue at that rate, that was in Q1, obviously, there's going to be some upside, but I think we're being prudent relative to that. Remember, this business, [ NPA ],is a book-and-burn business. So they got to always continue to drive towards that. So that's one thing. 
So back to the base business, yes, we had good performance in Q2. And effectively, that was a primary driver to our increase in the base business guide, is how I would characterize it. And look, I think at the end of the day, given the investments that I talked about on the G&A side that we're looking at the balance, I think that, that will offset any potential pending momentum that we got on the top line that may come to fruition. Pipeline is looking good relative to our, I would say, our state and local and government clients. I think that, that's positive. The pipeline is building on the advanced facilities. So we'll see how that all plays out. But we really see this coming together more in terms of our late fiscal 2021, which positions us better for 2022 than 2021."

And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. As the pandemic lessens its impact here in the United States, it's vital to recognize the significant struggles that are still occurring throughout the world, especially in India. Jacobs made an immediate donation to the United Way in New Delhi for critical medical supplies. And I'm particularly proud of our company and employees who together have donated $200,000 through our internal giving platform collectively. We have and will continue to support those that are still being impacted by the pandemic, including, for example, our operations in the Philippines.  
Turning to Slide 4. Before discussing our second quarter results, it's important to continue to reiterate how we think about our business by aligning and executing against our long-term strategy to drive superior value for our stakeholders. We take a multiyear approach to our rigorous strategy formation. This long-term mindset involves proactively assessing and aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. The transformation that Jacobs has undergone over the last several years has created significant value measured by relative total shareholder return.  
As you have seen from our recent organic actions, the PA Consulting investment and the acquisition of the Buffalo Group, we believe there's a significant opportunity to deliver differentiated, digitally enabled solutions as the world accelerates its efforts to modernize infrastructure, improve global supply chain and enhance national security.  
We have started the development of our new corporate strategy for fiscal year 2022 to '24, which we will present to the investor community later this year. As to our financial results, I'm pleased with our strong second quarter performance with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 27%. Backlog ended the second quarter up 10% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. Our strategic investment in PA Consulting closed on March 2 and demonstrated higher-than-expected results in the March quarter, with 19% revenue growth in sterling, up 28%, including the benefit of FX. We are also excited by the revenue synergies our joint Jacobs PA teams are creating, resulting in a robust pipeline in line with our deal model expectations.  
Given the stronger performance across Jacobs and the early closing of the PA investment, we are increasing our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we see the potential for one of the most attractive periods for growth in our company's history, activated through alignment of our portfolio to numerous secular growth opportunities in the expected infrastructure stimulus across the globe.  
Turning to Slide 5. Sustainability at Jacobs is reflected in our company's purpose of delivering solutions for a more connected sustainable world as well as through our values. We do things right, we challenge the accepted, we aim higher, and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people, to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. I'm proud of our efforts over the last few years as we are now being recognized by various external governance groups.  
For example, ISS recently updated their ESG assessment of Jacobs, where we are now approaching top decile in both environmental and social categories. These results are a credit to our people and their focus on our purpose and values.  
And of course, on an external basis, ESG is a significant growth opportunity for Jacobs. Building on the success of our sustainability strategy launched in 2019, PlanBeyond 2.0 reinforces our commitment to driving to a net 0 economy through furthering our sustainable business offerings. We are in the early stages of a significant business growth opportunity to partner with our global customers and communities to provide solutions with their net 0 carbon commitments.  
Now with our investment in PA Consulting, Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. For example, we're implementing the first bio geochemical reactor pilot plant project for PFAS remediation in the U.S. Supporting Germany's transition to significant net 0 power generation and distribution by 2030. We're teaming up water utilities in Australia to support decarbonization, working with industrial clients globally on their energy and resource management programs for advanced manufacturing facilities and many other projects, including those shared in the appendix to this presentation.  
Altogether, sustainable solutions is a high-growth business opportunity for Jacobs, today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which, by the way, makes Jacobs one of the largest ESG solutions providers.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."
282159,710880440,2301619,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 10, 2021",2021-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business.

Moving on to Slide 6 to review the quarterly performance for our Critical Mission Solutions business. During the second quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance and our workforce is executing at pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 vaccines are administered broadly across our operational sphere. Total CMS backlog is at $9.8 billion, representing a 7% year-over-year growth and up 6% pro forma, excluding the lower-margin hampered and classified procurement contract we have previously discussed. The CMS strategy is focused on revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes.  
Similar to last quarter, I will discuss 4 notable market trends positively impacting our CMS business: space exploration intelligence, all-source intelligence, digital modernization and clean energy.  
Beginning with space exploration and intelligence. From idea to operations, Jacobs delivers know-how and value to every stage of the space system life cycle for our civil and national security space plan. NASA leads this global exploration and development of deep space with its Artemis program that will carry astronauts to and from the moon surface and beyond. As NASA's largest service provider, Jacobs is involved in many aspects of the Artemis mission, including the space launch system, the Orion spacecraft and the exploration ground systems based at Kennedy Space Center. We are proud to have expanded our NASA support to the Wallops Flight facility located in Virginia, and are now providing full life cycle operations and testing that deploy expertise we have developed at other NASA centers.  
We remain heavily engaged in the NASA mission portfolio, including the recent support of the SLS hot-fire test and the design, fabrication and full deployment of the calibration device on the Perseverance Rover now exploring Mars. NASA continues to enjoy strong bipartisan congressional support with preliminary FY '22 budget, including a 6% increase over 2021. We also support the DoD's joint all-domain intelligence initiative, utilizing satellite connectivity in space and adding more capacity for intel analysis, such as our successful Mango One launch earlier this year. Overall, defense base spending was up 28% in FY '21 and is expected to show strong growth in FY '22 as well.  
Moving on to all source intelligence. Today's threat levels require intelligence analysts to utilize and coordinate multiple sources, including human, signal, open source, geospatial and measurement and signature to allow for better decision-making in real time. The Buffalo Group acquisition greatly expanded Jacobs' all-source intelligence capability. We were awarded 2 exciting wins from the Defense Intelligence Agency in the quarter. Jacobs will provide counterterrorism analytical expertise for the Defense Combating Terrorism Center, DCTC, and integrated intelligence centers and direct support of war fighters around the globe.  
We were also awarded a prime seat on the $12.6 billion solutions for the Information Technology enterprise, or Site III IDIQ to address the evolving IT requirements vital to the security of the United States. All those specific classified budget details were not provided in the preliminary budget. Redirection of funds towards emerging cyber and intelligence threats from state actors are anticipated.
Now turning to digital modernization. In order for government agencies to run effectively and transform how they accomplish their missions, they require a full spectrum of digital enterprise solutions, including engineering and operations; digital services such as cloud services, dev tech ops, cyber and data analytics. Contract obligations for digital modernization services have grown significantly over the past 5 years, with strong continued growth expected as government agencies upgrade their data networks.  
Recently, our software engineering team won a 10-year contract to continue to develop and sustain terrain awareness and warning system software for the U.S. Air Force C-17 fleet to help ensure pilot safety. 
A final trend is in clean energy or energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower and nuclear energy, all of which are critical to transitioning global economies away from fossil fuel.  
Across our CMS nuclear portfolio, our unique blend and depth of technical and program management capabilities allows us to provide life cycle support to our clients such as the delivery of Hinkley Point C, a large-scale nuclear power plant in the U.K. that will provide low-carbon electricity for approximately 6 million homes, developing small modular reactors and advanced modular reactors for delivering sustainable products such as green hydrogen or synthetic fuels and working with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability.  
Specifically, in the U.S., the DoE has been allocated a 10% increase in the preliminary FY '22 budget for decommissioning and new clean energy investments, including fusion.  
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in fiscal year 2021 and beyond under the Biden administration. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, with over $10 billion in source selection and an increasing margin profile.  
Now on Slide 7, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. Starting with an overview of the benefit of global stimulus, we anticipate a direct investment in our key industry sectors and geographies that align with global trends and emerging governmental focus on climate change, infrastructure modernization, digital transformation and advanced facility. We are uniquely positioned to provide world-class service to significant areas of stimulus, including the anticipated U.S. infrastructure bill. Our global delivery model connected across geographies and markets, combined with our digitized delivery approach ensures efficient and seamless support anywhere in the world. Our existing contracting framework with the primary recipients of the stimulus funding will allow us to unlock capacity to capture these emerging opportunities.  
As an example of our engagement, we are hosting a global webinar with our water sector clients on May 12 to help them navigate and access available funding sources through the U.S. stimulus legislation.  
As we look to increase operating leverage through our Focus 2023 efforts, we are accelerating growth in both core and new sectors. We've engaged our partners from PA Consulting to catalyze these efforts by applying their business transformation expertise to further optimize Jacobs' global delivery model. Combining our subject-matter experts with technology-enabled tools for a full solution offering, is a competitive differentiator, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters. 
Our continued financial resilience, driven by our balanced geographic and market portfolio, resulted in strong P&L performance in the quarter and 10% year-over-year backlog growth. Our pipeline remains healthy, and we anticipate continued growth as U.S. infrastructure bill materializes. 
I'll now discuss the key global trends and themes aligned with our P&PS business. Climate change is a macro and multi-decade driver for clients around the world. Much of the economic stimulus is focused as green stimulus, underpinning all infrastructure modernization. Private sector clients are accelerating their transition to a net 0 economy, increasingly seeking solutions that embrace ESG principles. We are a leading provider in this space, delivering innovative solutions that support our clients' decarbonization and resiliency goals, such as mass transit and fleet electrification work that we are delivering across the globe. 
A great example is the Cambridgeshire Autonomous Metro in the U.K., where in collaboration with PA Consultant, we are delivering an end-to-end solution for the implementation of autonomous electric vehicle infrastructure. 
Infrastructure monetization and digital transformation is driving growth in the mid and long term. Our global program management team continues to deliver iconic programs for clients across major metropolitan areas on 5 continents. A clear demonstration of our efforts to modernize infrastructure by increasing mobility and improving journey time and nearly doubling road capacity is the recent award at Highways England's lower Thames crossing program, one of the U.K.'s most ambitious and largest road project ever. 
As a result of our leading expertise in the water sector, our recent win, the Saint Paul Minnesota water treatment plant demonstrates our ability to implement solutions for aging infrastructure to maintain reliable service, enhance water quality, improve operations and maintenance and provide a sustainable utility. 
Additionally, we won the Changi NEWater Factory 3 project with the Public Utility Board in Singapore as a result of our technology-efficient design that reduces operational costs. The first in-service solution features reverse flow technology to maximize reverse osmosis recovery and exemplifies our solutions and technology differentiator. 
The global semiconductor chip shortage is driving industry growth levels above historical averages. This shortage is being driven by a unique convergence of demand use and applications from areas such as smartphones, cloud computing and data storage. Coupled with the rebalancing of global supply chain, we are engaged with multiple clients to accelerate capital projects and increase capacity. We continue to see robust spending in the life sciences sector driven by our clients' redistribution of their product portfolio. 
Additionally, contract manufacturing organizations are embarking on an unprecedented amount of biologic capacity to support global demand. Leveraging our industry leadership and long-standing client relationships, we have secured the Fujifilm Diosynth Bio project in the Southeastern United States and other large confidential programs globally. 
In summary, our balanced portfolio of industry sectors and geographies continues to strengthen our P&PS pipeline. 
Turning to Slide 8. This is a very successful quarter for PA Consulting, building on a strong full calendar year of 2020. PA's revenue growth at 28% year-over-year. PA is involved in a wide range of digital transformation projects, including the vaccine rollout program globally. PA's backlog was up 36% year-over-year. This positive sales growth as well as continued investment in partner hiring in 2020 and 2021 gives increased confidence for the full year and beyond. We have seen solid performance across all sectors with strong wins in life sciences and U.K. public services. 
On the sustainability front, we've built on our global delivery partnership with the innovative start-up, PulPac, signing numerous new consumer clients to replace single-use plastics in their products. PA continues to secure a wide range of digitalization project programs, including the wins highlighted on the slide. 
PA's strategy is to focus on growth in the private sector with an acute focus in the U.S. and further diversification in end markets globally. 
We are working in partnership with PA to accelerate that strategy through joint engagements in key sectors, including energy & utility, health & life sciences and defense & security. 
I will now turn it over to Kevin to speak to our financial performance."

Second quarter gross revenue increased 4% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%. This was driven by solid underlying business performance, offset by the timing of advanced facilities projects. Acquisitions and FX benefits continue to grow to growth by more than offsetting the burn-off of 2 lower margin previously disclosed contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. 
For the second half of fiscal year 2021 compared to 2020, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up in the low double digits year-over-year. On a pro forma basis for acquisitions, we expect second half revenue up low to mid-single digits versus a year ago as growth from the acquisitions and CMS and P&PS growth from a weaker second half 2020 compare more than offset continuous headwinds in CMS from the lower-margin contracts coming to an end. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven primarily by 3 factors: improvements in CMS gross margin as we continue to remix the portfolio to higher-margin business; a favorable impact from lower benefit costs; and the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile versus the rest of the portfolio. 
From a line of business standpoint, CMS gross margins increased strongly on a year-over-year basis as we benefited from higher-margin revenue in the base business, new wins and improved portfolio mix. P&P gross margin was up slightly year-over-year. 
Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up slightly year-over-year to 15%. As we look forward, we will continue to be disciplined in management of our G&A costs, but do expect an increase in G&A as a percentage of revenue as a result of the expected rebound in labor-related medical costs, IT-related investments as we move to a flexible workforce and other investments to drive growth.
GAAP operating profit was a negative $41 million and was mainly impacted by a $267 million cost related to the closing of the PA Consulting transaction that we called out in our press release filed this morning. Let me provide additional detail on the nature of this cost. 
The $267 million represents a portion of the aggregate purchase price consideration for our investment in PA. That per GAAP accounting is treated as compensation, given retention-related requirements and distribution of this amount post closing. We still view the total investment consideration unchanged at GBP 1.4 billion. I'll discuss the cash flow, on page 10, of the $267 million later in my remarks. 
In addition, we had $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA Consulting investment; $13 million of restructuring, transaction and other charges, including the Focus 2023 initiative; and $31 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. 
Adjusting for these items, adjusted operating profit was $311 million, up 32%, with both lines of business showing strong organic profit growth. 
In addition, PA Consulting posted strong double-digit growth in operating profit during their quarter ending April 2, 2021. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.5%, up 200 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and was effectively 10% without the benefit from PA, a record for the company. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0 per share and included 86% -- $0.86 per share from the PA investment consideration being treated as compensation previously mentioned, net of the associated tax impact, a $0.37 cost related to the mark-to-market investment in Worley and AI software provider, C3.ai, which included the impact of monetizing a portion of our C3.ai investment; $0.17 in deal and other PA consulting-related costs; $0.09 per share of after-tax charges primarily related to Focus 2023 and other miscellaneous restructuring costs and $0.17 of amortization of acquired intangibles. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.66, up 19% year-over-year. 
During the quarter, PA contributed $0.09 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.32 to $0.34 of 2021 accretion from PA. For modeling purpose, we fully consolidate the impact of the PA investment in our operating results, with a 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. 
Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $332 million and was up 27% year-over-year, reaching 11.2% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA Consulting. Even excluding the strong double-digit growth of PA, pro forma EBITDA growth was up 16% year-over-year. 
Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1.06 for Q2, with over onetime book-to-bills across each business. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 10. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 5.3% year-over-year on a reported basis but down 2% pro forma when the acquisitions of Wood and the Buffalo Group are considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off 2 lower margin contracts, which represented $115 million year-over-year revenue headwind during the quarter. When excluding the runoff headwinds, FX benefits and pro forma acquisitions, CMS base revenue growth was actually up 6% year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year headwinds from these 2 contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
CMS operating profit was $114 million, up 35% and up 27% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, even when factoring in the headwinds noted earlier. Operating margin was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 8.7%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities and the benefit from the higher-margin Buffalo Group business. 
For the second half fiscal 2021, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue growth when compared to the second half of fiscal year 2020. As we continue to ramp new wins that when combined with the benefits from the Buffalo Group acquisition, are expected to offset the revenue headwind previously discussed. 
Given the strategy to capture higher-value business via both acquisitions and organic efforts, we continue to expect reported operating profit growth to be up double-digit year-over-year in the second half versus the year ago period. 
Moving to P&PS. Q2 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by continued solid performance in the Americas and a rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. This growth is partially offset by year-over-year declines in our Advanced Facilities business due to the timing of contracts. P&PS is now seeing strong pipeline growth as both our life sciences and electronics customers move forward with previously paused projects. 
Total P&PS operating profit was up 7% year-over-year, and as a percentage of net revenue was 12.9% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by a slight increase in gross margin and disciplined G&A cost management. 
In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $98 million in revenue and $28 million in operating profit for the stub period, which has been consolidated in our results. On a pro forma basis for a full quarter results, revenue grew 28% on a reported basis and 19% year-over-year in local currency. 
Full quarter adjusted operating profit for PA was also significantly up year-over-year, representing strong adjusted OP margin as a percentage of revenue. 
Our non-allocated corporate costs were $33 million for the quarter, driven by continued strong cost discipline and favorable benefit costs. For the second half of fiscal year 2021, we expect our non-allocated corporate costs to be higher year-over-year, driven primarily by expected increases in medical costs, increased IT and other expenses, including travel and entertainment, as we begin to position the company for developing growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
Now turning to Slide 11. I'd like to update you on our Focus 2023 and M&A activities. I'm excited to share that we accelerated our Focus 2023 strategic initiatives by formally bringing on board a dedicated team from PA Consulting to partner in our work streams. Focus 2023, again, is a strategic initiative that we believe will lead to enhanced employee and customer experience; improve our ability to capture emerging high-growth, high-margin opportunities; and three, drive a more efficient cost structure through increased automation and process alignment for overall long-term profitability.
During the quarter, we incurred an additional $5 million charge in cash flows of approximately $12 million related to our Focus 2023 initiative. Charges from previous acquisitions and other items fell to $13 million consistent with our guidance regarding these costs falling over the course of 2021. 
Additionally, we incurred approximately $42 million in deal and other costs associated with the PA Consulting investment. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we expect another $50 million in P&L charges related to transaction, integration and other onetime costs, consistent with our previous guidance. 
From a cash flow standpoint, for the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect approximately $65 million of cash flow associated with the earlier noted items. Please also note that the $260 million of PA price consideration will flow through cash flow from operations in our Q3 period even though this cash flow represents effectively a part of our investment consideration in PA, which remains unchanged, again at GBP 1.4 billion. 
Now on to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated $209 million on reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The strong Q2 cash flow included a $42 million repayment of the U.K. VAT tax benefit from fiscal year '20 and a net negative of $74 million of costs associated with PA and Focus 2023 restructuring and other items. Please note that PA represented a net cash outflow of approximately $15 million in the stub period given the timing of certain cash taxes paid and transaction-related stamp duties. We continue to expect PA on a stand-alone basis to deliver strong free cash flow to adjusted net income on a rolling 12-month basis. 
Our transformation of the company is now delivering the expected improvements in free cash flow. It is net worthy that the free cash flow of the company has totaled over $1 billion over the last trailing 12-month period, even 1 including net onetime headwinds. We expect continued strong underlying cash flow through the balance of the year with full year cash conversion now expected to be over 100% when excluding onetime items and the $267 million investment consideration now characterized as a P&L charge and included in free cash flow in the third quarter. Regarding the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $893 million and a gross debt of $3.5 billion, resulted in $2.6 billion of net debt for attributing the benefits of the Worley and C3.ai equity. Treating these items as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.7x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. 
Regardless, we will continue in the near term to deploy excess cash toward debt repayment given our higher gross debt levels. 
Finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, We remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased to 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve."

But as far as the U.S. infrastructure stimulus opportunity, I think we're extremely well positioned with the organic capability we have today. 
And on the climate change side, when you look at the $5 billion, it's really wide ranging of what we're in. But as you look at the growth going forward, it's going to be everything from how do we help our clients adapt and mitigate. So whether it's sea level rise or flooding or bush fires and droughts, the whole energy transition equation moving away from fossil fuels into clean energy, and that's both working with our government and private clients. Everyone is looking to reduce their carbon footprint. That's where we come in around the whole decarbonization and eliminating or reducing greenhouse gases and then things like natural resource stewardship, which is critical across the globe. It's a global opportunity. We're positioned well as an end-to-end solutions provider and bringing some unique tools and innovation because it's going to require digital transformation to achieve these type of climate change transformative expectations by our clients."

Their last month tends to be the strongest month in the quarter. So effectively, don't necessarily take that $0.09 and assume it all the way through. So I think that, that's one thing to recognize.
So if you look and take away the $0.09 and kind of go to your remaining kind of, let's call it, $0.04 a month for the remaining 6 months. It is basically that number. We think that, that is a really strong performance consistent with what we had in our deal model. And ultimately, we're hoping, given the strong start, that maybe there could be some opportunity to improve on that over the balance of the year. But so far, they started strong. And Steve mentioned the comment about their current work being really, really strong in the first quarter. And -- but some of that's going to go away over their second, third and fourth calendar quarters for their year. And they have to do a really good job on replacing that over the balance of the year.

I don't know if it's necessarily 6 months. It's probably got a longer tail on that and eased through the next 12 to 24 months, but that's a strong trend, and it's both not only on the logic side, but it's also on memory chips and some of the lower-end chips that you're hearing from some of the automotive issues that are brewing around. 
On life sciences, that is probably more global as it pertains to us. And that is just the rebalancing of the product portfolio, all of this attention that took place on vaccines, specifically around the coronavirus. Great development that's happening within the oncology world. And as I said in the remarks, that's driving a real need for contract manufacturing, probably like nothing we've seen in history because of the volumes that are needed and the speed to market around these new therapies.

So there obviously is a war for talent.

But I guess just, Kevin, I just want to make sure we understand the new guidance correctly. I look at about 10 months of contribution off the EBITDA numbers that you previously talked about with PA, it equates to about $130 million. Again, regardless of seasonality, it's kind of a rough and tough number. Your guidance, the EBITDA side is up roughly that amount. Is this a way of kind of saying like, hey, the organic outlook is still good, but it's largely unchanged with most of the EBITDA raise from the acquisition?
And then on the EPS side, was there anything below the line that allowed you to take up the lower end of that EPS range a little bit more? Just maybe if you could talk about that. And then just on the free cash flow, it's just worth clarifying the cash flow from operations, there was a $230 million benefit in the quarter on accrued liabilities. I'm guessing that might be associated with the -- the $267 million that's going to be a cash outflow next quarter, but I don't know.

So effectively, that dynamic is occurring. So you're right relative to how that works. Total consideration doesn't change. We're still at the GBP 1.4 billion. So note that. I think that's important to know, Andy. 
Second point, in terms of the guide. No, there's -- look, the guide is effectively -- we took the $0.09, and we felt like the guide that we previously provided was appropriate. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, while their first quarter of their year was really strong, they got to giddy up and go relative to the pipeline that's in front of them, booking that and then burning that. And so effectively, we'll see how that plays out over the balance year. Let's hope that they do that. And in fact, if they kind of continue at that rate, that was in Q1, obviously, there's going to be some upside, but I think we're being prudent relative to that. Remember, this business, in PA, is a book-and-burn business. So they got to always continue to drive towards that. So that's one thing. 
So back to the base business, yes, we had good performance in Q2. And effectively, that was a primary driver to our increase in the base business guide, is how I would characterize it. And look, I think at the end of the day, given the investments that I talked about on the G&A side that we're looking at the balance, I think that, that will offset any potential pending momentum that we got on the top line that may come to fruition. Pipeline is looking good relative to our, I would say, our state and local and government clients. I think that, that's positive. The pipeline is building on the advanced facilities. So we'll see how that all plays out. But we really see this coming together more in terms of our late fiscal 2021, which positions us better for 2022 than 2021."

Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to Slide 4. Before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strategy,",742,"All right. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to Slide 4. Before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strategy, which includes aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we're developing our new corporate strategy and just completed a midpoint review of our business and competitive landscape. We look forward to sharing our new strategy, along with updated multiyear financial targets at our Investor Day later this year. 
Turning to our financial results, I'm pleased with our strong third quarter performance, with net revenues increasing 11% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 26%. Backlog ended the third quarter up 7% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis and our backlog excludes our significant Idaho National Labs remediation win. Now that the award has cleared protest when including Idaho, total Jacobs reported third quarter backlog would be up 11% and on a pro forma basis for Idaho, up 6%. 
Total PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 36% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins of 23%, making it one of the fastest-growing and most profitable consultancy firms. Given the strong year-to-date performance across all of Jacobs, including PA, we are again increasing our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook.
Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we believe we are entering an attractive growth period for Jacobs, driven by strong global trends and infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security  and a potential super cycle and global supply chain investments, most notably in our semiconductor and life sciences. We are anticipating an increasing and robust sales pipeline for both fiscal year 2022 and 2023. We are aligning our strong culture, deep domain knowledge and investments of technology-enabled solutions to help solve our clients' challenges and to convert this pipeline into meaningful growth opportunities for our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 5. At Jacobs, our company's purpose is delivering solutions for a more connected, sustainable world. And our values are: we do things right, we challenge the accepted, we aim higher, and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. Building on our PlanBeyond 2.0 strategy, which we released externally last week, we have now launched an ESG-focused digital thought leadership publication, Reimagined Perspectives, to share with the world what our talented teams are thinking relative to high-priority challenges, like climate change, and how they're creating and delivering innovative solutions in response. Living up to our brand promise begins with thought leadership by stimulating discussion, asking the hard questions and seeking new ways to meet challenges. The first publication is focused on resilience from a number of perspectives. And throughout today's presentation, you'll see examples of our people and our solutions and actions. We encourage you to follow us on social media or visit our website to learn more. 
Turning to Slide 6. We are seeing an acceleration across our global customer base and communities to provide solutions for their net zero carbon commitments. For example, at one of the largest U.S. consumer goods companies, we are providing consulting services to help them drive carbon neutral facilities as part of their journey to net zero emissions, an effort that may result in rethinking their entire global supply chain. And for a transportation customer in the U.S., we're helping them leverage renewable energy sources for their rail operations to enhance electric grid reliability during critical types. And in the U.K., we're researching how airports of the future will accommodate hydrogen aircraft. And in Germany, we're supporting Shell's goal of becoming a net zero emissions company by planning for their new sustainable campus. 
And moving further east, we're supporting the development of a new solar photovoltaic power plant in Malaysia. In Australia, we've been awarded another wind energy project with a confidential customer. Altogether, sustainable solutions are a high-growth business for Jacobs, today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which makes Jacobs one of the largest ESG solutions providers. And now with PA Consulting, Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

During the third quarter, our CMS business continued its solid performance. Total CMS backlog is at $9.6 billion, representing 6% year-over-year growth. Backlog in the quarter was impacted by protests, but we expect these to clear in Q4, resulting in strong backlog growth. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. 
As discussed in prior quarters, we are pursuing sectors with strong positive growth trends, including global energy transition, space-based ISR, intelligence analytics and 5G networks. I'd like to discuss several of those trends in recent related wins in greater detail, beginning with energy transition. Progressive leaders across the world are driving initiatives to cut off CO2 emissions through investment in clean energy solutions. And Jacobs has recently realigned its North American and European nuclear practices to better deliver our global life cycle nuclear capabilities. This includes advanced modular reactors or AMR and that can be used for electricity generation and for the -- and with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability. 
During the quarter, Jacobs was awarded the Idaho Cleanup Project at Idaho National Laboratory as the majority partner in the Idaho Environmental Coalition. The contract value is estimated at $3.9 billion over a 10-year period and recently cleared protest. Approximately $780 million will be included in Q4 backlog. Together with the BOE, we will use Jacobs technology-driven solutions to reduce the environmental legacy of the Cold War while delivering social value by supporting high-quality jobs in the region and protecting the Snake River Aquifer, a critical element of Idaho's agricultural industry. 
Moving on to space-based ISR. The U.S. military predicts that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, outthink and outmaneuver adversaries across the multiple domains: land, sea, air, cyber and increasingly, space. Low orbiting surveillance satellites can collect and process data much quicker than air ISR and advanced satellite centers are a critical component in the effectiveness of these military small sats. Jacobs won a 2-year contract from a classified client to perform demonstration of its active electronically scanned arrays, or AESA technology, similar to the technology utilized in our Mango satellite launch. A key differentiator for Jacobs in this area is the use of our commercial 5G technology in reducing the cost of space radar by up to 5x less than legacy space radar systems. This further advances Jacobs as an aerospace and defense prime, delivering value-added commercial space-based AESAs. 
Now turning to a related national security trend, intelligence analytics. Intelligence data often collected from multiple sources are analyzed with support from AI technologies and transformed into information that generates a picture and -- of adversary activity. ultimately informing and driving a commander's decision-making. Jacobs' recent Buffalo Group acquisition won 2 attractive awards during the quarter in support of the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, INSCOM. The 902nd Military Group CI Human intelligence Analytical Services contract is a $234 million 5-year award to provide advanced cyber and intelligence solutions for INSCOM's counterintelligence and counter-terrorism operations. This award is expected to clear protest and added to our backlog in Q4. Jacobs also won an annual extension of the U.S. Army's biometric and identity intelligence analytical support services contract. 
A final trend is the growth in 5G networks. Our telecom business had a strong quarter, in part from the accelerating rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, DIRECTV and T-Mobile as well as health systems and the U.S. Department of Defense. The increased demand is the result of clients seeking the benefits of 5G's higher bandwidth to operate in advanced environments for commercial and consumer applications, including telemedicine, augmented reality and next-generation gaming. And the DoD is also heavily in 5G technology in support of virtual mission planning and training. We're excited about the continued increase in opportunities, fueling growth in our telecom business. 
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 and beyond. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with an 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection and importantly, with an increasing margin profile. 
Now on Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We continue to demonstrate strong performance, driven by our strategy to focus on high-value sectors in key geographic regions, leveraging our strong global integrated delivery platform. Third quarter backlog was up 6%, resulting in greater than a 1x book-to-bill for both revenue and gross margin. The global trends of climate change, infrastructure monetization and digitalization as well as accelerated supply chain demands in areas driven by the pandemic are catalyzing our clients' mid- and long-term investments. As demonstrated by our results, we remain well positioned to grow. These multiyear trends align strongly with our purpose to make the world more connected and sustainable. 
I'd now like to provide more insight into the effect these global trends are having on our business, starting with climate change. As a recognized leader in forward-leaning solutions, including specific ESG actions aligned to decarbonization and energy transition, we are very well positioned to convert our growing pipeline into tangible results. On the environmental front, we continue to win strategic work with our key clients as demonstrated by our recent win to support the U.S. Air Force and their mission to protect human health and local communities, with a focus on combating emergent contaminants, including PFAS. In addition to new wins, we were recently named by environment analysts as the #1 leader in water quality and resources and our work on the Tyndall Air Force Base Coastal Resilience Study in Florida was recognized as a global winner at the U.K. Environment Agency's 2021 Flood and Coast Awards. 
Moving to infrastructure modernization. As part of our rapid uptick in our transit and rail portfolio, we are winning major projects around the globe, such as the East-West Rail program partner in the U.K., a major U.S. Transit Authority's metro rail platform reconstruction, and the Kiwi Rail modernization program in New Zealand. These important wins leverage our capability in digitally-enabled solutions. We are also developing digital solutions that apply to a wide cross-section of clients and sectors around the world, allowing us to use our global platform and client base to deploy solutions and creating new recurring revenue streams. One such product is Kaleidoscope. Launched today, Kaleidoscope is a predictive analytics application, which supports clients and capital planning and match the true risk, cost and vulnerabilities of interconnected infrastructure systems. Our cross-sector domain knowledge gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing innovative solutions and create stronger growth opportunities. 
As an example, for the health care sector, we are creating one of the world's first digital twins to support operational decision-making based on predictive analytics and scenario forecasting. We are integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze historical health and location-based service data alongside real-time meteorological traffic and large public event data to optimize patient demand and capacity scenarios. This is a fantastic example of how Jacobs is partnering with our clients to reinvent health care of tomorrow. 
Shifting to our Advanced Facilities sector, we believe we are entering an unprecedented multi-year growth cycle. In our Electronics sector, we are seeing a sharp rise in semiconductors in response to the global chip shortage, given long-term demand in cloud and edge computing data storage and smart infrastructure such as electric grids. Multiple government initiatives have been launched with the goal of supporting semiconductor manufacturing in their respective countries. As a global leader in the space, we are well positioned for strong growth with our clients in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Additionally, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly utilizing contract manufacturing capacity as a means to supplement their own production. We have secured several large programs, including the recently announced Fuji Diosynth Biotechnologies New Greenville campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We have also secured a major contract with Natureworks to design a manufacturing facility in Thailand, dedicated to producing biopolymers from sugar, resulting in products that are biodegradable and produced from sustainable resources. The design will be executed through our global delivery model, including talents from India and the Philippines. 
Finally, as it relates to pandemic-driven solutions, we have an exciting win that once again combines our world-leading domain expertise in water with our digital AI capabilities for a breakthrough project in the Middle East. We are performing program management services for the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy to deliver a wastewater laboratory that will screen and detect COVID-19 virus and other infectious diseases. 
Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 9. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to outperform expectations. New wins include recent revenue -- recently large revenue synergy in the U.K. that has built excitement across our teams. Working together, PA and Jacobs won the new U.K. Department of Food and Rural Affairs management consultancy contract, a large-scale strategic advisory program for business transformation and delivery. Joint pursuits continue to be across other regions and geographies, and I look forward to sharing additional details in the coming quarters. As we look at specific growth areas, PA continues to support the U.K.'s government -- U.K. government's COVID response, with their efforts now focused on vaccine deployment and test and trace activities. On a related note, 
PA is also seeing growth projects, both in the consumer and life sciences sectors. As disruption from the pandemic changes business for good, we're seeing increased interest in digital and online products, experience and service models. Examples include a major retailer that is revolutionizing their online offer to create new customer experiences by moving from face-to-face to a subscription model. And in health and life sciences, virtualizing the clinical trials process for patients through telemedicine. 
On the digital solutions front, PA and Unilever teamed up to create a world-leading predictive tool, COVID-19 Awareness and Situational Intelligence or CASI, which redefines how data can be harnessed to unlock predictive insight. The team combined their expertise in consumer goods, business intelligence, data analytics, AI, machine learning, operational resilience and global supply chains to create a live dashboard that monitors and provides real-time and predictive intelligence from a worldwide perspective. PA's product innovations for [ Teak Origin ] and Guide Beauty were recognized by this year's prestigious If Design Awards. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results."

Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contributed to growth by more than offsett",1342,"Thank you, Bob. Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contributed to growth by more than offsetting the previously disclosed burn-off of 2 lower margin contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up near double digits year-over-year and up slightly on a pro forma basis. This represents strong underlying growth, considering our fiscal fourth quarter of 202 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which will impact our 2021 fiscal fourth quarter reported growth rate by approximately 8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.6%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven by a few factors, a favorable revenue mix in both people and places and CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year, in line with our expectations to 17%. 
GAAP operating profit was $264 million and was mainly impacted by $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $315 million, up 32%, with both CMS and people in places showing strong organic profit growth. In addition, PA posted strong growth in operating profit during the quarter versus their year ago figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.82 per share and primarily included $0.44 related to an updated noncash valuation allocation between PA Consulting preferred and common shares, with no impact to the original consideration; $0.34 related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and an updated estimate of our annual adjusted effective tax rate; $0.24 of amortization of acquired intangibles, all of which were partly offset by $0.23 related to the positive mark-to-market investment in Worley and the impact of monetizing the remaining portion of our C3.ai investment. Excluding all items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.64, up 30% year-over-year. 
Included in the tax item noted earlier, third quarter adjusted EPS is impacted by 20% -- by a 20% effective tax rate to reflect a change and our estimated adjusted annual effective tax rate to 22.5% from 23.8%. This change in estimated tax rate resulted in an $0.08 per share tax benefit in our adjusted results during the third quarter. During the quarter, PA contributed $0.15 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.35 to $0.37 of 2021 PA accretion, up from $0.32 to $0.34 in our previous quarter. As a reminder, for modeling purposes, we fully consolidate the impact of the PA investment in our operating results, with a 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $321 million and was up 26% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation also includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA. Excluding PA, adjusted EBITDA growth was up 9% year-over-year. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1x for Q3, with actually a little bit higher book-to-bill of 1.1 on a gross margin level. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and down [ 2% ] pro forma when the acquisition of the Buffalo Group is considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off 2 lower margin contracts, which represented $190 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract runoff and FX benefits, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year impact from these 2 contract rolloffs through the balance of this year and our first  quarter of fiscal 2022. 
CMS operating profit was $108 million, up 21% and up 19% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating margin was up 150 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities. For the fourth quarter, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue, effectively offsetting the impact of the extra week of revenue last year, and we expect mid-single-digit operating profit growth as the timing of recent wins are now expected to ramp in fiscal year 2022. 
Moving to People & Places Solutions, Q3 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by a rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. While the Americas business saw near-term delays in larger projects, the positive developments regarding infrastructure stimulus over the last week is expected to result in customers beginning to leverage existing framework agreements as we enter 2022. We anticipate seeing awards associated with the stimulus beginning in our second half of next fiscal year. This developing momentum, when combined with the strength of our Advanced Facilities business noted earlier by Bob, positions us well into 2022. 
Total P&PS operating profit was up 8% year-over-year, including the benefit from FX. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.8% for the quarter, up 80 basis points year-over-year, driven mainly by a gross margin benefit from a more profitable revenue mix. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed [ $256 million in revenue ] and $57 million in operating profit. PA's Q3 revenue grew 36% and 20% year-over-year in local currency. Q3 operating profit margin was 22%, in line with our expectations. Finally, our nonallocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and up year-over-year and in line with our expectations. The increase was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs, IT investments and other expenses. We expect non-allocated corporate costs to also trend slightly higher in Q4, given continued increased -- increases in the medical costs and other investments as we begin to position the company for the growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
As we turn to Slide 12, I would like to comment that our restructuring and other charges have significantly decreased. And as a result, we have not included a specific slide on this subject in this presentation. To comment quickly, during the quarter, we incurred only $2 million of total net charges for Focus 2023 as well as other restructuring and integration activities. As a result, both P&L and related cash outflows for these items remain in line with our outlook, and we are focused on significantly decreasing these adjustments going forward. 
During the third quarter, we generated $153 million in reported free cash flow, as DSO again, showed strong improvement. It is important to note this cash flow included the $261 million of purchase price consideration for PA, treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter; and a net $19 million associated with Focus 2023 restructuring and other items' cash flow. Considering these items, underlying free cash flow was over $430 million, putting [indiscernible] on track for greater than 1x adjusted cash conversion for the fiscal year. 
During the quarter, we also monetized our investment in C3.ai for $39 million, which is reflected in cash flow from investing activities. As a result, we ended the quarter with cash of $966 million and gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $2.2 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of our Worley ownership. Treating the Worley position as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.4x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. And finally, given the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% this year to $0.21 per share. 
And now let me turn it back over to slide -- Steve, for Slide 13."

So what we got here is a 5-year authorization that's going to provide our state and local clients significant certainty. And that's huge. And it's also significant for Jacobs because we've evaluated that over 95% of this [ $1 trillion, $550 billion ] of new money is totally aligned to our Jacobs offerings. And when you go through that, obviously, highways, bridges, rapid transit is going to be a significant growth. But when you look at some of the other components like Amtrak and Freight Rail, which is going to quadruple in funding; drinking water and wastewater, which is going to be up 2.5x; airports more than doubling; ports and waterways, where we're an industry leader, same thing. And then you then tack on to that things like Super Fund and Army Core Civil works, which are right up where we're the leader in the industry across that growing significantly, and that's pretty fast starting opportunities the way the money will flow. And then, of course, what you talked about, Michael, energy transition, resilience and a whole host of other things, $8 billion in hydrogen hubs, which we're right in the center of providing solutions.

I'm glad you asked it because the Focus 2023 is a far-reaching effort that's being executed across the entire company about transforming the way we work. So yes, real estate is certainly part of that, because we're changing the way we're utilizing our real estate footprint and changing the way we work relative to that. We talked about how we want to ensure that our footprint, becomes more about collaboration, team building, training and less about a place where you go and do heads down work. So clearly, it's part of that, but it's much more than that. 
And effectively, what we're doing is aligning, creating more discipline in terms of the management of our processes, which is going to facilitate our ability to automate, create integrated process designs, which will facilitate people to spend less time in what I will call the administering of our projects. That's a huge effort when we talk about our project teams around the world. So we think this unlocks talent and the time of that talent to really drive future innovation. 
Now relative to the double-digit numbers, what we said and certainly in '22, our plan is, is that the bulk of the savings, which we're working on finalizing right now, in 2022, will be reinvested back into the business by the next wave of potential opportunities that will allow us to deliver even incremental benefits in 2023 and beyond. So while it's a piece of the 2022 guide or at least preliminary double-digit number that we talked about, it's not a substantial piece of it because we're planning on reinvesting back into the business. We think our ability to continue to drive a company that is doing different type of work, becoming more digital and its ability to deliver work, all of that translates into a need to invest. And so consequently, a vast majority of the savings will be reinvested back into the business over the course of 2022."

The Department of Defense, for example, is shifting into a major focus on upgrading, modernizing and making all of their systems more intelligent, and we play a -- set a role there because of the capabilities that we bring and some of the proven abilities in the most recent projects. 
Bob talked about the space cycle, deep space exploration as well as space intelligence, and then we move over to even things like 5G networks, where that is growing significantly as we talked about in our -- during our remarks. But the Cyber and Intelligence business, the pipeline there is rising. I mean when you look at the capability that we created, going back to over the last 7 or 8 years with -- starting with FNS acquisition, Van Dyke, Blue Canopy and most recently, KeyW and Buffalo Group, the leadership there in Critical Mission Solutions are now have really put that together to expand our offerings and be directly in the center of all of the cyber and mission intelligence.

The first one has to do with the $267 million from last quarter that you had your expense for GAAP rules on the purchase consideration. It looks like net of some people retiring or quitting or whatever happened at PA, the net number here was [ $261 million ], like you called out in your press release. So there's a $6 million difference there. And I was wondering if that benefit showed up in which segment, is that in the PA segment? Was that in SG&A? And then was that excluded or benefit to adjusted EPS as a gain in the quarter? 
And then secondarily, I was noticing that there's $158 million of accounts receivable, which, as far as I can tell, is the best quarter you've ever had in taking down accounts receivable. So I was just wondering, Kevin, if you could talk about whether that's just timing related? Or do you think there's a structural element to what you did in the quarter on the very good account receivable performance?"

So the -- let me go the first one quickly. the accounting and the complexity associated with PA because of not only the equity pieces that we've been talking about but also the backing out and noncontrolling interest and all that kind of stuff. All of that, we did not take that benefit to our P&L, that $6 million that you're alluding to. But maybe we can follow up and Jon can provide you a little bit more detailed bridge on that. 
Second thing is, as it relates to -- on a blank. Accounts receivable, sorry. No, we -- look, I think that while certainly a number of $430 million of free cash flow in a particular quarter is indicative of something that is not necessarily sustainable every single quarter, and so there could be, what I would say, some timing associated with that dynamic. It has nothing to do, other than the good work that the teams are doing around the globe that we've been talking about for the last 2 or 3 years, and we've really started to see that come to fruition over the 2020 and 2021 years. So very proud of the teams. They're doing a good job. This is ultimately having something to do with some of the Focus 2023 work we're doing, where we're fine-tuning and aligning our processes, where people are being able to get invoices out faster and ultimately, more accurate invoices, which is facilitating our ability to collect sooner. 
So while there certainly is some timing associated with it, it's good old fashioned just doing good work, collecting sooner, and ultimately don't necessarily assume that, that happens every single quarter to the extent it did. But we think these kind of numbers will be sustainable going forward. And while there will be blips up and down, while we're continuing to work hard to improve on our efficiencies in total working capital."

We've immediately been able to bring them into the Tier 1 rank. And those same offerings at larger scale, we're getting penetration on. So that's been a big, big piece. 
Secondly, and we're seeing it in the numbers with regards to kind of the percentage of their bookings, and where those are coming from leading to P&L growth in the out quarters. Second big piece, and this was publicly announced and that we had it in the script, so on the Fuji job, as we look at how we can continue to deliver next-generation type services to go faster, quite frankly, PA is working with us on Fuji to automate our entire -- the -- our design approach.

So Look, let me mention a few things we haven't talked about yet with regard to the Q&A is we talk a lot about what's going on in the U.S. But outside of the U.S., our organic growth activity is clearly ramping up. We have a strong pipeline in the U.K. Similar drivers there with infrastructure, stimulus and focus on modernization, especially in the rail side and decarbonization and we're expanding into Europe with some new programs in the airport sector. And then when we move over to the Middle East, we're seeing a really good pipeline and organic opportunity in places like Saudi and across the region in high-speed rail and also on the defense side as well. And similar things going on in parts of APAC and Australia, New Zealand, solid pipeline in Australia, New Zealand, across transportation, also the power sector there and the whole sustainable solution. So I wanted to kind of start with that. 
When you take a step back and look at Jacobs' opportunity to grow organically, what we see is every things are in different phases. Clearly, what Bob talked about around electronics and life sciences, that's going to be a more rapid ramp up as we get into -- over the next several quarters because of what -- especially what's going on around semiconductors. When we talk about this U.S. infrastructure opportunity, a bulk of it is going to be programmatic funding. And so therefore -- formulaic funding, I should have said. And so therefore, some of our frameworks and the way the funding will flow will happen with more sort of ramping up and some of it even in the early parts of '22. But as we get into some of the newer initiatives that the government is focusing on around resilience and energy transition, and some of the other digital opportunities, some of that will take a few extra quarters for that funding to flow to the various agencies. 
And on the Critical Mission Solutions side, if you look back to our -- the way Jacobs has unfolded over the last several years, it tends to come in certain peaks. And we're building up this great pipeline. We're very optimistic around the things that we've talked about. And then the only question is, does it hit next quarter? Or does it hit a couple of quarters later? But when it comes, it's going to have a meaningful impact to our '22 and moving into '23 and beyond. So overall, we just continue to be very bullish on our ability to grow organically, before we even think about deploying capital to - on the M&A side."

Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to Slide 4. Before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strategy,",742,"All right. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to Slide 4. Before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strategy, which includes aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we're developing our new corporate strategy and just completed a midpoint review of our business and competitive landscape. We look forward to sharing our new strategy, along with updated, multiyear financial targets at our Investor Day later this year. 
Turning to our financial results. I'm pleased with our strong third quarter performance, with net revenues increasing 11% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 26%. Backlog ended the third quarter up 7% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis, and our backlog excludes our significant Idaho National Labs remediation win. Now that the award has cleared protest, when including Idaho, total Jacobs reported third quarter backlog would be up 11% and on a pro forma basis for Idaho, up 6%. 
Total PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 36% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins of 23%, making it one of the fastest-growing and most profitable consultancy firms. Given the strong year-to-date performance across all of Jacobs, including PA, we are again increasing our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook.
Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we believe we are entering an attractive growth period for Jacobs, driven by strong global trends and infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security and a potential super cycle and global supply chain investments, most notably in our semiconductor and life sciences. We are anticipating an increasing and robust sales pipeline for both fiscal year 2022 and 2023. We are aligning our strong culture, deep domain knowledge and investments in technology-enabled solutions to help solve our clients' challenges and to convert this pipeline into meaningful growth opportunities for our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 5. At Jacobs, our company's purpose is delivering solutions for a more connected, sustainable world. And our values are: We do things right. We challenge the accepted. We aim higher, and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. 
Building on our PlanBeyond 2.0 strategy, which we released externally last week, we have now launched an ESG-focused digital thought leadership publication, Reimagined Perspectives, to share with the world what our talented teams are thinking relative to high-priority challenges like climate change, and how they're creating and delivering innovative solutions in response. Living up to our brand promise begins with thought leadership by stimulating discussion, asking the hard questions and seeking new ways to meet challenges. The first publication is focused on resilience from a number of perspectives. And throughout today's presentation, you'll see examples of our people and our solutions in action. We encourage you to follow us on social media or visit our website to learn more. 
Turning to Slide 6. We are seeing an acceleration across our global customer base and communities to provide solutions for their net zero carbon commitments. For example, at one of the largest U.S. consumer goods companies, we are providing consulting services to help them drive carbon neutral facilities as part of their journey to net zero emissions, an effort that may result in rethinking their entire global supply chain. And for a transportation customer in the U.S., we're helping them leverage renewable energy sources for their rail operations to enhance electric grid reliability during critical times. 
And in the U.K., we're researching how airports of the future will accommodate hydrogen aircraft. And in Germany, we're supporting Shell's goal of becoming a net zero emissions company by planning for their new sustainable campus. And moving further east, we're supporting the development of a new solar photovoltaic power plant in Malaysia. In Australia, we've been awarded another wind energy project with a confidential customer. 
Altogether, sustainable solutions are a high-growth business for Jacobs, today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which makes Jacobs one of the largest ESG solutions providers. And now with PA Consulting, Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

During the third quarter, our CMS business continued its solid performance. Total CMS backlog is at $9.6 billion, representing 6% year-over-year growth. Backlog in the quarter was impacted by protests, but we expect these to clear in Q4, resulting in strong backlog growth. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. 
As discussed in prior quarters, we are pursuing sectors with strong, positive growth trends, including global energy transition, space-based ISR, intelligence analytics and 5G networks. I'd like to discuss several of those trends and recent related wins in greater detail, beginning with energy transition. 
Progressive leaders across the world are driving initiatives to cut off CO2 emissions through investment in clean energy solutions. And Jacobs has recently realigned its North American and European nuclear practices to better deliver our global life cycle nuclear capabilities. This includes Advanced Modular Reactors, or AMR, that can be used for electricity generation and for the -- and with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability. 
During the quarter, Jacobs was awarded the Idaho Cleanup Project at Idaho National Laboratory as the majority partner in the Idaho Environmental Coalition. The contract value is estimated at $3.9 billion over a 10-year period and recently cleared protest. Approximately $780 million will be included in Q4 backlog. Together with the DOE, we will use Jacobs' technology-driven solutions to reduce the environmental legacy of the Cold War while delivering social value by supporting high-quality jobs in the region and protecting the Snake River Aquifer, a critical element of Idaho's agricultural industry.
Moving on to space-based ISR. The U.S. military predicts that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, outthink and outmaneuver adversaries across the multiple domains: land, sea, air, cyber and increasingly, space. Low-orbiting surveillance satellites can collect and process data much quicker than air ISR, and advanced satellite centers are a critical component in the effectiveness of these military small sats. Jacobs won a 2-year contract from a classified client to perform demonstration of its active electronically scanned arrays, or AESA technology, similar to the technology utilized in our Mango satellite launch. A key differentiator for Jacobs in this area is the use of our commercial 5G technology in reducing the cost of space radar by up to 5x less than legacy space radar systems. This further advances Jacobs as an aerospace and defense prime, delivering value-added, commercial, space-based AESAs. 
Now turning to a related national security trend, intelligence analytics. Intelligence data often collected from multiple sources are analyzed with support from AI technologies and transformed into information that generates a picture and -- of adversary activity, ultimately informing and driving a commander's decision-making. Jacobs' recent Buffalo Group acquisition won 2 attractive awards during the quarter in support of the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, INSCOM. The 902nd Military Group, CI, human intelligence analytical services contract is a $234 million, 5-year award to provide advanced cyber and intelligence solutions for INSCOM's counterintelligence and counter-terrorism operations. This award is expected to clear protest and added to our backlog in Q4. Jacobs also won an annual extension of the U.S. Army's biometric and identity intelligence analytical support services contract. 
A final trend is the growth in 5G networks. Our telecom business had a strong quarter, in part from the accelerating rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, DIRECTV and T-Mobile as well as health systems and the U.S. Department of Defense. The increased demand is the result of clients seeking the benefits of 5G's higher bandwidth to operate in advanced environments for commercial and consumer applications, including telemedicine, augmented reality and next-generation gaming. And the DoD is also heavily in 5G technology in support of virtual mission planning and training. We're excited about the continued increase in opportunities, fueling growth in our telecom business. 
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 and beyond. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with an 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection and importantly, with an increasing margin profile. 
Now on Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We continue to demonstrate strong performance, driven by our strategy to focus on high-value sectors in key geographic regions, leveraging our strong, global, integrated delivery platform. Third quarter backlog was up 6%, resulting in greater than a 1x book-to-bill for both revenue and gross margin. The global trends of climate change, infrastructure monetization and digitalization as well as accelerated supply chain demands in areas driven by the pandemic, are catalyzing our clients' mid- and long-term investments. As demonstrated by our results, we remain well positioned to grow. These multiyear trends align strongly with our purpose to make the world more connected and sustainable. 
I'd now like to provide more insight into the effect these global trends are having on our business, starting with climate change. As a recognized leader in forward-leaning solutions, including specific ESG actions aligned to decarbonization and energy transition, we are very well positioned to convert our growing pipeline into tangible results. 
On the environmental front, we continue to win strategic work with our key clients as demonstrated by our recent win to support the U.S. Air Force and their mission to protect human health and local communities, with a focus on combating emergent contaminants, including PFAS. In addition to new wins, we were recently named by environment analysts as the #1 leader in water quality and resources. And our work on the Tyndall Air Force Base coastal resilience study in Florida was recognized as a global winner at the U.K. Environment Agency's 2021 flood and coast awards. 
Moving to infrastructure modernization. As part of our rapid uptick in our transit and rail portfolio, we are winning major projects around the globe, such as the East-West Rail program partner in the U.K., a major U.S. transit authority's metro rail platform reconstruction, and the KiwiRail modernization program in New Zealand. These important wins leverage our capability in digitally-enabled solutions. 
We are also developing digital solutions that apply to a wide cross-section of clients and sectors around the world, allowing us to use our global platform and client base to deploy solutions and creating new, recurring revenue streams. One such product is Kaleidoscope. Launched today, Kaleidoscope is a predictive analytics application, which supports clients in capital planning and match the true risks, cost and vulnerabilities of interconnected infrastructure systems. 
Our cross-sector domain knowledge gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing innovative solutions and create stronger growth opportunities. As an example, for the health care sector, we are creating one of the world's first digital twins to support operational decision-making based on predictive analytics and scenario forecasting. We are integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze historical health and location-based service data alongside real-time meteorological traffic and large public event data to optimize patient demand and capacity scenarios. This is a fantastic example of how Jacobs is partnering with our clients to reinvent health care of tomorrow. 
Shifting to our advanced facilities sector. We believe we are entering an unprecedented multiyear growth cycle. In our electronics sector, we are seeing a sharp rise in semiconductors in response to the global chip shortage, given long-term demand in cloud and edge computing, data storage and smart infrastructures such as electric grids. Multiple government initiatives have been launched with the goal of supporting semiconductor manufacturing in their respective countries. As a global leader in the space, we are well positioned for strong growth with our clients in the U.S., Europe and Asia. 
Additionally, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly utilizing contract manufacturing capacity as a means to supplement their own production. We have secured several large programs, including the recently announced FUJI Diosynth Biotechnologies New Greenville campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. 
We have also secured a major contract with NatureWorks to design a manufacturing facility in Thailand dedicated to producing biopolymers from sugar, resulting in products that are biodegradable and produced from sustainable resources. The design will be executed through our global delivery model, including talents from India and the Philippines. 
Finally, as it relates to pandemic-driven solutions, we have an exciting win that once again combines our world-leading domain expertise in water with our digital AI capabilities for a breakthrough project in the Middle East. We are performing program management services for the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy to deliver a wastewater laboratory that will screen and detect COVID-19 virus and other infectious diseases. 
Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 9. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to outperform expectations. New wins include recent revenue -- a recent large revenue synergy in the U.K. that has built excitement across our teams. Working together, PA and Jacobs won the new U.K. department of food and rural affairs (sic) [ Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ] management consultancy contract, a large-scale strategic advisory program for business transformation and delivery. Joint pursuits continue to be across other regions and geographies, and I look forward to sharing additional details in the coming quarters. 
As we look at specific growth areas, PA continues to support the U.K.'s government -- U.K. government's COVID response, with their efforts now focused on vaccine deployment and test and trace activities. On a related note, PA is also seeing growth projects, both in the consumer and life sciences sectors. As disruption from the pandemic changes business for good, we're seeing increased interest in digital and online products, experience and service models. Examples include a major retailer that is revolutionizing their online offer to create new customer experiences by moving from face-to-face to a subscription model. And in health and life sciences, virtualizing the clinical trials process for patients through telemedicine. 
On the digital solutions front, PA and Unilever teamed up to create a world-leading predictive tool, COVID-19 Awareness and Situational Intelligence, or CASI, which redefines how data can be harnessed to unlock predictive insight. The team combined their expertise in consumer goods, business intelligence, data analytics, AI, machine learning, operational resilience and global supply chains to create a live dashboard that monitors and provides real-time and predictive intelligence from a worldwide perspective. PA's product innovations for TeakOrigin and Guide Beauty were recognized by this year's prestigious iF DESIGN AWARDS. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results."

Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year, and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contributed to growth by more than offset",1334,"Thank you, Bob. Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year, and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contributed to growth by more than offsetting the previously disclosed burn-off of 2 lower-margin contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits.
For the fourth quarter, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up near double digits year-over-year and up slightly on a pro forma basis. This represents strong underlying growth, considering our fiscal fourth quarter of 202 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which will impact our 2021 fiscal fourth quarter reported growth rate by approximately 8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis.
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.6%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven by a few factors, a favorable revenue mix in both people and places and CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year, in line with our expectations to 17%.
GAAP operating profit was $264 million and was mainly impacted by $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $315 million, up 32%, with both CMS and people & places showing strong organic profit growth. In addition, PA posted strong growth in operating profit during the quarter versus their year ago figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. 
GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.82 per share and primarily included: $0.44 related to an updated, noncash valuation allocation between PA Consulting preferred and common shares, with no impact to the original consideration; $0.34 related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and an updated estimate of our annual adjusted effective tax rate; $0.24 of amortization of acquired intangibles; all of which were partly offset by $0.23 related to the positive mark-to-market investment in Worley and the impact of monetizing the remaining portion of our C3.ai investment. Excluding all items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.64, up 30% year-over-year. 
Included in the tax item noted earlier, third quarter adjusted EPS is impacted by 20% -- by a 20% effective tax rate that reflects a change in our estimated adjusted annual effective tax rate to 22.5% from 23.8%. This change in estimated tax rate resulted in an $0.08 per share tax benefit in our adjusted results during the third quarter. 
During the quarter, PA contributed $0.15 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.35 to $0.37 of 2021 PA accretion, up from $0.32 to $0.34 in our previous quarter. As a reminder, for modeling purposes, we fully consolidate the impact of the PA investment in our operating results, with a 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. 
Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $321 million and was up 26% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation also includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA. Excluding PA, adjusted EBITDA growth was up 9% year-over-year. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1x for Q3, with actually a little bit higher book-to-bill of 1.1 on a gross margin level. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 2% pro forma when the acquisition of the Buffalo Group is considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off 2 lower-margin contracts, which represented $190 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract runoff and FX benefits, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year impact from these 2 contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and our first quarter of fiscal 2022.
CMS operating profit was $108 million, up 21% and up 19% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating margin was up 150 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities. For the fourth quarter, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue, effectively offsetting the impact of the extra week of revenue last year. And we expect mid-single-digit operating profit growth as the timing of recent wins are now expected to ramp in fiscal year 2022. 
Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q3 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by a rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. While the Americas business saw near-term delays in larger projects, the positive developments regarding infrastructure stimulus over the last week is expected to result in customers beginning to leverage existing framework agreements as we enter 2022. We anticipate seeing awards associated with the stimulus beginning in our second half of next fiscal year. This developing momentum, when combined with the strength of our advanced facilities business noted earlier by Bob, positions us well into 2022. 
Total P&PS operating profit was up 8% year-over-year, including the benefit from FX. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.8% for the quarter, up 80 basis points year-over-year, driven mainly by a gross margin benefit from a more profitable revenue mix. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $256 million in revenue and $57 million in operating profit. PA's Q3 revenue grew 36% and 20% year-over-year in local currency. Q3 operating profit margin was 22%, in line with our expectations. 
Finally, our nonallocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and up year-over-year and in line with our expectations. The increase was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs, IT investments and other expenses. We expect non-allocated corporate costs to also trend slightly higher in Q4, given continued increased -- increases in the medical costs and other investments as we begin to position the company for the growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
As we turn to Slide 12, I would like to comment that our restructuring and other charges have significantly decreased. And as a result, we have not included a specific slide on this subject in this presentation. To comment quickly, during the quarter, we incurred only $2 million of total net charges for Focus 2023 as well as other restructuring and integration activities. As a result, both P&L and related cash outflows for these items remain in line with our outlook, and we are focused on significantly decreasing these adjustments going forward. 
During the third quarter, we generated $153 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again, showed strong improvement. It is important to note this cash flow included the $261 million of purchase price consideration for PA, treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter; and a net $19 million associated with Focus 2023 restructuring and other items' cash flow. Considering these items, underlying free cash flow was over $430 million, putting us on track for greater than 1x adjusted cash conversion for the fiscal year. During the quarter, we also monetized our investment in C3.ai for $39 million, which is reflected in cash flow from investing activities. 
As a result, we ended the quarter with cash of $966 million and gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $2.2 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of our Worley ownership. Treating the Worley position as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.4x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. And finally, given the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% this year to $0.21 per share. 
Now let me turn it back over to slide -- Steve, for Slide 13."

Our U.S. government relations team have done an outstanding job to help influence this outcome, which, of course, it's important for Jacobs, but it's highly important for the United States. 
So what we got here is a 5-year authorization that's going to provide our state and local clients significant certainty. And that's huge. And it's also significant for Jacobs because we've evaluated that over 95% of this trillion-dollar, $550 billion of new money is totally aligned to our Jacobs offerings. And when you go through that, obviously, highways, bridges, rapid transit is going to be a significant growth. But when you look at some of the other components, like Amtrak and freight rail, which is going to quadruple in funding; drinking water and wastewater, which is going to be up 2.5x; airports more than doubling; ports and waterways, where we're an industry leader, same thing. 
And then you then tack on to that things like Super Fund and Army Corps civil works, which are right up where we're the leader in the industry across that growing significantly. And that's pretty fast-starting opportunities the way the money will flow. 
And then, of course, what you talked about, Michael, energy transition, resilience and a whole host of other things. $8 billion in hydrogen hubs, which we're right in the center of providing solutions. So just a great, great opportunity for Jacobs moving forward."

I'm glad you asked it because the Focus 2023 is a far-reaching effort that's being executed across the entire company about transforming the way we work. So yes, real estate is certainly part of that, because we're changing the way we're utilizing our real estate footprint and changing the way we work relative to that. We talked about how we want to ensure that our footprint becomes more about collaboration, team building, training and less about a place where you go and do heads-down work. So clearly, it's part of that, but it's much more than that. 
And effectively, what we're doing is aligning, creating more discipline in terms of the management of our processes, which is going to facilitate our ability to automate, create integrated process designs, which will facilitate people to spend less time in what I will call the administering of our projects. That's a huge effort when we talk about our project teams around the world. So we think this unlocks talent and the time of that talent to really drive future innovation. 
Now relative to the double-digit numbers, what we said and certainly in '22 our plan is, is that the bulk of the savings, which we're working on finalizing right now, in 2022, will be reinvested back into the business by the next wave of potential opportunities that will allow us to deliver even incremental benefits in 2023 and beyond. So while it's a piece of the 2022 guide or at least preliminary double-digit number that we talked about, it's not a substantial piece of it because we're planning on reinvesting back into the business. 
We think our ability to continue to drive a company that is doing different type of work, becoming more digital in its ability to deliver work, all of that translates into a need to invest. And so consequently, a vast majority of the savings will be reinvested back into the business over the course of 2022."

The Department of Defense, for example, is shifting into a major focus on upgrading, modernizing and making all of their systems more intelligent. And we play a center role there as -- because of the capabilities that we bring and some of the proven abilities in the most recent projects. 
Bob talked about the space cycle, deep space exploration as well as space intelligence. And then we move over to even things like 5G networks, where that is growing significantly as we talked about in our -- during our remarks. But the cyber and intelligence business, the pipeline there is rising. I mean when you look at the capability that we created, going back to over the last 7 or 8 years with -- starting with FNS acquisition, Van Dyke, Blue Canopy and most recently, KeyW and Buffalo Group. The leadership there in Critical Mission Solutions are now have really put that together to expand our offerings and be directly in the center of all of the cyber and mission intelligence, the fact that now we're up to 12 of the 18 intelligence agencies that we're working for.

The first one has to do with the $267 million from last quarter that you had to expense per GAAP rules on the purchase consideration. Looks like net of some people retiring or quitting or whatever happened at PA, the net number here was $261 million, like you called out in your press release. So there's a $6 million difference there. And I was wondering if that benefit showed up in which segment. Is that in the PA segment? Was that in SG&A? And then was that excluded or benefit to adjusted EPS as a gain in the quarter? 
And then secondarily, I was noticing that there's $158 million of accounts receivable, which, as far as I can tell, is the best quarter you've ever had in taking down accounts receivable. So I was just wondering, Kevin, if you could talk about whether that's just timing related? Or do you think there's a structural element to what you did in the quarter on the very good account receivable performance?"

So the -- let me go the first one quickly. The accounting and the complexity associated with PA because of not only the equity pieces that we've been talking about but also the backing out and noncontrolling interest and all that kind of stuff, all of that, we did not take that benefit to our P&L, that $6 million that you're alluding to. But maybe we can follow up, and Jon can provide you a little bit more detailed bridge on that. 
Second thing is, as it relates to -- turning a blank. Accounts receivable, sorry. No, we -- look, I think that while certainly a number of $430 million of free cash flow in a particular quarter is indicative of something that is not necessarily sustainable every single quarter. And so there could be, what I would say, some timing associated with that dynamic. It has nothing to do, other than the good work that the teams are doing around the globe that we've been talking about for the last 2 or 3 years, and we've really started to see that come to fruition over the 2020 and 2021 years. So very proud of the teams. They're doing a good job. 
This is ultimately having something to do with some of the Focus 2023 work we're doing, where we're fine-tuning and aligning our processes. Where people are being able to get invoices out faster and ultimately, more accurate invoices, which is facilitating our ability to collect sooner.
So while there certainly is some timing associated with it, it's good old fashioned just doing good work, collecting sooner, and ultimately don't necessarily assume that, that happens every single quarter to the extent it did. But we think these kind of numbers will be sustainable going forward. And while there will be blips up and down, well, we're continuing to work hard to improve on our efficiencies in total working capital."

PA traditionally had relationships at the kind of Tier 2, Tier 3 life sciences clients in -- whether it be med tech and kind of product technology or looking at the digitization of a component of their business, such as clinical trials or other types of health information items, honed it in on a few Tier 2 or Tier 3. We've immediately been able to bring them into the Tier 1 rank. And those same offerings at larger scale, we're getting penetration on. So that's been a big, big piece. Secondly -- and we're seeing it in the numbers with regards to kind of the percentage of their bookings and where those are coming from, leading to P&L growth in the out quarters. 
Second big piece, and this was publicly announced and that we had it in the script. So on the FUJI job, as we look at how we can continue to deliver next-generation-type services to go faster, quite frankly, PA is working with us on FUJI to automate our entire -- the -- our design approach.

So look, let me mention a few things we haven't talked about yet with regard to the Q&A is we talk a lot about what's going on in the U.S. But outside of the U.S., our organic growth activity is clearly ramping up. We have a strong pipeline in the U.K. Similar drivers there with infrastructure, stimulus and focus on modernization, especially in the rail side and decarbonization. And we're expanding into Europe with some new programs in the airport sector. 
And then when we move over to the Middle East, we're seeing a really good pipeline and organic opportunity in places like Saudi and across the region in high-speed rail and also on the defense side as well. And similar things going on in parts of APAC and Australia, New Zealand. Solid pipeline in Australia, New Zealand across transportation, also the power sector there and the whole sustainable solution. So I wanted to kind of start with that. 
When you take a step back and look at Jacobs' opportunity to grow organically, what we see is every -- things are in different phases. Clearly, what Bob talked about around electronics and life sciences, that's going to be a more rapid ramp up as we get into -- over the next several quarters because of what -- especially what's going on around semiconductors. When we talk about this U.S. infrastructure opportunity, a bulk of it is going to be programmatic funding and so, therefore -- formulaic funding, I should have said. And so therefore, some of our frameworks and the way the funding will flow will happen with more sort of ramping up and some of it even in the early parts of '22. But as we get into some of the newer initiatives that the government is focusing on around resilience and energy transition and some of the other digital opportunities, some of that will take a few extra quarters for that funding to flow to the various agencies. 
And on the Critical Mission Solutions side, if you look back to our -- the way Jacobs has unfolded over the last several years, it tends to come in certain peaks. And we're building up this great pipeline. We're very optimistic around the things that we've talked about. And then the only question is, does it hit next quarter? Or does it hit a couple of quarters later? But when it comes, it's going to have a meaningful impact to our '22 and moving into '23 and beyond. So overall, we just continue to be very bullish on our ability to grow organically, before we even think about deploying capital to - on the M&A side."

Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to Slide 4. Before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strateg",738,"All right. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 4. Before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strategy, which includes aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we're developing our new corporate strategy and just completed a midpoint review of our business and competitive landscape. We look forward to sharing our new strategy, along with updated, multiyear financial targets at our Investor Day later this year. 
Turning to our financial results. I'm pleased with our strong third quarter performance, with net revenues increasing 11% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 26%. Backlog ended the third quarter up 7% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis, and our backlog excludes our significant Idaho National Labs remediation win. Now that the award has cleared protest, when including Idaho, total Jacobs reported third quarter backlog would be up 11% and on a pro forma basis for Idaho, up 6%. 
Total PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 36% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins of 23%, making it one of the fastest-growing and most profitable consultancy firms. Given the strong year-to-date performance across all of Jacobs, including PA, we are again increasing our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook.
Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we believe we are entering an attractive growth period for Jacobs, driven by strong global trends and infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security and a potential super cycle and global supply chain investments, most notably in our semiconductors and life sciences. We are anticipating an increasing and robust sales pipeline for both fiscal year 2022 and 2023. We are aligning our strong culture, deep domain knowledge and investments in technology-enabled solutions to help solve our clients' challenges and to convert this pipeline into meaningful growth opportunities for our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 5. At Jacobs, our company's purpose is delivering solutions for a more connected, sustainable world. And our values are: We do things right. We challenge the accepted. We aim higher, and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. 
Building on our PlanBeyond 2.0 strategy, which we released externally last week, we have now launched an ESG-focused digital thought leadership publication, Reimagined Perspectives, to share with the world what our talented teams are thinking relative to high-priority challenges like climate change and how they're creating and delivering innovative solutions in response. Living up to our brand promise begins with thought leadership by stimulating discussion, asking the hard questions and seeking new ways to meet challenges. The first publication is focused on resilience from a number of perspectives. And throughout today's presentation, you'll see examples of our people and our solutions in action. We encourage you to follow us on social media or visit our website to learn more. 
Turning to Slide 6. We are seeing an acceleration across our global customer base and communities to provide solutions for their net-zero carbon commitments. For example, at one of the largest U.S. consumer goods companies, we are providing consulting services to help them drive carbon-neutral facilities as part of their journey to net-zero emissions, an effort that may result in rethinking their entire global supply chain. And for a transportation customer in the U.S., we're helping them leverage renewable energy sources for their rail operations to enhance electric grid reliability during critical times. 
And in the U.K., we're researching how airports of the future will accommodate hydrogen aircraft. And in Germany, we're supporting Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions company by planning for their new sustainable campus. And moving further east, we're supporting the development of a new solar photovoltaic power plant in Malaysia. In Australia, we've been awarded another wind energy project with a confidential customer. 
Altogether, sustainable solutions are a high-growth business for Jacobs, today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which makes Jacobs one of the largest ESG solutions providers. And now with PA Consulting, Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

During the third quarter, our CMS business continued its solid performance. Total CMS backlog is at $9.6 billion, representing 6% year-over-year growth. Backlog in the quarter was impacted by protests, but we expect these to clear in Q4, resulting in strong backlog growth. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. 
As discussed in prior quarters, we are pursuing sectors with strong, positive growth trends, including global energy transition, space-based ISR, intelligence analytics and 5G networks. I'd like to discuss several of those trends and recent related wins in greater detail, beginning with energy transition. 
Progressive leaders across the world are driving initiatives to cut off CO2 emissions through investment in clean energy solutions. And Jacobs has recently realigned its North American and European nuclear practices to better deliver our global life cycle nuclear capabilities. This includes Advanced Modular Reactors, or AMRs, that can be used for electricity generation and for the -- and with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability. 
During the quarter, Jacobs was awarded the Idaho Cleanup Project at Idaho National Laboratory as the majority partner in the Idaho Environmental Coalition. The contract value is estimated at $3.9 billion over a 10-year period and recently cleared protest. Approximately $780 million will be included in Q4 backlog. Together with the DOE, we will use Jacobs' technology-driven solutions to reduce the environmental legacy of the Cold War while delivering social value by supporting high-quality jobs in the region and protecting the Snake River Aquifer, a critical element of Idaho's agricultural industry.
Moving on to space-based ISR. The U.S. military predicts that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, outthink and outmaneuver adversaries across the multiple domains: land, sea, air, cyber and increasingly, space. Low-orbiting surveillance satellites can collect and process data much quicker than air ISR, and advanced satellite centers are a critical component in the effectiveness of these military small sats. Jacobs won a 2-year contract from a classified client to perform demonstration of its active electronically scanned arrays, or AESA technology, similar to the technology utilized in our Mango satellite launch. A key differentiator for Jacobs in this area is the use of our commercial 5G technology in reducing the cost of space radar by up to 5x less than legacy space radar systems. This further advances Jacobs as an aerospace and defense prime, delivering value-added, commercial, space-based AESAs. 
Now turning to a related national security trend, intelligence analytics. Intelligence data often collected from multiple sources are analyzed with support from AI technologies and transformed into information that generates a picture and -- of adversary activity, ultimately informing and driving a commander's decision-making. Jacobs' recent Buffalo Group acquisition won 2 attractive awards during the quarter in support of the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, INSCOM. The 902nd Military Group, CI, human intelligence analytical services contract is a $234 million, 5-year award to provide advanced cyber and intelligence solutions for INSCOM's counterintelligence and counterterrorism operations. This award is expected to clear protest and added to our backlog in Q4. Jacobs also won an annual extension of the U.S. Army's biometric and identity intelligence analytical support services contract. 
A final trend is the growth in 5G networks. Our telecom business had a strong quarter, in part from the accelerating rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, DIRECTV and T-Mobile as well as health systems and the U.S. Department of Defense. The increased demand is the result of clients seeking the benefits of 5G's higher bandwidth to operate in advanced environments for commercial and consumer applications, including telemedicine, augmented reality and next-generation gaming. And the DoD is also heavily in 5G technology in support of virtual mission planning and training. We're excited about the continued increase in opportunities fueling growth in our telecom business. 
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 and beyond. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with an 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection and importantly, with an increasing margin profile. 
Now on Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We continue to demonstrate strong performance, driven by our strategy to focus on high-value sectors in key geographic regions, leveraging our strong, global, integrated delivery platform. Third quarter backlog was up 6%, resulting in greater than a 1x book-to-bill for both revenue and gross margin. The global trends of climate change, infrastructure monetization and digitalization as well as accelerated supply chain demands in areas driven by the pandemic, are catalyzing our clients' mid- and long-term investments. As demonstrated by our results, we remain well positioned to grow. These multiyear trends align strongly with our purpose to make the world more connected and sustainable. 
I'd now like to provide more insight into the effect these global trends are having on our business, starting with climate change. As a recognized leader in forward-leaning solutions, including specific ESG actions aligned to decarbonization and energy transition, we are very well positioned to convert our growing pipeline into tangible results. 
On the environmental front, we continue to win strategic work with our key clients as demonstrated by our recent win to support the U.S. Air Force and their mission to protect human health and local communities, with a focus on combating emergent contaminants, including PFAS. In addition to new wins, we were recently named by environment analysts as the #1 leader in water quality and resources. And our work on the Tyndall Air Force Base coastal resilience study in Florida was recognized as a global winner at the U.K. Environment Agency's 2021 flood and coast awards. 
Moving to infrastructure modernization. As part of our rapid uptick in our transit and rail portfolio, we are winning major projects around the globe, such as the East-West Rail program partner in the U.K., a major U.S. transit authority's metro rail platform reconstruction and the KiwiRail modernization program in New Zealand. These important wins leverage our capability in digitally enabled solutions. 
We are also developing digital solutions that apply to a wide cross-section of clients and sectors around the world, allowing us to use our global platform and client base to deploy solutions and creating new, recurring revenue streams. One such product is Kaleidoscope. Launched today, Kaleidoscope is a predictive analytics application, which supports clients in capital planning and match the true risks, cost and vulnerabilities of interconnected infrastructure systems. 
Our cross-sector domain knowledge gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing innovative solutions and create stronger growth opportunities. As an example, for the health care sector, we are creating one of the world's first digital twins to support operational decision-making based on predictive analytics and scenario forecasting. We are integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze historical health and location-based service data alongside real-time meteorological, traffic and large public event data to optimize patient demand and capacity scenarios. This is a fantastic example of how Jacobs is partnering with our clients to reinvent health care of tomorrow. 
Shifting to our advanced facilities sector. We believe we are entering an unprecedented multiyear growth cycle. In our electronics sector, we are seeing a sharp rise in semiconductors in response to the global chip shortage, given long-term demand in cloud and edge computing, data storage and smart infrastructures such as electric grids. Multiple government initiatives have been launched with the goal of supporting semiconductor manufacturing in their respective countries. As a global leader in the space, we are well positioned for strong growth with our clients in the U.S., Europe and Asia. 
Additionally, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly utilizing contract manufacturing capacity as a means to supplement their own production. We have secured several large programs, including the recently announced FUJI Diosynth Biotechnologies new Greenville campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. 
We have also secured a major contract with NatureWorks to design a manufacturing facility in Thailand dedicated to producing biopolymers from sugar, resulting in products that are biodegradable and produced from sustainable resources. The design will be executed through our global delivery model, including talents from India and the Philippines. 
Finally, as it relates to pandemic-driven solutions, we have an exciting win that once again combines our world-leading domain expertise in water with our digital AI capabilities for a breakthrough project in the Middle East. We are performing program management services for the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy to deliver a wastewater laboratory that will screen and detect COVID-19 virus and other infectious diseases. 
Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 9. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to outperform expectations. New wins include recent revenue -- a recent large revenue synergy in the U.K. that has built excitement across our teams. Working together, PA and Jacobs won the new U.K. department of food and rural affairs (sic) [ Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ] management consultancy contract, a large-scale strategic advisory program for business transformation and delivery. Joint pursuits continue to be across other regions and geographies, and I look forward to sharing additional details in the coming quarters. 
As we look at specific growth areas, PA continues to support the U.K.'s government -- U.K. government's COVID response, with their efforts now focused on vaccine deployment and test and trace activities. On a related note, PA is also seeing growth projects, both in the consumer and life sciences sectors. As disruption from the pandemic changes business for good, we're seeing increased interest in digital and online products, experience and service models. Examples include a major retailer that is revolutionizing their online offer to create new customer experiences by moving from face-to-face to a subscription model; and in health and life sciences, virtualizing the clinical trials process for patients through telemedicine. 
On the digital solutions front, PA and Unilever teamed up to create a world-leading predictive tool, COVID-19 Awareness and Situational Intelligence, or CASI, which redefines how data can be harnessed to unlock predictive insight. The team combined their expertise in consumer goods, business intelligence, data analytics, AI, machine learning, operational resilience and global supply chains to create a live dashboard that monitors and provides real-time and predictive intelligence from a worldwide perspective. PA's product innovations for TeakOrigin and Guide Beauty were recognized by this year's prestigious iF DESIGN AWARDS. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results."

Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year, and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contributed to growth by more than offset",1334,"Thank you, Bob. Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year, and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contributed to growth by more than offsetting the previously disclosed burn-off of 2 lower-margin contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits.
For the fourth quarter, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up near double digits year-over-year and up slightly on a pro forma basis. This represents strong underlying growth, considering our fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which will impact our 2021 fiscal fourth quarter reported growth rate by approximately 8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis.
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.6%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven by a few factors, a favorable revenue mix in both People & Places and CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year, in line with our expectations to 17%.
GAAP operating profit was $264 million and was mainly impacted by $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $315 million, up 32%, with both CMS and People & Places showing strong organic profit growth. In addition, PA posted strong growth in operating profit during the quarter versus their year ago figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. 
GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.82 per share and primarily included: $0.44 related to an updated, noncash valuation allocation between PA Consulting preferred and common shares, with no impact to the original consideration; $0.34 related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and an updated estimate of our annual adjusted effective tax rate; $0.24 of amortization of acquired intangibles; all of which were partly offset by $0.23 related to the positive mark-to-market investment in Worley and the impact of monetizing the remaining portion of our C3.ai investment. Excluding all items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.64, up 30% year-over-year. 
Included in the tax item noted earlier, third quarter adjusted EPS is impacted by 20% -- by a 20% effective tax rate that reflects a change in our estimated adjusted annual effective tax rate to 22.5% from 23.8%. This change in estimated tax rate resulted in an $0.08 per share tax benefit in our adjusted results during the third quarter. 
During the quarter, PA contributed $0.15 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.35 to $0.37 of 2021 PA accretion, up from $0.32 to $0.34 in our previous quarter. As a reminder, for modeling purposes, we fully consolidate the impact of the PA investment in our operating results, with a 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. 
Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $321 million and was up 26% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation also includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA. Excluding PA, adjusted EBITDA growth was up 9% year-over-year. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1x for Q3, with actually a little bit higher book-to-bill of 1.1 on a gross margin level. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 2% pro forma when the acquisition of the Buffalo Group is considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off 2 lower-margin contracts, which represented $190 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract runoff and FX benefits, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year impact from these 2 contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and our first quarter of fiscal 2022.
CMS operating profit was $108 million, up 21% and up 19% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating margin was up 150 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities. For the fourth quarter, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue, effectively offsetting the impact of the extra week of revenue last year. And we expect mid-single-digit operating profit growth as the timing of recent wins are now expected to ramp in fiscal year 2022. 
Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q3 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by a rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. While the Americas business saw near-term delays in larger projects, the positive developments regarding infrastructure stimulus over the last week is expected to result in customers beginning to leverage existing framework agreements as we enter 2022. We anticipate seeing awards associated with the stimulus beginning in our second half of next fiscal year. This developing momentum, when combined with the strength of our advanced facilities business noted earlier by Bob, positions us well into 2022. 
Total P&PS operating profit was up 8% year-over-year, including the benefit from FX. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.8% for the quarter, up 80 basis points year-over-year, driven mainly by a gross margin benefit from a more profitable revenue mix. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $256 million in revenue and $57 million in operating profit. PA's Q3 revenue grew 36% and 20% year-over-year in local currency. Q3 operating profit margin was 22%, in line with our expectations. 
Finally, our nonallocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and up year-over-year and in line with our expectations. The increase was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs, IT investments and other expenses. We expect non-allocated corporate costs to also trend slightly higher in Q4, given continued increased -- increases in the medical costs and other investments as we begin to position the company for the growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
As we turn to Slide 12, I would like to comment that our restructuring and other charges have significantly decreased. And as a result, we have not included a specific slide on this subject in this presentation. To comment quickly, during the quarter, we incurred only $2 million of total net charges for Focus 2023 as well as other restructuring and integration activities. As a result, both P&L and related cash outflows for these items remain in line with our outlook, and we are focused on significantly decreasing these adjustments going forward. 
During the third quarter, we generated $153 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again, showed strong improvement. It is important to note this cash flow included the $261 million of purchase price consideration for PA, treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter; and a net $19 million associated with Focus 2023 restructuring and other items' cash flow. Considering these items, underlying free cash flow was over $430 million, putting us on track for greater than 1x adjusted cash conversion for the fiscal year. During the quarter, we also monetized our investment in C3.ai for $39 million, which is reflected in cash flow from investing activities. 
As a result, we ended the quarter with cash of $966 million and gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $2.2 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of our Worley ownership. Treating the Worley position as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.4x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. And finally, given the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% this year to $0.21 per share. 
Now let me turn it back over to slide -- Steve, for Slide 13."

Our U.S. government relations team have done an outstanding job to help influence this outcome, which, of course, it's important for Jacobs, but it's highly important for the United States. 
So what we got here is a 5-year authorization that's going to provide our state and local clients significant certainty. And that's huge. And it's also significant for Jacobs because we've evaluated that over 95% of this trillion-dollar, $550 billion of new money is totally aligned to our Jacobs offerings. And when you go through that, obviously, highways, bridges, rapid transit is going to be a significant growth. But when you look at some of the other components, like Amtrak and freight rail, which is going to quadruple in funding; drinking water and wastewater, which is going to be up 2.5x; airports more than doubling; ports and waterways, where we're an industry leader, same thing. 
And then you then tack on to that things like superfund and Army Corps civil works, which are right up where we're the leader in the industry across that growing significantly. And that's pretty fast-starting opportunities the way the money will flow. 
And then, of course, what you talked about, Michael, energy transition resilience and a whole host of other things, $8 billion in hydrogen hubs, which we're right in the center of providing solutions. So just a great, great opportunity for Jacobs moving forward."

I'm glad you asked it because the Focus 2023 is a far-reaching effort that's being executed across the entire company about transforming the way we work. So yes, real estate is certainly part of that because we're changing the way we're utilizing our real estate footprint and changing the way we work relative to that. We talked about how we want to ensure that our footprint becomes more about collaboration, team building, training and less about a place where you go and do heads-down work. So clearly, it's part of that, but it's much more than that. 
And effectively, what we're doing is aligning, creating more discipline in terms of the management of our processes, which is going to facilitate our ability to automate, create integrated process designs, which will facilitate people to spend less time in what I will call the administering of our projects. That's a huge effort when we talk about our project teams around the world. So we think this unlocks talent and the time of that talent to really drive future innovation. 
Now relative to the double-digit numbers, what we said and certainly in '22, our plan is, is that the bulk of the savings, which we're working on finalizing right now, in 2022, will be reinvested back into the business by the next wave of potential opportunities that will allow us to deliver even incremental benefits in 2023 and beyond. So while it's a piece of the 2022 guide or at least preliminary double-digit number that we talked about, it's not a substantial piece of it because we're planning on reinvesting back into the business. 
We think our ability to continue to drive a company that is doing different type of work, becoming more digital in its ability to deliver work, all of that translates into a need to invest. And so consequently, a vast majority of the savings will be reinvested back into the business over the course of 2022."

The Department of Defense, for example, is shifting into a major focus on upgrading, modernizing and making all of their systems more intelligent. And we play a center role there as -- because of the capabilities that we bring and some of the proven abilities in the most recent projects. 
Bob talked about the space cycle, deep space exploration as well as space intelligence. And then we move over to even things like 5G networks, where that is growing significantly as we talked about in our -- during our remarks. But the cyber and intelligence business, the pipeline there is rising. I mean when you look at the capability that we created, going back to over the last 7 or 8 years with -- starting with FNS acquisition, Van Dyke, Blue Canopy and most recently, KeyW and Buffalo Group, the leadership there in Critical Mission Solutions are now have really put that together to expand our offerings and be directly in the center of all of the cyber and mission intelligence, the fact that now we're up to 12 of the 18 intelligence agencies that we're working for.

Looks like net of some people retiring or quitting or whatever happened at PA, the net number here was $261 million, like you called out in your press release. So there's a $6 million difference there. And I was wondering if that benefit showed up in which segment. Is that in the PA segment? Was that in SG&A? And then was that excluded or benefit to adjusted EPS as a gain in the quarter? 
And then secondarily, I was noticing that there's $158 million of accounts receivable, which, as far as I can tell, is the best quarter you've ever had in taking down accounts receivable. So I was just wondering, Kevin, if you could talk about whether that's just timing related? Or do you think there's a structural element to what you did in the quarter on the very good account receivable performance?"

So the -- let me go the first one quickly.

But maybe we can follow up, and Jon can provide you a little bit more detailed bridge on that. 
Second thing is, as it relates to -- [ on ] a blank. Accounts receivable, sorry. No, we -- look, I think that while certainly, a number of $430 million of free cash flow in a particular quarter is indicative of something that is not necessarily sustainable every single quarter. And so there could be, what I would say, some timing associated with that dynamic. It has nothing to do, other than the good work that the teams are doing around the globe that we've been talking about for the last 2 or 3 years, and we've really started to see that come to fruition over the 2020 and 2021 years. So very proud of the teams. They're doing a good job. 
This is ultimately having something to do with some of the Focus 2023 work we're doing, where we're fine-tuning and aligning our processes; where people are being able to get invoices out faster and ultimately, more accurate invoices, which is facilitating our ability to collect sooner.
So while there certainly is some timing associated with it, it's good old fashioned just doing good work, collecting sooner and ultimately, don't necessarily assume that that happens every single quarter to the extent it did. But we think these kind of numbers will be sustainable going forward. And while there will be blips up and down, well, we're continuing to work hard to improve on our efficiencies in total working capital."

PA traditionally had relationships at the kind of Tier 2, Tier 3 life sciences clients in -- whether it be med tech and kind of product technology or looking at the digitization of a component of their business, such as clinical trials or other types of health information items, honed it in on a few Tier 2 or Tier 3. We've immediately been able to bring them into the Tier 1 rank. And those same offerings at larger scale, we're getting penetration on. So that's been a big, big piece. Secondly -- and we're seeing it in the numbers with regards to kind of the percentage of their bookings and where those are coming from, leading to P&L growth in the out quarters. 
Second big piece, and this was publicly announced and that we had it in the script.

So look, let me mention a few things we haven't talked about yet with regard to the Q&A is we talk a lot about what's going on in the U.S. But outside of the U.S., our organic growth activity is clearly ramping up. We have a strong pipeline in the U.K. Similar drivers there with infrastructure, stimulus and focus on modernization, especially in the rail side and decarbonization. And we're expanding into Europe with some new programs in the airport sector. 
And then when we move over to the Middle East, we're seeing a really good pipeline and organic opportunity in places like Saudi and across the region in high-speed rail and also on the defense side as well. And similar things going on in parts of APAC and Australia, New Zealand. Solid pipeline in Australia and New Zealand across transportation, also the power sector there and the whole sustainable solution. So I wanted to kind of start with that. 
When you take a step back and look at Jacobs' opportunity to grow organically, what we see is every -- things are in different phases. Clearly, what Bob talked about around electronics and life sciences, that's going to be a more rapid ramp-up as we get into -- over the next several quarters because of what -- especially what's going on around semiconductors. When we talk about this U.S. infrastructure opportunity, a bulk of it is going to be programmatic funding and so, therefore -- formulaic funding, I should have said. And so therefore, some of our frameworks and the way the funding will flow will happen with more sort of ramping up and some of it even in the early parts of '22. But as we get into some of the newer initiatives that the government is focusing on around resilience and energy transition and some of the other digital opportunities, some of that will take a few extra quarters for that funding to flow to the various agencies. 
And on the Critical Mission Solutions side, if you look back to our -- the way Jacobs has unfolded over the last several years, it tends to come in certain peaks. And we're building up this great pipeline. We're very optimistic around the things that we've talked about. And then the only question is, does it hit next quarter? Or does it hit a couple of quarters later? But when it comes, it's going to have a meaningful impact to our '22 and moving into '23 and beyond. So overall, we just continue to be very bullish on our ability to grow organically before we even think about deploying capital to - on the M&A side."

Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. Turning to Slide 4. Before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strateg",738,"All right. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 4. Before reviewing our third quarter results, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to our current strategy, which includes aligning our portfolio toward large secular growth opportunities where we can deliver sustained double-digit profit growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we're developing our new corporate strategy and just completed a midpoint review of our business and competitive landscape. We look forward to sharing our new strategy, along with updated, multiyear financial targets at our Investor Day later this year. 
Turning to our financial results. I'm pleased with our strong third quarter performance, with net revenues increasing 11% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA growth of 26%. Backlog ended the third quarter up 7% year-over-year and up 3% on a pro forma basis, and our backlog excludes our significant Idaho National Labs remediation win. Now that the award has cleared protest, when including Idaho, total Jacobs reported third quarter backlog would be up 11% and on a pro forma basis for Idaho, up 6%. 
Total PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 36% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins of 23%, making it one of the fastest-growing and most profitable consultancy firms. Given the strong year-to-date performance across all of Jacobs, including PA, we are again increasing our full fiscal year 2021 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS outlook.
Looking beyond fiscal 2021, we believe we are entering an attractive growth period for Jacobs, driven by strong global trends and infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security and a potential super cycle and global supply chain investments, most notably in our semiconductors and life sciences. We are anticipating an increasing and robust sales pipeline for both fiscal year 2022 and 2023. We are aligning our strong culture, deep domain knowledge and investments in technology-enabled solutions to help solve our clients' challenges and to convert this pipeline into meaningful growth opportunities for our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 5. At Jacobs, our company's purpose is delivering solutions for a more connected, sustainable world. And our values are: We do things right. We challenge the accepted. We aim higher, and we live inclusion. This is critical for our people to work for a company that believes sustainability is fundamental to what we stand for as an organization. 
Building on our PlanBeyond 2.0 strategy, which we released externally last week, we have now launched an ESG-focused digital thought leadership publication, Reimagined Perspectives, to share with the world what our talented teams are thinking relative to high-priority challenges like climate change and how they're creating and delivering innovative solutions in response. Living up to our brand promise begins with thought leadership by stimulating discussion, asking the hard questions and seeking new ways to meet challenges. The first publication is focused on resilience from a number of perspectives. And throughout today's presentation, you'll see examples of our people and our solutions in action. We encourage you to follow us on social media or visit our website to learn more. 
Turning to Slide 6. We are seeing an acceleration across our global customer base and communities to provide solutions for their net-zero carbon commitments. For example, at one of the largest U.S. consumer goods companies, we are providing consulting services to help them drive carbon-neutral facilities as part of their journey to net-zero emissions, an effort that may result in rethinking their entire global supply chain. And for a transportation customer in the U.S., we're helping them leverage renewable energy sources for their rail operations to enhance electric grid reliability during critical times. 
And in the U.K., we're researching how airports of the future will accommodate hydrogen aircraft. And in Germany, we're supporting Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions company by planning for their new sustainable campus. And moving further east, we're supporting the development of a new solar photovoltaic power plant in Malaysia. In Australia, we've been awarded another wind energy project with a confidential customer. 
Altogether, sustainable solutions are a high-growth business for Jacobs, today comprising nearly $5 billion of our revenue, which makes Jacobs one of the largest ESG solutions providers. And now with PA Consulting, Jacobs is uniquely positioned across the entire end-to-end ESG opportunity. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

During the third quarter, our CMS business continued its solid performance. Total CMS backlog is at $9.6 billion, representing 6% year-over-year growth. Backlog in the quarter was impacted by protests, but we expect these to clear in Q4, resulting in strong backlog growth. Our CMS strategy is focused on creating resilient revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities that drive innovative outcomes. 
As discussed in prior quarters, we are pursuing sectors with strong, positive growth trends, including global energy transition, space-based ISR, intelligence analytics and 5G networks. I'd like to discuss several of those trends and recent related wins in greater detail, beginning with energy transition. 
Progressive leaders across the world are driving initiatives to cut off CO2 emissions through investment in clean energy solutions. And Jacobs has recently realigned its North American and European nuclear practices to better deliver our global life cycle nuclear capabilities. This includes Advanced Modular Reactors, or AMRs, that can be used for electricity generation and for the -- and with the global community to bring fusion power to commercial viability. 
During the quarter, Jacobs was awarded the Idaho Cleanup Project at Idaho National Laboratory as the majority partner in the Idaho Environmental Coalition. The contract value is estimated at $3.9 billion over a 10-year period and recently cleared protest. Approximately $780 million will be included in Q4 backlog. Together with the DOE, we will use Jacobs' technology-driven solutions to reduce the environmental legacy of the Cold War while delivering social value by supporting high-quality jobs in the region and protecting the Snake River Aquifer, a critical element of Idaho's agricultural industry.
Moving on to space-based ISR. The U.S. military predicts that future conflicts will be won by those with an information advantage, enabling the ability to outpace, outthink and outmaneuver adversaries across the multiple domains: land, sea, air, cyber and increasingly, space. Low-orbiting surveillance satellites can collect and process data much quicker than air ISR, and advanced satellite centers are a critical component in the effectiveness of these military small sats. Jacobs won a 2-year contract from a classified client to perform demonstration of its active electronically scanned arrays, or AESA technology, similar to the technology utilized in our Mango satellite launch. A key differentiator for Jacobs in this area is the use of our commercial 5G technology in reducing the cost of space radar by up to 5x less than legacy space radar systems. This further advances Jacobs as an aerospace and defense prime, delivering value-added, commercial, space-based AESAs. 
Now turning to a related national security trend, intelligence analytics. Intelligence data often collected from multiple sources are analyzed with support from AI technologies and transformed into information that generates a picture and -- of adversary activity, ultimately informing and driving a commander's decision-making. Jacobs' recent Buffalo Group acquisition won 2 attractive awards during the quarter in support of the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, INSCOM. The 902nd Military Group, CI, human intelligence analytical services contract is a $234 million, 5-year award to provide advanced cyber and intelligence solutions for INSCOM's counterintelligence and counterterrorism operations. This award is expected to clear protest and added to our backlog in Q4. Jacobs also won an annual extension of the U.S. Army's biometric and identity intelligence analytical support services contract. 
A final trend is the growth in 5G networks. Our telecom business had a strong quarter, in part from the accelerating rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, DIRECTV and T-Mobile as well as health systems and the U.S. Department of Defense. The increased demand is the result of clients seeking the benefits of 5G's higher bandwidth to operate in advanced environments for commercial and consumer applications, including telemedicine, augmented reality and next-generation gaming. And the DoD is also heavily in 5G technology in support of virtual mission planning and training. We're excited about the continued increase in opportunities fueling growth in our telecom business. 
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 and beyond. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with an 18-month qualified new business remaining above $30 billion, including $10 billion in source selection and importantly, with an increasing margin profile. 
Now on Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. We continue to demonstrate strong performance, driven by our strategy to focus on high-value sectors in key geographic regions, leveraging our strong, global, integrated delivery platform. Third quarter backlog was up 6%, resulting in greater than a 1x book-to-bill for both revenue and gross margin. The global trends of climate change, infrastructure monetization and digitalization as well as accelerated supply chain demands in areas driven by the pandemic, are catalyzing our clients' mid- and long-term investments. As demonstrated by our results, we remain well positioned to grow. These multiyear trends align strongly with our purpose to make the world more connected and sustainable. 
I'd now like to provide more insight into the effect these global trends are having on our business, starting with climate change. As a recognized leader in forward-leaning solutions, including specific ESG actions aligned to decarbonization and energy transition, we are very well positioned to convert our growing pipeline into tangible results. 
On the environmental front, we continue to win strategic work with our key clients as demonstrated by our recent win to support the U.S. Air Force and their mission to protect human health and local communities, with a focus on combating emergent contaminants, including PFAS. In addition to new wins, we were recently named by environment analysts as the #1 leader in water quality and resources. And our work on the Tyndall Air Force Base coastal resilience study in Florida was recognized as a global winner at the U.K. Environment Agency's 2021 flood and coast awards. 
Moving to infrastructure modernization. As part of our rapid uptick in our transit and rail portfolio, we are winning major projects around the globe, such as the East-West Rail program partner in the U.K., a major U.S. transit authority's metro rail platform reconstruction and the KiwiRail modernization program in New Zealand. These important wins leverage our capability in digitally enabled solutions. 
We are also developing digital solutions that apply to a wide cross-section of clients and sectors around the world, allowing us to use our global platform and client base to deploy solutions and creating new, recurring revenue streams. One such product is Kaleidoscope. Launched today, Kaleidoscope is a predictive analytics application, which supports clients in capital planning and match the true risks, cost and vulnerabilities of interconnected infrastructure systems. 
Our cross-sector domain knowledge gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing innovative solutions and create stronger growth opportunities. As an example, for the health care sector, we are creating one of the world's first digital twins to support operational decision-making based on predictive analytics and scenario forecasting. We are integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze historical health and location-based service data alongside real-time meteorological, traffic and large public event data to optimize patient demand and capacity scenarios. This is a fantastic example of how Jacobs is partnering with our clients to reinvent health care of tomorrow. 
Shifting to our advanced facilities sector. We believe we are entering an unprecedented multiyear growth cycle. In our electronics sector, we are seeing a sharp rise in semiconductors in response to the global chip shortage, given long-term demand in cloud and edge computing, data storage and smart infrastructures such as electric grids. Multiple government initiatives have been launched with the goal of supporting semiconductor manufacturing in their respective countries. As a global leader in the space, we are well positioned for strong growth with our clients in the U.S., Europe and Asia. 
Additionally, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly utilizing contract manufacturing capacity as a means to supplement their own production. We have secured several large programs, including the recently announced FUJI Diosynth Biotechnologies new Greenville campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. 
We have also secured a major contract with NatureWorks to design a manufacturing facility in Thailand dedicated to producing biopolymers from sugar, resulting in products that are biodegradable and produced from sustainable resources. The design will be executed through our global delivery model, including talents from India and the Philippines. 
Finally, as it relates to pandemic-driven solutions, we have an exciting win that once again combines our world-leading domain expertise in water with our digital AI capabilities for a breakthrough project in the Middle East. We are performing program management services for the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy to deliver a wastewater laboratory that will screen and detect COVID-19 virus and other infectious diseases. 
Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 9. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to outperform expectations. New wins include recent revenue -- a recent large revenue synergy in the U.K. that has built excitement across our teams. Working together, PA and Jacobs won the new U.K. department of food and rural affairs (sic) [ Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ] management consultancy contract, a large-scale strategic advisory program for business transformation and delivery. Joint pursuits continue to be across other regions and geographies, and I look forward to sharing additional details in the coming quarters. 
As we look at specific growth areas, PA continues to support the U.K.'s government -- U.K. government's COVID response, with their efforts now focused on vaccine deployment and test and trace activities. On a related note, PA is also seeing growth projects, both in the consumer and life sciences sectors. As disruption from the pandemic changes business for good, we're seeing increased interest in digital and online products, experience and service models. Examples include a major retailer that is revolutionizing their online offer to create new customer experiences by moving from face-to-face to a subscription model; and in health and life sciences, virtualizing the clinical trials process for patients through telemedicine. 
On the digital solutions front, PA and Unilever teamed up to create a world-leading predictive tool, COVID-19 Awareness and Situational Intelligence, or CASI, which redefines how data can be harnessed to unlock predictive insight. The team combined their expertise in consumer goods, business intelligence, data analytics, AI, machine learning, operational resilience and global supply chains to create a live dashboard that monitors and provides real-time and predictive intelligence from a worldwide perspective. PA's product innovations for TeakOrigin and Guide Beauty were recognized by this year's prestigious iF DESIGN AWARDS. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financial results."

Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year, and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contributed to growth by more than offset",1334,"Thank you, Bob. Turning to Slide 10 now for a quick financial overview. Third quarter gross revenue increased 10% year-over-year, and net revenue was up 11%. In line with last quarter, acquisitions and FX benefits contributed to growth by more than offsetting the previously disclosed burn-off of 2 lower-margin contracts in CMS. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions, net revenue was up low single digits.
For the fourth quarter, we expect total reported net revenue growth to be up near double digits year-over-year and up slightly on a pro forma basis. This represents strong underlying growth, considering our fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which will impact our 2021 fiscal fourth quarter reported growth rate by approximately 8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis.
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.6%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. The higher gross margin on a year-over-year basis was driven by a few factors, a favorable revenue mix in both People & Places and CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year, in line with our expectations to 17%.
GAAP operating profit was $264 million and was mainly impacted by $50 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $315 million, up 32%, with both CMS and People & Places showing strong organic profit growth. In addition, PA posted strong growth in operating profit during the quarter versus their year ago figure. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. 
GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.82 per share and primarily included: $0.44 related to an updated, noncash valuation allocation between PA Consulting preferred and common shares, with no impact to the original consideration; $0.34 related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and an updated estimate of our annual adjusted effective tax rate; $0.24 of amortization of acquired intangibles; all of which were partly offset by $0.23 related to the positive mark-to-market investment in Worley and the impact of monetizing the remaining portion of our C3.ai investment. Excluding all items, third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.64, up 30% year-over-year. 
Included in the tax item noted earlier, third quarter adjusted EPS is impacted by 20% -- by a 20% effective tax rate that reflects a change in our estimated adjusted annual effective tax rate to 22.5% from 23.8%. This change in estimated tax rate resulted in an $0.08 per share tax benefit in our adjusted results during the third quarter. 
During the quarter, PA contributed $0.15 of accretion, net of incremental interest. We now expect $0.35 to $0.37 of 2021 PA accretion, up from $0.32 to $0.34 in our previous quarter. As a reminder, for modeling purposes, we fully consolidate the impact of the PA investment in our operating results, with a 35% minority interest backed out in noncontrolling interest. 
Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $321 million and was up 26% year-over-year, representing 10.8% of net revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA calculation also includes the burden of the 35% minority interest impact from PA. Excluding PA, adjusted EBITDA growth was up 9% year-over-year. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our pro forma book-to-bill ratio was 1x for Q3, with actually a little bit higher book-to-bill of 1.1 on a gross margin level. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 11. Starting with CMS, revenue was up 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 2% pro forma when the acquisition of the Buffalo Group is considered. As previously communicated, we are transitioning off 2 lower-margin contracts, which represented $190 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract runoff and FX benefits, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. We expect approximately $200 million a quarter of year-over-year impact from these 2 contract roll-offs through the balance of this year and our first quarter of fiscal 2022.
CMS operating profit was $108 million, up 21% and up 19% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Operating margin was up 150 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%. The improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities. For the fourth quarter, we expect relatively flat CMS reported revenue, effectively offsetting the impact of the extra week of revenue last year. And we expect mid-single-digit operating profit growth as the timing of recent wins are now expected to ramp in fiscal year 2022. 
Moving to People & Places Solutions. Q3 net revenue was up 1.4% year-over-year, driven by a rebound in our international regions as well as benefits from FX. While the Americas business saw near-term delays in larger projects, the positive developments regarding infrastructure stimulus over the last week is expected to result in customers beginning to leverage existing framework agreements as we enter 2022. We anticipate seeing awards associated with the stimulus beginning in our second half of next fiscal year. This developing momentum, when combined with the strength of our advanced facilities business noted earlier by Bob, positions us well into 2022. 
Total P&PS operating profit was up 8% year-over-year, including the benefit from FX. Operating profit as a percentage of net revenue was 13.8% for the quarter, up 80 basis points year-over-year, driven mainly by a gross margin benefit from a more profitable revenue mix. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $256 million in revenue and $57 million in operating profit. PA's Q3 revenue grew 36% and 20% year-over-year in local currency. Q3 operating profit margin was 22%, in line with our expectations. 
Finally, our nonallocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and up year-over-year and in line with our expectations. The increase was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs, IT investments and other expenses. We expect non-allocated corporate costs to also trend slightly higher in Q4, given continued increased -- increases in the medical costs and other investments as we begin to position the company for the growth momentum that is expected in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
As we turn to Slide 12, I would like to comment that our restructuring and other charges have significantly decreased. And as a result, we have not included a specific slide on this subject in this presentation. To comment quickly, during the quarter, we incurred only $2 million of total net charges for Focus 2023 as well as other restructuring and integration activities. As a result, both P&L and related cash outflows for these items remain in line with our outlook, and we are focused on significantly decreasing these adjustments going forward. 
During the third quarter, we generated $153 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again, showed strong improvement. It is important to note this cash flow included the $261 million of purchase price consideration for PA, treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter; and a net $19 million associated with Focus 2023 restructuring and other items' cash flow. Considering these items, underlying free cash flow was over $430 million, putting us on track for greater than 1x adjusted cash conversion for the fiscal year. During the quarter, we also monetized our investment in C3.ai for $39 million, which is reflected in cash flow from investing activities. 
As a result, we ended the quarter with cash of $966 million and gross debt of $3.1 billion, resulting in $2.2 billion of net debt before attributing the benefit of our Worley ownership. Treating the Worley position as cash, our pro forma net debt to expected adjusted 2021 EBITDA is approximately 1.4x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. And finally, given the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% this year to $0.21 per share. 
Now let me turn it back over to slide -- Steve, for Slide 13."

So what we got here is a 5-year authorization that's going to provide our state and local clients significant certainty. And that's huge. And it's also significant for Jacobs because we've evaluated that over 95% of this trillion-dollar, $550 billion of new money is totally aligned to our Jacobs offerings. And when you go through that, obviously, highways, bridges, rapid transit is going to be a significant growth. But when you look at some of the other components, like Amtrak and freight rail, which is going to quadruple in funding; drinking water and wastewater, which is going to be up 2.5x; airports more than doubling; ports and waterways, where we're an industry leader, same thing. 
And then you then tack on to that things like superfund and Army Corps civil works, which are right up where we're the leader in the industry across that growing significantly. And that's pretty fast-starting opportunities the way the money will flow. 
And then, of course, what you talked about, Michael, energy transition resilience and a whole host of other things, $8 billion in hydrogen hubs, which we're right in the center of providing solutions. So just a great, great opportunity for Jacobs moving forward."

I'm glad you asked it because the Focus 2023 is a far-reaching effort that's being executed across the entire company about transforming the way we work. So yes, real estate is certainly part of that because we're changing the way we're utilizing our real estate footprint and changing the way we work relative to that. We talked about how we want to ensure that our footprint becomes more about collaboration, team building, training and less about a place where you go and do heads-down work. So clearly, it's part of that, but it's much more than that. 
And effectively, what we're doing is aligning, creating more discipline in terms of the management of our processes, which is going to facilitate our ability to automate, create integrated process designs, which will facilitate people to spend less time in what I will call the administering of our projects. That's a huge effort when we talk about our project teams around the world. So we think this unlocks talent and the time of that talent to really drive future innovation. 
Now relative to the double-digit numbers, what we said and certainly in '22, our plan is, is that the bulk of the savings, which we're working on finalizing right now, in 2022, will be reinvested back into the business by the next wave of potential opportunities that will allow us to deliver even incremental benefits in 2023 and beyond. So while it's a piece of the 2022 guide or at least preliminary double-digit number that we talked about, it's not a substantial piece of it because we're planning on reinvesting back into the business. 
We think our ability to continue to drive a company that is doing different type of work, becoming more digital in its ability to deliver work, all of that translates into a need to invest. And so consequently, a vast majority of the savings will be reinvested back into the business over the course of 2022."

The Department of Defense, for example, is shifting into a major focus on upgrading, modernizing and making all of their systems more intelligent. And we play a center role there as -- because of the capabilities that we bring and some of the proven abilities in the most recent projects. 
Bob talked about the space cycle, deep space exploration as well as space intelligence. And then we move over to even things like 5G networks, where that is growing significantly as we talked about in our -- during our remarks. But the cyber and intelligence business, the pipeline there is rising. I mean when you look at the capability that we created, going back to over the last 7 or 8 years with -- starting with FNS acquisition, Van Dyke, Blue Canopy and most recently, KeyW and Buffalo Group, the leadership there in Critical Mission Solutions are now have really put that together to expand our offerings and be directly in the center of all of the cyber and mission intelligence, the fact that now we're up to 12 of the 18 intelligence agencies that we're working for.

Looks like net of some people retiring or quitting or whatever happened at PA, the net number here was $261 million, like you called out in your press release. So there's a $6 million difference there. And I was wondering if that benefit showed up in which segment. Is that in the PA segment? Was that in SG&A? And then was that excluded or benefit to adjusted EPS as a gain in the quarter? 
And then secondarily, I was noticing that there's $158 million of accounts receivable, which, as far as I can tell, is the best quarter you've ever had in taking down accounts receivable. So I was just wondering, Kevin, if you could talk about whether that's just timing related? Or do you think there's a structural element to what you did in the quarter on the very good account receivable performance?"

So the -- let me go the first one quickly.

But maybe we can follow up, and Jon can provide you a little bit more detailed bridge on that. 
Second thing is, as it relates to -- [ on ] a blank. Accounts receivable, sorry. No, we -- look, I think that while certainly, a number of $430 million of free cash flow in a particular quarter is indicative of something that is not necessarily sustainable every single quarter. And so there could be, what I would say, some timing associated with that dynamic. It has nothing to do, other than the good work that the teams are doing around the globe that we've been talking about for the last 2 or 3 years, and we've really started to see that come to fruition over the 2020 and 2021 years. So very proud of the teams. They're doing a good job. 
This is ultimately having something to do with some of the Focus 2023 work we're doing, where we're fine-tuning and aligning our processes; where people are being able to get invoices out faster and ultimately, more accurate invoices, which is facilitating our ability to collect sooner.
So while there certainly is some timing associated with it, it's good old fashioned just doing good work, collecting sooner and ultimately, don't necessarily assume that that happens every single quarter to the extent it did. But we think these kind of numbers will be sustainable going forward. And while there will be blips up and down, well, we're continuing to work hard to improve on our efficiencies in total working capital."

PA traditionally had relationships at the kind of Tier 2, Tier 3 life sciences clients in -- whether it be med tech and kind of product technology or looking at the digitization of a component of their business, such as clinical trials or other types of health information items, honed it in on a few Tier 2 or Tier 3. We've immediately been able to bring them into the Tier 1 rank. And those same offerings at larger scale, we're getting penetration on. So that's been a big, big piece. Secondly -- and we're seeing it in the numbers with regards to kind of the percentage of their bookings and where those are coming from, leading to P&L growth in the out quarters. 
Second big piece, and this was publicly announced and that we had it in the script.

Clearly, what Bob talked about around electronics and life sciences, that's going to be a more rapid ramp-up as we get into -- over the next several quarters because of what -- especially what's going on around semiconductors. When we talk about this U.S. infrastructure opportunity, a bulk of it is going to be programmatic funding and so, therefore -- formulaic funding, I should have said. And so therefore, some of our frameworks and the way the funding will flow will happen with more sort of ramping up and some of it even in the early parts of '22. But as we get into some of the newer initiatives that the government is focusing on around resilience and energy transition and some of the other digital opportunities, some of that will take a few extra quarters for that funding to flow to the various agencies. 
And on the Critical Mission Solutions side, if you look back to our -- the way Jacobs has unfolded over the last several years, it tends to come in certain peaks. And we're building up this great pipeline. We're very optimistic around the things that we've talked about. And then the only question is, does it hit next quarter? Or does it hit a couple of quarters later? But when it comes, it's going to have a meaningful impact to our '22 and moving into '23 and beyond. So overall, we just continue to be very bullish on our ability to grow organically before we even think about deploying capital to - on the M&A side."

Turning to Slide 4. Before I review our results, I'd like to share that we're in the final stages of completing our new strategy.",704,"Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 4. Before I review our results, I'd like to share that we're in the final stages of completing our new strategy. We will be hosting an investor event on the week of March 7 for a deep dive of the next phase of our Jacobs transformation. 
Three key initiatives have emerged. First, we're putting in place a purpose-driven road map rooted in our values and strong culture to maximize our next stage of growth. Secondly, we identified and have aligned investment resources to capture three multi-decade growth opportunities: Global infrastructure modernization, climate response and the digitization of industry. And third, we're taking a transformational approach to executing against these opportunities as we are unlocking the innovation engine at Jacobs, expanding our technology ecosystem while accelerating our trajectory of profitable growth are cash flow generation. We look forward to illuminating this strategy at our upcoming investor event. 
Now turning to our financial results. I'm pleased with our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year performance with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12% during the quarter and 18% for the full year. Backlog ended the fourth quarter up 12% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis. 
PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 41% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth while maintaining adjusted operating profit margins of 24%. For the full year, PA revenues surpassed $1 billion, far exceeding our deal investment model. 
As we look at overall Jacobs growth going forward, we now have certainty surrounding the unprecedented U.S. infrastructure funding with the passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act last week. And more broadly, global infrastructure modernization and national security needs are accelerating as our government and commercial clients address the challenges of climate change, advancement of the digitization strategies and increasing cyber threats. On top of that, our advanced facilities business is expected to show significant growth driven by the need for additional semiconductor manufacturing capacity and post pandemic life sciences priorities. Given these strong growth dynamics, we're introducing fiscal 2022 guidance for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Looking beyond 2022, we expect our strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2025. 
Turning to Slide 5. As we reflect on climate change, it is globally accepted that humanity is at a critical juncture in our efforts to limit global warming. Jacobs and PA participated at the recent UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, COP26 in Glasgow to demonstrate our commitment to reinvent tomorrow with immediate and sustained action in the transition to a net zero economy. We stood alongside other business, financial and government leaders as well as activists and students to make sure our voice was heard. We engaged in activities to accelerate solutions to ensure the world stays on track to meet the critical 1.5-degree Celsius trajectory while preparing to adapt to the changes already locked in from climate change. 
As we move to Slide 6, given the nature of our business, it's clear that Jacobs greatest opportunity to positively address climate change comes from the sustainable and resilient solutions that we co-create and deliver a partnership with our clients. To spearhead this effort, we have established a new office of global climate response in ESG to ensure that sustainability is woven into all of our solutions across markets and geographies. We are accelerating our established partnerships with the public and private sector to advance net zero carbon outcomes, climate resilience natural and social capital as well as ESG business transformation in alignment with the United Nations' sustainable development goals. 
Annually, we generate approximately $5 billion of ESG-related revenue and expect to grow significantly over the next several years, driven by strong capability and energy transition, decarbonization, climate adaptation and natural resource stewardship. 
Our culture is a competitive differentiator. Our people have the knowledge, curiosity and the trust of our clients to achieve our purpose to create a more connected, sustainable world. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

During the fourth quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance. Total CMS backlog increased 16% year-over-year, 7% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion, driven by a strategic new wins in cyber and intel and nuclear and remediation. 
Our CMS strategy is focused on creating recurring revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth include cyber, commercial space and 5G technology for national security. 
Beginning with Cyber Intelligence, we are seeing several major emerging threats to national security. First, cyber attacks on mission-critical infrastructure, which are even more stealth and as disruptive as a traditional attack. Second, the speed and complexity of near-peer threats, which requires real-time coordination between space and other domains as the severity of nation state-sponsored attacks continues to increase. And third, the adoption of data-intensive AI-based applications are dramatically increasing the need for real-time data security and integrity. 
The funding for addressing these threats are partially reflected in the unclassified federal government spending on cyber in FY '22, which is expected to be over $20 billion, up 10% from prior year. Additionally, we expect the spending within classified budgets to be up higher. 
During the quarter, we were awarded a $300 million 7-year contract with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency to modernize the NGA's ability to rapidly gain and share insights from cross-domain inventory, including top secret data classification. And within the classified budget, we were awarded a $170 million 5-year new contract to develop highly secure and hardened software applications that are leveraging the latest advances in AI and machine learning. 
We recently closed the BlackLynx acquisition, which provides software-enabled solutions for automating the collection of data at the edge and quickly gaining insights into extremely large structured and unstructured data. Our strong presence across the DoD and intelligence community as well as our digital enablement center will provide the escape velocity for BlackLynx to commercialize and scale their solutions, resulting in highly profitable recurring revenue. 
We also recently announced the strategic investment and distribution agreement with Hawkeye 360, which will enhance our digital intelligence suite of technologies with their RF spectrum analytics and collection automation offering. 
Moving on to space. With the significant amount of capital being infused into the commercial space companies, the affordability of space tourism is becoming a reality as well as other emerging opportunities, such as acceleration of satellite-based technologies and the need to understand the impact of space debris. Today, we support commercial space companies with manufacturing process optimization, system and subsystem prototype work and test facility studies and projects. As commercial space matures, we are positioning our solutions for these emerging opportunity. 
During the quarter, we were notified of a significant increase to the ceiling of our contract in Marshall Space Flight Center that also supports ARTEMIS and SLS. The U.S. space force selected Jacobs for a 5-year contract to provide software and system support for its Patriot Excalibur system, which coordinates the scheduling, training and status of U.S. space force 
aircraft. Finally, our telecom business business has had a strong quarter 
and we see the rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, Verizon, DIRECTV, T-Mobile and DISH Network accelerating in 2022 and beyond. In addition, the new bipartisan infrastructure bill includes $2.5 billion for 5G rollout at U.S. military bases, and the DoD is investing heavily in 5G technology in support of national priorities. 
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in 2022. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business opportunities remaining above $30 billion, which includes $10 billion 
in-source selection with an increasing margin profile. Now on to Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business. 
We finished the year with strong financial performance with a year-over-year 
backlog growth of 7% and annual net revenue growth.
I'll discuss our results across the major theme of climate response pandemic solutions, infrastructure 
modernization and digitalization. Starting with Climate response. As the top-ranked global environmental consulting firm, Jacobs is leading the efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate emergency, advanced transition to a clean energy net zero economy and rapidly respond to natural disasters. This quarter, Jacobs was awarded a multiyear contract by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center to integrate nature-based solutions that grow climate resilience across defense department facilities. 
Jacobs has recently been selected to reimagine New York's Rikers Island, taking the site through a full community revitalization with an equitable, resilient multiuse approach, incorporating our innovative social value analysis. As the first phase in a 20-year program across the entire city, Jacobs plan will consolidate four aging wastewater facilities into a state-of-the-art 1 billion-gallon per day water resource recovery facility that includes a renewable energy hub. 
In the transportation market, our specialists have pioneered advanced charging technology that enables clients to transition to decarbonize its operation, a key focus of economic stimulus packages. Our transportation team continues to win contracts that support clients with asset operational and technology shifts towards green fleets. For example, we recently won and commenced a hydrogen rail facility study with Caltrans. And our long-term work with Brisbane Metro continues to showcase cutting-edge green transit solutions. 
With exponential growth forecasted in the electric vehicle market, Jacobs has become the go-to firm to support 
leading EV battery and vehicle manufacturing companies globally. We've doubled our EV book of business in the past year and our forecast for continued growth. 
We also announced a strategic partnership and investment in Microgrid Labs, a provider of commercial fleet electrification and infrastructure solutions, including their proprietary 
SaaS platform. The green economy transition is driving increased investments in hydrogen and renewables, and our team is delivering diverse solutions for a range of clients from our participation in the [ Bakken Energy Hub ] consortium in the U.K. to energy transmission plans for a potential offshore wind development in the U.S. and additional contracts with [ EVRA's ] renewables Abilene solar farm and the Swan Bank waste-to-energy facility in Australia. 
Moving on to the theme of pandemic response. With ongoing impact to the supply chain, health systems and semiconductor chip shortage, Jacobs is gaining momentum with multiyear biopharma, such as the next phase of a new $2 billion biotechnology facility. Jacobs has successfully 
won several health opportunities in the U.S., Europe and Australia as they rethink pandemic response operations. 
The most significant aspect of the global supply chain disruption involves semiconductor shortages. The world's leading technical services provider to the semiconductor industry, we are poised for significant growth in the electronics sector this year and expect our electronics business to further accelerate over the next several years. In fact, Jacobs is engineering several major investments for large chip manufacturers. Projects like Intel's New Arizona fab, which Jacobs is designing -- are scheduled to be fully operational in 2024. The new fab will manufacture Intel's most advanced process technologies and represents the largest private investment in Arizona's history. 
Interconnected with climate, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digital transformation are leading to long-term transformative growth with significant wins across all markets. Globally, we are continuing to win pioneering transportation projects across all sectors and modes. In highways, we were recently selected for transport for New South, along with consortium partners, to undertake the $1.2 billion wearing of freeway upgrade project to accommodate a third road, crossing Sydney Harbor. 
In Fortune Maritime, we won the sustainable ports design and program management for King Abu -- port in Daman, Saudi Arabia. And in Air Transportation, we were selected as the integrated program manager for the Solidarity Transport Hub in Poland, a greenfield field airport in multimodal, including a high-speed rail network, with an initial planned capacity of 45 million passengers. The program is of national significance. It will become the benchmark for zero carbon delivery and be a sustainable transportation platform for Eastern Europe's future travel demands. 
Our long-standing relationships in existing framework agreements supported major wins with U.S. state departments of transportation and transport for London, emphasizing our market-leading position for solving our clients' most complex transportation challenges. 
In summary, we see continued investment across the P&PS client sectors. We are already experiencing exciting global wins in the first quarter of our new fiscal year, indicating that we are well positioned to develop and deliver unmatched value and capability to our clients as investment momentum builds from the U.S. Infrastructure Act and other economic stimulus. 
Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 9. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to exceed expectations. Supported by an extension of consultative service to U.K.'s National Health Service, PA's efforts have extended into longer-term vaccine deployment, test and trace and future pandemic preparedness planning. Additionally, PA growth is being accentuated by recent digital solution wins for confidential U.S. biopharmaceutical clients in the areas of cell and gene therapy and next-generation patient care model. We continue to progress our synergy growth and long-term collaboration. 
The Jacobs PA team were recently awarded a biotechnology manufacturing plant expansion to provide an end-to-end life cycle solution incorporating critical digitized, clinical trial information into the process design and facility layout. Additionally, we continue to receive joint strategic consultancy awards in the transportation sector globally. I look forward to our continued success with collaborative and integrated offerings to our customers. 
At COP26, PA displayed its deep ESG expertise and successfully unveiled its innovative EV battery charging technology, Charge Point. Further, PA gained -- PA received industry recognition for their jointly developed COVID-19 awareness and situational intelligence tool with Unilever. The business exceeded talent expectations -- talent expansion targets for the year and is well positioned for continued out-year growth. 
I will now turn it over to Kevin."

Turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of fourth quarter results, followed by our fiscal year review. 
As we have previously communicated, our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which impacted our quarter year-over-year growth rate by 7% and our full year growth rate by 2%. The fourth quarter gross revenue increased 2% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%, including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions and adjusting for the year ago extra week, net revenue was up 6% for the quarter. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.2%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last year, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both People & Places, CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting profile of nearly 50%. We will continue to focus on increasing gross margins as we bring to market higher value solutions for our clients. 
Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 17%. Within G&A, during the quarter, we incurred an approximate $20 million or $0.12 per share charge to a legal settlement cost, which burden both GAAP and our adjusted results. This charge was related to a CH2M legacy matter surrounding a previously completed product advisory arrangement. 
GAAP operating profit was $252 million and was mainly impacted by $46 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $303 million, up 17%. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10%, up 85 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. 
EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.34 per share and included $0.45 primarily related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and other tax-related items, $0.40 related to the final mark-to-market of the Worley stock and related FX impact, $0.23 of net impact related to amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.10 of transaction and other related costs and $0.06 from Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.58, including the $0.12 burden from the previously discussed legal matter. During the quarter, PA's continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion, net of incremental interest. 
Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 12% year-over-year, representing 10% of net revenue. 
Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.3x for Q4, positioning us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the course of fiscal year 2022. 
Now turning to a recap of our full year fiscal year 2021 on Slide 11. Gross revenue increased 4%  and net revenue was up 7%, including the pro forma impact of all acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in the year-ago period, net revenue was up 3% for the full year. 
We continue to enhance our portfolio to higher-value solutions, which is evident as gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 26% for the year, up 235 basis points year-over-year. 
We expect mid-single-digit reported revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with an acceleration in the second half of our fiscal year, driven by U.S. infrastructure spending, and the ramp-up of new awards in our CMS business. 
GAAP operating profit was $688 million and was mainly impacted by the $261 million of purchase price consideration for the PA Consulting investment and $150 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $1.188 billion, up 23% and represented 10% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.244 billion was up 18% year-over-year to 10.6% of net revenue and just above the midpoint of our increased fiscal 2021 outlook. GAAP EPS was $3.12 and was impacted by $1.96 from the PA Consulting purchase price consideration and valuation allocation, $0.77 amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.57 related to the U.K. statutory rate change and other U.K.-related tax items, $0.35 of net charges related to Focus 2023, deal costs and restructuring and all of this being partially offset by a net lost of $0.48 from the final sale of Worley and C3 AI equity stake. Excluding all of these items, adjusted EPS was $6.29, also above the midpoint of our previously increased outlook. Of the 629, PA Consulting contributed $0.48 to that figure. 
Before turning to LOB performance, I would like to highlight that we are currently working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint. As a result, while we are still reviewing key components of the plan, we expect the potential noncash impairment charge ranging from $60 million to $70 million in the first half of fiscal '22. Our new footprint will facilitate virtual work options that leverage new technology and more collaborative workspaces in our offices. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 12. Starting with CMS. Q4 2021 revenue was down 5% year-over-year but when adjusting for the extra week in Q4 2020 was relatively flat on a pro forma basis. 
Let me remind you of the transitional dynamic impacting CMS revenue growth related to the transitioning off of two lower margin contracts. This represented $175 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract run up and adjusted the extra week a year ago, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. In 2022 Q1, we expect -- we continue to expect an approximate $210 million year-over-year impact from these two contract roll-offs and this will phase out in Q2. As a result, we expect reported revenue in the first quarter 2022 to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis with underlying growth being much stronger. We expect the CMS growth trajectory to improve over the year, resulting in a reported mid- to high single-digit full year 2022 growth rate. 
Q4 operating profit was $115 million, up 7%. Operating profit margin was strong, up 100 basis points year-over-year to 9.1%. For the full year, CMS operating profit was $447 million, up 20% with 8.8% operating profit margin. The improvement for the quarter and the year in operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities across the business. We expect operating profit margin to remain in the mid-8% range through fiscal 2022. 
Moving to People & Places. Q4 net revenue was flat year-over-year. When factoring in the impact from the extra week, P&PS grew net revenue approximately 8% year-over-year for Q4 and was up 2% for the fiscal year 2021. In Q4, total P&PS, NPS operating profit was down year-over-year, driven by the $20 million legal settlement cost I described earlier. Adding back that legal settlement cost, operating profit growth would have been up 8% in Q4. 
For the fiscal year, operating profit was up 5% or 8%. Excluding the legal settlement. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $273 million in revenue and $66 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q4 revenue grew 41% and 32% year-over-year in Sterling. Q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 24%, in line with our expectations. On a full year basis, PA Consulting grew revenue 33%, 24% in Sterling with adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. 
Our nonallocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and $190 million for the full year. These costs were up year-over-year and in line with our expectation. It's driven primarily by the expected costs and IT investments related to our new ways of working. In fiscal 2022, we expect nonallocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, given continued increases in medical costs and other investments. These corporate costs as well as Focus 2023, CMS, P&PS investments will perceive our expected acceleration in revenue growth and profit later in 2022. 
In summary, these increased investments ahead of our growth will likely result in our Q1 profitability and EPS being relatively flat versus our Q4 results, with Q2 then showing an improvement and further acceleration occurring in the second half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we generated $176 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again, showed strong improvement. The quarter's cash flow included $22 million of cash related to restructuring and other items, with $16 million related to our real estate lease termination as we take advantage of virtual working. For the year, free cash flow was $633 million, which was mainly impacted by the $261 million of PA purchase price consideration treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter. Regardless, our reported free cash flow represented 133% conversion against our reported net income. 
For the full year 2022, we will again target an adjusted free cash flow conversion of at or above 1x. As a result of our strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and a gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in $1.9 billion of net debt. Our pro forma net debt-to-adjusted expected 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. 
During the quarter, we monetized our Worley stock for $370 million and executed a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program. We will continue to monitor for any material dislocation in our share price, given the strong, long-term secular growth opportunities for our company. 
And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Steve."

And the semiconductor shortage is acute and we have many of our clients that are looking to build significant capacities over the next several years. 
I do think our private clients ultimately are now all thinking more robustly about spend as it relates to environmental solutions and thinking about how they can transform their footprints in a way that are facilitating our ability to become a more sustainable global economy, and I think that, that's clear. And then I would augment that is with our government services side, exactly the same comment. 
So I think the CapEx is very strong in that regard. 
The last piece I would call out is our environmental business and energy transition business is touching the oil and gas space as well, where we are working with them to ultimately provide incremental capability sets that that will help them, and them becoming a more viable, sustainable contributor to the global climate actions being taken around the globe. 
So I think you're right, they were focused across a wide swath. And actually, a lot of them, given the work we do are very, very strongly focused on these areas, which we think will encourage incremental CapEx longer term."

So some of your questions are a little premature as we're finalizing all that work for margins and whatnot. Rest assured, though, I think you can pretty much assume that the margin is not going down as it relates to what we're trying to get accomplished from an overall perspective. 
As it relates to cost to get there, look, we think that most of the things that we're going to be able to do are going to be embedded in our normal course operational expenditures. We did -- I did highlight the fact that we're working on a further of our real estate footprint. We're expecting a potential impairment of, I don't know, 60 to 70, maybe up to 70 in the first half, maybe even in the first quarter. And then if I think about other things, there's not going to be significant monies on top of that, maybe 25 to 50 in 2022. And then '23 and beyond, TBD, I would say.

Having said all of that, I do believe our incremental growth going forward in Q1 and Q2 is going to be more solid than what we've been seeing over the last few quarters. And so we're starting to see some of that benefit of the advanced facility certainly not as much in Q1, but in Q2. And so I do think we'll see some good solid growth in Q1 and Q2 on People & Places, and then it will accelerate again hopefully, into the Q3 and Q4 numbers.

And those are squarely around transportation, water resiliency and all the environmental impacts that are affiliated with climate change. 
And so those client relationships that we've had have been pretty robust for several years and are supporting those opportunity. Around advanced facilities, this is a multi-decade type of leadership approach that we've had, specifically in semi, but also in life sciences that's been a legacy business of ours forever.

If you look at some of the -- we have code names for them, but some of the wins that we've had over the course of the last 9 months, that has played out perfectly. 
And then BlackLynx is getting us into those software solutions, coupled with advisory services on automation and collection of data with processing engines that are working at the edge, all around security. And so we're excited about both of those. And coupled with long-term advisory platforms that we've had and the agencies that we're already in, that's going to serve us extremely well.

We've got a strong position with our domain knowledge for several decades within those end markets that we're talking about. Coupled with now, technology-enabled solutions is really what our acquisition strategy has been as accelerants to our strategy. So we're looking at the pipeline right now. It looks really good and more to follow on that front, as Steve mentioned at the Investor Day. 
The employee base is something that we are acutely focused in on right now. This is where our globality really, really helps us in that we're in multiple locations around the world with high-end talent that are delivering global talent utilized to deliver local solutions. And so our ability to scale, you hear about some of the labor shortages that -- and labor topics that are -- that we're faced with in the Western hemisphere, we're scaling in multiple locations for jobs that are all around the world. And that's been a big piece of ours. 
And then that last part with regards to PA, mentioned a couple of collaborative opportunities.

And hopefully, we'll have some more wins to talk about the Defra win in the U.K. last quarter. This win, can't disclose client in the biotechnology world, it's just shown that having the ability to offer expertise at the entirety of the life cycle of a project, a program or an issue is powerful and is one that's picking up some significant momentum.

So really, it comes down to the whole timing question that you asked. 
There has been some delay -- very modest delay as the government clients are waiting just to see the else come of this budget. And so as soon as that gets finalized, we see a few of these near-term prospects that we hinted to unleash whether that happens in December or the second quarter, I think we're talking about sort of that kind of timing. So we're -- that's why we're very optimistic about the upward trend and CMS revenue growth as we move through 2022."

So it's not a slam dunk as it relates to what's going to be happening in 2022 by any stretch. 
So having said all of that, what they've done in '22 -- or '21 has been extraordinarily strong, good margins, and they've been executing well.

Turning to Slide 4. Before I review our results, I'd like to share that we're in the final stages of completing our new strategy",704,"Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 business performance and key initiatives.  
Turning to Slide 4. Before I review our results, I'd like to share that we're in the final stages of completing our new strategy. We will be hosting an investor event on the week of March 7 for a deep dive of the next phase of our Jacobs transformation.  
Three key initiatives have emerged. First, we're putting in place a purpose-driven road map rooted in our values and strong culture to maximize our next stage of growth. Secondly, we identified and have aligned investment resources to capture three multi-decade growth opportunities: global infrastructure modernization, climate response and the digitization of industry. And third, we're taking a transformational approach to executing against these opportunities as we are unlocking the innovation engine at Jacobs, expanding our technology ecosystem while accelerating our trajectory of profitable growth and durable cash flow generation. We look forward to illuminating this strategy at our upcoming investor event.  
Now turning to our financial results. I'm pleased with our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year performance with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12% during the quarter and 18% for the full year. Backlog ended the fourth quarter up 12% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis.  
PA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 41% revenue growth. More importantly, PA delivered this growth while maintaining adjusted operating profit margins of 24%. For the full year, PA revenues surpassed $1 billion, far exceeding our deal investment model.  
As we look at overall Jacobs growth going forward, we now have certainty surrounding the unprecedented U.S. infrastructure funding with the passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act last week. And more broadly, global infrastructure modernization and national security needs are accelerating as our government and commercial clients address the challenges of climate change, advancement of their digitization strategies and increasing cyber threats. On top of that, our advanced facilities business is expected to show significant growth driven by the need for additional semiconductor manufacturing capacity and post-pandemic life sciences priorities. Given these strong growth dynamics, we're introducing fiscal 2022 guidance for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Looking beyond 2022, we expect our strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2025.  
Turning to Slide 5. As we reflect on climate change, it is globally accepted that humanity is at a critical juncture in our efforts to limit global warming. Jacobs and PA participated at the recent UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, COP26, in Glasgow to demonstrate our commitment to reinvent tomorrow with immediate and sustained action in the transition to a net zero economy. We stood alongside other business, financial and government leaders as well as activists and students to make sure our voice was heard. We engaged in activities to accelerate solutions to ensure the world stays on track to meet the critical 1.5-degree Celsius trajectory while preparing to adapt to the changes already locked in from climate change.  
As we move to Slide 6, given the nature of our business, it's clear that Jacobs' greatest opportunity to positively address climate change comes from the sustainable and resilient solutions that we co-create and deliver in partnership with our clients. To spearhead this effort, we have established a new Office of Global Climate Response and ESG to ensure that sustainability is woven into all of our solutions across markets and geographies. We are accelerating our established partnerships with the public and private sector to advance net zero carbon outcomes, climate resilience, natural and social capital as well as ESG business transformation in alignment with the United Nations' sustainable development goals.  
Annually, we generate approximately $5 billion of ESG-related revenue and expect to grow significantly over the next several years, driven by strong capability and energy transition, decarbonization, climate adaptation and natural resource stewardship.  
Our culture is a competitive differentiator. Our people have the knowledge, curiosity and the trust of our clients to achieve our purpose to create a more connected, sustainable world.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob Pragada to provide more detail by line of business."

During the fourth quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance. Total CMS backlog increased 16% year-over-year, 7% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion, driven by strategic new wins in cyber and intel and nuclear and remediation.  
Our CMS strategy is focused on creating recurring revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities. Three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth include cyber, commercial space and 5G technology for national security.  
Beginning with cyber intelligence, we are seeing several major emerging threats to national security. First, cyber attacks on mission-critical infrastructure, which are in even more stealth and as destructive as a traditional attack. Second, the speed and complexity of near-peer threats, which requires real-time coordination between space and other domains as the severity of nation state-sponsored attacks continues to increase. And third, the adoption of data-intensive AI-based applications are dramatically increasing the need for real-time data security and integrity.  
The funding for addressing these threats are partially reflected in the unclassified federal government spending on cyber in FY '22, which is expected to be over $20 billion, up 10% from prior year. Additionally, we expect the spending within classified budgets to be up higher.  
During the quarter, we were awarded a $300 million 7-year contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to modernize the NGA's ability to rapidly gain and share insights from cross-domain inventory, including top secret data classification. And within the classified budget, we were awarded a $170 million 5-year new contract to develop highly secure and hardened software applications that are leveraging the latest advances in AI and machine learning.  
We recently closed the BlackLynx acquisition, which provides software-enabled solutions for automating the collection of data at the edge and quickly gaining insights into extremely large volumes of structured and unstructured data. Our strong presence across the DoD and intelligence community as well as our digital enablement center will provide the escape velocity for BlackLynx to commercialize and scale their solutions, resulting in highly profitable recurring revenue.  
We also recently announced the strategic investment and distribution agreement with Hawkeye 360, which will enhance our digital intelligence suite of technologies with their RF spectrum analytics and collection automation offering.  
Moving on to space. With the significant amount of capital being infused into the commercial space companies, the affordability of space tourism is becoming a reality as well as other emerging opportunities, such as acceleration of satellite-based technologies and the need to understand the impact of space debris. Today, we support commercial space companies with manufacturing process optimization, system and subsystem prototype work and test facility studies and projects. As commercial space matures, we are positioning our solutions for the emerging opportunity.  
During the quarter, we were notified of a significant increase to the ceiling of our contract in Marshall Space Flight Center that also supports Artemis and SLS. The U.S. space force selected Jacobs for a 5-year contract to provide software and system support for its Patriot Excalibur system, which coordinates the scheduling, training and status of U.S. space force aircraft. Finally, our telecom business has had a strong quarter. And we see the rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, Verizon, DIRECTV, T-Mobile and DISH Network accelerating in 2022 and beyond. In addition, the new bipartisan infrastructure bill includes $2.5 billion for 5G rollout at U.S. military bases, and the DoD is investing heavily in 5G technology in support of national priorities.  
In summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in 2022. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business opportunities remaining above $30 billion, which includes $10 billion in source selection with an increasing margin profile. 
Now on to Slide 8. I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business.  We finished the year with strong financial performance with a year-over-year backlog growth of 7% and annual net revenue growth.
I'll discuss our results across the major themes of climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digitization.  Starting with climate response. As the top-ranked global environmental consulting firm, Jacobs is leading the efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate emergency, advance transition to a clean energy net zero economy and rapidly respond to natural disasters. This quarter, Jacobs was awarded a multiyear contract by the U.S. Army's Engineer Research and Development Center to integrate nature-based solutions that grow climate resilience across defense department facilities.  
Jacobs has recently been selected to reimagine New York's Rikers Island, taking the site through a full community revitalization with an equitable, resilient, multiuse approach, incorporating our innovative social value analysis. As the first phase in a 20-year program across the entire city, Jacobs' plan will consolidate four aging wastewater facilities into a state-of-the-art 1 billion-gallon per day water resource recovery facility that includes a renewable energy hub.  
In the transportation market, our specialists have pioneered advanced charging technology that enables clients to transition to decarbonize its operation, a key focus of economic stimulus packages. Our transit team continues to win contracts that support clients with asset, operational and technology shifts towards green fleets. For example, we recently won and commenced a hydrogen rail facility study with Caltrans. And our long-term work with Brisbane Metro continues to showcase cutting-edge green transit solutions.  
With exponential growth forecasted in the electric vehicle market, Jacobs has become the go-to firm to support leading EV battery and vehicle manufacturing companies globally. We've doubled our EV book of business in the past year and are forecasting continued growth.  
We also announced a strategic partnership and investment in Microgrid Labs, a provider of commercial fleet electrification and infrastructure solutions, including their proprietary SaaS platform. The green economy transition is driving increased investments in hydrogen and renewables, and our team is delivering diverse solutions for a range of clients from our participation in the Bacton Energy Hub consortium in the U.K. to energy transmission plans for a potential offshore wind development in the U.S. and additional contracts with Iberdrola's renewables Avonlie solar farm and the Swanbank waste-to-energy facility in Australia.  
Moving on to the theme of pandemic response. With ongoing impact to the supply chain, health systems and semiconductor chip shortage, Jacobs is gaining momentum with multiyear backlog across sectors, with new wins in biopharma such as the next phase of a new $2 billion biotechnology facility. Jacobs has successfully won several health opportunities in the U.S., Europe and Australia as they rethink pandemic response operations.  
The most significant aspect of the global supply chain disruption involves semiconductor shortages. As the world's leading technical services provider to the semiconductor industry, we are poised for significant growth in the electronics sector this year and expect our electronics business to further accelerate over the next several years. In fact, Jacobs is engineering several major investments for large chip manufacturers. 
Projects like Intel's new Arizona fab, which is -- which Jacobs is designing, are scheduled to be fully operational in 2024. The new fab will manufacture Intel's most advanced process technologies and represent the largest private investment in Arizona's history. Interconnected with climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digital transformation are leading to long-term transformative growth with significant wins across all markets. 
Globally, we are continuing to win pioneering transportation projects across all sectors and modes. In highways, we were recently selected for Transport for New South Wales, along with consortium partners, to undertake the $1.2 billion Warringah freeway upgrade project to accommodate a third road crossing Sydney harbor. In ports and maritime, we won the sustainable ports design and program management for King Abdul Aziz Port in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. And in air transportation, we were selected as the integrated program manager for the Solidarity Transport Hub in Poland, a greenfield airport in multimodal, including a high-speed rail network with an initial planned capacity of 45 million passengers. The program is of national significance. It will become the benchmark for zero-carbon delivery and be a sustainable transportation platform for Eastern Europe's future travel demands. 
Our long-standing relationships and existing framework agreements supported major wins with U.S. state departments of transportation and Transport for London, emphasizing our market-leading position for solving our clients' most complex transportation challenges. In summary, we see continued investment across the P&PS client sectors. We are already experiencing exciting global wins in the first quarter of our new fiscal year, indicating that we are well positioned to develop and deliver unmatched value and capability to our clients as investment momentum builds from the U.S. Infrastructure Act and other economic stimulus. 
Turning to PA Consulting on Slide 9. As Steve mentioned, PA continues to exceed expectations. Supported by an extension of consultative service to U.K.'s National Health Service, PA's efforts have extended into longer-term vaccine deployment, test and trace and future pandemic preparedness planning. Additionally, PA growth is being accentuated by recent digital solution wins for confidential U.S. biopharmaceutical clients in the areas of cell and gene therapy and next-generation patient care model. We continue to progress our synergy growth and long term collaboration. 
The Jacobs PA team were recently awarded a biotechnology manufacturing plant expansion to provide an end-to-end life cycle solution, incorporating critical digitized clinical trial information into the process design and facility layout. Additionally, we continue to receive joint strategic consultancy awards in the transportation sector globally. I look forward to our continued success with collaborative and integrated offerings to our customers. 
At COP26, PA displayed its deep ESG expertise and successfully unveiled its innovative EV battery charging technology, ChargePoint. Further, PA gained and PA received industry recognition for their jointly developed COVID-19 awareness and situational intelligence tool with Unilever. The business exceeded talent expectations -- talent expansion targets for the year and is well positioned for continued out-year growth. I will now turn it over to Kevin."

Turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of fourth quarter results, followed by our fiscal year review. As we have previously communicated, our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 had 14 week",1620,"And thank you, Bob, and good day to all listening on the call today. Turning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of fourth quarter results, followed by our fiscal year review. As we have previously communicated, our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which impacted our quarter year-over-year growth rate by 7% and our full year growth rate by 2%. The fourth quarter gross revenue increased 2% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%. Including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions and adjusting for the year ago extra week, net revenue was up 6% for the quarter. 
Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.2%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last year, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both people and places, CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile of nearly 50%. We will continue to focus on increasing gross margins as we bring to market higher-value solutions for our clients. Adjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 17%. Within G&A, during the quarter, we incurred an approximate $20 million or $0.12 per share charge to a legal settlement cost, which burden both GAAP and our adjusted results. This charge was related to a CH2M legacy matter surrounding a previously completed product advisory arrangement. 
GAAP operating profit was $252 million and was mainly impacted by $46 million of amortization from acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $303 million, up 17%. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10%, up 85 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.34 per share and included $0.45 primarily related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and other tax-related items, $0.40 related to the final mark-to-market of the Worley stock and related FX impact, $0.23 of net impact related to amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.10 of transaction and other related costs and $0.06 from Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs. 
Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.58, including the $0.12 burden from the previously discussed legal matter. During the quarter, PA's continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion, net of incremental interest. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 12% year-over-year, representing 10% of net revenue. 
Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter. Our revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.3x for Q4, positioning us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the course of fiscal year 2022. 
Now turning to a recap of our full year fiscal year 2021 on Slide 11. Gross revenue increased 4%, and net revenue was up 7%, including the pro forma impact of all acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in the year ago period, net revenue was up 3% for the full year. We continue to enhance our portfolio to higher-value solutions, which is evident as gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 26% for the year, up 235 basis points year-over-year. We expect mid-single digit reported revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with an acceleration in the second half of our fiscal year, driven by U.S. infrastructure spending and the ramp-up of new awards in our CMS business. 
GAAP operating profit was $688 million and was mainly impacted by the $261 million of purchase price consideration for the PA Consulting investment and $150 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Adjusted operating profit was $1.188 billion, up 23% and represented 10% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.244 billion was up 18% year-over-year to 10.6% of net revenue and just above the midpoint of our increased fiscal 2021 outlook. GAAP EPS was $3.12 and was impacted by $1.96 from the PA Consulting purchase price consideration and valuation allocation, $0.77 of amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.57 related to the U.K. statutory rate change and other U.K. related tax items, $0.35 of net charges related to Focus 2023, deal costs and restructuring and all of this being partially offset by a net positive $0.48 from the final sale of Worley and C3.ai equity stakes. Excluding all of these items, adjusted EPS was $6.29, also above the midpoint of our previously increased outlook.  Of the $6.29, PA Consulting contributed $0.48 to that figure. 
Before turning to LOB performance, I would like to highlight that we are currently working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint. As a result, while we are still reviewing key components of the plan, we expect a potential noncash impairment charge ranging from $60 million to $70 million in the first half of fiscal '22. Our new footprint will facilitate virtual work options that leverage new technology and more collaborative workspaces in our offices. 
Regarding our LOB performance, let's turn to Slide 12. Starting with CMS. Q4 2021 revenue was down 5% year-over-year, but when adjusting for the extra week in Q4 2020 was relatively flat on a pro forma basis. Let me remind you of the transitional dynamic impacting CMS revenue growth related to the transitioning off of 2 lower-margin contracts. This represented $175 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter. When excluding the contract run-up and adjusting for the extra week a year ago, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. In 2022 Q1, we expect to -- we continue to expect an approximate $210 million year-over-year impact from these 2 contract roll-offs, and this will phase out in Q2. As a result, we expected report -- we expect reported revenue in the first quarter 2022 to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis, with underlying growth being much stronger. 
We expect the CMS growth trajectory to improve over the year, resulting in a reported mid- to high single-digit full year 2022 growth rate. Q4 CMS operating profit was $115 million, up 7%. Operating profit margin was strong, up 100 basis points year-over-year to 9.1%. For the full year, CMS operating profit was $447 million, up 20% with 8.8% operating profit margin. The improvement for the quarter and the year and operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher-margin opportunities across the business. We expect operating profit margin to remain in the mid-8% range through fiscal 2022. 
Moving to People & Places. Q4 net revenue was flat year-over-year. When factoring in the impact from the extra week, P&PS grew net revenue approximately 8% year-over-year for Q4 and was up 2% for the fiscal year 2021. In Q4, total P&PS operating profit was down year-over-year, driven by the $20 million legal settlement cost I described earlier. Adding back that legal settlement cost, operating profit growth would have been up 8% in Q4. For the fiscal year, operating profit was up 5% or 8% excluding the legal settlement. In terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $273 million in revenue and $66 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q4 revenue grew 41% and 32% year-over-year in sterling. 
Q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 24%, in line with our expectations. On a full year basis, PA Consulting grew revenue 33%, 24% in sterling, with adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. Our non-allocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and $190 million for the full year. These costs were up year-over-year and in line with our expectations. These -- this -- the increase, excuse me, was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs and IT investments related to our new ways of working. In fiscal 2022, we expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, given continued increases in medical costs and other investments. These corporate costs as well as Focus 2023, CMS, P&PS investments will precede our expected acceleration in revenue growth and profit later in 2022. 
In summary, these increased investments ahead of our growth will likely result in our Q1 profitability and EPS being relatively flat versus our Q4 results, with Q2 then showing improvement and further acceleration occurring in the second half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we generated $176 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The quarter's cash flow included $22 million of cash related to restructuring and other items with $16 million related to a real estate lease termination as we take advantage of virtual working. For the year, free cash flow was $633 million, which was mainly impacted by the $261 million of PA purchase price consideration treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter. Regardless, our reported free cash flow represented 133% conversion against our reported net income. 
For the full year 2022, we will again target an adjusted free cash flow conversion of at or above 1x. As a result of our strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and a gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in $1.9 billion of net debt. Our pro forma net debt to adjusted expected 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3x, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. During the quarter, we monetized our Worley stock for $370 million and executed a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program. We will continue to monitor for any material dislocation in our share price, given the strong long-term secular growth opportunities for our company. 
And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. Now I'll turn it back over to Steve."

And the semiconductor shortage is acute, and we have many of our clients that are looking to build significant capacities over the next several years. 
I do think our private clients ultimately are now all thinking more robustly about spend as it relates to environmental solutions and thinking about how they can transform their footprints in a way that are facilitating our ability to become a more sustainable global economy, and I think that, that's clear. And then I would augment that is, with our government services side, exactly the same comment.  So I think the CapEx is very strong in that regard. 
The last piece I would call out is our environmental business and energy transition business is touching the oil and gas space as well, where we are working with them to ultimately provide incremental capability sets that will help them in them becoming a more viable, sustainable contributor to the global climate actions being taken around the globe. 
So I think you're right, they were focused across a wide swath. And actually, a lot of them, given the work we do, are very, very strongly focused on these areas, which we think will encourage incremental CapEx longer term."

So some of your questions are a little premature as we're finalizing all that work for margins and whatnot. Rest assured, though, I think you can pretty much assume that the margin is not going down as it relates to what we're trying to get accomplished from an overall perspective. 
As it relates to cost to get there, look, we think that most of the things that we're going to be able to do are going to be embedded in our normal course operational expenditures. We did -- I did highlight the fact that we're working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint. We're expecting a potential impairment of, I don't know, $60 million to $70 million, maybe up to $70 million in the first half, maybe even in the first quarter. And then if I think about other things, there's not going to be significant monies on top of that, maybe $25 million to $50 million in 2022. And then '23 and beyond, TBD, I would say.

Seems like at the midpoint of the fiscal '22 guidance, you're going to outpace that. And I just wanted to reconcile that considering the way you described the cadence of fiscal '22 earnings. It seems like the exit velocity is going to be quite strong and that we should actually see accelerating earnings growth out of fiscal '22. So I hope that question makes sense. Just wanted to talk through the mechanics there. Maybe there's some conservatism. Any commentary there would be helpful."

First, on the acquisition piece. We're excited. If you look at the last two that we did within CMS about a year ago with The Buffalo Group and most recently with BlackLynx, these are right down the -- right in the bull's eye of where we're going in cyber and intelligence where we're bringing in, whether it be client diversification with The Buffalo Group and higher-end advisory services, and that has played out extremely well. If you look at some of the -- we have code names for them, but some of the wins that we've had over the course of the last 9 months, that has played out perfectly. 
And then BlackLynx is getting us into those software solutions, coupled with advisory services on automation and collection of data with processing engines that are working at the edge, all around security. And so we're excited about both of those. And coupled with long-term advisory platforms that we've had and the agencies that we're already in, that's going to serve us extremely well. 
With regard to prospects in the P&PS world, I'd target it more towards -- it's not too dissimilar than our cyber and intelligence prospects around technology. We've got a strong position with our domain knowledge for several decades within those end markets that we're talking about. Coupled with now, technology-enabled solutions, it is really what our acquisition strategy has been as accelerants to our strategy. So we're looking at the pipeline right now. It looks really good and more to follow on that front, as Steve mentioned at the Investor Day. 
The employee base is something that we are acutely focused in on right now. This is where our globality really, really helps us in that we're in multiple locations around the world with high-end talent that are delivering global talent utilized to deliver local solutions. And so our ability to scale, you hear about some of the labor shortages that -- and labor topics that are -- that we're faced with in the Western hemisphere, we're scaling in multiple locations for jobs that are all around the world. And that's been a big piece of ours. 
And then that last part with regards to PA, mentioned a couple of collaborative opportunities. But where are -- where PA sits in a lot of the same clients that we have in that C-suite as well as in kind of the front end of technology as our clients are developing new innovative ways of delivering the global topics, we're seeing the collaboration accelerate. And hopefully, we'll have some more wins to talk about, the Defra win in the U.K. last quarter, this win, can't disclose a client in the biotechnology world. It's just shown that having the ability to offer expertise at the entirety of the life cycle of a project, a program or an issue is powerful and is one that's picking up some significant momentum. So we're excited on all fronts."

And we feel very well positioned at places like NASA and how the budgets played out there. So really, it comes down to the whole timing question that you asked. 
There has been some delay -- very modest delay as the government clients are waiting just to see the outcome of this budget. And so as soon as that gets finalized, we see a few of these near-term prospects that we've hinted to, to unleash whether that happens in December or the second quarter, I think we're talking about sort of that kind of timing. So we're -- that's why we're very optimistic about the upward trend in CMS revenue growth as we move through 2022."

Is there anything we should be aware of, big picture, of why earnings growth would not accelerate? Why it would step down to 2025? Is there, as you were kind of alluding to, is it recompete risk? Is it just higher -- less level of SG&A or where the margins are? Just kind of help us understand. I know you'll flesh out more at the Investor Day.

Now there -- as we look into 2022, they're going to be growing, but it's not going to be at that same rate that we've been talking about. They got to figure out a way to recover and get new business to replace some of this business that's going to go away. So it's not a slam dunk as it relates to what's going to be happening in 2022 by any stretch. 
So having said all of that, what they've done in '22 -- or '21 has been extraordinarily strong, good margins, and they've been executing well.
