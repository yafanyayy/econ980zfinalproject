28492682,704074358,2224281,"Etsy, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Etsy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks a lot, Deb, and hello, welcome, everyone. 2020 was no doubt a transformative year for Etsy, a time when circumstance met preparedness, highlighting the agility of our model, the dynamism of our team and the power of our differentiated strategy. Ets",2502,"Thanks a lot, Deb, and hello, welcome, everyone. 2020 was no doubt a transformative year for Etsy, a time when circumstance met preparedness, highlighting the agility of our model, the dynamism of our team and the power of our differentiated strategy. Etsy emerges transform a larger and stronger marketplace as a result.
We understand that the stakes are high, millions count on us now more so than ever, and I'm proud of our impact. We help to create economic opportunity for our sellers and lead from the front on many important social issues. As a marketplace that gets better as it gets bigger, we believe that Etsy is now even better positioned to lead into the future.
When we look at our 2020 results, they were spectacular. Consolidated GMS was $10.3 billion, up 106% on a currency-neutral basis. Consolidated revenue was $1.7 billion, up 111%, with an EBITDA margin of approximately 32%. Said differently, we roughly achieved our 2023 aspirations in 2020. Rachel will provide more insights on Q4 in just a moment. But we're proud of our inclusion in the S&P 500 is yet another signal of the importance that the Etsy Marketplace is playing in the global economy.
And in fact, speaking of the global economy, 2020 was an extraordinary year for e-commerce overall as the growth rate of e-commerce roughly doubled as much of the offline world shutdown. And as fast as e-commerce grew, Etsy grew much, much faster. In fact, Etsy grew almost 2.5x as fast as e-commerce. We had to change the y-axis of the graph just to accommodate it.
Etsy is gaining meaningful share versus e-commerce because where the world is racing to offer the same thing priced maybe a little cheaper or shipping just a little faster. Etsy offers something truly unique, something truly special. And we're now seeing the power of that difference.
That growth helped Etsy to become one of the most visited e-commerce sites in the United States. In fact, we were the fourth largest retail e-commerce site by monthly visits, and we've become one of the most recognized e-commerce brands in the United States. People suddenly mention Etsy in the same breadth as much larger retailers like Walmart or Target or eBay. And it's not just in the U.S. in fact, in the fourth quarter, international accounted for over 40% of all of the GMS on Etsy.
I'd like to take a moment to talk about the United Kingdom, which had a truly breakout year in 2020 with a growth rate of 189% year-over-year. As fast as Etsy grew, Etsy U.K. grew much, much faster. And Germany, our second largest e-commerce market also more than doubled in 2020. What I'm most pleased about is the percentage of e-commerce on both of those sites that's local. That's domestic, where both the buyer and the seller are located in the U.K. or in Germany, respectively. In the U.K., now more than 70% of trade is local. That means for people in the U.K., Etsy is very much a domestic platform where there's a sufficient vibrancy of both supply and demand for people to be able to come there for everyday needs. And we're seeing that in Germany, and I think that really speaks well to the power of our international opportunity overall.
Why? Well, one important reason is the ability of the Etsy marketplace to meet rapidly evolving buyer needs. 2020 search trends highlight the dynamism of our marketplace. For example, in March, when the off-line world largely shut down, demand for essentials on Etsy exploded, and our sellers almost instantaneously grows to meet those needs. And as trends evolve throughout the year from nesting and home office to home furnishings to outdoor events and reimagine events, things like virtual graduation ceremonies or lawn celebrations, our sellers were there to create and to deliver. In fact, if you can imagine it, it's very possible that people came to Etsy to make it and to buy it.
All of this resulted in dramatic growth across all of our buyer segments. Etsy added twice as many new buyers in 2020 as they did in 2019. In fact, there were many weeks in 2020 where Etsy added more than 1 million new buyers per week, and we reactivated 22 million lapsed buyers. These are buyers who hadn't shopped in Etsy in at least a year. And they've come back to Etsy in 2020 at a time when they really needed us most to find that Etsy is better in so many ways than the last version of Etsy that they might have visited possibly years ago.
I'm particularly excited about the growth of habitual buyers. Habitual buyers were yet again, our fastest-growing segment in the fourth quarter. And habitual buyers grew 157% year-over-year. 2020 was also a year when we grew the pie for many of our sellers. In fact, many of our sellers had their best year ever in 2020. GMS per seller was up 22%, while we simultaneously grew active sellers by 64%. We, of course, work hard to support our sellers by driving more sales. We also worked hard to support our sellers in many other ways. For example, as governments in the United States and Europe drafted legislation to support our economy, Etsy was a very vocal advocate making sure that governments remember that independent workers, people like sellers on Etsy, also matter and that we need to design our legislation and our economic reform with them in mind.
Speaking of working hard, I'm incredibly proud of our team and how well they transitioned under very trying circumstances. At a time when they suddenly need to work entirely remote and face all of the stresses that everyone is facing in the external environment, our team rose to the challenge and were more productive than ever. As one example, experiment velocity grew 16% year-over-year while we simultaneously had higher hit rate than we did in the prior year. What that means is that each team was working hard and making a lot of progress making the product experience on Etsy even better.
In addition to that, site traffic was up very substantially. And what that means is that the productivity of every team is automatically higher. The ROI of every squad is higher. We continue to make investments aligned with our right to win that we believe are making the product experience at Etsy materially better. For example, we've talked a lot about the importance of search and discovery on Etsy. And here, we show some examples of how the search experience continues to get better and better. Our initial investments in dynamic ranking and Semantic gap have laid the foundation for personalized search, which is making it easier for buyers to find what they're looking for and to be inspired from among our over 85 million items.
Buyers are now scrolling through fewer listings, which is making search less overwhelming and more rewarded. And of course, it's about so much more than just search. We continue to make investments to improve the product experience in many, many ways. Two examples in the fourth quarter were the launch of installment payments and the ability to filter searches around expected delivery dates. So you can see just items that are going to arrive within your time frame.
And just as our product experience improved, so has our brand awareness. We made significant strides in marketing in 2020, expanding the visibility of our brand globally. Our brand team launched 5 different creative campaigns in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, with a record number of impressions and share voice to cut through. And we expanded our performance marketing and our CRM campaigns very materially, equipping our teams with more resources and better tools within our Martech stack and turbocharging the success of our performance marketing campaigns through our offsite ads program. Our top of mind awareness has grown, and we have so much room yet to grow it further.
I also want to take a minute to highlight some of the critical infrastructure investments we make that maybe aren't as obvious to the outside world, but are so important to our success as a business. For example, I'd like to give a shout out to our member services and trust and safety teams. In early spring, demand on Etsy, suddenly instantaneously and unexpectedly more than doubled. And of course, that created a dramatic increase in customer support and trust and safety tickets. And our team rose to that challenge and delivered against the very high levels of customer satisfaction that our customers expect and deserve. That's only possible because of the tooling and the infrastructure and the capabilities that we have built as a team over the past several years.
And in addition to providing high-quality customer support, we work very hard to make customer supported Etsy ever more human. In fact, in the fourth quarter of 2020, 73% of customer contacts were handled real time, meaning their voice or chat, which is quite a dramatic change from where we were just 2 years ago.
2 years ago, we described to all of you our long-term right to win strategy, which propelled our growth in 2020 and is more relevant than ever. We're building upon that momentum to deepen and strengthen in each of the 4 areas that make up our right to win. We didn't pivot to meet the demands of 2020. Rather, we doubled down on this strategy, which has allowed us to meet the demands in 2020, and we believe will continue to strengthen our business for years to come. We have a deep passion for the Etsy community. Specifically, our buyers and sellers who come to Etsy to express themselves or to turn their creative passion into a business. We believe that the opportunity is large, the shift in customer behavior has brought more sales online, and we know that for almost every purchase occasion, we have something delightful on Etsy to offer.
In 2021, our focus areas will be centered around things that continue to differentiate the Etsy experience from all of the other players in e-commerce. In search and discovery, our big tracks of work involve making it easier to find just the right thing even when you don't have the right words to describe it and helping to surprise and inspire people, being a place where buyers can come and browse, lean back and find inspiration. Personalization is a very important focus, helping people to find things they didn't even ask for, but know it when they see it. And we've barely begun to unpack the opportunity in personalization. We'll lean into this in superhuman ways, combining the latest of AI with human curation, leveraging the power of our community and our team to help curate items and use those to train models to become ever more personalized.
We want to leverage the distinct power of our growing community to help make Etsy less overwhelming and made just for you. And we'll do all of this in ways that make Etsy even more human. For example, leveraging video. Unlike most products, every item on Etsy comes with a story. Every seller has his or her own story. And video is a powerful way to tell those stories. Plus, we can show buyers how the items look, how they feel, even how they sound. This is a great example of how we have so much more runway to more richly connect buyers and sellers. And once you find just the right item, you need the confidence to be willing to buy it.
In 2021, we're going to be very focused on the post-purchase experience, being transparent about when you can expect an item to arrive, being purposeful about when to communicate that in the purchase journey. Making sure our sellers have all the right information that they need to meet the deadlines and letting buyers know that we have their back in case anything goes wrong.
As we work to become a habit for buyers, it becomes even more important that they trust us and see Etsy as reliable. We'll have so much more to tell you about our product road map as we progress throughout the year. But we couldn't be more excited about what's on deck for 2021.
And I'd like to take just a minute to talk about Reverb, another example of the beauty of a 2-sided marketplace. Especially when combined with strong execution in product and marketing. Reverb also had a fantastic 2020, growing faster than their market. And the company recently laid out their rights to win their long-term strategy with key differentiators, which mirror Etsy zone and show just how much opportunity there is to grow the Reverb platform.
I also want to highlight our virtuous cycle and the progress that we've made in our economic, social and ecological pillars to benefit all of our stakeholders. Etsy has always believed that being a good citizen makes us an even stronger and more resilient business. And 2020 demonstrated that people are looking to shop their values. They're looking to put their money where their heart is. And they hold businesses to a higher standard.
Since announcing our impact strategy in 2017, we've continued to evolve and update our goals. We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in this past year. But we're not resting on our laurels. We're setting some aggressive new targets for 2021 and beyond, creating a more diverse, equitable and sustainable marketplace and supply chain to expand our economic impact. Etsy's economic output is now similar to the city of Houston. We're continuing to build on our diverse and inclusive workforce at Etsy and at Reverb. I'm proud of the fact that, for example, we doubled the percentage of our leadership team that are underrepresented minorities. And we sourced 100% of our electricity from renewables. We've set a new goal, which is to be net 0 emissions by 2030.
Most importantly, you'll be able to read more about in our soon to be filed integrated annual report where we're now using both the SASB and the TCFD frameworks to help you better track all of our strategies and progress. As we look forward over many years, we continue to believe that e-commerce is consolidating around fewer and fewer scaled e-commerce platforms. And we believe that Etsy is better positioned than ever to be one of those few scaled platforms, a brand which rises above the rest by standing for something truly unique and different, standing for the individual creators and for keeping commerce human.
I believe Etsy can and should be a massive force in the world. The world has taken notice, and we have strong conviction that our opportunity is bigger than ever.
I'd like to close by thanking our team once again for their passion, their creativity and their conviction. And now I'll turn it over to Rachel."

My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and Etsy's stand-alone results where appropriate.On a consolidated basis, Etsy's fourth quart",2551,"Thanks, Josh, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our Q4 earnings call. My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and Etsy's stand-alone results where appropriate.
On a consolidated basis, Etsy's fourth quarter GMS grew 118% to $3.6 billion. Revenue grew 129% to $617 million, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA of nearly $192 million, capping off a strong year where we achieved industry-leading growth and record profitability. Etsy's stand-alone Q4 GMS grew 127% to $3.4 billion. Our disciplined investment strategy and strong execution drove more adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter than in all of 2019.
Top line growth exceeded our Q4 guidance, which had projected a steeper decelerating GMS trend due primarily to 2 factors. First, mass contracting as a percent of overall GMS. And second, the uncertainty of consumer spending patterns and global economies related to the pandemic.
As Josh mentioned earlier, international growth was robust in 2020. In Q4, consolidated international GMS expanded 500 basis points sequentially to 40% of overall GMS. International GMS was up 140% on a constant currency basis and was driven in part by strong trends in the U.K. and Germany. Our fastest-growing trade route in the fourth quarter was once again our domestic sales between buyers and sellers within the same country.
It's also worth noting that we are disclosing U.K. revenue, which is based on the location of the seller for the first time as it was more than 10% for 2020 at $196 million. We're adding India as a core market, bringing our total focus markets to 7, given heightened investments we've been making to build the foundation of incredible inventory from creative entrepreneurs in that country.
Etsy had an exceptional holiday as the shopping season started earlier and growth rates exceeded prior years, providing a meaningful tailwind in the quarter, setting some exciting records as shown on this slide. We told you on our last call how we would be investing heavily in product and marketing to make Etsy a wonderful holiday shopping destination, and these investments really paid off. Etsy's peak holiday shopping day was small business Saturday. Growth was up 150% year-over-year, and we generated over $50,000 in GMS per minute. This is especially important as it gives them more than 4 million small businesses on our platform relevance and a voice during this important time in retail.
We also continue to see growth in our top 6 categories with homewares and home furnishings, our largest and fastest growing category, growing 226% during the 5 days of Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. All of the work we've done to keep Etsy top of mind and ensure we could handle the surge in activity enabled us to deliver great results. Not only did our holiday season start earlier, we also peaked higher and sustained strengths longer than in prior holiday periods.
We saw continued strong growth across many of our categories to end 2020, especially in our top six, which for all of 2020 represented over 80% of Etsy GMS growing 85% year-over-year. You can see the full year category growth on this slide. Globally, Etsy's growth is distributed in over 50 different retail categories. Outside of the top 6 categories, full year growth was 115%, excluding mask sales, powered by segments such as toys and games and pet supplies. As expected, mask sales continued to contract as a percent of overall GMS to 4% in Q4, down from 11% in Q3 and 14% in Q2, a trend which we expect to continue.
Following the steady trend of 93% year-over-year growth in Q2 and Q3, nonmass GMS growth accelerated sequentially to 118% in Q4. In addition, we're seeing very healthy underlying trends from mask buyers. Of the 3 million mask-only buyers in Q3, approximately 50% returned in Q4 for a non mass purchase. This is up 12 percentage points compared to Q3, a great signal, but we are retaining and converting buyers who are coming to Etsy for some of their essential purchases.
Consolidated Q4 revenue was driven by growth in both marketplace and services revenue. In particular, key drivers for GMS volume, Etsy Payments, Etsy Ads and Offsite Ads revenue. Etsy Ads, Offsite Ads and our expanded Etsy Payments platform combined helped to sustain take rate at 17.1% in Q4, a quarter where historically, take rates contract due to seasonality. We continue to make strides in bolstering our advertising products and initiatives to help sellers drive velocity in the marketplace and take control of their success.
On a consolidated basis, onsite Etsy Ads and Reverb's bump offering grew 74% year-over-year with both marketplaces improving our ad platforms and enhance the functionality and user experience for sellers and show more relevant ads to buyers. Etsy's Offsite Ads continue to yield encouraging returns, with opt out rates remaining less than 2%. We're optimizing return and channel mix for our sellers' listings. Now incorporating buyer segment information in the signals we send to our ad partners, including differentiated LTVs to drive efficiency.
In the second half of 2020, 9% of Etsy's stand-alone GMS earned an Offsite Ads fee. This effective increase in take rate enables us to invest more on behalf of our sellers while maintaining our ROI threshold.
From a seller's perspective, the return on ad spend is in the range of 6x to 8x on the high end for any ad product. And this is a risk-free investment since the seller only pays the fee when she makes a sale. Gross margin was 76%, up 920 basis points compared to last year and continue to benefit from our shift to Offsite Ads, which delivers incremental revenue without an equal offset in cost of revenue. And to a lesser extent, the change to Reverb's transaction fee also expanded gross margin in Q4 since this was the first full quarter of consolidated P&L benefit.
We're scaling our investments in 2 ways, both in marketing and product development. On this slide, we've shown you marketing as a percentage of GMS versus buyer growth to illustrate how we scaled marketing to drive returns. As you know, we've been leaning in more heavily to upper funnel channels, in particular, and these investments are having the desired impact. For example, in the fourth quarter, we saw year-over-year improvements in prompted and unprompted awareness and positive gains in several key brand metrics. We also track monthly movement in brand familiarity, emotional closeness, relevance and every danes and are seeing strong progress here as well.
I want to highlight some specifics around our Q4 investments. As mentioned last quarter, we ran 2 separate TV campaigns during the holiday period, one aimed to drive purchases and another designed to build brand affinity and deepen the emotional connection to Etsy. Both campaigns, in addition to various other efforts in media and PR, earned Etsy's marketing team as one of ad age's marketers of the year alongside some of the world's most well-known brands.
Overall, both campaigns outperformed our expectations, driving visits and conversion rate and ultimately incremental GMS. Despite an increase in CPMs as many retailers stepped up spend to close the year.
Q4 consolidated marketing spend was $211 million, up 151% year-over-year. Brand marketing spend, which includes television and digital video, with 23% of our consolidated marketing spend in Q4 and 24% in Q4 last year versus 18% in Q3. This represents approximately $49 million of the spend in the fourth quarter.
In our performance marketing channels, we've rapidly scaled our spend as a result of Offsite Ads. Performance marketing spend was $147 million, up 193% year-over-year and up 65% compared to last quarter. We're also hard at work improving our owned channels, building out use cases for our new CRM tools, such as personalized e-mails or targeted push notifications. We're investing to drive efficiencies in each and every channel across the funnel to bring in new buyers and drive frequency.
The other lever for improvement in GMS is our investment in product development, which you can see illustrated on this slide. This spend drives higher conversion rate from new and repeat buyers and increased frequency. The impact of this investment is evident both in our GMS growth, our experiment velocity and accelerated hiring with a larger product development investment as seen on our P&L. We ended the year with 1,414 employees, an increase of 14% compared to last year. As Josh mentioned earlier, we're getting twice the leverage from our product teams with an ambitious investment road map.
Moving to our operating metrics. We are really pleased with the continued increases in new buyers and reactivation of our large base of existing buyers. For example, in the fourth quarter, active buyers grew 77% year-over-year to approximately $81 million for the Etsy Marketplace and a 92% increase in new and reactivated buyers. GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis grew 13% year-over-year, driven in part by habitual buyers, which grew over 157% in Q4. This is up from 100% growth in the third quarter. The third quarter of sequential acceleration in this valuable segment. Also, 11% of repeat buyers in Q3 became habitual buyers in Q4, and we now have 6.5 million habitual buyers.
In addition to our habitual buyers, many of our other buyer segments exhibited tremendous growth. For example, repeat buyers, those who made purchases on 2 or more days in a 12-month period, grew 97% to $32 million, approximately 20 percentage points faster than overall active buyers and a sequential acceleration compared to last quarter.
2020 was an unprecedented year as all of our buyer cohorts inflected higher during the period. Slide 35 shows 2020 GMS per buyer and the year-over-year growth from each of our last 5 cohorts. We're pleased to see that our older cohorts, such as the 2015 cohort, who have been on the platform for 5 years, generated the highest GMS per buyer and grew as fast as our more recent cohorts. For our newer cohorts in 2020, we've seen a meaningful improvement in their purchase behavior. Approximately 22% of new buyers in 2020 became repeat buyers within 60 days of their first purchase, up from 16% in 2019. These data points are indicative that the underlying trends in our marketplace continue to improve.
Moving to the balance sheet. As of 12/31, we had $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, in addition to a $200 million revolver that is currently undrawn. In Q4, we repurchased $78 million of our stock or 618,841 shares at an average price of $125 per share. We've now completed the November 2018 buyback program, repurchasing approximately $200 million of stock or roughly 3 million shares at an average price of $64.80. Our Board of Directors recently authorized a new $250 million stock repurchase program.
And turning to our outlook. While it is our normal practice to provide annual guidance as a basic framework for our business, given the continued uncertainties facing Etsy, e-commerce at large and global macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending, we are only providing guidance for Q1 at this time. We currently estimate Q1 consolidated GMS to be approximately $3 billion, up about 115% to 125% compared to Q1 of last year. Revenue of $513 million to $536 million, up 125% to 135% versus last year. And adjusted EBITDA of $168 million to $178 million with a margin in the range of 32% to 34%.
In giving this outlook for Q1, we have the benefit of nearly 2 months of the quarter already in the books. January was very strong, but it was clear to us it was helped in part by a tailwind from stimulus checks. We want to call this out as we do not currently expect to have the same tailwind in Q2 and, in fact, can already see that February relative to January is less strong without that stimulus. Furthermore, the recent weather events in the South and the Pacific Northwest had a very clear impact on our GMS in the past week. Another reminder that certain unpredictable macro events beyond our control are apt to create volatility in our performance.
As you update your models and think about the cadence of growth for 2021 and beyond, we'd like to remind you of a few things. During the latter part of Q1, Etsy will lap a period of negative growth rates that spanned from mid- to late March 2020. The outlook I just gave for Q1 includes several weeks of comping this low point. Then, as you recall, on April 2, 2020, we saw the start of significant unprecedented growth initially catalyzed by demand for face masks. In total, 2020 face masks exceeded $740 million, with $346 million in Q2 and $264 million in Q3. While face masks versus nonface masks GMS trends have certainly been encouraging, our expectation is that year-over-year quarterly growth rate comparisons will be challenging when you eliminate the face mask sales from your forward models.
In 2020, Etsy growth outpaced the broader e-commerce sector. While we are not giving the full year guidance today, it may be informative to look at third-party data and research on how they are projecting growth for the industry this year. It suggests that for the sector, Q1 2021 growth will be approximately in line with Q4 2020, and that the industry will start to more rapidly decelerate starting in Q2, with the majority of incremental growth for the year realized in the first quarter. It remains our ambition to continue to outgrow e-commerce. Propelled by the underlying changes we've seen in the marketplace and the heightened awareness of our differentiated brand.
However, we also know, we hope, that as the world opens up later this year, consumers will soon be able to spend more of their money on travel, dining and entertainment. And this will create some headwind in Etsy's growth relative to 2020.
Last note on the revenue outlook. Historically, there is some favorable seasonality to our first quarter take rate. This year, we also benefit from Offsite Ads, additional Etsy Payment geographies and Reverb's higher transaction fee. As we think about the quarterly cadence of take rate throughout the year, Q1 may represent the high watermark for 2021 take rate.
On expenses, two points to keep in mind. First, we want to reiterate that our revenue per headcount is significantly higher than our peers and results in margins that are stronger than we want, given the many opportunities we see to invest for growth. So as you think about expense trends and margin drivers, keep in mind that we are investing in talent and accelerating our pace of hiring in 2021, with a particular focus on product and engineering.
Second, we exceed the revenue threshold in many international geographies for collecting and remitting digital sales tax. This obligation will grow as our business continues to expand. We have more conviction than ever to invest in our business for the long term, building top of mind awareness in the hearts and minds of consumers and continuing to gain market share. We're building on our momentum, and we expect to continue to capitalize on our large market opportunity.
Thank you for your time today. I will now turn the call over to Deb, so we can take your questions."

And you're right that we started with search. I think we're in very early innings. And you can think about personalization very narrowly as knowing, for example, how we've started, what things have you searched for in the past, what things have you favorited in the past, what have you bought in the past. And using that to inform your search results.
But taking the aperture out further, having a deeper understanding of what that might imply of your sense of style and understanding things like what style are all of these 80-plus million items, what are other people who bought these also been interested in, what might complete the look of this. It might not be that item at all, but it might be other things that match with that item. These are all areas of personalization, where we have not really even begun. And so I think we have a tremendous amount of opportunity still to go. What we have learned, which is not surprising to us or anyone is that it is actually valuable. Even in our first launches in personalization, it makes the experience better, it makes conversion rate go up. We're very optimistic about what it can do. So if I think about personalization to your point of where else can you go, search and discovery, which I would think of as a lean and you type in a query at Etsy, and we give you a more personalized set of results, is where we've started. Lean back is another opportunity for personalization. So think what kind of recommendations can we present to you? What kinds of things can we show you that would inspire you. You didn't even think to ask for but we happen to know that other people like you are interested.
And the other bucket that I think is very exciting is Offsite. When we are marketing to you, being on Facebook or Google or elsewhere, the ability to know more about you and be even more personalized in terms of how we reach out to you is an opportunity that I think is large and will continue to get better and better over time."

One of the wonderful things about a 2-sided marketplace like Etsy is that it gets better as it gets bigger. There's a virtuous cycle that's turning. And so the growth in Etsy in our core international markets has been strong in the past but was truly extraordinary in 2020. And if I look at the U.K. in particular, which really had a breakout year, it does feel like that virtuous cycle just turned more and more. So it appears to us that going from a top 20 e-commerce brand to a top 10 e-commerce brand appears to have a really positive impact on our business and going from top 10 to top 5 has a really positive impact in terms of brand awareness in the market. And it makes sense because what's happening is we're bringing vibrancy. We're bringing more sellers with more items so you can shop domestically more and we're getting more buyers, which brings more sellers.
So part of what we're learning is what might be mechanisms where we can accelerate that brand awareness. How can we invest? There's a natural growth curve, which we ride, but how can we invest to make that happen even faster? You are seeing us do things like brand marketing in both the U.K. and in Germany. And as we always do with Etsy, we're very data driven. We're very experiment driven, and we're looking at what's that doing to our flywheel on both the demand and the supply side and how can we extrapolate that to think about ways to accelerate our growth even further in international."

One data point that Rachel shared is that 50% of people who were mask-only buyers in the third quarter came back and bought a nonmask item in the fourth quarter, which we think is really encouraging. So we do like what we see. And honestly, during this time of COVID, people have had fewer options. So they've turned to Etsy more often and they're generally delayed by what they see in almost every category. They're going to find a really broad assortment of products. They're going to find that they're priced well and getting something made just for you with a 100 note is just a better way to shop."

What does that see doing differently that is allowing you to keep by growth and volume is so strong? And then the second piece of the question is really specifically the different categories. Can you talk about specific category strength? How sustainable do you think the Home goods category is for you?

First, in terms of what we're doing differently, it's hard for me to say because I have a lot more access to information about what Etsy does and what our competitors do. So I can talk about what we're doing. And honestly, I think a big part of it is we stand for something different. There's a bunch of places you can go where you can buy the exact same thing as somewhere else. And maybe it's $0.02 cheaper and arrive an hour faster. And that's not always what people are solving for. And so I think the fact that we own a space in e-commerce that I think is both different and important is meaningful. And I think that, that means we have a real opportunity to grow share and continue to grow share over time. We're not following everyone else's playbook. And people are realizing more and more that Etsy is a different way to shop. And I think a better way to shop very often. So that, I think, is the most important thing. We are firing on all cylinders as best we can. So I think our Performance marketing team is doing great job. I think our brand marketing team is doing a great job. I think our product team has really been doing a lot of great work to ship great product improvements that make the customer experience better.
One of the things -- one of the questions I get often is sort of in what inning are you? Or how much good stuff is left at Etsy? One of the things that I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that hit rate went up. That's a fancy way of saying that a higher percentage of things we shipped in the fourth quarter had a really positive impact on the customer experience than in prior quarters. That would not suggest that we are running out of runway, rather, that we're getting better and better at unpacking new opportunities as we go. So I think the team is executing really well against the business that's differentiated. That's strong. When -- there was another part of your question around category mix. Largely, the same in the fourth quarter. Not -- I don't think a lot to report there. In terms of home furnishings, let's talk about that one for a minute.
Yes. Etsy is growing much faster than most players in home furnishings. And yet if you look at our total home furnishing sales versus the market for home furnishings, we are still a tiny part of the home furnishings market. And so I think there's an enormous amount of opportunity for Etsy to grow in home furnishings as with other categories. Your question about weddings. Weddings group about is growing about 30% year-over-year, which I think is a testament to the perseverance and creativity of the human spirit. In this moment in time, if you're finding a way to get married and get your community together virtually or whatnot, that's great. And so the fact that we're actually seeing weddings back to growing is a testament to our customers. But I hope that when people can get back together in person again, we might see weddings and events grow even faster, and that might be a tailwind for the business."

We're growing both of those metrics considerably.
We are opening up new channels for our Offsite Ads. We just announced, I think, yesterday that we have opened up some of our affiliate channels.

But we're learning more how TV and then mid-funnel things like video and other ads in social can really all work collectively to get us top of mind and have you start on Etsy and not start somewhere else, which I think is really helpful.

We're starting to get much more nuanced about, particularly in performance marketing, how to bid differently for different customers that might have a different lifetime value. But we're also learning more about what it is that drives loyalty. And part of what a habitual buyers figured out is she sort of figured out the hacks of Etsy to get the most out of Etsy. For example, she's really good at knowing what keywords to type into a search engine to get the kinds of satisfying results that she wants. She might know, for example, how to describe her sense of style in the way that a merchandiser would speak. And a lot of people don't have that kind of vocabulary, don't have that kind of language. And so when we talk about a big focus for 2021 and beyond being getting great search results when you don't know the words to describe it. I think a lot of that is how do we create the kind of experience habitual buyer has for other kinds of buyers, so they can see the wonder of Etsy in the way that habitual buyers do as well. I think there's a tremendous opportunity for us to make Etsy more accessible to more people, so they become habitual."

I don't know if we put enough tea leaves out there yet for you guys to like quantify it. But they have both been very meaningful drivers. And when we improve the product, the most common thing that happens is conversion rate goes up. You can also drive AOV up, you can drive frequency up. There's a lot of ways that making the product better is visible to us and the metrics. One of the most -- the fastest moving metric is usually conversion rate.
And so when the product team does something to make conversion rate higher, suddenly, the marketing team can spend more for a visit, right? The lifetime value effectively of every visit has gone up. When the product experience gets better, customer loyalty gets better. And that also allows us to market more. So there really is a virtuous circle to the two. But broadly speaking, I would say they have both been very meaningful. It's not really lopsided, where one is way bigger than the other.
I will mention again something Rachel said in her prepared remarks, which is, if you think about a squad, one product squad focusing on a customer problem. The traffic that, that squad is working on now has suddenly doubled. So if they were able to get an increase in conversion rate of x, the value of that is now twice what it was in 2019. And so the leverage we're getting out of our product organization is extraordinary. And it speaks to the fact that we really want to be hiring because I think there's a long road map of great initiatives, and there's frankly too many things on the cutting room floor right now. So it is a focus of ours to scale the team to keep up with the opportunity ahead of ours."

Just a reminder, on the way that we forecast and build our plans for our business is that we start with our baseline. So what would happen if we all just went home. And so there is some number there that our cohorts -- our older cohorts are very strong. They come and they're very reliable. They come back year after year after year, and that's the baseline. And then from there, we build on what is going to come to us incrementally through marketing and what we exactly might come to us incrementally through product. So you're asking the exact right question, how much is each of those incremental buckets. And I agree with Josh 100% that they work together. But the things that we're working on also are to bring back new buyers. So we added a significant number of new buyers, which doubled in the year. We are reactivating those older cohorts. So maybe cohorts that don't come even once a year we've reactivated those. And then we're working on the frequency of all of those groups to how often they come back. So we've been able to move the levers on all of those things through the 1, 2 punch of both product and marketing. Once they come to the site, we want to convert them, and the product really does the heavy lifting of converting that and having repeat that experience again."

It's 2 part question. First one is related to the U.K. So how did U.K. growth trend during the year versus mobility? So as people were moving around less, how did our growth move up? Or is it inversely correlated like that? Or is there some other thing going on with the U.K. growth? And then the second piece is about marketing spend. Are we looking to ramp up spend further in the U.K. and Germany this year?"

I would say that the growth rate in the U.K. was definitely impacted by lockdowns. The U.K. had some pretty strong lockdowns early in the spring and then again late in the year, and we definitely saw that on our site pretty strongly and pretty immediately. But the growth rate in the middle of 2020 in the U.K. was pretty good, too, when they eased lockdown. So the growth rate throughout the year was really good. But it was even stronger during lockdowns. I think that's a fair point.
We did invest more in the U.K. and Germany. Frankly, across our core European markets, we invested more. Part of that was just building better Martech capabilities. As I mentioned, getting those feeds to be better allowed us to invest more. We didn't change our discipline around ROI threshold, we just got better capabilities that allowed us to invest more and the timing was good because it was a very moment when demand was skyrocketing throughout Europe.
We are excited about the returns we're seeing in the higher funnel investments we're making in the U.K. and Germany. So you should expect us to continue to be investing in TV, for example, in the U.K. and Germany. And we're experimenting, like we did with the U.S., we're experimenting with wow, while spending that amount worked, but if we spend more. How does that work? And what's that marginal return curve look like. And so you'll see us experiment with that quarter-to-quarter in both the U.K. and Germany, I would expect in 2021."

Etsy emerges transformed, a larger and stronger marketplace as a result.
We understand that the stakes are high. Millions count on us now more so than ever, and I'm proud of our impact. We help to create economic opportunity for our sellers and led from the front on many important social issues. As a marketplace that gets better as it gets bigger, we believe that Etsy is now even better positioned to lead into the future.
When we look at our 2020 results, they were spectacular. Consolidated GMS was $10.3 billion, up 106% on a currency-neutral basis. Consolidated revenue was $1.7 billion, up 111%, with an EBITDA margin of approximately 32%. Said differently, we roughly achieved our 2023 aspirations in 2020. Rachel will provide more insights on Q4 in just a moment. But we're proud of our inclusion in the S&P 500, and it's yet another signal of the importance that the Etsy Marketplace is playing in the global economy.
And in fact, speaking of the global economy, 2020 was an extraordinary year for e-commerce overall as the growth rate of e-commerce roughly doubled as much of the offline world shut down. And as fast as e-commerce grew, Etsy grew much, much faster. In fact, Etsy grew almost 2.5x as fast as e-commerce. We had to change the y-axis of the graph just to accommodate it. Etsy is gaining meaningful share versus e-commerce because where the world is racing to offer the same thing priced maybe a little cheaper or shipping just a little faster, Etsy offers something truly unique, something truly special. And we're now seeing the power of that difference.
That growth helped Etsy to become one of the most visited e-commerce sites in the United States. In fact, we were the fourth largest retail e-commerce site by monthly visits, and we've become one of the most recognized e-commerce brands in the United States. People suddenly mention Etsy in the same breath as much larger retailers like Walmart or Target or eBay. And it's not just in the U.S. In fact, in the fourth quarter, international accounted for over 40% of all of the GMS on Etsy.
I'd like to take a moment to talk about the United Kingdom, which had a truly breakout year in 2020 with a growth rate of 189% year-over-year. As fast as Etsy grew, Etsy U.K. grew much, much faster. And Germany, our second largest e-commerce market, also more than doubled in 2020. What I'm most pleased about is the percentage of e-commerce on both of those sites, that's local, that's domestic, where both the buyer and the seller are located in the U.K. or in Germany, respectively. In the U.K., now more than 70% of trade is local. That means for people in the U.K., Etsy is very much a domestic platform where there's a sufficient vibrancy of both supply and demand for people to be able to come there for everyday needs. And we're seeing that in Germany, and I think that really speaks well to the power of our international opportunity overall.
Why? Well, one important reason is the ability of the Etsy Marketplace to meet rapidly evolving buyer needs. 2020 search trends highlight the dynamism of our marketplace. For example, in March, when the offline world largely shut down, demand for essentials on Etsy exploded. And our sellers almost instantaneously rose to meet those needs. And as trends evolve throughout the year from nesting and home office to home furnishings to outdoor events and reimagined events, things like virtual graduation ceremonies or lawn celebrations, our sellers were there to create and to deliver. In fact, if you can imagine it, it's very possible that people came to Etsy to make it and to buy it.
All of this resulted in dramatic growth across all of our buyer segments. Etsy added twice as many new buyers in 2020 as they did in 2019. In fact, there were many weeks in 2020 where Etsy added more than 1 million new buyers per week, and we reactivated 22 million lapsed buyers. These are buyers who hadn't shopped in Etsy in at least a year. And they've come back to Etsy in 2020 at a time when they really needed us most to find that Etsy is better in so many ways than the last version of Etsy that they might have visited possibly years ago.
I'm particularly excited about the growth of habitual buyers. Habitual buyers were yet again our fastest-growing segment in the fourth quarter. And habitual buyers grew 157% year-over-year. 
2020 was also a year when we grew the pie for many of our sellers. In fact, many of our sellers had their best year ever in 2020. GMS per seller was up 22%, while we simultaneously grew active sellers by 64%. We, of course, work hard to support our sellers by driving more sales. We also work hard to support our sellers in many other ways. For example, as governments in the United States and Europe drafted legislation to support our economy, Etsy was a very vocal advocate, making sure that governments remember that independent workers, people like sellers on Etsy, also matter and that we need to design our legislation and our economic reform with them in mind.
Speaking of working hard, I'm incredibly proud of our team and how well they transitioned under very trying circumstances. At a time when they suddenly need to work entirely remote and face all of the stresses that everyone is facing in the external environment, our team rose to the challenge and were more productive than ever. As one example, experiment velocity grew 16% year-over-year while we simultaneously had higher hit rate than we did in the prior year. What that means is that each team was working hard and making a lot of progress making the product experience on Etsy even better.
In addition to that, site traffic was up very substantially. And what that means is that the productivity of every team is automatically higher. The ROI of every squad is higher. We continue to make investments aligned with our right to win that we believe are making the product experience at Etsy materially better. For example, we've talked a lot about the importance of search and discovery on Etsy. And here, we show some examples of how the search experience continues to get better and better. Our initial investments in dynamic ranking and semantic gap have laid the foundation for personalized search, which is making it easier for buyers to find what they're looking for and to be inspired from among our over 85 million items.
Buyers are now scrolling through fewer listings, which is making search less overwhelming and more rewarding. And of course, it's about so much more than just search. We continue to make investments to improve the product experience in many, many ways. Two examples in the fourth quarter were the launch of installment payments and the ability to filter searches around expected delivery dates. So you can see just items that are going to arrive within your time frame.
And just as our product experience improved, so has our brand awareness. We made significant strides in marketing in 2020, expanding the visibility of our brand globally. Our brand team launched 5 different creative campaigns in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, with a record number of impressions and share of voice to cut through. And we expanded our performance marketing and our CRM campaigns very materially, equipping our teams with more resources and better tools within our Martech stack and turbocharging the success of our performance marketing campaigns through our Offsite Ads program. Our top of mind awareness has grown, and we have so much room yet to grow it further.
I also want to take a minute to highlight some of the critical infrastructure investments we make that maybe aren't as obvious to the outside world but are so important to our success as a business. For example, I'd like to give a shout out to our member services and trust and safety teams. In early spring, demand on Etsy suddenly instantaneously and unexpectedly more than doubled. And of course, that created a dramatic increase in customer support and trust and safety tickets. And our team rose to that challenge and delivered against the very high levels of customer satisfaction that our customers expect and deserve. That's only possible because of the tooling and the infrastructure and the capabilities that we have built as a team over the past several years.
And in addition to providing high-quality customer support, we work very hard to make customer support at Etsy ever more human. In fact, in the fourth quarter of 2020, 73% of customer contacts were handled real time, meaning they're voice or chat, which is quite a dramatic change from where we were just 2 years ago.
2 years ago, we described to all of you our long-term right to win strategy, which propelled our growth in 2020 and is more relevant than ever. We're building upon that momentum to deepen and strengthen in each of the 4 areas that make up our right to win. We didn't pivot to meet the demands of 2020. Rather, we doubled down on this strategy, which has allowed us to meet the demands in 2020 and we believe will continue to strengthen our business for years to come. 
We have a deep passion for the Etsy community, specifically our buyers and sellers who come to Etsy to express themselves or to turn their creative passion into a business. We believe that the opportunity is large. The shift in customer behavior has brought more sales online, and we know that for almost every purchase occasion, we have something delightful on Etsy to offer.
In 2021, our focus areas will be centered around things that continue to differentiate the Etsy experience from all of the other players in e-commerce. In search and discovery, our big tracks of work involve making it easier to find just the right thing even when you don't have the right words to describe it and helping to surprise and inspire people, being a place where buyers can come and browse, lean back and find inspiration.
Personalization is a very important focus, helping people to find things they didn't even ask for but know it when they see it. And we've barely begun to unpack the opportunity in personalization. We'll lean into this in superhuman ways, combining the latest of AI with human curation, leveraging the power of our community and our team to help curate items and use those to train models to become ever more personalized.
We want to leverage the distinct power of our growing community to help make Etsy less overwhelming and made just for you. And we'll do all of this in ways that make Etsy even more human. For example, leveraging video. Unlike most products, every item on Etsy comes with a story. Every seller has his or her own story. And video is a powerful way to tell those stories. Plus, we can show buyers how the items look, how they feel, even how they sound. This is a great example of how we have so much more runway to more richly connect buyers and sellers. And once you find just the right item, you need the confidence to be willing to buy it.
In 2021, we're going to be very focused on the post-purchase experience, being transparent about when you can expect an item to arrive, being purposeful about when to communicate that in the purchase journey, making sure our sellers have all the right information that they need to meet the deadlines and letting buyers know that we have their back in case anything goes wrong. As we work to become a habit for buyers, it becomes even more important that they trust us and see Etsy as reliable. We'll have so much more to tell you about our product road map as we progress throughout the year, but we couldn't be more excited about what's on deck for 2021.
And I'd like to take just a minute to talk about Reverb, another example of the beauty of a 2-sided marketplace, especially when combined with strong execution in product and marketing. Reverb also had a fantastic 2020, growing faster than their market. And the company recently laid out their rights to win, their long-term strategy with key differentiators, which mirror Etsy's own and show just how much opportunity there is to grow the Reverb platform.
I also want to highlight our virtuous cycle and the progress that we've made in our economic, social and ecological pillars to benefit all of our stakeholders. Etsy has always believed that being a good citizen makes us an even stronger and more resilient business. And 2020 demonstrated that people are looking to shop their values. They're looking to put their money where their heart is. And they hold businesses to a higher standard.
Since announcing our impact strategy in 2017, we've continued to evolve and update our goals. We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in this past year. But we're not resting on our laurels. We're setting some aggressive new targets for 2021 and beyond, creating a more diverse, equitable and sustainable marketplace and supply chain to expand our economic impact. Etsy's economic output is now similar to the city of Houston. 
We're continuing to build on our diverse and inclusive workforce at Etsy and at Reverb. I'm proud of the fact that, for example, we doubled the percentage of our leadership team that are underrepresented minorities. And we sourced 100% of our electricity from renewables. We've set a new goal, which is to be net 0 emissions by 2030.
Most importantly, you'll be able to read more about in our soon-to-be-filed integrated annual report where we're now using both the SASB and the TCFD frameworks to help you better track all of our strategies and progress. As we look forward over many years, we continue to believe that e-commerce is consolidating around fewer and fewer scaled e-commerce platforms. And we believe that Etsy is better positioned than ever to be one of those few scaled platforms, a brand which rises above the rest by standing for something truly unique and different, standing for the individual creators and for keeping commerce human.
I believe Etsy can and should be a massive force in the world. The world has taken notice, and we have strong conviction that our opportunity is bigger than ever.
I'd like to close by thanking our team once again for their passion, their creativity and their conviction. And now I'll turn it over to Rachel."

My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and Etsy's stand-alone results where appropriate.On a consolidated basis, Etsy's fourth quart",2549,"Thanks, Josh, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our Q4 earnings call. My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and Etsy's stand-alone results where appropriate.
On a consolidated basis, Etsy's fourth quarter GMS grew 118% to $3.6 billion. Revenue grew 129% to $617 million. And we delivered adjusted EBITDA of nearly $192 million, capping off a strong year where we achieved industry-leading growth and record profitability. Etsy's stand-alone Q4 GMS grew 127% to $3.4 billion. Our disciplined investment strategy and strong execution drove more adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter than in all of 2019.
Top line growth exceeded our Q4 guidance, which had projected a steeper decelerating GMS trend due primarily to 2 factors: first, masks contracting as a percent of overall GMS; and second, the uncertainty of consumer spending patterns and global economies related to the pandemic.
As Josh mentioned earlier, international growth was robust in 2020. In Q4, consolidated international GMS expanded 500 basis points sequentially to 40% of overall GMS. International GMS was up 140% on a constant currency basis and was driven in part by strong trends in the U.K. and Germany. Our fastest-growing trade route in the fourth quarter was once again our domestic sales between buyers and sellers within the same country.
It's also worth noting that we are disclosing U.K. revenue, which is based on the location of the seller, for the first time as it was more than 10% for 2020 at $196 million. We're adding India as a core market, bringing our total focus markets to 7, given heightened investments we've been making to build the foundation of incredible inventory from creative entrepreneurs in that country.
Etsy had an exceptional holiday as the shopping season started earlier and growth rates exceeded prior years, providing a meaningful tailwind in the quarter, setting some exciting records as shown on this slide. We told you on our last call how we would be investing heavily in product and marketing to make Etsy a wonderful holiday shopping destination, and these investments really paid off. Etsy's peak holiday shopping day was Small Business Saturday. Growth was up 150% year-over-year, and we generated over $50,000 in GMS per minute. This is especially important as it gives them more than 4 million small businesses on our platform relevance and a voice during this important time in retail.
We also continue to see growth in our top 6 categories with homewares and home furnishings, our largest and fastest-growing category, growing 226% during the 5 days of Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. All of the work we've done to keep Etsy top of mind and ensure we could handle the surge in activity enabled us to deliver great results. Not only did our holiday season start earlier, we also peaked higher and sustained strengths longer than in prior holiday periods.
We saw continued strong growth across many of our categories to end 2020, especially in our top 6, which for all of 2020 represented over 80% of Etsy GMS growing 85% year-over-year. You can see the full year category growth on this slide. Globally, Etsy's growth is distributed in over 50 different retail categories. Outside of the top 6 categories, full year growth was 115%, excluding mask sales, powered by segments such as toys and games and pet supplies. As expected, mask sales continued to contract as a percent of overall GMS to 4% in Q4, down from 11% in Q3 and 14% in Q2, a trend which we expect to continue.
Following the steady trend of 93% year-over-year growth in Q2 and Q3, nonmask GMS growth accelerated sequentially to 118% in Q4. In addition, we're seeing very healthy underlying trends from mask buyers. Of the 3 million mask-only buyers in Q3, approximately 50% returned in Q4 for a nonmask purchase. This is up 12 percentage points compared to Q3, a great signal, but we are retaining and converting buyers who are coming to Etsy for some of their essential purchases.
Consolidated Q4 revenue was driven by growth in both marketplace and services revenue, in particular, key drivers for GMS volume, Etsy Payments, Etsy Ads and Offsite Ads revenue. Etsy Ads, Offsite Ads and our expanded Etsy Payments platform combined helped to sustain take rate at 17.1% in Q4, a quarter where historically take rates contract due to seasonality. We continue to make strides in bolstering our advertising products and initiatives to help sellers drive velocity in the marketplace and take control of their success.
On a consolidated basis, onsite Etsy Ads and Reverb's bump offering grew 74% year-over-year with both marketplaces improving our ad platforms and enhance the functionality and user experience for sellers and show more relevant ads to buyers. Etsy's Offsite Ads continue to yield encouraging returns, with opt-out rates remaining less than 2%. We're optimizing return and channel mix for our sellers' listings, now incorporating buyer segment information in the signals we send to our ad partners, including differentiated LTVs to drive efficiency. 
In the second half of 2020, 9% of Etsy's stand-alone GMS earned an Offsite Ads fee. This effective increase in take rate enables us to invest more on behalf of our sellers while maintaining our ROI threshold. From a seller's perspective, the return on ad spend is in the range of 6x to 8x on the high end for any ad product. And this is a risk-free investment since the seller only pays the fee when she makes a sale. 
Gross margin was 76%, up 920 basis points compared to last year and continue to benefit from our shift to Offsite Ads, which delivers incremental revenue without an equal offset in cost of revenue. And to a lesser extent, the change to Reverb's transaction fee also expanded gross margin in Q4 since this was the first full quarter of consolidated P&L benefit.
We're scaling our investments in 2 ways, both in marketing and product development. On this slide, we've shown you marketing as a percentage of GMS versus buyer growth to illustrate how we scaled marketing to drive returns. As you know, we've been leaning in more heavily to upper-funnel channels, in particular, and these investments are having the desired impact. For example, in the fourth quarter, we saw year-over-year improvements in prompted and unprompted awareness and positive gains in several key brand metrics. We also track monthly movement in brand familiarity, emotional closeness, relevance and everydayness and are seeing strong progress here as well.
I want to highlight some specifics around our Q4 TV investments. As mentioned last quarter, we ran 2 separate TV campaigns during the holiday period, one aimed to drive purchases and another designed to build brand affinity and deepen the emotional connection to Etsy. Both campaigns, in addition to various other efforts in media and PR, earned Etsy's marketing team as one of Ad Age's Marketers of the Year alongside some of the world's most well-known brands. Overall, both campaigns outperformed our expectations, driving visits and conversion rate and ultimately incremental GMS, despite an increase in CPMs as many retailers stepped up spend to close the year.
Q4 consolidated marketing spend was $211 million, up 151% year-over-year. Brand marketing spend, which includes television and digital video, was 23% of our consolidated marketing spend in Q4 and 24% in Q4 last year versus 18% in Q3. This represents approximately $49 million of the spend in the fourth quarter.
In our performance marketing channels, we've rapidly scaled our spend as a result of Offsite Ads. Performance marketing spend was $147 million, up 193% year-over-year and up 65% compared to last quarter. We're also hard at work improving our owned channels, building out use cases for our new CRM tools such as personalized e-mails or targeted push notifications. We're investing to drive efficiencies in each and every channel across the funnel to bring in new buyers and drive frequency.
The other lever for improvement in GMS is our investment in product development, which you can see illustrated on this slide. This spend drives higher conversion rate from new and repeat buyers and increased frequency. The impact of this investment is evident both in our GMS growth, our experiment velocity and accelerated hiring with a larger product development investment as seen on our P&L. We ended the year with 1,414 employees, an increase of 14% compared to last year. As Josh mentioned earlier, we're getting twice the leverage from our product teams with an ambitious investment road map.
Moving to our operating metrics. We are really pleased with the continued increases in new buyers and reactivation of our large base of existing buyers. For example, in the fourth quarter, active buyers grew 77% year-over-year to approximately $81 million for the Etsy Marketplace and a 92% increase in new and reactivated buyers. GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis grew 13% year-over-year, driven in part by habitual buyers, which grew over 157% in Q4. This is up from 100% growth in the third quarter, the third quarter of sequential acceleration in this valuable segment. Also, 11% of repeat buyers in Q3 became habitual buyers in Q4, and we now have 6.5 million habitual buyers.
In addition to our habitual buyers, many of our other buyer segments exhibited tremendous growth. For example, repeat buyers, those who made purchases on 2 or more days in a 12-month period, grew 97% to $32 million, approximately 20 percentage points faster than overall active buyers and a sequential acceleration compared to last quarter.
2020 was an unprecedented year as all of our buyer cohorts inflected higher during the period. Slide 35 shows 2020 GMS per buyer and the year-over-year growth from each of our last 5 cohorts. We're pleased to see that our older cohorts, such as the 2015 cohort, who have been on the platform for 5 years, generated the highest GMS per buyer and grew as fast as our more recent cohorts. For our newer cohorts in 2020, we've seen a meaningful improvement in their purchase behavior. Approximately 22% of new buyers in 2020 became repeat buyers within 60 days of their first purchase, up from 16% in 2019. These data points are indicative that the underlying trends in our marketplace continue to improve.
Moving to the balance sheet. As of 12/31, we had $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, in addition to a $200 million revolver that is currently undrawn. In Q4, we repurchased $78 million of our stock or 618,841 shares at an average price of $125 per share. We've now completed the November 2018 buyback program, repurchasing approximately $200 million of stock or roughly 3 million shares at an average price of $64.80. Our Board of Directors recently authorized a new $250 million stock repurchase program.
And turning to our outlook. While it is our normal practice to provide annual guidance as a basic framework for our business, given the continued uncertainties facing Etsy, e-commerce at large and global macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending, we are only providing guidance for Q1 at this time. We currently estimate Q1 consolidated GMS to be approximately $3 billion, up about 115% to 125% compared to Q1 of last year; revenue of $513 million to $536 million, up 125% to 135% versus last year; and adjusted EBITDA of $168 million to $178 million with a margin in the range of 32% to 34%.
In giving this outlook for Q1, we have the benefit of nearly 2 months of the quarter already in the books. January was very strong, but it was clear to us it was helped in part by a tailwind from stimulus checks. We want to call this out as we do not currently expect to have the same tailwind in Q2 and, in fact, can already see that February relative to January is less strong without that boost from stimulus. Furthermore, the recent weather events in the South and the Pacific Northwest had a very clear impact on our GMS in the past week, another reminder that certain unpredictable macro events beyond our control are apt to create volatility in our performance.
As you update your models and think about the cadence of growth for 2021 and beyond, we'd like to remind you of a few things. During the latter part of Q1, Etsy will lap a period of negative growth rates that spanned from mid- to late March 2020. The outlook I just gave for Q1 includes several weeks of comping this low point. Then, as you recall, on April 2, 2020, we saw the start of significant unprecedented growth initially catalyzed by demand for face masks. In total, 2020 face masks exceeded $740 million, with $346 million in Q2 and $264 million in Q3. While face masks versus nonface masks GMS trends have certainly been encouraging, our expectation is that year-over-year quarterly growth rate comparisons will be challenging when you eliminate the face mask sales from your forward models.
In 2020, Etsy growth outpaced the broader e-commerce sector. While we are not giving the full year guidance today, it may be informative to look at third-party data and research on how they are projecting growth for the industry this year. It suggests that for the sector, Q1 2021 growth will be approximately in line with Q4 2020 and that the industry will start to more rapidly decelerate starting in Q2 with the majority of incremental growth for the year realized in the first quarter. It remains our ambition to continue to outgrow e-commerce, propelled by the underlying changes we've seen in the marketplace and the heightened awareness of our differentiated brand.
However, we also know, we hope, that as the world opens up later this year, consumers will soon be able to spend more of their money on travel, dining and entertainment. And this will create some headwind in Etsy's growth relative to 2020.
Last note on the revenue outlook. Historically, there is some favorable seasonality to our first quarter take rate. This year, we also benefit from Offsite Ads, additional Etsy Payment geographies and Reverb's higher transaction fee. As we think about the quarterly cadence of take rate throughout the year, Q1 may represent the high-water mark for 2021 take rate.
On expenses, 2 points to keep in mind. First, we want to reiterate that our revenue per headcount is significantly higher than our peers and results in margins that are stronger than we want given the many opportunities we see to invest for growth. So as you think about expense trends and margin drivers, keep in mind that we are investing in talent and accelerating our pace of hiring in 2021 with a particular focus on product and engineering.
Second, we exceed the revenue threshold in many international geographies for collecting and remitting digital sales tax. This obligation will grow as our business continues to expand. We have more conviction than ever to invest in our business for the long term, building top of mind awareness in the hearts and minds of consumers and continuing to gain market share. We're building on our momentum, and we expect to continue to capitalize on our large market opportunity.
Thank you for your time today. I will now turn the call over to Deb so we can take your questions."

We have a lot of questions in the chat box. So I'll just dive right in. If you have any additional questions, feel free to add them in as well.
The first question is from Rick Patel at Needham & Company. Can you update us on where you are in the personalization journey? What did you learn in 2020? And what can we look forward to in 2021? At what point will you have enough data and analytics to go beyond search and use personalization as a predictive tool? 
Josh, I think we should start with you on that one."

And you're right that we started with search. I think we're in very early innings. And you can think about personalization very narrowly as knowing, for example, how we've started, what things have you searched for in the past, what things have you favorited in the past, what have you bought in the past and using that to inform your search results.
But taking the aperture out further, having a deeper understanding of what that might imply of your sense of style and understanding things like what style are all of these 80-plus million items, what are other people who bought these also been interested in, what might complete the look of this. It might not be that item at all, but it might be other things that match with that item. These are all areas of personalization, where we have not really even begun. And so I think we have a tremendous amount of opportunity still to go. 
What we have learned, which is not surprising to us or anyone, is that it is actually valuable. Even in our first launches in personalization, it makes the experience better. It makes conversion rate go up. We're very optimistic about what it can do. 
So if I think about personalization to your point of where else can you go, search and discovery, which I would think of as a lean and you type in a query at Etsy and we give you a more personalized set of results, is where we've started. Lean back is another opportunity for personalization. So think what kind of recommendations can we present to you, what kinds of things can we show you that would inspire you that you didn't even think to ask for but we happen to know that other people like you are interested.
And the other bucket that I think is very exciting is Offsite. When we are marketing to you, being on Facebook or Google or elsewhere, the ability to know more about you and be even more personalized in terms of how we reach out to you is an opportunity that I think is large and will continue to get better and better over time."

One of the wonderful things about a 2-sided marketplace like Etsy is that it gets better as it gets bigger. There's a virtuous cycle that's turning. And so the growth in Etsy in our core international markets has been strong in the past but was truly extraordinary in 2020. And if I look at the U.K. in particular, which really had a breakout year, it does feel like that virtuous cycle just turned more and more. 
So it appears to us that going from a top 20 e-commerce brand to a top 10 e-commerce brand appears to have a really positive impact on our business, and going from top 10 to top 5 has a really positive impact in terms of brand awareness in the market. And it makes sense because what's happening is we're bringing vibrancy. We're bringing more sellers with more items so you can shop domestically more. And we're getting more buyers, which brings more sellers.
So part of what we're learning is what might be mechanisms where we can accelerate that brand awareness. How can we invest? There's a natural growth curve, which we ride, but how can we invest to make that happen even faster? You are seeing us do things like brand marketing in both the U.K. and in Germany. And as we always do with Etsy, we're very data driven. We're very experiment driven. And we're looking at what's that doing to our flywheel on both the demand and the supply side and how can we extrapolate that to think about ways to accelerate our growth even further in international."

Not consumer electronics. I mean there's a couple of -- not travel. There's a few things, categories out there. But for the most part, things you need to buy and use, you can find them on Etsy. And our consumers are learning that more and more. 
One data point that Rachel shared is that 50% of people who were mask-only buyers in the third quarter came back and bought a nonmask item in the fourth quarter, which we think is really encouraging. So we do like what we see. And honestly, during this time of COVID, people have had fewer options. So they've turned to Etsy more often and they're generally delighted by what they see in almost every category. They're going to find a really broad assortment of products. They're going to find that they're priced well. And getting something made just for you with a handwritten note is just a better way to shop."

And then we've been -- we talked about this last time as well, but the number of buyers that make cross-category purchases was 17% in 2020. So that's buyers that came 4 -- 4 or more purchases across 2 or more categories. And so we're really seeing people exploring. I love the metric that Josh just threw out there, too, about the nonmask buyers coming back another time. And that really shows that the new buyers that we've obtained and the ones that we've reactivated are really exploring Etsy and understand the breadth of product that we have."

What is Etsy doing differently that is allowing you to keep buyer growth and volume so strong? And then the second piece of the question is really specifically to the different categories. Can you talk about specific category strength? How sustainable do you think the home goods category is for you? What are our expectations for weddings and bridal showers this year, which are typically important for you in Q2 to Q3? That's the many pieces.
Maybe, Josh, you want to start and then -- yes."

First, in terms of what we're doing differently, it's hard for me to say because I have a lot more access to information about what Etsy does than what our competitors do. So I can talk about what we're doing. And honestly, I think a big part of it is we stand for something different. There's a bunch of places you can go where you can buy the exact same thing as somewhere else. And maybe it's $0.02 cheaper and will arrive an hour faster. And that's not always what people are solving for. 
And so I think the fact that we own a space in e-commerce that I think is both different and important is meaningful. And I think that, that means we have a real opportunity to grow share and continue to grow share over time. We're not following everyone else's playbook. And people are realizing more and more that Etsy is a different way to shop and, I think, a better way to shop very often. 
So that, I think, is the most important thing. We are firing on all cylinders as best we can. So I think our performance marketing team is doing great job. I think our brand marketing team is doing a great job. I think our product team has really been doing a lot of great work to ship great product improvements that make the customer experience better.
One of the things -- one of the questions I get often is sort of in what inning are you or how much good stuff is left at Etsy. One of the things that I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that hit rate went up. That's a fancy way of saying that a higher percentage of things we shipped in the fourth quarter had a really positive impact on the customer experience than in prior quarters. That would not suggest that we are running out of runway, rather, that we're getting better and better at unpacking new opportunities as we go. So I think the team is executing really well against the business that's differentiated. That's strong. 
When -- there was another part of your question around category mix. Largely the same in the fourth quarter. Not -- I don't think a lot to report there. 
In terms of home furnishings, let's talk about that one for a minute. Yes. Etsy is growing much faster than most players in home furnishings. And yet if you look at our total home furnishing sales versus the market for home furnishings, we are still a tiny part of the home furnishings market. And so I think there's an enormous amount of opportunity for Etsy to grow in home furnishings as with other categories. 
Your question about weddings. Weddings grew about -- is growing about 30% year-over-year, which I think is a testament to the perseverance and creativity of the human spirit. In this moment in time, if you're finding a way to get married and get your community together virtually or whatnot, that's great. And so the fact that we're actually seeing weddings back to growing is a testament to our customers. But I hope that when people can get back together in person again, we might see weddings and events grow even faster, and that might be a tailwind for the business."

We're starting to get much more nuanced about, particularly in performance marketing, how to bid differently for different customers that might have a different lifetime value. But we're also learning more about what it is that drives loyalty. 
And part of what a habitual buyers figured out is she sort of figured out the hacks of Etsy to get the most out of Etsy. For example, she's really good at knowing what keywords to type into a search engine to get the kinds of satisfying results that she wants. She might know, for example, how to describe her sense of style in the way that a merchandiser would speak. And a lot of people don't have that kind of vocabulary, don't have that kind of language. 
And so when we talk about a big focus for 2021 and beyond being -- getting great search results when you don't know the words to describe it, I think a lot of that is how do we create the kind of experience a habitual buyer has for other kinds of buyers so they can see the wonder of Etsy in the way that habitual buyers do as well. I think there's a tremendous opportunity for us to make Etsy more accessible to more people, so they become habitual."

And you're going to get it at a cost that is not egregious. 
And all of those things we've been working on with considerable effort.

I also think we've been patient and picky. Our core business, we think, is at the early stages of having -- unpacking its growth potential, and we want to make sure that we keep our eye on the prize.

I don't know if we've put enough tea leaves out there yet for you guys to like quantify it. But they have both been very meaningful drivers. And when we improve the product, the most common thing that happens is conversion rate goes up. You can also drive AOV up. You can drive frequency up. There's a lot of ways that making the product better is visible to us and the metrics. One of the most -- the fastest-moving metric is usually conversion rate.
And so when the product team does something to make conversion rate higher, suddenly, the marketing team can spend more for a visit, right? The lifetime value effectively of every visit has gone up. When the product experience gets better, customer loyalty gets better. And that also allows us to market more. So there really is a virtuous circle to the 2. But broadly speaking, I would say they have both been very meaningful. It's not really lopsided, where one is way bigger than the other.
I will mention again something Rachel said in her prepared remarks, which is if you think about a squad, one product squad focusing on a customer problem, the traffic that, that squad is working on now has suddenly doubled. So if they were able to get an increase in conversion rate of x, the value of that is now twice what it was in 2019. And so the leverage we're getting out of our product organization is extraordinary. And it speaks to the fact that we really want to be hiring because I think there's a long road map of great initiatives, and there's frankly too many things on the cutting room floor right now. So it is a focus of ours to scale the team to keep up with the opportunity ahead of ours."

And so there is some number there that our cohorts -- our older cohorts are very strong. They come -- and they're very reliable. They come back year after year after year, and that's the baseline. And then from there, we build on what is going to come to us incrementally through marketing and what we expect might come to us incrementally through product. 
So you're asking the exact right question, how much is each of those incremental buckets. And I agree with Josh 100% that they work together. But the things that we're working on also are to bring back new buyers. So we added a significant number of new buyers, which doubled in the year. We are reactivating those older cohorts. So maybe cohorts that don't come even once a year. We've reactivated those. And then we're working on the frequency of all of those groups to how often they come back. 
So we've been able to move the levers on all of those things through the 1, 2 punch of both product and marketing. Once they come to the site, we want to convert them, and the product really does the heavy lifting of converting them and having them repeat that experience again."

I would say that the growth rate in the U.K. was definitely impacted by lockdowns. The U.K. had some pretty strong lockdowns early in the spring and then again late in the year, and we definitely saw that on our site pretty strongly and pretty immediately. But the growth rate in the middle of 2020 in the U.K. was pretty good, too, when they eased lockdown. So the growth rate throughout the year was really good. But it was even stronger during lockdowns. I think that's a fair point.
We did invest more in the U.K. and Germany. Frankly, across our core European markets, we invested more. Part of that was just building better Martech capabilities. As I mentioned, getting those feeds to be better allowed us to invest more. We didn't change our discipline around ROI threshold. We just got better capabilities that allowed us to invest more, and the timing was good because it was a very moment when demand was skyrocketing throughout Europe.
We are excited about the returns we're seeing in the higher-funnel investments we're making in the U.K. and Germany. So you should expect us to continue to be investing in TV, for example, in the U.K. and Germany. And we're experimenting, like we did with the U.S., we're experimenting with, wow, while spending that amount worked, what if we spend more. How does that work? And what's that marginal return curve look like? And so you'll see us experiment with that quarter-to-quarter in both the U.K. and Germany, I would expect, in 2021."

Q1 was another really strong quarter for Etsy in terms of its financial results and also in terms of its corporate citizenship. I'd like to start this evening by talking a little bit about some of those citizenship efforts. 
Etsy continues to speak out against racism and harassment. For example, in the first quarter, we donated $500,000 to support the AAPI community, and we continue to invest in highlighting the wonderful work of many different underrepresented sellers within our buyer community. For example, our partnership with the [ GE Spend ] from Alabama, I'm delighted to report that many of the [ GE Spend ] shops sold out within the first 24 hours of the launch of that initiative. 
Etsy also launched Donate to Change where buyers can round up to support the uplift fund, which provides a path to entrepreneurship for many different communities. And we had over 1 million buyers round up to support the uplift fund in just the last 6 weeks of the quarter. 
Third, Etsy continues to deepen its commitment to environmental sustainability, announcing our goal to be net zero by 2030. This continues to pave our pathway as a trailbreaker with one of the most ambitious targets of any of our peer group. 
As I said, our Q1 results were excellent. Consolidated GMS was $3.1 billion, up 128% year-over-year. And that's really the result of strength in the core and continued positive momentum in frequency. 
You'll also notice that we came in above the top of guidance, guidance that we gave in late February. Most of that overshoot relative to guidance was due to the impact of stimulus, and Rachel is going to talk about that more in her section. 
The core business did great in Q1. Our customer cohorts continued to show that we're driving increased frequency and engagement from all of our different buyer segments. Etsy added 16 million new or reactivated buyers in the quarter for a total of 90 million active buyers, up 91% year-over-year. And I'm particularly pleased that our fastest-growing segment yet again was habitual buyers, our most loyal and engaged buyers. We now have 8 million habitual buyers, and that was up 200% year-over-year. 
Building on this expanded base, we are laser-focused on driving frequency. And of course, frequency can be driven in part by your marketing initiatives, things to make you more front of mind for customers, but it's also critical that we have a customer experience that in and of itself is engaging and [ lives ] activity. And so we've been launching efforts across the spectrum. And to depict just a few, [indiscernible] are something we launched recently. And that allows a buyer to come and tell us more about their particular tastes and their particular interests in a light and fun way, that not only makes that visit more engaging in session, but it gives us important information to help bring that buyer back more often to have more satisfying experiences in the future. 
We've been working a lot on buyer triggers as well, things to notify people through app pushes, through e-mails and other things that there's something new or interesting that's happening. For example, that an IMU favorite in the past has gone on sale. And when they come back to the site, we've been investing in an update tab in the app. Think of that as your daily feed for what's changed since you've last been here. Maybe an item you've left in your cart has gone on sale. Or here's some new favorites that you might be interested into add to your list. It's very encouraging to see that now 13% of app visits include a visit to the updates tab, and 27% of those visits have buyers clicking on one or more of the listings that we include in updates. 
And the fourth pillar is strategic discounting where we've launched a tool that allows our team to rapidly test and then automate and scale different types of discounts to very finely tuned customer segments. So $5 off, for example, on your next purchase. 
I've never been more excited about our product road map. We continue to make investments that we believe are driving long-term value, making the customer experience better. 
I know we show you this slide a lot, but it really is how we drive focus and prioritization within our product organization focused on each of these 4 pillars. We start within each pillar by saying what customer experiences do we want to focus on to truly uplift? We then ask what are the fewest initiatives that could have the most impact in those customer experiences. And then we assign very specific goals so it's clear what success looks like and here's what your constraints are to squads who are owned -- who own the success of those different initiatives. 
So let me take a second now to show you the priorities within each of these 4 pillars for 2021. Within search, we have 4 focus areas. Personalization is about making Etsy feel more like it's made just for you. Buyer pathways is about making it easier to find the things you want, whether or not you would actually put a search query into the search engine; and making sure that we have few, and hopefully no, dead ends. 
Closing the semantic gap is about taking what you happen to enter into a search engine and interpreting that for what you actually meant you wanted. And of course, all of this relies upon an infrastructure that is fast and reliable and scalable. 
Double-clicking on personalization, just to show you an example of that pillar, we launched the ability to personalize the search results recently, and we're seeing really encouraging gains from that. But we're still very much in early innings, consuming more data to understand more about what that customer wants and then delivering, through more sophisticated models, ever more personalized search results. 
But it doesn't end with just the search results themselves. We actually believe that over time, we can customize the entire experience. So here you see an example of how the layout itself might be different for 2 different customer segments. And our ambition over time is to create ever more finely tuned customer segments that are built through multivariate models powered by machine learning, so that Etsy truly feels made just for you. 
I'd also highlight on this slide a couple of the infrastructure improvements that have led to material gains in the past quarter. For example, the shift made the search results faster, which resulted in increases in click and conversion rate. And we're able to expand the search results for long-tail queries, leading to more satisfying buying experiences there as well. 
What makes the Etsy marketplace truly special is that every item and every seller has a story and a story you'd actually be interested to hear. And there's nothing more powerful than video to help to tell that story. 
We also encourage conversations directly between the buyer and seller, something you'll see in few of any other marketplaces, because those convos help the buyer and seller to co-create, personalize or customize or even just to form community. That's one of the things most different and special about Etsy, and we think investing in this pillar is critically important. 
One example of where we're leading in is in video itself. Sellers have now uploaded about 5 million videos to the Etsy site. That's up 36% quarter-over-quarter. And we're seeing very encouraging progress when a listing includes a video, that buyers engage with it more click and even convert more. But the listing page is only the beginning of where we can be using video to tell the story of Etsy, tell the story of the item and to help people to engage even more often throughout the site. So expect to see more video and more places making the Etsy experience even more dynamic.
The third pillar is trust, and we have 4 focus areas within trust. First is speed expectation. That's making it very clear when you can expect the item to arrive. 
Second is delivery predictability. Where is this item in the fulfillment process? Being made or currently being shipped to you? 
Third is issue resolution, making it even easier to access support and know that we have your back on the rare instance that something goes wrong. 
And fourth is seller reputation. This is around giving sellers even more visibility into how they're performing versus key customer satisfaction metrics as well as setting the bar for what good looks like, so that we create more of a sense of agency among the sellers for how they can drive success in their business, and create a race to the top where the buyer experience improves as a result for all of our buyers. 
Taking seller reputation as an example and showing how we can apply that to fulfillment, on the left you see a new dashboard we've launched within the seller dashboard. And here it shows the seller very clearly which items are expected to ship today, which ones ship tomorrow, which ones ship next week. So they know exactly where they should be focusing their time and energy. 
We've also been focusing on dashboards that show how they're doing versus fulfillment expectations relative to our expectations of what good looks like, so that again they focus their energy. And we've set the standard together on how we can deliver a consistently great customer experience to our buyers that feels predictable for all of our sellers. 
The foundation of Etsy's right to win is our sellers collection of unique items. I know I've told you in the past that 90% of buyers report that they come to Etsy for items that they can't find anywhere else. And in fact, one of the most special parts of Etsy is that most things on Etsy can be personalized and customized. And in fact, we find that buyers are 20% more likely to make a purchase when they're looking for customized or personalized items. So a focus for this year is going to be even more specifically highlighting and showcasing items that can be personalized and customized as well as streamlining that process of co-creation between the buyer and the seller. 
But of course, what good is this great collection of unique items if we don't tell the world about it? In fact, we launched a brand-new campaign called Bye Bye Boring, and I'd like to pause to show you one of the spots in that new campaign. 
[Presentation] 
Given the performance that we've seen in the U.S. from our television campaigns, we're interested to see whether investments in television can actually accelerate our flywheel in some international markets and get us to scale even faster. So we're going to be experimenting, leaning in more in the U.K. and in Germany to see how above-the-line marketing can drive brand awareness and more [ invitation ] and get us spinning faster. 
I'd like to show you now an example of a campaign we're going to run in Germany. Germany is a market that's different than the U.S. and the U.K. in that awareness there is substantially lower, although we are seeing very positive momentum. So there's more work that needs to be done to introduce Etsy to the German market. This campaign is called Etsy [ Hotsy, ] which translates to Etsy Has It. 
[Presentation] 
Etsy also has the advantage of being blogged by many influencers. So we've created a scalable experience where influencers can curate or co-create their own set of items, and then market those items to their own communities. That reinforces the desirability, the quality, the diversity and the scarcity of items on Etsy and allows Etsy to reach out to diverse communities ways that feel highly personal, curated and craveworthy. 
All in all, I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead for the Etsy marketplace. But speaking of couldn't be more excited, I'd like to take a moment also to give you an update on how things are going with Reverb. 
Reverb also had an outstanding Q1. GMS grew about 50% or about 5x faster than the musical instrument industry. And Reverb continues to deepen its moat, serving as the primary marketplace for many musicians. Reverb's 4 key focus areas for 2021 are going to be around personalization, around partnerships with brands like Fender to market new gear, deepening its investments in growth in international, and continuing to improve the customer experience. 
It's now been about 18 months since Etsy acquired Reverb, and we couldn't be happier with how that partnership has evolved. As you'll see on the left, Etsy has helped Reverb to expand its gross margins from 33% to about 53%, and the purchasing power and scale of Etsy has played an important role in that. We've taken many of those gains and we've reinvested in marketing, and that investment in marketing has also helped to accelerate the growth of Reverb. 
But we're not just investing more. We're investing more efficiently. So you'll see on the right that each dollar of marketing is driving more GMS through the incorporation of Etsy's tools and techniques to help make the marketing funnel within Reverb even more efficient.
In closing, Q1 was another great quarter for Etsy. I couldn't be prouder of the team or more grateful to the whole community. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rachel."

My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and Etsy's stand-alone results where appropriate. 
We saw continued momentum in Q1 as we delivered another strong quarter across the board, delivering higher-than-expected GMS and revenue and healthy adjusted EBITDA. on a consolidated basis, Etsy's first quarter GMS grew 132% to $3.1 billion. Revenue grew 141% to $551 million. And adjusted EBITDA was $184 million with margins of about 33%. 
On a consolidated basis, international GMS expanded 200 basis points sequentially to 42% of overall GMS. International GMS grew faster than our overall growth, accelerating to 169%. Our fastest-growing  [Audio Gap] 
the U.S. country. International domestic delivered its highest ever growth in Q1 and grew more than 2x faster than our overall growth rate. 
While we continue to benefit from significant macro tailwinds in several core international markets, success can also be attributed to our focused strategy to build local marketplaces by supplementing global product launches with locally relevant optimizations that expand domestic vibrancy. In addition, we've been careful and measured in our marketing approach by efficiently using performance marketing dollars and now adding brand spend in the U.K. and Germany. 
When we provided our outlook for Q1 in late February, we mentioned that unpredictable macro events beyond our control could create volatility in performance. And as you can see from the monthly cadence, January was up 130%. February was up 107% impacted by weather events, as we had previously noted. And March was up 161% as we lapped the onset of the pandemic and saw positive impact from government stimulus checks. 
U.S. government stimulus was only a very small part of our guidance for the quarter, but the timing and impact turned out to be much larger than we had anticipated, and we believe made up the majority of our guidance beat. In estimating the impact of stimulus checks, we bifurcated GMS growth trends between ZIP codes with household income higher and lower than $50,000. And as you can see from this slide, after the distribution of stimulus checks, GMS growth from ZIP codes with income lower than $50,000 outpaced those at more than $50,000. 
On an Etsy stand-alone basis, our category mix remained fairly stable, with our top 6 categories representing over 80% of our GMS and growing 115% year-over-year. Weddings, a shopping occasion that was a headwind to our overall growth in 2020, was up 43% in Q1 and remains an opportunity as geographies reopen. 
As mobility restrictions ease and consumers shift their purchasing habits reflect more social lifestyle, Etsy's category mix could reflect dynamics. For example, just recently in March, GMS growth was driven in part by gifting related to Easter and U.K. Mother's Day, which were celebrated with more indoors family than outdoor events than in the prior year. 
A great signal of the health of our core business can be seen on this chart. Non-mask GMS growth accelerated 20 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 138%, the second consecutive order of sequential acceleration. As anticipated, mask sales continued to contract as a percentage of overall GMS to 2.5%, down from 4% in Q4. Consolidated Q1 revenue was again driven by growth in both marketplace and services renew, with key drivers being GMS volume, Etsy payments, Etsy ads and offsite ads revenue. 
Transaction revenue grew 144% year-over-year, driven by higher GMS from visit growth and an expansion in conversion rate. Payments revenue was up 156%, and we processed 92% of our Etsy stand-alone GMS through Etsy Payments in Q1, up from 89% in Q1 of 2020. 
Consolidated advertising revenue was up 93% year-over-year. You'll recall that in the first quarter of 2020, our Etsy Ads revenue model included a portion related to Google Shopping of about $11 million. Excluding this Google Shopping revenue from Q1 2020, consolidated on-site advertising growth was up 138% in Q1 2021. 
For offsite ads, Q1 was our final fully incremental quarter of revenue for this service as we began to build sellers in early May of 2020. We recently expanded our distribution channels for off-site ads to the Google display network, which provides access to over 1 million affiliate sites. While spend on this channel is relatively small today, sellers can now reach buyers on major publishing sites such as Buzzfeed, Martha Stewart and Better Homes and Gardens. 
As a reminder of how the model works, Etsy places ads on behalf of our sellers, leveraging our marketing expertise and budget, while only charging sellers if ads lead directly to sales within a 30-day attribution window. We continue to make strides in bolstering our advertising products and initiatives to help sellers drive velocity in the marketplace and take control of their success. 
Etsy Payments, Etsy Ads and offsite ads all were drivers of the take rate expanding to 17.5%, up 60 basis points compared to Q1 of last year and 40 basis points sequentially. 
Gross margin was 74%, expanding 10 percentage points compared to last year and continuing to benefit from our shift to off-site ads, which delivers incremental revenue without an equal offset in the cost of revenue. Gross margins were also positively impacted by the leverage gain of the highly variable nature of our revenue base and Reverb's higher transaction fee versus prior year. 
We continue to leverage marketing and product investments to drive incremental growth on the platform. Prior to making an investment or launching a new initiative, we rigorously test and iterate to ensure we're delivering a positive ROI. 
In Q1, we launched a new TV campaign, expanded our performance in marketing channels and continue to drive efficiencies. And Q1 consolidated marketing spend was $151 million, up 212% year-over-year. There's never been a better time for us to lean into advertising and gain share. There are 3 factors that help explain how marketing is generating momentum and driving profitable growth. 
First, we continue to benefit from buyer frequency as our cohorts are engaging with us more often, leading to material gains in lifetime value. For example, GMS per buyer is up 20% year-over-year. And as we achieve growth in LTV, it enables us to spend more marketing dollars at a healthy ROI.
Second, as part of our offsite ads initiative, we generated an additional seller fee when we successfully place an ad that leads to a sale. This incremental revenue recoups approximately 30% of our performance marketing spend and increases lifetime value, and consequently allows us to reinvest to drive more growth for our sellers, a beautiful virtuous flywheel. 
And third, because we have continued to heighten awareness of the significant breadth of merchandise on the Etsy platform, there was higher demand for our long tail of keywords, creating more ad inventory for us to bid on that meets our ROI hurdles. Brand marketing spend, which includes television and digital video, was 13% of our consolidated marketing spend in Q1. We intend to increase brand marketing as a percentage of total spend, which will continue to shift the LTV curve a bit further out and late in the payback period of the marketing portfolio overall. 
Our product development investments continue to deliver strong returns, driving higher conversion rates and frequency. This investment is reflected in our pace of hiring and has led to GMS growth. We accelerated hiring in Q1, adding nearly 100 employees. We ended Q1 with 1,508 employees, an increase of 18% compared to Q1 of last year, and at an accelerated pace versus the 14% increase we had in all of 2020. 
In addition to growth investments, we allocated a meaningful portion of our portfolio to foundational spend or infrastructure to serve the platform. For example, we invested in areas such as data infrastructure, member services and our developer experience to make our platform faster, more efficient and reliable.
Moving to our operating metrics for the Etsy stand-alone marketplace, we delivered the highest growth rate since we became a public company for active buyers, repeat buyers and habitual buyers in the first quarter. In Q1, active buyers grew 91% year-over-year to approximately 90 million, and growth in new buyers grew 114%. 
Habitual buyers, our most loyal buyers, grew over 205% for the quarter to 7.9 million, the fourth quarter of sequential acceleration. Despite only accounting for 9% of active buyers, this segment contributes on average about 40% of GMS. So as we develop the product and marketing strategies that Josh discussed, we pay a lot of attention to these buyers as well as those that could eventually become habitual in the future. 
In addition to our habitual buyers, repeat buyers, those who made purchases on 2 or more days in a 12-month period, grew 114% to 36 million. 
GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis grew 20% year-over-year, driven by repeat purchases and frequency. Our cohorts continue to show stable underlying trends as we invest to drive further stickiness and habit-forming behavior. 
Active sellers grew 17% year-over-year to 4.5 million for the Etsy marketplace, and we are focused on growing the pie for all our sellers. Trailing 12-month GMS per active seller was up 34%, and listings on our marketplace grew to over 90 million items.
Moving to the balance sheet. As of 3/31, we had $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, in addition to a $200 million revolver that is currently undrawn. Our business model is capital-light, and our cost structure is highly variable to revenue. And we've continued to take measures to optimize and scale our marketplace.
Turning to our outlook. Given volatile global macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending broadly, and external e-commerce forecasts which continue to be in flux, we are only providing guidance for Q2 at this time. 
We currently estimate Q2 consolidated GMS to be approximately $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion or about 5% to 15% compared to Q2 of last year. Revenue of $493 million to $536 million, up 15% to 25% versus last year. And adjusted EBITDA of $129 million to $144 million, with a margin in the range of 25% to 28%. 
Here are a few reminders as you update your models and think about the cadence of growth. In Q2 of 2020, we saw the beginnings of significant growth in face masks, which delivered $346 million of GMS in the quarter and 14% of Etsy's stand-alone GMS. As we showed you, in Q1 of 2021, face masks have declined to less than 3% of Etsy's stand-alone GMS and have been declining sequentially each quarter since Q2 of last year. We are forecasting continued sequential decline in the remainder of 2021. 
Leading macroeconomic indicators such as TSA flight information, mall traffic and Google mobility data suggest that as states and countries reopen, activity and consumption in non-retail categories is picking up, and this could imply increasing headwinds in the balance of the year. For example, we have started to see what we believe are some reopening headwinds in select core markets. We monitor third-party forecast, as do you. And data suggest that 2021 e-commerce growth will have been the highest in Q1. 
Our estimate is that government stimulus drove approximately 8 percentage points of GMS growth in Q1 2021. We have already seen this benefit wane in April and early May and do not expect government stimulus to similarly impact our business in the second half of this year. 
Coupled with the continued decline in mask sales, we also currently expect new buyers to decelerate in 2021, given the record number of new buyers we acquired in 2020. That said, we're encouraged by the progress in frequency and are hyper-focused on delivering a better user experience for all of our buyers. 
We expanded GMS substantially through 2020, with the highest GMS in Q4 2020. This means that year-over-year comps in 2021 are expected to get steeper as we go through the year. That fact combined with the other factors I just outlined: possible deceleration in e-commerce growth, absence of stimulus tailwinds and, potential future impact from business reopenings, implies that year-over-year growth rates may decelerate as we progress from here. 
Wrapping up guidance, you may also want to think about Q2 performance by modeling a 2-year stack looking at 2021 versus 2019, which implies 170% growth for Q2 at the midpoint of the guidance range, a mild deceleration compared to 207% in Q1. To put a finer point at it -- on it, that is $3 billion of GMS in Q2 2021 compared with $1 billion 2 years ago. That's an incremental $2 billion. 
Even if you forecast more deceleration in the second half, you'll still see very strong full year results on a 2-year stack basis. We believe this is a better representation of the stability and sustained momentum that we have seen in our growth trends. 
We remain very excited about the opportunity ahead and believe that now is the right time for us to invest for growth. These investments primarily are in the form of people and marketing dollars. Our growth has vastly outpaced our hiring, and we're leaving far too many great ideas on the cutting room floor. We've already added 100 employees in Q1 and intend to keep hiring throughout the year, so we have ample resources in time to impact the holiday season and beyond. We're establishing a new product development center in Mexico City, a great location for tech talent, and you will see us begin to hire there in addition to our existing locations.
In addition, we continue to make important investments in infrastructure, marketplace safety, compliance and customer support, critical functions that support our growth. And finally, we see great opportunities in marketing, especially internationally where we are less penetrated in key channels relative to the U.S., and we are testing whether brand investments can further accelerate growth. In Q2, we intend to invest an incremental $15 million in brand marketing versus Q1, including more spend in Germany and the U.K., contracting our margins in the short term. We believe these investments will be ROI positive and expect they will deliver a return over many quarters in the future.
In closing, I want to reiterate that as we navigate unprecedented times, we remain highly confident and encouraged about our long-term opportunities. We also believe that our brand is more relevant than ever before as we build top of mind awareness in the hearts and minds of consumers.
Thank you all for your time today. I'll now turn the call over to Deb so we can take your questions."

So just to be clear, semantic gap is about translating what you meant with what you actually wrote. So for example, cocktail attire for men, a good search result for that might be a blue blazer. And yet the word cocktail or attire might appear in the title of blue blazer.
So there's a lot of work we've been doing to improve our models on that. We've been making great progress. 3 things I'd talk about that are underway that we think are exciting. 
One is using neural or deep learning models to expand the number of candidates of 100 million items. Picking the right small set that are actually appropriate from which you can then rank from 1 to 500 is actually a big part of that task, that first pass through the 100 million listings to find the right candidates. And we're starting now to leverage deep learning models to do that. 
Second thing I would say is what do you do for listings that are relatively new that haven't been exposed to very many buyers, where you have very few data points. So we're starting now to interpolate with new listings where we think they might be relevant. 
And the third thing we're doing in semantic bridge is language agnosticity. So you might have done your search in French, but we're going to show you some German search results as well. 
Those are 3 examples, but I also don't want to imply that when we launch a neural model that we are done and we move on. We might spend years optimizing that model. And so we are in the very early days of launching these models, experimenting and improving our results with these models. 
So to the question of how good can we get, I don't know. We'll find out. I think we'll never be perfect, but we can get a lot better than we are. And we are already a lot better than we were even 1 year ago.
The other thing I'd say in this area is that we won't always speak with words. And so one of the things we're focused on now is how can we use pictures. Let us show you some things. You might not even know the words to express what you want, but we might be able to show you some ideas. And as you interact with those ideas, that tells us what you want, and we get better and better."

For those of you, and h",651,"Well ultimately in my prerecorded remarks, we are very focused on building more hooks into the experience to engage you and have you come back wanting more, and importantly having the site be very rewarding in terms of what's next. For those of you, and hopefully all of you use Etsy regularly, the Etsy home page has been the rearview mirror for many years. You show up on Etsy, and it's things you've recently viewed, or things you're recently favorited, or it's a bunch of things you've already done. 
We're moving much more now to show you more recommendations, more leaning forward, things you might like, things you haven't seen. Shops you've favorited, here's 3 new items from those shops. And so we're both figuring out how to learn more about your taste and preferences, so we can provide better recommendations, and then entice you with things that we think are going to be interesting to make you want to come back more and more. 
And part of that is of course, the listing experience and recommendations, but part of that is things like video. And when we talk about videos, by the way, it's not just shooting that item from multiple angles. Some of the videos that we're finding are most mesmerizing are the ""making of"" videos. Customers seem very interested in how did you actually make this product, and they can watch those for hours sometimes. It's fun and inspiring. And that's uniquely Etsy. You're not going to find that on other platforms. 
And so finding ways to really engage customers in the platform is something we're very focused on as well as all of the marketing efforts. And the television investment we're doing in the performance marketing investment we're doing also helped to keep Etsy top of mind and really make us a place that people want to come back to. 
And I'm particularly proud that when we ask customers now in both the U.S. and the U.K. a very generic question, which is just, ""What are your favorite places to shop online?"" Etsy is now top 10 in both of those 2 markets. And that's the kind of thing we're going for, that we're top of mind. And we're not like, ""What's your favorite handmade site?"" Or ""What's your favorite place to go ?"" Just """"What's your favorite place to shop online?"" Etsy's now top 10 site by our internal survey work in both the U.S. and the U.K., and I think that's really encouraging.
The second part of your question was about category mix. And I can guess, like you can guess, what's going to happen with home furnishings, what's going to happen with events like weddings. What I would say is one of the parts of the Etsy model that I like the most is that we can speculate a lot, but we don't actually do anything differently at Etsy. 
We have 100 million items for sale on Etsy today. So whatever is hot tomorrow, there's an enormously high probability that we have it. And if we don't have it, it will be on the site within hours. 
And so our marketplace responds very dynamically to trends, and our performance marketing system picks that up in largely real time. And boy, did we ever see that through COVID, right? We have an incredibly agile and dynamic marketplace. 
So unlike so many others, we're not sitting around guessing what's going to happen in June and buying inventory against that and putting marketing spend against that, only to maybe be proven right and maybe be proven wrong. We have a marketplace that naturally adapts. And we tend to work much more horizontally on making sure that the seller experience is really good, making sure that the buyer experience is really good. And whenever they want to buy and sell in that particular moment is great by us."

And so we didn't give guidance for the full year. I can remind you, though, that usually in the fourth quarter, we see the take rates might hit their lowest point just because revenue relative to the very, very high conversion rate we get on transaction. GMS will increase significantly and our -- and the non -- the elements of revenue that are not variable with GMS, like listing fees and Etsy Ads, will be relatively lower.

And I've talked a bit about some of the things we're doing to drive more engagement and keep you coming back: personalization, recommendations, videos. 
Let me talk a little bit about seller performance. I'm really quite excited about that as well in addition. Our sellers want agency. They want to know what they can do that will make them more successful. And we have the ability to do a better job telling them that. So the more we can provide them with, for example, a customer satisfaction scorecard. Here are the 5 metrics that matter most to your buyers, and here's how you rank relative to other sellers and relative to what good looks like. That will be very helpful for sellers and will let them know where to invest their precious time and energy. And in doing so, I have no doubt that the clearer we can be about what good looks like and where they are relative to that, the more they will rise to that opportunity and do a great job. 
And that creates a race to the top that makes the experience better for all of our buyers. And so some of the things we've already launched in that area are around fulfillment time. You as a buyer want to know when the item is going to come. And then you want it to -- it needs to arrive on time. 
And so you've seen us now in the seller dashboard launch very clear to seller, here is what needs to ship today. Here is what needs to ship tomorrow. And we've started to experiment with what's the easiest way to explain to sellers how they're doing on fulfillment, and what good looks like there. And you should see us do more and more of that. 
And I think that's going very helpful in terms of lifting all boats and making the buyer experience at Etsy better and better and better, combined with the marketing efforts that we're doing that are keeping Etsy top of mind, so that as we have a fantastic experience that delivers so often. We're there, and we're planting the seed, and we're building a habit. 
And us leading into brand marketing right now is part of that. I think that this is a fantastic time for us to be reinforcing what is unique and special and different about Etsy and how often we're relevant for buyers."

And as we see more in the increase of habitual buyers and the significant increase in frequency, that's an example of people coming and really understanding the breadth of product that Etsy has to offer. 
I'll also mention that average order values are higher in Reverb, for instance. So as Reverb also grows, we get increase in higher spending items there as well. 
Higher average order values may imply that we have higher -- some higher margin to invest there with our marketing. And so that the whole -- that works, the whole ecosystem will work positively in that regard.

If you look at something like Similar Web, it says that Etsy and Wayfair are pretty comparable in terms of visits per unique visitor per month or per quarter. But in eBay is 3x our level.

We're doing some quizzes, tell us the kinds of things you like and you tend to buy, which by the way, also plants the seed for all the different things you can buy on Etsy. 
And then when I think about consumer sentiment, I think that over the next coming years, and we're already starting to have this, there's going to be some introspection around shopping your values and where you want to buy and who you want to support.

Future growth will really come from continued increases in conversion rate on the site. And so that's where we're really focused. 
I'll put in one more. We gave a data point on this call also that I think it's just worthy of mentioning, that our offsite ads program gives us about a 30% offset -- In the quarter, it gave us about a 30% offset to our entire performance marketing spend. And so when you think about Etsy's profitability and marketing spend, it's important to look at that piece of revenue that is offsetting what you see in our marketing line. So we're really getting good -- we have a lot of spending power. We can spend deeper as we make these LTV increases from things like offsite ads and product improvements."

By our internal survey work, we have made meaningful improvements throughout the funnel, so unaided awareness, awareness, visit intention, and preference. And in fact, we continue to see a slightly concave curve in that more people say that they are passionate evangelists of us, than say have an immediate intent to come back and shop in the near term. 
So that continues to be a gap around what are your needs, and does Etsy have things for your needs? So reminding them that many things they want to buy, you could actually find on Etsy. But we've seen that entire brand awareness funnel go up, and we're very pleased by that. 
I'm sure it's a combination of plenty of people actually visiting the site over the course of the prior months and quarters and being happy with what they've seen. It might have been their first time on Etsy, or they might not have been on Etsy in a while. And think it's a better Etsy than it was a few years ago, and I think people are seeing that and feeling that and experiencing that. 
And I think our marketing efforts are having a meaningful impact on that, our above-the-line marketing efforts, our below-the-line marketing efforts and influencers talking about us. And friends over Zoom calls talking about that great purchase they just made. 
And all of that is helping to push brand awareness. Ultimately, what matters is if you tell someone, you have the following purchase mission. You need to buy a gift for your mother for Mother's day. You have 2 seconds. Where do you go? It's what is on the tip of your tongue. That's what we're going for. 
And so that's where the survey research just asking people, ""What are your 10 favorite places to shop online?"" That's our ambition. We don't want to be the best handmade place. We don't want to be the best home furnishing place. When we ask people, ""What's your favorite place to shop online?"" I want them to say Etsy. And I think that, that ambition is the right ambition for us. 
And we are now a top 10 site according to our internal research for many customers in the United States and the U.K., but we can certainly move up that ranking. It'd be great to be top 5. And by the way, there's a lot more markets in the world than just the U.S. and the U.K."

And we've got more vibrancy now on the buyer and the seller side than we did before. 
But brand awareness in Germany is still actually quite low. If you ask the average German, ""Where do you go to shop online?"" Not a ton of them are going to put Etsy in their top 10, or even necessarily going to have Etsy in the tip of their tongue. 
So in the past, what we've done is we've really leaned on performance marketing until awareness in the market is very high. And then we go with TV. In Germany, we're experimenting with going with TV earlier. Can we drive brand awareness, which is in fact, going to turn the funnel faster and make our performance marketing more efficient? 
And that's an experiment that we're running starting in the second quarter. We'll run it for a little while. You don't learn this in just one quarter. But we're spending an incremental $15 million in television ads in the second quarter. Almost all of that is going to be in the U.K. and Germany to see what TV can do over time. And I would expect that to be an investment that will span through 2021. But over at least the course of this year, what can that do to our brand metrics."

And we've been talking for most of 2020, and we talked about it again last quarter, that we would expect some margin contraction because we think now is the time to be investing. the words we used on this call, we're leaving far too many things on the cutting room floor. 
The thing that takes a bit of time to ramp is hiring people. And so we're -- and we are accelerating the hiring. We talked about hiring 100 people in Q1. Year-over-year, Q1 was 100, and it was 18% growth and all of -- sorry, was 18% growth, not 118% growth in terms of head count adds versus Q1 of last year. But that's up from 14% in all of 2020, so you can see uptick in hiring. 
And as we get more people on board, that ought to contract margins a bit. We would expect those to yield future top side gains in future quarters. 
And then you just heard Josh talk about investment in brand marketing. We're going to continue to lean into brand marketing. And in fact, we're spending $15 million more in Q2 in brand marketing, most of which is in U.K. and Germany. 
And so those things also will yield, but with brand marketing, that the payback curve is a little bit longer. And so those things taken together, without giving you specific guidance on margins, we believe we have a wonderful, healthy business model with low fixed cost and not capital intensive. But these are the years that we'd like to be investing for that long-term growth to get future margin expansion."

I'd like to start this evening by talking a little bit about some of those citizenship",1784,"Thanks, Deb. And good evening, everyone. Q1 was another really strong quarter for Etsy in terms of its financial results and also in terms of its corporate citizenship. I'd like to start this evening by talking a little bit about some of those citizenship efforts.
Etsy continues to speak out against racism and harassment. For example, in the first quarter, we donated $500,000 to support the AAPI community, and we continue to invest in highlighting the wonderful work of many different underrepresented sellers within our buyer community. For example, our partnership with the Gee's Bend quilters from Alabama. I'm delighted to report that many of the Gee's Bend shops sold out within the first 24 hours of the launch of that initiative.
Etsy also launched donate the change, where buyers can round up to support the Uplift Fund, which provides a path to entrepreneurship for many different communities. And we had over 1 million buyers round up to support the Uplift Fund in just the last 6 weeks of the quarter.
Third, Etsy continues to deepen its commitment to environmental sustainability, announcing our goal to be net 0 by 2030. This continues to pave our pathway as a trailbreaker with one of the most ambitious targets of any of our peer group.
As I said, our Q1 results were excellent. Consolidated GMS was $3.1 billion, up 128% year-over-year. And that's really the result of strength in the core and continued positive momentum in frequency. You'll also notice that we came in above the top of guidance, guidance that we gave in late February. Most of that overshoot relative to guidance was due to the impact of stimulus, and Rachel is going to talk about that more in her section.
The core business did great in Q1. Our customer cohorts continue to show that we're driving increased frequency and engagement from all of our different buyer segments. Etsy added 16 million new or reactivated buyers in the quarter for a total of 90 million active buyers, up 91% year-over-year. And I'm particularly pleased that our fastest-growing segment yet again was habitual buyers, our most loyal and engaged buyers. We now have 8 million habitual buyers, and that was up 200% year-over-year.
Building on this expanded base, we are laser-focused on driving frequency. And of course, frequency can be driven in part by your marketing initiatives, things to make you more front of mind for customers. But it's also critical that we have a customer experience that in and of itself is engaging and drives activity. And so we've been launching efforts across the spectrum, and to pick just a few, quizzes are something we launched recently. And that allows a buyer to come and tell us more about their particular tastes and their particular interests in a light and fun way. That not only makes that visit more engaging in session, but it gives us important information to help bring that buyer back more often to have more satisfying experiences in the future.
We've been working a lot on buyer triggers as well, things to notify people through app pushes, through e-mails and other things that there's something new or interesting that's happening. For example, that -- an item you favorited in the past has gone on sale. 
And when they come back to the site, we've been investing in an Updates tab in the app. Think of that as your daily feed for what's changed since you've last been here. Maybe an item you've left in your cart has gone on sale. Or here are some new favorites that you might be interested in to add to your list. It's very encouraging to see that now 13% of app visits include a visit to the Updates tab, and 27% of those visits have buyers clicking on one or more of the listings that we include in Updates.
And the fourth pillar is strategic discounting, where we've launched a tool that allows our team to rapidly test and then automate and scale different types of discounts to very finely tuned customer segments. So $5 off, for example, on your next purchase.
I've never been more excited about our product road map. We continue to make investments that we believe are driving long-term value, making the customer experience better. I know we show you this slide a lot, but it really is how we drive focus and prioritization within our product organization focused on each of these 4 pillars. We start within each pillar by saying what customer experiences do we want to focus on to truly uplift. We then ask what are the fewest initiatives that could have the most impact in those customer experiences. And then we assign very specific goals so it's clear what success looks like and here's what your constraints are to squads who are owned -- who own the success of those different initiatives.
So let me take a second now to show you the priorities within each of these 4 pillars for 2021. Within search, we have 4 focus areas. Personalization is about making Etsy feel more like it's made just for you. Buyer pathways is about making it easier to find the things you want, whether or not you would actually put a search query into the search engine, and making sure that we have few, and hopefully no, dead ends.
Closing the semantic gap is about taking what you happen to enter into a search engine and interpreting that for what you actually meant you wanted. And of course, all of this relies upon an infrastructure that is fast and reliable and scalable. Double-clicking on personalization, just to show you an example of that pillar, we launched the ability to personalize the search results recently, and we're seeing really encouraging gains from that. But we're still very much in early innings, consuming more data to understand more about what that customer wants and then delivering, through more sophisticated models, ever more personalized search results.
But it doesn't end with just the search results themselves. We actually believe that over time, we can customize the entire experience. So here, you see an example of how the layout itself might be different for 2 different customer segments. And our ambition over time is to create ever more finely tuned customer segments that are built through multivariate models powered by machine learning so that Etsy truly feels made just for you.
I'd also highlight on this slide a couple of the infrastructure improvements that have led to material gains in the past quarter. For example, the search infra team made the search results faster, which resulted in increases in click and conversion rate. And we're able to expand the search results for long-tail queries, leading to more satisfying buying experiences there as well.
What makes the Etsy marketplace truly special is that every item and every seller has a story and a story you'd actually be interested to hear. And there's nothing more powerful than video to help to tell that story.
We also encourage conversations directly between the buyer and seller, something you'll see in few of any other marketplaces. Because those convos help the buyer and seller to co-create, personalize or customize or even just to form community. That's one of the things most different and special about Etsy, and we think investing in this pillar is critically important.
One example of where we're leaning in is in video itself. Sellers have now uploaded about 5 million videos to the Etsy site. That's up 36% quarter-over-quarter. And we're seeing very encouraging progress when a listing includes a video, that buyers engage with it more click and even convert more.
But the listing page is only the beginning of where we can be using video to tell the story of Etsy, tell the story of the item and to help people to engage even more often throughout the site. So expect to see more video and more places making the Etsy experience even more dynamic.
The third pillar is trust, and we have 4 focus areas within trust. First is speed expectation. That's making it very clear when you can expect the item to arrive. Second is delivery predictability. Where is this item in the fulfillment process, being made or currently being shipped to you? Third is issue resolution, making it even easier to access support and know that we have your back on the rare instance that something goes wrong. And fourth is seller reputation. This is around giving sellers even more visibility into how they're performing versus key customer satisfaction metrics as well as setting the bar for what good looks like so that we create more of a sense of agency among the sellers for how they can drive success in their business and create a race to the top where the buyer experience improves as a result for all of our buyers.
Taking seller reputation as an example and showing how we can apply that to fulfillment, on the left you see a new dashboard we've launched within the seller dashboard. And here, it shows the seller very clearly which items are expected to ship today, which ones ship tomorrow, which ones ship next week. So they know exactly where they should be focusing their time and energy. We've also been focusing on dashboards that show how they're doing versus fulfillment expectations relative to our expectations of what good looks like so that again they focus their energy. And we've set the standard together on how we can deliver a consistently great customer experience to our buyers that feels predictable for all of our sellers.
The foundation of Etsy's Right to Win is our sellers' collection of unique items. I know I've told you in the past that 90% of buyers report that they come to Etsy for items that they can't find anywhere else. And in fact, one of the most special parts of Etsy is that most things on Etsy can be personalized and customized. And in fact, we find that buyers are 20% more likely to make a purchase when they're looking for customized or personalized items. 
So a focus for this year is going to be even more specifically highlighting and showcasing items that can be personalized and customized as well as streamlining that process of co-creation between the buyer and the seller. But of course, what good is this great collection of unique items if we don't tell the world about it? In fact, we launched a brand-new campaign called Why Buy Boring, and I'd like to pause to show you one of the spots in that new campaign.

Germany is a market that's different than the U.S. and the U.K. in that awareness there is substantially lower, although we are seeing very positive momentum.

Reverb also had an outstanding Q1. GMS grew about 50% or about 5x faster than the musical instrument industry. And Reverb continues to deepen its moat, serving as the primary marketplace for many musicians. Reverb's 4 key focus areas for 2021 are going to be around personalization, around partnerships with brands like Fender to market new gear, deepening its investments in growth in international and continuing to improve the customer experience.
It's now been about 18 months since Etsy acquired Reverb, and we couldn't be happier with how that partnership has evolved. As you'll see on the left, Etsy has helped Reverb to expand its gross margins from 33% to about 53%, and the purchasing power and scale of Etsy has played an important role in that. We've taken many of those gains and we've reinvested in marketing. And that investment in marketing has also helped to accelerate the growth of Reverb.
But we're not just investing more. We're investing more efficiently. So you'll see on the right that each dollar of marketing is driving more GMS through the incorporation of Etsy's tools and techniques to help make the marketing funnel within Reverb even more efficient.
In closing, Q1 was another great quarter for Etsy. I couldn't be prouder of the team or more grateful to the whole community.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rachel."

And thank you, everyone, for joining us for our call. My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and Etsy's stand-alone results where appropriate.
We saw continued momentum in Q1 as we delivered another strong quarter across the board, delivering higher-than-expected GMS and revenue and healthy adjusted EBITDA. On a consolidated basis, Etsy's first quarter GMS grew 132% to $3.1 billion. Revenue grew 141% to $551 million. And adjusted EBITDA was $184 million with margins of about 33%.
On a consolidated basis, international GMS expanded 200 basis points sequentially to 42% of overall GMS. International GMS grew faster than our overall growth, accelerating to 169%. Our fastest-growing  growing trade route in Q1 was once again our domestic sales between buyers and sellers within the same non-U.S. country. International domestic delivered its highest ever growth in Q1 and grew more than 2x faster than our overall growth rate.
While we continue to benefit from significant macro tailwinds in several core international markets, success can also be attributed to our focused strategy to build local marketplaces by supplementing global product launches with locally relevant optimizations that expand domestic vibrancy. In addition, we've been careful and measured in our marketing approach by efficiently using performance marketing dollars and now adding brand spend in the U.K. and Germany.
When we provided our outlook for Q1 in late February, we mentioned that unpredictable macro events beyond our control could create volatility in performance. And as you can see from the monthly cadence, January was up 130%. February was up 107% impacted by weather events, as we had previously noted. And March was up 161% as we lapped the onset of the pandemic and saw positive impact from government stimulus checks.
U.S. government stimulus was only a very small part of our guidance for the quarter, but the timing and impact turned out to be much larger than we had anticipated, and we believe, made up the majority of our guidance beat. In estimating the impact of stimulus checks, we bifurcated GMS growth trends between ZIP codes with household income higher and lower than $50,000. And as you can see from this slide, after the distribution of stimulus checks, GMS growth from ZIP codes with income lower than $50,000 outpaced those at more than $50,000.
On an Etsy stand-alone basis, our category mix remained fairly stable, with our top 6 categories representing over 80% of our GMS and growing 115% year-over-year. Weddings, a shopping occasion that was a headwind to our overall growth in 2020, was up 43% in Q1 and remains an opportunity as geographies reopen.
As mobility restrictions ease and consumers shift their purchasing habits to reflect a more social lifestyle, Etsy's category mix could reflect that dynamic. For example, just recently in March, GMS growth was driven in part by gifting related to Easter and U.K. Mother's Day, which were celebrated with more in-person family and outdoor events than in the prior year.
A great signal of the health of our core business can be seen on this chart. Non-mask GMS growth accelerated 20 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 138%, the second consecutive quarter of sequential acceleration. As anticipated, mask sales continued to contract as a percentage of overall GMS to 2.5%, down from 4% in Q4.
Consolidated Q1 revenue was again driven by growth in both marketplace and services revenue, with key drivers being GMS volume, Etsy Payments, Etsy Ads and Offsite Ads revenue. Transaction revenue grew 144% year-over-year, driven by higher GMS from visit growth and an expansion in conversion rate. Payments revenue was up 156%, and we processed 92% of our Etsy stand-alone GMS through Etsy Payments in Q1, up from 89% in Q1 of 2020.
Consolidated advertising revenue was up 93% year-over-year. You'll recall that in the first quarter of 2020, our Etsy Ads revenue model included a portion related to Google Shopping of about $11 million. Excluding this Google Shopping revenue from Q1 2020, consolidated on-site advertising growth was up 138% in Q1 2021.
For Offsite Ads, Q1 was our final fully incremental quarter of revenue for this service as we began to bill sellers in early May of 2020. We recently expanded our distribution channels for Offsite Ads to the Google Display Network, which provides access to over 1 million affiliate sites. While spend on this channel is relatively small today, sellers can now reach buyers on major publishing sites such as BuzzFeed, Martha Stewart and Better Homes and Gardens. As a reminder of how the model works, Etsy places ads on behalf of our sellers, leveraging our marketing expertise and budget while only charging sellers if ads lead directly to sales within a 30-day attribution window. We continue to make strides in bolstering our advertising products and initiatives to help sellers drive velocity in the marketplace and take control of their success.
Etsy Payments, Etsy Ads and Offsite Ads all were drivers of the take rate expanding to 17.5%, up 60 basis points compared to Q1 of last year and 40 basis points sequentially. 
Gross margin was 74%, expanding 10 percentage points compared to last year and continuing to benefit from our shift to Offsite Ads, which delivers incremental revenue without an equal offset in the cost of revenue. Gross margins were also positively impacted by the leverage gain of the highly variable nature of our revenue base and Reverb's higher transaction fee versus prior year.
We continue to leverage marketing and product investments to drive incremental growth on the platform. Prior to making an investment or launching a new initiative, we rigorously test and iterate to ensure we're delivering a positive ROI.
In Q1, we launched a new TV campaign, expanded our performance marketing channels and continued to drive efficiencies. Q1 consolidated marketing spend was $151 million, up 212% year-over-year. There's never been a better time for us to lean into advertising and gain share. There are 3 factors that help explain how marketing is generating momentum and driving profitable growth.
First, we continue to benefit from buyer frequency as our cohorts are engaging with us more often, leading to material gains in lifetime value. For example, GMS per buyer is up 20% year-over-year. And as we achieve growth in LTV, it enables us to spend more marketing dollars at a healthy ROI.
Second, as part of our Offsite Ads initiative, we generate an additional seller fee when we successfully place an ad that leads to a sale. This incremental revenue recoups approximately 30% of our performance marketing spend and increases lifetime value and consequently allows us to reinvest to drive more growth for our sellers, a beautiful virtuous flywheel.
And third, because we have continued to heighten awareness of the significant breadth of merchandise on the Etsy platform, there was higher demand for our long tail of keywords, creating more ad inventory for us to bid on that meets our ROI hurdles. Brand marketing spend, which includes television and digital video, was 13% of our consolidated marketing spend in Q1. We intend to increase brand marketing as a percentage of total spend, which will continue to shift the LTV curve a bit further out and late in the payback period of the marketing portfolio overall.
Our product development investments continue to deliver strong returns, driving higher conversion rates and frequency. This investment is reflected in our pace of hiring and has led to GMS growth. We accelerated hiring in Q1, adding nearly 100 employees. We ended Q1 with 1,508 employees, an increase of 18% compared to Q1 of last year and at an accelerated pace versus the 14% increase we had in all of 2020.
In addition to growth investments, we allocated a meaningful portion of our portfolio to foundational spend or infrastructure to serve the platform. For example, we invested in areas such as data infrastructure, member services and our developer experience to make our platform faster, more efficient and reliable.
Moving to our operating metrics for the Etsy stand-alone marketplace. We delivered the highest growth rate since we became a public company for active buyers, repeat buyers and habitual buyers in the first quarter. In Q1, active buyers grew 91% year-over-year to approximately 90 million, and growth in new buyers grew 114%. 
Habitual buyers, our most loyal buyers, grew over 205% for the quarter to 7.9 million, the fourth quarter of sequential acceleration. Despite only accounting for 9% of active buyers, this segment contributes on average about 40% of GMS. So as we develop the product and marketing strategies that Josh discussed, we pay a lot of attention to these buyers as well as those that could eventually become habitual in the future. In addition to our habitual buyers, repeat buyers, those who made purchases on 2 or more days in a 12-month period, grew 114% to 36 million.
GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis grew 20% year-over-year, driven by repeat purchases and frequency. Our cohorts continue to show stable underlying trends as we invest to drive further stickiness and habit-forming behavior.
Active sellers grew 70% year-over-year to 4.5 million for the Etsy marketplace, and we are focused on growing the pie for all our sellers. Trailing 12-month GMS per active seller was up 34%, and listings on our marketplace grew to over 90 million items.
Moving to the balance sheet. As of 3/31, we had $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in addition to a $200 million revolver that is currently undrawn. Our business model is capital-light, and our cost structure is highly variable to revenue. And we've continued to take measures to optimize and scale our marketplace.
Turning to our outlook. Given volatile global macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending broadly and external e-commerce forecasts which continue to be in flux, we are only providing guidance for Q2 at this time. We currently estimate Q2 consolidated GMS to be approximately $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion, up about 5% to 15% compared to Q2 of last year; revenue of $493 million to $536 million, up 15% to 25% versus last year; and adjusted EBITDA of $129 million to $144 million, with a margin in the range of 25% to 28%.
Here are a few reminders as you update your models and think about the cadence of growth. In Q2 of 2020, we saw the beginnings of significant growth in face masks, which delivered $346 million of GMS in the quarter and 14% of Etsy's stand-alone GMS. As we showed you, in Q1 of 2021, face masks have declined to less than 3% of Etsy's stand-alone GMS and have been declining sequentially each quarter since Q2 of last year. We are forecasting continued sequential decline in the remainder of 2021.
Leading macroeconomic indicators such as TSA flight information, mall traffic and Google mobility data suggest that as states and countries reopen, activity and consumption in non-retail categories is picking up, and this could imply increasing headwinds in the balance of the year. For example, we have started to see what we believe are some reopening headwinds in select core markets. We monitor third-party forecast, as do you, and data suggest that 2021 e-commerce growth will have been the highest in Q1.
Our estimate is that government stimulus drove approximately 8 percentage points of GMS growth in Q1 2021. We have already seen this benefit wane in April and early May and do not expect government stimulus to similarly impact our business in the second half of this year. Coupled with the continued decline in mask sales, we also currently expect new buyers to decelerate in 2021 given the record number of new buyers we acquired in 2020. That said, we're encouraged by the progress in frequency and are hyper-focused on delivering a better user experience for all of our buyers.
We expanded GMS substantially through 2020, with the highest GMS in Q4 2020. This means that year-over-year comps in 2021 are expected to get steeper as we go through the year. That fact, combined with the other factors I just outlined, possible deceleration in e-commerce growth, absence of stimulus tailwinds and potential future impact from business reopenings, implies that year-over-year growth rates may decelerate as we progress from here.
Wrapping up guidance, you may also want to think about Q2 performance by modeling a 2-year stack looking at 2021 versus 2019, which implies 170% growth for Q2 at the midpoint of the guidance range, a mild deceleration compared to 207% in Q1. To put a finer point at it -- on it, that is $3 billion of GMS in Q2 2021 compared with $1 billion 2 years ago. That's an incremental $2 billion. Even if you forecast more deceleration in the second half, you'll still see very strong full year results on a 2-year stack basis. We believe this is a better representation of the stability and sustained momentum that we have seen in our growth trends.
We remain very excited about the opportunity ahead and believe that now is the right time for us to invest for growth. These investments primarily are in the form of people and marketing dollars. Our growth has vastly outpaced our hiring, and we're leaving far too many great ideas on the cutting room floor. We've already added 100 employees in Q1 and intend to keep hiring throughout the year, so we have ample resources in time to impact the holiday season and beyond. 
We're establishing a new product development center in Mexico City, a great location for tech talent, and you will see us begin to hire there in addition to our existing locations. In addition, we continue to make important investments in infrastructure, marketplace safety, compliance and customer support, critical functions that support our growth. 
And finally, we see great opportunities in marketing, especially internationally, where we are less penetrated in key channels relative to the U.S. And we are testing whether brand investments can further accelerate growth. In Q2, we intend to invest an incremental $15 million in brand marketing versus Q1, including more spend in Germany and the U.K., contracting our margins in the short term. We believe these investments will be ROI positive and expect they will deliver a return over many quarters in the future.
In closing, I want to reiterate that as we navigate unprecedented times, we remain highly confident and encouraged about our long-term opportunities. We also believe that our brand is more relevant than ever before as we build top of mind awareness in the hearts and minds of consumers.

So just to be clear, semantic gap is about translating what you meant with what you actually wrote. So for example, cocktail attire for men, a good search result for that might be a blue blazer. And yet the word cocktail nor attire might appear in the title of blue blazer. So there's a lot of work we've been doing to improve our models on that. We've been making great progress. Three things I'd talk about that are underway that we think are exciting. 
One is using neural or deep learning models to expand the number of candidates of 100 million items. Picking the right small set that are actually appropriate from which you can then rank from 1 to 500 is actually a big part of that task, that first pass through the 100 million listings to find the right candidates. And we're starting now to leverage deep learning models to do that. 
Second thing I would say is what do you do for listings that are relatively new that haven't been exposed to very many buyers, where you have very few data points. So we're starting now to interpolate with new listings where we think they might be relevant. 
And the third thing we're doing in semantic bridge is language agnosticity. So you might have done your search in French, but we're going to show you some German search results as well. 
Those are 3 examples, but I also don't want to imply that when we launch a neural model that we are done and we move on. We might spend years optimizing that model. And so we are in the very early days of launching these models, experimenting and improving our results with these models. 
So to the question of how good can we get, I don't know. We'll find out. I think we'll never be perfect, but we can get a lot better than we are. And we are already a lot better than we were even 1 year ago.
The other thing I'd say in this area is that we won't always speak with words. And so one of the things we're focused on now is how can we use pictures. Let us show you some things. You might not even know the words to express what you want, but we might be able to show you some ideas. And as you interact with those ideas, that tells us what you want, and we get better and better."

For those of y",654,"Well, as I talked about in my prerecorded remarks, we are very focused on building more hooks into the experience to engage you and have you come back wanting more, and importantly, having the site be very rewarding in terms of what's next. For those of you, and hopefully all of you use Etsy regularly, the Etsy homepage has been the rearview mirror for many years. You show up on Etsy, and it's things you've recently viewed or things you recently favorited, or it's a bunch of things you've already done. 
We're moving much more now to show you more recommendations, more leaning forward, things you might like, things you haven't seen, shops you've favorited. Here's 3 new items from those shops. And so we're both figuring out how to learn more about your taste and preferences so we can provide better recommendations and then entice you with things that we think are going to be interesting to make you want to come back more and more. 
And part of that is, of course, the listing experience and recommendations. But part of that is things like video. And when we talk about videos, by the way, it's not just shooting that item from multiple angles. Some of the videos that we're finding are most mesmerizing are the making of videos. Customers seem very interested in how did you actually make this product, and they can watch those for hours sometimes. It's fun and inspiring. And that's uniquely Etsy. You're not going to find that on other platforms. 
And so finding ways to really engage customers in the platform is something we're very focused on as well as all of the marketing efforts. And the television investment we're doing and the performance marketing investment we're doing also helped to keep Etsy top of mind and really make us a place that people want to come back to. 
And I'm particularly proud that when we ask customers now in both the U.S. and the U.K. a very generic question, which is just, ""What are your favorite places to shop online?"" Etsy is now top 10 in both of those 2 markets. And that's the kind of thing we're going for, that we're top of mind. And we're not like, ""What's your favorite handmade site?"" or ""What's your favorite place to go for niche?"" Just, ""What's your favorite place to shop online?"" Etsy's now top 10 site by our internal survey work in both the U.S. and the U.K., and I think that's really encouraging.
The second part of your question was about category mix. And I can guess, like you can guess, what's going to happen with home furnishings, what's going to happen with events like weddings. What I would say is one of the parts of the Etsy model that I like the most is that we can speculate a lot, but we don't actually do anything differently at Etsy. We have 100 million items for sale on Etsy today. So whatever is hot tomorrow, there's an enormously high probability that we have it. And if we don't have it, it will be on the site within hours. 
And so our marketplace responds very dynamically to trends, and our performance marketing system picks that up in largely real time. And boy, did we ever see that through COVID, right? We have an incredibly agile and dynamic marketplace. 
So unlike so many others, we're not sitting around guessing what's going to happen in June and buying inventory against that and putting marketing spend against that only to maybe be proven right and maybe be proven wrong. We have a marketplace that naturally adapts. And we tend to work much more horizontally on making sure that the seller experience is really good, making sure that the buyer experience is really good. And whenever they want to buy and sell in that particular moment is great by us."

And so we didn't give guidance for the full year. I can remind you, though, that usually in the fourth quarter, we see the take rates might hit their lowest point just because revenue relative to the very, very high conversion rate we get on transactions, GMS will increase significantly and our -- and the non -- the elements of revenue that are not variable with GMS like listing fees and Etsy Ads will be relatively lower.

So the main thing is keeping the main thing, the main thing. People need to have a great experience on Etsy when they come, when they browse, when they shop. And I've talked a bit about some of the things we're doing to drive more engagement and keep you coming back: personalization, recommendations, videos. 
Let me talk a little bit about seller performance. I'm really quite excited about that as well in addition. Our sellers want agency. They want to know what they can do that will make them more successful. And we have the ability to do a better job telling them that. So the more we can provide them with, for example, a customer satisfaction scorecard. Here are the 5 metrics that matter most to your buyers, and here's how you rank relative to other sellers and relative to what good looks like. 
That will be very helpful for sellers, and it will let them know where to invest their precious time and energy. And in doing so, I have no doubt that the clearer we can be about what good looks like and where they are relative to that, the more they will rise to that opportunity and do a great job. And that creates a race to the top that makes the experience better for all of our buyers. 
And so some of the things we've already launched in that area are around fulfillment time. You as a buyer want to know when the item is going to come. And then you want it to -- it needs to arrive on time. And so you've seen us now in the seller dashboard launch very clear to seller, here is what needs to ship today. Here is what needs to ship tomorrow. And we've started to experiment with what's the easiest way to explain to sellers how they're doing on fulfillment and what good looks like there. And you should see us do more and more of that. 
And I think that's going very helpful in terms of lifting all boats and making the buyer experience at Etsy better and better and better, combined with the marketing efforts that we're doing that are keeping Etsy top of mind so that as we have a fantastic experience that delivers so often, we're there and we're planting the seed and we're building a habit. And us leaning into brand marketing right now is part of that.

So I think one of the things that is really resonating with people through our marketing is why to come to Etsy and when to come to Etsy. And so we've talked before in the past about thinking about Etsy not just for the cushions but for the couch. And as we see more in the increase of habitual buyers and the significant increase in frequency, that's an example of people coming and really understanding the breadth of product that Etsy has to offer. 
I'll also mention that the average order values are higher in Reverb, for instance. So as Reverb also grows, we get increase in higher spending items there as well. Higher average order values may imply that we have higher -- some higher margin to invest there with our marketing. And so that the whole -- that works -- the whole ecosystem will work positively in that regard. 
To date, though, the primary growth we've gotten from GMS has been more visits and higher conversion rates. And that's where our efforts have really focused, and that's where we're getting a lot of the value creation from the marketing investment."
28492682,711342155,2271412,"Etsy, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Etsy, Inc.","Executives","I'll only add that I agree with your thesis. If you look at something like SimilarWeb, it says that Etsy and Wayfair are pretty comparable in terms of visits per unique visitor per month or per quarter. But in eBay, it's 3x our level.

If you look at something like SimilarWeb, it says that Etsy and Wayfair are pretty comparable in terms of visits per unique visitor per month or per quarter. But in eBay, it's 3x our level. And Wayfair's only home furnishings. Etsy is across many, many categories. So it stands to reason that we would look more like an eBay than we would like a Wayfair. 
So I agree that there is a lot of opportunity for us to do better. And that's about really helping our buyers understand the breadth of offering that's available on Etsy and all the different times that we can actually serve them. And we're doing more. So for example, right now for brand-new buyers, we're using video to have a brief like ""welcome to Etsy"" moment where we start to explain to them all the different things that we have on offer. We're doing some quizzes, tell us the kinds of things you like and you tend to buy, which by the way, also plants the seed for all the different things you can buy on Etsy. 
And then when I think about consumer sentiment, I think that over the next coming years, and we're already starting to have this, there's going to be some introspection around shopping your values and where you want to buy and who you want to support. And I think Etsy is going to do very well as people think more and more about, ""Do I want to spend all of my e-commerce dollars with one place? Or do I want to support small businesses?"" I think people are going to want to support small businesses a little more, particularly when those small businesses deliver a great experience at a fair price. And I think we can do that. I think our sellers can do that."

Future growth will really come from continued increases in conversion rate on the site. And so that's where we're really focused. 
I'll put in one more. We gave a data point on this call also that I think is just worthy of mentioning that our Offsite Ads program gives us about a 30% offset -- in the quarter, it gave us about a 30% offset to our entire performance marketing spend. And so when you think about Etsy's profitability and marketing spend, it's important to look at that piece of revenue that is offsetting what you see in our marketing line. So we're really getting good -- we have a lot of spending power. We can spend deeper as we make these LTV increases from things like Offsite Ads and product improvements."

By our internal survey work, we have made meaningful improvements throughout the funnel, so unaided awareness, visit intention and preference. And in fact, we continue to see a slightly concave curve in that more people say that they are passionate evangelists of us than say have an immediate intent to come back and shop in the near term. 
So that continues to be a gap around what are your needs and does Etsy have things for your needs. So reminding them that many things they want to buy, you could actually find on Etsy. But we've seen that entire brand awareness funnel go up, and we're very pleased by that. I'm sure it's a combination of plenty of people actually visiting the site over the course of the prior months and quarters and being happy with what they've seen. It might have been their first time on Etsy, or they might not have been on Etsy in a while. 
And I think it's a better Etsy than it was a few years ago, and I think people are seeing that and feeling that and experiencing that. And I think our marketing efforts are having a meaningful impact on that, our above-the-line marketing efforts, our below-the-line marketing efforts and influencers talking about us and friends over Zoom calls talking about that great purchase they just made. 
And all of that is helping to push brand awareness. Ultimately, what matters is if you tell someone, you have the following purchase mission. You need to buy a gift for your mother for Mother's day. You have 2 seconds. Where do you go? It's what is on the tip of your tongue. That's what we're going for. 
And so that's where the survey research -- just asking people, ""What are your 10 favorite places to shop online?"" That's our ambition. We don't want to be the best handmade place. We don't want to be the best home furnishing place. When we ask people, ""What's your favorite place to shop online?"" I want them to say Etsy. And I think that, that ambition is the right ambition for us. 
And we are now a top 10 site according to our internal research for many customers in the United States and the U.K., but we can certainly move up that ranking. It'd be great to be top 5. And by the way, there's a lot more markets in the world than just the U.S. and the U.K."

And we've got more vibrancy now on the buyer and the seller side than we did before. But brand awareness in Germany is still actually quite low. If you ask the average German, where do you go to shop online, not a ton of them are going to put Etsy in their top 10 or even necessarily going to have Etsy in the tip of the tongue. 
So in the past, what we've done is we've really leaned on performance marketing until awareness in the market is very high. And then we go with TV. In Germany, we're experimenting with going with TV earlier. Can we drive brand awareness, which is in fact, going to turn the funnel faster and make our performance marketing more efficient?
And so that's an experiment that we're running starting in the second quarter. We'll run it for a little while. You don't learn this in just one quarter. But we're spending an incremental $15 million in television ads in the second quarter. Almost all of that is going to be in the U.K. and Germany to see what TV can do over time. And I would expect that to be an investment that will span through 2021, but over at least the course of this year, what can that do to our brand metrics."

In fact, the words we used on this call are we're leaving far too many things on the cutting room floor. 
The thing that takes a bit of time to ramp is hiring people. And so we're -- and we are accelerating the hiring. We talked about hiring 100 people in Q1. Year-over-year, Q1 was 100, and it was 18% growth and all of -- sorry, it was 18% growth, not 118% growth in terms of head count adds versus Q1 of last year. But that's up from 14% in all of 2020. So you can see uptick in hiring. And as we get more people on board, that ought to contract margins a bit. We would expect those to yield future top side gains in future quarters. 
And then you just heard Josh talk about investment in brand marketing. We're going to continue to lean into brand marketing. And in fact, we're spending $15 million more in Q2 in brand marketing, most of which is in U.K. and Germany. And so those things also will yield, but with brand marketing, the payback curve is a little bit longer. 
And so those things taken together, without giving you specific guidance on margins, we believe we have a wonderful, healthy business model with low fixed cost and not capital intensive.

In fact, non-mas",2012,"Thanks, Deb, and good evening, everyone. Etsy delivered a strong second quarter. I'm pleased to share highlights with you on our progress and our results. Consolidated GMS was $3 billion, up 10% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. In fact, non-mask GMS on a net stand-alone basis grew 31% year-over-year which, frankly, I find remarkable, given the extraordinary comps from last year. And on a 2-year basis, this is 153% growth, also excluding face masks. Revenue grew 23% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%. We feel great about these returns we're seeing as our investments ramp. We also announced the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7 during the quarter, which I'll talk about in just a few minutes. 
Our Q2 '21 performance is particularly impressive when put in context of the year-ago period that we're comping. Remembering back to Q2 of 2020, brick-and-mortar stores were largely shut down with the exception of essential services. And even at those essential stores, lines were long and shelves were often empty. Even e-tailers faced similar challenges, with many products out of stock and long shipping delays for the rest. 
And in the midst of this crisis, Etsy mobilized cottage industry to the rescue. Etsy sellers had so much of what you needed and were ready to ship quickly, at a fair price and without significant supply chain challenges. In fact, Etsy was one of the few places where you could shop with confidence and convenience in Q2 of 2020. As a result, we delivered the highest growth rate of any company that we track in our sector. 
Flash forward to Q2 of 2021 and thankfully, things began to look dramatically different. While the situation is still evolving, people are moving about much more freely and beginning to travel and dine out again. Many brick-and-mortar stores have reopened, and there are a wide range of e-tailers ready to ship almost anything to your doorstep without delay. And even in the face of this renewed abundance of choice, again and again, shoppers chose to return to Etsy, in fact, about 90 million of them. And most importantly, they chose to shop with us more frequently. 
Given the massive pull forward in new buyer acquisition last year, it's no surprise that new buyer growth has decelerated materially in recent months. However, that deceleration has been offset by growth in GMS per active buyer, which as you know, is a big focus area for us. We're encouraged to see that shoppers love the experience they've had with Etsy over the past year and are coming back for more, even in a world of greatly expanded choice. 
As Rachel will talk about further, we're extremely pleased with the strength and stability we're seeing in our cohort performance and our conviction to invest in what we believe is Etsy's tremendous long-term opportunity. 
Turning to our most important focus area and job #1, growing the core etsy.com marketplace. We continue to make what we believe are very valuable long-term investments aligned with our Right to Win, driving continued material improvements in the customer experience in order to make Etsy even more special and deepen our competitive advantages. 
I'll now walk through some of the exciting progress we made in Q2. Starting with search and discovery. In our quest to close the semantic gap and create a platform that better understands our buyers, tastes and preferences, in Q2, our team created and launched a proprietary capability we call XWalk, a large-scale real-time graph retrieval engine that dramatically expands the amount of available data used to capture semantic meaning and to improve conversion rate by showing more relevant inventory to buyers. 
Every click and purchase on Etsy gives us information about the relationship between users, queries, listings, shops and more. And these events have long powered our ranking and retrieval systems. But due to the sheer volume of information, we could only use a relatively small slice of it. With XWalk, we're now able to use nearly all of our relevant data to better capture semantic meaning across all of our inventory. 
For example, XWalk has significantly reduced the number of dead ends, which are queries that return 0 search results, unlocking over 1 million incremental searches that are delivering relevant search results. We're only at the very beginning stages of leveraging XWalk, which has many other applications beyond search, for example, making recommendations more relevant, providing better on-site marketing experiences and improving technologies that keep the Marketplace safe. 
Turning to Slide 7 in our efforts to amplify the human element of the Etsy Marketplace. We've mentioned listing videos on our last few calls, and we're now starting to get real traction as they're incorporated throughout more and more of the Etsy experience on-site and off. In fact, there are now nearly 8 million videos uploaded on Etsy. Listing videos are driving engagement on social and we're seeing measurable wins from adding videos to the homepage. 
We're especially encouraged by the results our sellers are seeing from their process videos, which show how our sellers make their items and especially Etsy-like experience. Many buyers are viewing these videos and watching them to completion. In fact, listing and process videos drove a significant sequential increase in engagement on our social channels, up 700% quarter-over-quarter. 
Our third pillar is, of course, about trust. And we've -- as we've said, we're laser focused this year on the post-purchase experience and we're making great progress. This quarter, I'd like to highlight the gains we've made with delivery predictability, setting clear expectations for when items will arrive and ensuring our sellers consistently meet those expectations. 
In the second quarter of 2020, only 73% of domestic orders on Etsy displayed an expected delivery date. In other words, before you placed an order, almost 30% of the time, we couldn't tell you when you could expect to receive it. Origin ZIP codes, which tell us from where in the U.S. an item is shipping, have also been an area of focus because they help us to more precisely estimate the time in transit. We've more than doubled origin ZIP code coverage over the past year, which has cut 1 full day from the expected delivery date, causing a meaningful positive impact to conversion rate. 
While we aren't in a race to be fastest, it's critical that we have transparent expectations that our sellers can meet reliably. This is a needle-mover for us. As we deliver on buyers' expectations, they've tended to come back and make more purchases more frequently. We're targeting to get both of these metrics over 90% in time for the holiday season. 
Last quarter, we told you that we would be exploring ways to define what good service looks like for Etsy sellers, leading to last week's global launch of our Star Seller program. The program's goal is to recognize and reward our best sellers while motivating all sellers to deliver exceptional customer service. As part of this program, we've defined a set of customer service metrics that we know are critical to buyers, such as on-time shipping, 5-star reviews and responsiveness to buyer convos. 
And we've set the bar for what good looks like, all while providing a transparent dashboard to show sellers where they stand versus each of these metrics. We believe that this creates a race to the top for sellers, who will understand even more what actions they can take in order to further delight customers. Later this year, we'll begin to surface Star Seller Badges throughout the buyer experience. 
Turning to Slide 10, let's talk about our continuing investments designed to increase frequency. As you know, we're laser-focused on this area. And in fact, the Etsy Marketplace delivered a 22% increase in GMS per active buyer in the quarter. I'm delighted to report that we're seeing encouraging signs of progress across multiple initiatives. Highlighting just 2: First, we're continuing to see progress with buyer triggers. For example, adding a badge in the upper corner of the app icon, showing how many updates are pending drove a meaningful increase in repeat visit rate. 
And second, we've created faster and easier ways for sellers to invest in deepening relationships with their buyers while driving frequency to Etsy. A great example is seller thank you coupons. For example, get 10% off on your next purchase when you buy again from my shop, which during an experiment, saw 170% improvement in uptake. Now 11% of purchases include a thank you coupon. 
As many of you know, the Buy on Etsy app has historically been our highest converting experience. In Q2, we began to test more prominent ways to prompt buyers to download the app at key moments in their journey. We focused on organic product improvements and to date, have invested very few marketing dollars to drive app downloads. We've seen major wins. For example, by prompting app downloads on the post-purchase thank you page, encouraging you to download the app in order to easily track your order status. The results have been compelling. We're now running at about 1.3 million app downloads a month and have garnered 9 million downloads year-to-date. And Etsy is now the #7 shopping app in the iOS App Store, the highest it's ever been. 
Most importantly, newer cohorts of app users are showing promising engagement signals based on their visits, favoriting and purchase behavior. In Q2, new app users that made a purchase then went on to favorite and view listings roughly 20% more than new mobile web users that made a purchase during the same time frame. 
Turning to brand marketing. TV and digital video continue to be great tools to drive awareness and engagement with the Etsy brand. As we mentioned last quarter, our investments in the U.K. and Germany are showing encouraging results. Double clicking on Germany, in addition to our TV and digital video investments, we worked with German personalities to support our Etsy [indiscernible] or Etsy Has It campaign. We saw 5 points of improvement in prompted and unprompted awareness, expanded social reach and generated over 4.5 million impressions in earned media during the campaign flight. Other benefits included an uptick in seller growth and a higher return on our performance marketing channels. We're very pleased with these results, which indicate that we're laying the foundation for growth in this important market. 
There are so many more product and marketing wins I'd love to tell you about, but I also want to give some time to our other marketplaces. We now have 4 highly differentiated e-commerce marketplaces in our House of Brands, and we couldn't be more excited to have found 2 more businesses that share our mission to keep commerce In addition to common missions, strong leadership teams and performance-based cultures, each brand is connected at the core, with similar growth levers and requirements for success such as sophisticated search technology, compelling on-site customer experiences, an efficient payment platform, value-added seller services, effective shipping options, strong brand and performance marketing capabilities and a commitment to investments that protect the marketplace. As you know, we have deep expertise in each of these areas, and we'll be implementing knowledge sharing loops to drive value creation across the brands, all while enabling each to serve its customers in its own distinct way. 
First, turning to Depop on Slide 14. We believe Depop is the best asset in the resale space, given its high user engagement metrics. The U.S. secondhand market opportunity is projected to double to $77 billion by 2025. And the resale portion of secondhand is forecasted to grow 11x faster than retail clothing for the next 5 years. We're also seeing that young consumers are adopting secondhand fashion faster than any other audience. And Depop is the tenth most-visited shopping site among Gen Z consumers in the U.S. In fact, we think Depop is potentially to Etsy like Venmo was to PayPal, a new way to shop for the new generation. Let's take a look at a quick 30-second video that captures the excitement of Depop.

Just like we've demonstrated with Etsy and Reverb, we see significant opportunities to make focused improvements to the on-site product experience that we believe can expand conversion rate. We'll also explore value-added services to drive monetization. We'll compare insights on how we've grown Etsy globally with localized experiences and focused investments to help Depop take its marketplace beyond its current core regions in the U.S. and U.K. And we'll work to evaluate the efficiency of their marketing investments, focused on improving LTV, driving buyer and GMS growth and enabling the business to invest more and similar or better returns compared to their current investments. 
Now turning to Elo7. Elo7 is known as the Etsy of Brazil, a leader in custom and made-to-order merchandise. We now have a foothold in Latin America, a region with high barriers to entry where we previously did not have a meaningful customer base. Elo7 is ranked as a top 10 e-commerce site in Brazil, providing us with a strong local brand in the largest Latin American e-commerce region. E-commerce in Latin America is estimated to be less than 10% penetrated and is expected to reach approximately $160 billion by 2025. Brazil alone is forecasted to reach $50 billion in the same time period. Here's a quick glimpse of Elo7 through one of their TV ads. We hope you'll agree that the similarities with Etsy are obvious.

We've just kicked off integration work for both businesses, so it's important to keep in mind that it will take multiple quarters and years to operationalize all of the many ways that we believe we can help Depop and Elo7 grow. 
And last but certainly not least, Reverb delivered a solid quarter despite prior year comps that benefited from many competitors having to close their retail stores and warehouses. We're confident that the Reverb team is focused on the right areas and are excited about their future opportunities. In particular, this past quarter, we launched personalized recommendations and invited more music makers to add to their gear collections, which now includes over 175,000 pieces of gear from players across Reverb. 
This capability not only helps us to learn more about buyers and personalize their experience, it also helps players consider selling their gear through a greater understanding of how much it's worth. We launched a new premium ad platform for Bump, and we formed a new international product team that delivered its first global specific feature enhancements. 
Taking all of this together, we believe that Etsy is now an even more valuable company with an even larger opportunity than we had before. We have a large and expanding TAM and we're moving in a different direction than commoditized marketplaces. 
The pandemic proved just how many purchase occasions Etsy is relevant for, and we have more confidence than ever in our core opportunity. Reverb has a compelling value proposition in musical instruments and we see a clear path for future growth. Depop enables us to deepen our penetration into apparel, specifically in the exciting and fast-growing sector of resale. And Elo7 gives us a local presence in the large Brazilian market. Our ambition is driven by a true love of lightning in a bottle peer-to-peer marketplaces and a well-defined investment strategy that we believe can drive strong top line growth and profitability for these brands. 
Many of you have asked whether these deals are a sign of more to come. I can tell you that our primary focus now is to integrate Depop and Elo7 into the family while continuing to drive strong performance at Etsy and Reverb. We're incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished. And hopefully, we've demonstrated to you that we balance our ambition with discipline, making thoughtful and strategic moves that build long-term value for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rachel."

My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and etsy.com's stand-alone results, where appropriate. As a reminder, Depop and Elo7 results are not reflected in our consolidated financial results or KPIs for the second quarter. 
We had a strong quarter across the board despite macro headwinds and challenging year-over-year comps, delivering GMS, revenue and adjusted EBITDA squarely within our expectations. Before diving in, I want to point out that we're now growing off a meaningfully larger base. Just taking GMS, for example, we've added $2 billion incrementally to the 2019 base, and we're just beginning to benefit from the power of what this larger scale can do for Etsy over time. 
Moving to the financials. On a consolidated basis, Etsy's second quarter GMS grew 13% year-over-year to $3 billion, revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $529 million and adjusted EBITDA was $139 million with a margin of about 26%. On an etsy.com stand-alone basis, we see non-mask GMS growth as an important barometer of underlying trends in the core business. In Q2, face masks declined to 1.4% of etsy.com's stand-alone GMS, declining sequentially each quarter since Q2 of last year. 
And as you can see on Slide 23, non-mask GMS grew 31% year-over-year, particularly notable considering last year's unprecedented spike in new buyers with the onset of the pandemic. Non-mask GMS growth on a 2-year basis remained fairly stable relative to last quarter and the historical trend line. These are encouraging data points that highlight strong underlying trends in our business. While we don't anticipate showing the monthly cadence of growth in the future, we thought it was important to show the stability of our trends in light of the expected headwinds in the coming quarters. 
Here, you can see the monthly cadence of growth on a 2-year basis for the etsy.com stand-alone marketplace. April was up 177%, May was up 150% and June was up 143%. This trend details how we delivered strong growth throughout the quarter, particularly on a 2-year basis. But in light of the expected Q2 headwinds, there has been steady deceleration as the world has reopened. 
On a consolidated basis, [ percent ] international GMS expanded 900 basis points year-over-year to 41% of overall GMS. International GMS grew faster than our overall growth and was up 45% in Q2. Our fastest-growing trade route was once again international domestic, sales in which both the buyer and seller are in the same market. New and existing international buyer growth trended in line with each other, unlike in the U.S. where we are seeing deceleration in new buyer growth. Growth in international has been fueled by product investments such as an improved English to German translation model and higher investment in brand marketing in the U.K. and Germany. 
Consolidated Q2 revenue was again driven by growth in both Marketplace and services revenue, with key drivers being Etsy Ads revenue, Etsy Payments and GMS volume. Transaction fee revenue grew 15% year-over-year, driven by higher GMS from visit growth and frequency. Payments revenue was up 19% and we processed 92% of our etsy.com stand-alone GMS through Etsy Payments in Q2, a direct result of the expansion of Etsy Payments to 9 new countries in Q3 of 2020. 
Consolidated advertising revenue, which includes Etsy Ads and Reverb's Bump, was up 44% year-over-year. Consolidated take rate expanded to 17.4% in the second quarter, up 150 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. Etsy Ads revenue growth, excluding Reverb's Bump service, was up 47%, following nearly 100% revenue growth in the prior year. 
Etsy Ads revenue was driven by experiments that improved our ad ranking function, resulting in a significant increase in the post-click conversion rate while maintaining the same attractive return on ad spend for our sellers. As a result, sellers have continued to increase their overall budget for Etsy Ads to procure prominent placement and increased sales. In fact, for the month of June 2021, seller budget was 92% higher when compared to their overall budget in June of 2020. 
Gross margin was 72% on a consolidated basis, continuing to benefit from our shift to offsite ads, which delivers incremental revenue without an equal offset in cost of revenue and which we view as a significant subsidy to our performance marketing spend. As you may recall, our introduction of offsite ads, which we began to bill sellers for in May 2020, drove a 500 basis point expansion in gross margin at that time. In Q2 '21, offsite ads opt-out rates were still less than 2% and chargeability remained healthy. In fact, the number of sellers who've chosen to stay in the program is growing at a faster rate than active sellers, a testament to how many sellers value our offsite ads product. 
Our product development investments continue to deliver strong returns, driving higher conversion rates and frequency. For example, we now have more squads focused on frequency initiatives and have seen significant increases in hit rate. Q2 consolidated product development spend was $62 million, up 37% year-over-year, mostly driven by our planned increased headcount. Note that consolidated headcount was nearly 1,600 at quarter end, up 24% year-over-year, with much of this increase sitting in product development. 
We have continued to ramp our marketing spend to lean into this time when the Etsy brand is capturing global attention. Q2 consolidated marketing spend was $167 million, up 46% year-over-year. Brand spend was 23% of consolidated marketing, up 73% year-over-year. An important driver of the increased marketing spend in Q2 was our TV campaigns in the U.K. and Germany, which each performed well during the quarter. In Germany, where we had not tested upper funnel marketing before, we jumped 4 places in Comscore retail rankings during the month of May. In both markets, we also observed the halo effect of making other performance channels work harder. 
We're seeing significant progress prompting buyers to download the app, which represents our smallest share of visits. It has the highest conversion rate. And nearly all of this is coming from product investments rather than marketing spend. We believe success here could lead to more traffic from repeat and existing buyers shifting from paid to organic, which will enable us to spend more to acquire new buyers through higher LTV as well as improvement to adjusted EBITDA as paid clicks and visits shift to organic. 
Moving to our operating metrics for the Etsy stand-alone marketplace. In Q2, active buyers grew 51% year-over-year to approximately 90 million. Repeat buyers, those who made purchases on 2 or more days in a 12-month period, grew 61% year-over-year to 36 million. And habitual buyers, our most loyal buyers, remained our fastest-growing buyer segment, up 115% for the quarter to nearly 8 million. As of Q2 2021, this buyer segment accounts for only 9% of active buyers that contributes on average about 40% of our GMS. These metrics demonstrate encouraging stability in our buyer base, signs we've all been looking for as barometers for how sticky the 2020 gains may be. 
As you know, the pandemic significantly accelerated our acquisition of new buyers. In 2020, we acquired 38 million new buyers, nearly 2x the number of new buyers we acquired in 2019. Remember, a new buyer is someone who has never before shopped on Etsy. As anticipated, our new buyer growth rate declined in Q2 but remained at a healthy level of 8 million, nearly double the number of new buyers acquired in Q2 2019. On a trailing 12-month basis, we've acquired over 40 million new buyers. 
We're excited to see that the underlying purchase trends for our new buyer cohorts remain healthy as well. For example, Q2 GMS per new buyer expanded to $46, growing 24% year-over-year. Many of you asked us during the past year if the buyers we acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic were valuable or only came to Etsy during the pandemic, given limited shopping options. We are only a few months into the world gradually reopening, and so far, all signs indicate that these buyers are at least as valuable as those we acquired prior to the pandemic. 
GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis accelerated to $129, a record 22% year-over-year growth, driven by repeat purchases and frequency. We're extremely pleased to see our cohorts continue to show stable underlying trends as we invest to drive further stickiness and habit-forming behavior. 
Moving to the balance sheet. As of 6/30, we had $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, in addition to a $200 million revolver that is currently undrawn. Note that the acquisitions of both Depop and Elo7 were completed in July, so these acquisitions are not reflected on the quarter-ending balance sheet. During the quarter, we also issued $1 billion of 7-year convertible senior notes. A portion of the proceeds was used to repurchase $180 million of our stock and to purchase capped calls. Free cash flow was impacted by the timing of cash payments compared to accruals for sizable expenses such as sales taxes and marketing spend. 
And now turning to our outlook. We currently estimate that our Q3 consolidated GMS, which will now include Etsy Reverb, Depop and Elo7, will be approximately $2.9 billion to $3 billion, up about 12.5% at the midpoint compared to Q3 of last year. Our Q3 revenue will be $500 million to $525 million, up about 13.5% at the midpoint versus Q3 of last year. And our adjusted EBITDA margin will be about 25%. 
Within our Q3 GMS guidance, we are forecasting very solid growth for the etsy.com stand-alone marketplace. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit GMS growth and growth in the mid-teens, excluding face masks. In Q3 2020, etsy.com's stand-alone marketplace GMS grew 116%, which was the highest growth rate among the U.S. publicly traded e-commerce peers that we track, a really big number to comp. Please also remember that 11% of Etsy's stand-alone GMS or $264 million was from face masks in Q3 2020. 
Consolidated revenue guidance assumes a take rate of about 17.4%. Excluding Depop and Elo7 from the Q3 guidance, our take rate guidance for just etsy.com and Reverb, our former consolidated reporting, would have been about 17.7%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for Q3 is also impacted by the addition of Depop and Elo7. The addition of these 2 businesses is about a 300 basis point contraction to what our guidance would have been without them. Given very similar fundamental economics to etsy.com and Reverb, we're confident that with scale, both can deliver strong margins and healthy levels of profitability. 
It is important to keep in mind that the etsy.com Marketplace will continue to be the vast majority of our top and bottom line performance, at least in the near term. In fact, given the transaction timing and the relative size of Depop and Elo7, we expect only modest contribution to our Q3 and FY '21 top line performance. Also for your models, I mentioned that Q2 consolidated headcount was up over 20%, and you can expect this rate of hiring to continue this quarter. And we recently welcomed 550 new employees to Etsy, Inc. with our July acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. 
As we look beyond Q3, we are excited about the upcoming holiday season, with so many product and marketing initiatives already bearing fruit and more to come. For Q4, keep in mind that we will be comparing to the very strong 2020 holiday period, which benefited from an extended shopping season, stimulus payments, continued shutdowns in certain regions and some logistics disruptions for other e-commerce players. Also recall that the fourth quarter had $133 million of face mask GMS or about 4% of our total. We are currently forecasting very little GMS from face masks in our Q4 2021 internal model. 
We've previously pointed out that our comps get tougher as we progress through 2021, with Q1 2022 potentially our hardest go-forward comp, given the sizable positive impact from government stimulus in Q1 2021. We operate Etsy with a disciplined approach that maintains a healthy balance between growth and margins, and our results have historically landed us between a rule of 40 and a rule of 50 company. We plan to continue to live by this principle and are confident that our long-term profitability model remains intact. Thank you for your time today. I will now turn the call over to Deb so we can take your questions."

So first, we feel really good about our Q3 guide. I mean, we're talking about Etsy stand-alone growing in the mid-teens Q-over-Q in a world where we anticipate that in Q3, the world will be largely reopened, and people are going about their lives much like they were not entirely like they were before COVID, of course, but much like they were before COVID. 
So some of the things that are powering that, we are seeing a resurgence of growth from some categories like wedding. So weddings, for example, was up over 100% quarter-over -- year-over-year in Q2, and it was the second sequential quarter of growth for weddings. That's certainly helpful. We're also seeing building momentum in some categories like back-to-school. So last year was all about home schooling and people were buying desks for their kids at home. Now they're buying backpacks and they're buying all sorts of things to get ready to send their kids back to school and we're already seeing that. 
We're really pleased to see sustained momentum in many categories. So for example, home furnishings is seeing nice sustained growth, and as you know, that's our largest category. And some of the things that are really hot in home furnishings right now are kids furniture, garden, gardening activities and things like that. And then as always, we're seeing the viral trends. Whatever is hot and new right now is showing up on Etsy. So things that are hot on TikTok, for example, show up on Etsy within moments and actually can drive millions of dollars of GMS. So those are really the 4 buckets. And did I -- [indiscernible] at the beginning."

Etsy has gotten take rate gains from the expansion of Etsy Payments to 9 new markets globally. And Reverb actually took a price increase last year as well, which helped keep the former consolidated Etsy take rate high. We look at take rate improvements as a value exchange, so where we can offer more services that are -- that benefit the seller. In exchange for some fee increase, we are open to doing those things. So for instance, last year, we added offsite ads and that was a win-win for sellers and for Etsy. 
So there's lots of opportunity to continue to add services and where we see a fair exchange of value would consider taking  fees for that. But right now, we have no plans for that and there's nothing in our guidance that would suggest that we have any plans for that."

Brazil is different. Etsy doesn't really have a presence in Brazil. And in fact, cross-border trade between Brazil and other markets outside of Mercosur is really tough for a bunch of reasons. 
And so we expect that Elo7 will remain a stand-alone brand and a stand-alone business, giving us a presence in Brazil for the first time. And when we look at who has succeeded in Brazil, it has tended to be the native companies. MercadoLibre is very successful there and eBay didn't manage to penetrate. So we think having a native indigenous brand in Brazil built for Brazil that is focused primarily on domestic trade is the right way to go, and we're really excited about the Elo7 team and brand is our way to do that."

We are seeing that the brand marketing spend we're doing in Germany and the U.K. is making our performance marketing more effective, and therefore, we are spending more. The performance marketing spend is quite mechanical. We have very clear ROI thresholds, and we have quite clear ways to measure impact in nearly real-time. 
So as the performance of our performance marketing gets better, we just automatically increase spend. And if things happen to depress it, we automatically take spend down. But you're right that because the TV advertising is making brand awareness higher, it means the propensity to click on our ads is higher and the lifetime value of the customers is higher, and that allows us to spend incrementally more in those markets."

We said percentage that was paid was 19%, which is down from the previous quarter. Remember that one of the things that we do is we invest in top-of-funnel marketing, which we don't count in our paid spend because the traffic from top-of-funnel marketing comes in through the direct channel. So we spent a lot of money incrementally marketing in the second quarter. The dominant portion of that incremental spend was on top-of-funnel marketing in the U.K. and Germany, drove a lot of top line that we count as direct. So that's one of the answers to your question. 
The second answer is that we actually spent relatively flat amount of money on performance marketing, and we got the same or better ROI. And also recall that our performance marketing is now subsidized by our offsite ads product. We don't actually see that subsidy in the marketing line that shows up in revenue. So all of those factors together drove really high return on our performance marketing spend and relatively a lower percentage of total traffic coming from paid."

And really job 1 was to partner with the Reverb team to think about where can their product efforts be most focused to improve conversion rate. That makes the value of a visit go up and the lifetime value of a visitor and a customer go up. And at the same time, how can we optimize their marketing spend? 
And those 2 are actually a virtuous cycle because if conversion rate goes up, the value of a visit goes up, that allows you to actually invest more in marketing, right? And if your marketing is more efficient, you can really get the flywheel to turn. And so we're excited about how that has worked at Reverb, and we hope to execute similar ideas, not the exact same but similar kinds of playbooks add both Depop and Elo7. 
They're both very different marketplaces and they have different dynamics and they face different trends. And so step 1 is to get in and partner with their teams and understand where they are and see where we can add value and what their current road maps are. So the teams are doing that very actively. I think we've owned those 2 businesses for 2 or 3 weeks in total. And the teams are already there and working, and we're excited about what the future can hold. 
I will say that this takes work and it takes time and it takes effort. And we are very conscious of the fact that the big prize here is the core Etsy Marketplace, which we are incredibly excited about the massive opportunity ahead of us at Etsy. And so we want to be thoughtful and disciplined, as we always are. So integrating Depop and Elo7, I think, is meaningful. And we want to take the time to integrate those 2 and make sure that they're successful and really set up for success. So that's very much our focus right now. 
To the question of are there other 2-sided marketplaces out there? Maybe. As I said, it's lightning in a bottle. It's not every day you come across a truly authentic organic 2-sided marketplace that really has mojo in a place that's additive to Etsy where Etsy is really positioned to help where we can acquire it at a fair price and where we have the bandwidth available to do it. So we've got a high bar, and I would say we're going to be patient and picky. And right now, we're very much focused on the core Etsy Marketplace and integrating Depop and Elo7."

So first of all, I'll start by saying that our 3 subsidiaries in our new House of Brands together represent less than 15% of our total GMS. So they're still important. We see huge opportunity for them but they are relatively minor impact to our total guide, and at Etsy, we try to think about focus, and we're very focused on continuing to grow the Etsy Marketplace. 
What we've disclosed for Depop, and when we announced the acquisition was that Depop did about $650 million of GMS in 2020 and about $70 million in revenue, and it was growing about 100% at the -- in 2020. You would expect that Depop is experiencing the same sort of macro headwinds from the economy reopening that all of e-commerce is experiencing. So we -- while we're not giving a specific guide for Depop now, you can consider that, that's factored into our guidance. 
Elo7 is much smaller. Also, they had -- they did not have a tailwind from the pandemic in 2020 like Depop and Etsy did a lot because there they've had significant impact from COVID in that region and also their business is much more concentrated in the event space that has been more hampered by shutdowns. We did, however, say in our guidance the addition of those 2 new businesses to our former consolidated numbers, so former consolidated, meaning Etsy plus Reverb, creates about a 300 basis point contraction to the bottom line. These are very new businesses. We've owned them for 2 weeks. Reverb is a perfect example of how we've been able to grow and optimize that business. So we're super excited about it while we invest in them for growth."

And so adding 8 million new buyers is a sequential decline from what we were adding in the pandemic. But it's 8 million new buyers. And in fact, it's almost twice the level of new buyers we were adding before the pandemic. So I think that's, again, quite remarkable. And they're coming from a number of sectors. One, international has been great and we are growing in international markets a little faster as a percentage of the total than we are in the U.S. in places like the U.K. and Germany. For example, our core focus areas, the investments we've been making over a period of years to make those markets more robust, we're seeing some of the fruits of that. 
But even in the United States, there are still a lot of people who don't shop online, don't regularly shop online or haven't really heard of Etsy. Etsy is coming into the common vocabulary now and people are starting to say, ""Oh yes, my neighbor told me about that."" And, ""Oh yes, I hear that's really hip and cool."" There's a lot of people who still haven't yet experienced Etsy. 
And then there's new demographics that we're starting to really lean into. For example, men, that's about 50% of the population and it's very underrepresented at Etsy, as we've said. And we think that leaning in more there, we can do a lot to open up to new segments and new categories even within the United States."

But at minimum, it will be a badge on your shop to highlight to buyers that you're one of the very best sellers. 
I think one of the most important things it does, though, is it provides agency to sellers. It tells them very transparently, here are the customer service metrics that buyers care about the most and here is what good looks like. And that sets a bar, an aspiration for our sellers of where they want to go and where we want them to go. And one of the things we hear from sellers over and over again is, what can I do to be more prominent? And if you look online, what -- the tips and tricks they hear from a lot of others is like keyword stuffing, like put more keywords in your title. That doesn't necessarily make the buyer experience better, right? Do you ship on time? Do you answer buyer convos in a really timely fashion? Do you get 5-star reviews on your products? Those are things that buyers really care about, and we want to focus sellers on those things. 
And so the Star Seller program is a great example. And by the way, it's not the only way we can do this, but it is a powerful example of how we can really tell sellers exactly what they can do to be more prominent and give them agency in their own success in a way that creates a race to the top and lifts all boats. And I'm really excited about this track of work in the coming years."

And that we have these really, really big numbers to comp. We said that non-mask sales in Q3 last year grew 119%. And we roughly added $2 billion of GMS on a 2-year basis.

Second tier are things that we can operate as services across all of our brands. So Payments might be an example of that and we'll certainly explore that. There might be other things like member support and trust and safety. There might be other services like our ad network.

In fact, non-m",2016,"Thanks, Deb, and good evening, everyone. Etsy delivered a strong second quarter. I'm pleased to share highlights with you on our progress and our results. 
Consolidated GMS was $3 billion, up 10% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. In fact, non-mask GMS on an Etsy stand-alone basis grew 31% year-over-year which, frankly, I find remarkable, given the extraordinary comps from last year. And on a 2-year basis, this is 153% growth, also excluding face masks. 
Revenue grew 23%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%. We feel great about these returns we're seeing as our investments ramp. We also announced the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7 during the quarter, which I'll talk about in just a few minutes. 
Our Q2 '21 performance is particularly impressive when put in context of the year-ago period that we're comping. Remembering back to Q2 of 2020, brick-and-mortar stores were largely shut down with the exception of essential services. And even at those essential stores, lines were long and shelves were often empty. Even e-tailers faced similar challenges, with many products out of stock and long shipping delays for the rest. 
And in the midst of this crisis, Etsy mobilized cottage industry to the rescue. Etsy sellers had so much of what you needed and were ready to ship quickly, at a fair price and without significant supply chain challenges. In fact, Etsy was one of the few places where you could shop with confidence and convenience in Q2 of 2020. As a result, we delivered the highest growth rate of any company that we track in our sector. 
Flash forward to Q2 of 2021 and thankfully, things began to look dramatically different. While the situation is still evolving, people are moving about much more freely and beginning to travel and dine out again. Many brick-and-mortar stores have reopened, and there are a wide range of e-tailers ready to ship almost anything to your doorstep without delay. And even in the face of this renewed abundance of choice, again and again, shoppers chose to return to Etsy, in fact, about 90 million of them. And most importantly, they chose to shop with us more frequently. 
Given the massive pull forward in new buyer acquisition last year, it's no surprise that new buyer growth has decelerated materially in recent months. However, that deceleration has been offset by growth in GMS per active buyer, which as you know, is a big focus area for us. We're encouraged to see that shoppers love the experience they've had with Etsy over the past year and are coming back for more, even in a world of greatly expanded choice. 
As Rachel will talk about further, we're extremely pleased with the strength and stability we're seeing in our cohort performance and our conviction to invest in what we believe is Etsy's tremendous long-term opportunity. 
Turning to our most important focus area and job #1, growing the core etsy.com marketplace. We continue to make what we believe are very valuable long-term investments aligned with our Right to Win, driving continued material improvements in the customer experience in order to make Etsy even more special and deepen our competitive advantages. 
I'll now walk through some of the exciting progress we made in Q2. Starting with search and discovery. In our quest to close the semantic gap and create a platform that better understands our buyers, tastes and preferences, in Q2, our team created and launched a proprietary capability we call XWalk, a large-scale real-time graph retrieval engine that dramatically expands the amount of available data used to capture semantic meaning and to improve conversion rate by showing more relevant inventory to buyers. 
Every click and purchase on Etsy gives us information about the relationship between users, queries, listings, shops and more. And these events have long powered our ranking and retrieval systems. But due to the sheer volume of information, we could only use a relatively small slice of it. With XWalk, we're now able to use nearly all of our relevant data to better capture semantic meaning across all of our inventory. 
For example, XWalk has significantly reduced the number of dead ends, which are queries that return 0 search results, unlocking over 1 million incremental searches that are delivering relevant search results. We're only at the very beginning stages of leveraging XWalk, which has many other applications beyond search, for example, making recommendations more relevant, providing better on-site marketing experiences and improving technologies that keep the Marketplace safe. 
Turning to Slide 7 in our efforts to amplify the human element of the Etsy Marketplace. We've mentioned listing videos on our last few calls, and we're now starting to get real traction as they're incorporated throughout more and more of the Etsy experience on-site and off. In fact, there are now nearly 8 million videos uploaded on Etsy. Listing videos are driving engagement on social and we're seeing measurable wins from adding videos to the homepage. 
We're especially encouraged by the results our sellers are seeing from their process videos, which show how our sellers make their items, an especially Etsy-like experience. Many buyers are viewing these videos and watching them to completion. In fact, listing and process videos drove a significant sequential increase in engagement on our social channels, up 700% quarter-over-quarter. 
Our third pillar is, of course, about trust. And we've -- as we've said, we're laser focused this year on the post-purchase experience and we're making great progress. This quarter, I'd like to highlight the gains we've made with delivery predictability, setting clear expectations for when items will arrive and ensuring our sellers consistently meet those expectations. 
In the second quarter of 2020, only 73% of domestic orders on Etsy displayed an expected delivery date. In other words, before you placed an order, almost 30% of the time, we couldn't tell you when you could expect to receive it. Origin ZIP codes, which tell us from where in the U.S. an item is shipping, have also been an area of focus because they help us to more precisely estimate the time in transit. We've more than doubled origin ZIP code coverage over the past year, which has cut 1 full day from the expected delivery date, causing a meaningful positive impact to conversion rate. 
While we aren't in a race to be fastest, it's critical that we have transparent expectations that our sellers can meet reliably. This is a needle-mover for us. As we deliver on buyers' expectations, they've tended to come back and make more purchases more frequently. We're targeting to get both of these metrics over 90% in time for the holiday season. 
Last quarter, we told you that we would be exploring ways to define what good service looks like for Etsy sellers, leading to last week's global launch of our Star Seller program. The program's goal is to recognize and reward our best sellers while motivating all sellers to deliver exceptional customer service. As part of this program, we've defined a set of customer service metrics that we know are critical to buyers, such as on-time shipping, 5-star reviews and responsiveness to buyer convos. And we've set the bar for what good looks like, all while providing a transparent dashboard to show sellers where they stand versus each of these metrics. We believe that this creates a race to the top for sellers, who will understand even more what actions they can take in order to further delight customers. Later this year, we'll begin to surface Star Seller Badges throughout the buyer experience. 
Turning to Slide 10, let's talk about our continuing investments designed to increase frequency. As you know, we're laser-focused on this area. And in fact, the Etsy Marketplace delivered a 22% increase in GMS per active buyer in the quarter. I'm delighted to report that we're seeing encouraging signs of progress across multiple initiatives. Highlighting just 2: first, we're continuing to see progress with buyer triggers. For example, adding a badge in the upper corner of the ap icon, showing how many updates are pending drove a meaningful increase in repeat visit rate. 
And second, we've created faster and easier ways for sellers to invest in deepening relationships with their buyers while driving frequency to Etsy. A great example is seller thank you coupons. For example, get 10% off on your next purchase when you buy again from my shop, which during an experiment, saw 170% improvement in uptake. Now 11% of purchases include a thank you coupon. 
As many of you know, the Buy on Etsy app has historically been our highest converting experience. In Q2, we began to test more prominent ways to prompt buyers to download the app at key moments in their journey. We focused on organic product improvements and to date, have invested very few marketing dollars to drive app downloads. We've seen major wins. For example, by prompting app downloads on the post-purchase thank you page, encouraging you to download the app in order to easily track your order status. The results have been compelling. We're now running at about 1.3 million app downloads a month and have garnered 9 million downloads year-to-date. And Etsy is now the #7 shopping app in the iOS App Store, the highest it's ever been. 
Most importantly, newer cohorts of app users are showing promising engagement signals based on their visits, favoriting and purchase behavior. In Q2, new app users that made a purchase then went on to favorite and view listings roughly 20% more than new mobile web users that made a purchase during the same time frame. 
Turning to brand marketing. TV and digital video continue to be great tools to drive awareness and engagement with the Etsy brand. As we mentioned last quarter, our investments in the U.K. and Germany are showing encouraging results. Double clicking on Germany, in addition to our TV and digital video investments, we worked with German personalities to support our [ Etsy Hot Seat ] or Etsy Has It campaign. We saw 5 points of improvement in prompted and unprompted awareness, expanded social reach and generated over 4.5 million impressions in earned media during the campaign flight. 
Other benefits included an uptick in seller growth and a higher return on our performance marketing channels. We're very pleased with these results, which indicate that we're laying the foundation for growth in this important market. 
There are so many more product and marketing wins I'd love to tell you about, but I also want to give some time to our other marketplaces. We now have 4 highly differentiated e-commerce marketplaces in our House of Brands, and we couldn't be more excited to have found 2 more businesses that share our mission to Keep Commerce Human. 
In addition to common missions, strong leadership teams and performance-based cultures, each brand is connected at the core, with similar growth levers and requirements for success such as sophisticated search technology, compelling on-site customer experiences, an efficient payment platform, value-added seller services, effective shipping options, strong brand and performance marketing capabilities and a commitment to investments that protect the marketplace. As you know, we have deep expertise in each of these areas, and we'll be implementing knowledge sharing loops to drive value creation across the brands, all while enabling each to serve its customers in its own distinct way. 
First, turning to Depop on Slide 14. We believe Depop is the best asset in the resale space, given its high user engagement metrics. The U.S. secondhand market opportunity is projected to double to $77 billion by 2025. And the resale portion of secondhand is forecasted to grow 11x faster than retail clothing for the next 5 years. We're also seeing that young consumers are adopting secondhand fashion faster than any other audience. And Depop is the tenth most-visited shopping site among Gen Z consumers in the U.S. In fact, we think Depop is potentially to Etsy like Venmo was to PayPal, a new way to shop for the new generation. 
Let's take a look at a quick 30-second video that captures the excitement of Depop.

Just like we've demonstrated with Etsy and Reverb, we see significant opportunities to make focused improvements to the on-site product experience that we believe can expand conversion rate. We'll also explore value-added services to drive monetization. We'll compare insights on how we've grown Etsy globally with localized experiences and focused investments to help Depop take its marketplace beyond its current core regions in the U.S. and U.K. And we'll work to evaluate the efficiency of their marketing investments, focused on improving LTV, driving buyer and GMS growth and enabling the business to invest more and similar or better returns compared to their current investments. 
Now turning to Elo7. Elo7 is known as the Etsy of Brazil, a leader in custom and made-to-order merchandise. We now have a foothold in Latin America, a region with high barriers to entry where we previously did not have a meaningful customer base. Elo7 is ranked as a top 10 e-commerce site in Brazil, providing us with a strong local brand in the largest Latin American e-commerce region. E-commerce in Latin America is estimated to be less than 10% penetrated and is expected to reach approximately $160 billion by 2025. Brazil alone is forecasted to reach $50 billion in the same time period. Here's a quick glimpse of Elo7 through one of their TV ads. We hope you'll agree that the similarities with Etsy are obvious.

We've just kicked off integration work for both businesses, so it's important to keep in mind that it will take multiple quarters and years to operationalize all of the many ways that we believe we can help Depop and Elo7 grow. 
And last but certainly not least, Reverb delivered a solid quarter despite prior year comps that benefited from many competitors having to close their retail stores and warehouses. We're confident that the Reverb team is focused on the right areas and are excited about their future opportunities. In particular, this past quarter, we launched personalized recommendations and invited more music makers to add to their gear collections, which now includes over 175,000 pieces of gear from players across Reverb. 
This capability not only helps us to learn more about buyers and personalize their experience, it also helps players consider selling their gear through a greater understanding of how much it's worth. We launched a new premium ad platform for Bump, and we formed a new international product team that delivered its first global specific feature enhancements. 
Taking all of this together, we believe that Etsy is now an even more valuable company with an even larger opportunity than we had before. We have a large and expanding TAM and we're moving in a different direction than commoditized marketplaces. 
The pandemic proved just how many purchase occasions Etsy is relevant for, and we have more confidence than ever in our core opportunity. Reverb has a compelling value proposition in musical instruments and we see a clear path for future growth. Depop enables us to deepen our penetration into apparel, specifically in the exciting and fast-growing sector of resale. And Elo7 gives us a local presence in the large Brazilian market. Our ambition is driven by a true love of lightning in a bottle peer-to-peer marketplaces and a well-defined investment strategy that we believe can drive strong top line growth and profitability for these brands. 
Many of you have asked whether these deals are a sign of more to come. I can tell you that our primary focus now is to integrate Depop and Elo7 into the family while continuing to drive strong performance at Etsy and Reverb. We're incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished. And hopefully, we've demonstrated to you that we balance our ambition with discipline, making thoughtful and strategic moves that build long-term value for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rachel."

My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and etsy.com's stand-alone results, where appropriate. As a reminder, Depop and Elo7 results are not reflected in our consolidated financial results or KPIs for the second quarter. 
We had a strong quarter across the board despite macro headwinds and challenging year-over-year comps, delivering GMS, revenue and adjusted EBITDA squarely within our expectations. Before diving in, I want to point out that we're now growing off a meaningfully larger base. Just taking GMS, for example, we've added $2 billion incrementally to the 2019 base, and we're just beginning to benefit from the power of what this larger scale can do for Etsy over time. 
Moving to the financials. On a consolidated basis, Etsy's second quarter GMS grew 13% year-over-year to $3 billion, revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $529 million and adjusted EBITDA was $139 million with a margin of about 26%. On an etsy.com stand-alone basis, we see non-mask GMS growth as an important barometer of underlying trends in the core business. In Q2, face masks declined to 1.4% of etsy.com's stand-alone GMS, declining sequentially each quarter since Q2 of last year. 
And as you can see on Slide 23, non-mask GMS grew 31% year-over-year, particularly notable considering last year's unprecedented spike in new buyers with the onset of the pandemic. Non-mask GMS growth on a 2-year basis remained fairly stable relative to last quarter and the historical trend line. These are encouraging data points that highlight strong underlying trends in our business. 
While we don't anticipate showing the monthly cadence of growth in the future, we thought it was important to show the stability of our trends in light of the expected headwinds in the coming quarters. 
Here, you can see the monthly cadence of growth on a 2-year basis for the etsy.com stand-alone marketplace. April was up 177%, May was up 150% and June was up 143%. This trend details how we delivered strong growth throughout the quarter, particularly on a 2-year basis. But in light of the expected Q2 headwinds, there has been steady deceleration as the world has reopened. 
On a consolidated basis, percent international GMS expanded 900 basis points year-over-year to 41% of overall GMS. International GMS grew faster than our overall growth and was up 45% in Q2. Our fastest-growing trade route was once again international domestic, sales in which both the buyer and seller are in the same market. New and existing international buyer growth trended in line with each other, unlike in the U.S. where we are seeing deceleration in new buyer growth. Growth in international has been fueled by product investments such as an improved English to German translation model and higher investment in brand marketing in the U.K. and Germany. 
Consolidated Q2 revenue was again driven by growth in both Marketplace and services revenue, with key drivers being Etsy Ads revenue, Etsy Payments and GMS volume. Transaction fee revenue grew 15% year-over-year, driven by higher GMS from visit growth and frequency. Payments revenue was up 19% and we processed 92% of our etsy.com stand-alone GMS through Etsy Payments in Q2, a direct result of the expansion of Etsy Payments to 9 new countries in Q3 of 2020. 
Consolidated advertising revenue, which includes Etsy Ads and Reverb's Bump, was up 44% year-over-year. Consolidated take rate expanded to 17.4% in the second quarter, up 150 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. Etsy Ads revenue growth, excluding Reverb's Bump service, was up 47%, following nearly 100% revenue growth in the prior year. Etsy Ads revenue was driven by experiments that improved our ad ranking function, resulting in a significant increase in the post-click conversion rate while maintaining the same attractive return on ad spend for our sellers. As a result, sellers have continued to increase their overall budget for Etsy Ads to procure prominent placement and increased sales. In fact, for the month of June 2021, seller budget was 92% higher when compared to their overall budget in June of 2020. 
Gross margin was 72% on a consolidated basis, continuing to benefit from our shift to offsite ads, which delivers incremental revenue without an equal offset in cost of revenue and which we view as a significant subsidy to our performance marketing spend. As you may recall, our introduction of offsite ads, which we began to bill sellers for in May 2020, drove a 500 basis point expansion in gross margin at that time. 
In Q2 '21, offsite ads opt-out rates were still less than 2% and chargeability remained healthy. In fact, the number of sellers who've chosen to stay in the program is growing at a faster rate than active sellers, a testament to how many sellers value our offsite ads product. 
Our product development investments continue to deliver strong returns, driving higher conversion rates and frequency. For example, we now have more squads focused on frequency initiatives and have seen significant increases in hit rate. Q2 consolidated product development spend was $62 million, up 37% year-over-year, mostly driven by our planned increased headcount. Note that consolidated headcount was nearly 1,600 at quarter end, up 24% year-over-year, with much of this increase sitting in product development. 
We have continued to ramp our marketing spend to lean into this time when the Etsy brand is capturing global attention. Q2 consolidated marketing spend was $167 million, up 46% year-over-year. Brand spend was 23% of consolidated marketing, up 73% year-over-year. An important driver of the increased marketing spend in Q2 was our TV campaigns in the U.K. and Germany, which each performed well during the quarter. In Germany, where we had not tested upper funnel marketing before, we jumped 4 places in ComScore retail rankings during the month of May. In both markets, we also observed the halo effect of making other performance channels work harder. 
We're seeing significant progress prompting buyers to download the app, which represents our smallest share of visits, yet has the highest conversion rate. And nearly all of this is coming from product investments rather than marketing spend. We believe success here could lead to more traffic from repeat and existing buyers shifting from paid to organic, which will enable us to spend more to acquire new buyers through higher LTV as well as improvement to adjusted EBITDA as paid clicks and visits shift to organic. 
Moving to our operating metrics for the Etsy stand-alone marketplace. In Q2, active buyers grew 51% year-over-year to approximately 90 million. Repeat buyers, those who made purchases on 2 or more days in a 12-month period, grew 61% year-over-year to 36 million. And habitual buyers, our most loyal buyers, remained our fastest-growing buyer segment, up 115% for the quarter to nearly 8 million. As of Q2 2021, this buyer segment accounts for only 9% of active buyers that contributes on average about 40% of our GMS. These metrics demonstrate encouraging stability in our buyer base, signs we've all been looking for as barometers for how sticky the 2020 gains may be. 
As you know, the pandemic significantly accelerated our acquisition of new buyers. In 2020, we acquired 38 million new buyers, nearly 2x the number of new buyers we acquired in 2019. Remember, a new buyer is someone who has never before shopped on Etsy. As anticipated, our new buyer growth rate declined in Q2 but remained at a healthy level of 8 million, nearly double the number of new buyers acquired in Q2 2019. On a trailing 12-month basis, we've acquired over 40 million new buyers. 
We're excited to see that the underlying purchase trends for our new buyer cohorts remain healthy as well. For example, Q2 GMS per new buyer expanded to $46, growing 24% year-over-year. Many of you asked us during the past year if the buyers we acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic were valuable or only came to Etsy during the pandemic, given limited shopping options. We are only a few months into the world gradually reopening, and so far, all signs indicate that these buyers are at least as valuable as those we acquired prior to the pandemic. 
GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis accelerated to $129, a record 22% year-over-year growth, driven by repeat purchases and frequency. We're extremely pleased to see our cohorts continue to show stable underlying trends as we invest to drive further stickiness and habit-forming behavior. 
Moving to the balance sheet. As of 6/30, we had $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, in addition to a $200 million revolver that is currently undrawn. Note that the acquisitions of both Depop and Elo7 were completed in July, so these acquisitions are not reflected on the quarter-ending balance sheet. During the quarter, we also issued $1 billion of 7-year convertible senior notes. A portion of the proceeds was used to repurchase $180 million of our stock and to purchase capped calls. Free cash flow was impacted by the timing of cash payments compared to accruals for sizable expenses such as sales taxes and marketing spend. 
And now turning to our outlook. We currently estimate that our Q3 consolidated GMS, which will now include Etsy Reverb, Depop and Elo7, will be approximately $2.9 billion to $3 billion, up about 12.5% at the midpoint compared to Q3 of last year. Our Q3 revenue will be $500 million to $525 million, up about 13.5% at the midpoint versus Q3 of last year. And our adjusted EBITDA margin will be about 25%. 
Within our Q3 GMS guidance, we are forecasting very solid growth for the etsy.com stand-alone marketplace. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit GMS growth and growth in the mid-teens, excluding face masks. In Q3 2020, etsy.com's stand-alone marketplace GMS grew 116%, which was the highest growth rate among the U.S. publicly traded e-commerce peers that we track, a really big number to comp. Please also remember that 11% of Etsy's stand-alone GMS or $264 million was from face masks in Q3 2020. 
Consolidated revenue guidance assumes a take rate of about 17.4%. Excluding Depop and Elo7 from the Q3 guidance, our take rate guidance for just etsy.com and Reverb, our former consolidated reporting, would have been about 17.7%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for Q3 is also impacted by the addition of Depop and Elo7. The addition of these 2 businesses is about a 300 basis point contraction to what our guidance would have been without them. Given very similar fundamental economics to etsy.com and Reverb, we're confident that with scale, both can deliver strong margins and healthy levels of profitability. 
It is important to keep in mind that the etsy.com Marketplace will continue to be the vast majority of our top and bottom line performance, at least in the near term. In fact, given the transaction timing and the relative size of Depop and Elo7, we expect only modest contribution to our Q3 and FY '21 top line performance. Also for your models, I mentioned that Q2 consolidated headcount was up over 20%, and you can expect this rate of hiring to continue this quarter. And we recently welcomed 550 new employees to Etsy, Inc. with our July acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. 
As we look beyond Q3, we are excited about the upcoming holiday season, with so many product and marketing initiatives already bearing fruit and more to come. For Q4, keep in mind that we will be comparing to the very strong 2020 holiday period, which benefited from an extended shopping season, stimulus payments, continued shutdowns in certain regions and some logistics disruptions for other e-commerce players. Also recall that the fourth quarter had $133 million of face mask GMS or about 4% of our total. We are currently forecasting very little GMS from face masks in our Q4 2021 internal model. 
We've previously pointed out that our comps get tougher as we progress through 2021. With Q1 2022, potentially our hardest go-forward comp, given the sizable positive impact from government stimulus in Q1 2021. We operate Etsy with a disciplined approach that maintains a healthy balance between growth and margins, and our results have historically landed us between a rule of 40 and a rule of 50 company. We plan to continue to live by this principle and are confident that our long-term profitability model remains intact.

So first, we feel really good about our Q3 guide. I mean, we're talking about Etsy stand-alone growing in the mid-teens Q-over-Q in a world where we anticipate that in Q3, the world will be largely reopened, and people are going about their lives much like they were not entirely like they were before COVID, of course, but much like they were before COVID. 
So some of the things that are powering that, we are seeing a resurgence of growth from some categories like weddings. So weddings, for example, was up over 100% quarter-over -- year-over-year in Q2, and it was the second sequential quarter of growth for weddings. So that's certainly helpful. We're also seeing building momentum in some categories like back-to-school. So last year was all about home schooling and people were buying desks for their kids at home. Now they're buying backpacks and they're buying all sorts of things to get ready to send their kids back to school and we're already seeing that. 
We're really pleased to see sustained momentum in many categories. So for example, home furnishings is seeing nice, sustained growth, and as you know, that's our largest category. And some of the things that are really hot in home furnishings right now are kids' furniture, garden, gardening activities and things like that. And then as always, we're seeing the viral trends. Whatever is hot and new right now is showing up on Etsy. So things that are hot on TikTok, for example, show up on Etsy within moments and actually can drive millions of dollars of GMS. So those are really the 4 buckets. And Deb, did I -- [ I forgot, like, ] at the beginning."

So you can see that without the new businesses, our take rate would have been 17.7%. And the new businesses, though much smaller than Etsy, have lower take rates and make some contraction to that overall number. 
Etsy has gotten take rate gains from the expansion of Etsy Payments to 9 new markets globally. And Reverb actually took a price increase last year as well, which helps keep the former consolidated Etsy take rate high. We look at take rate improvements as a value exchange, so where we can offer more services that are -- that benefit the seller. In exchange for some fee increase, we are open to doing those things. So for instance, last year, we added offsite ads and that was a win-win for sellers and for Etsy. 
So there's lots of opportunity to continue to add services, and where we see a fair exchange of value, would consider taking fees for that. But right now, we have no plans for that and there's nothing in our guidance that would suggest that we have any plans for that."

And we just combined the 2, you're right, very, very quickly. Brazil is different. Etsy doesn't really have a presence in Brazil. And in fact, cross-border trade between Brazil and other markets outside of Mercosur is really tough for a bunch of reasons. 
And so we expect that Elo7 will remain a stand-alone brand and a stand-alone business, giving us a presence in Brazil for the first time. And when we look at who has succeeded in Brazil, it has tended to be the native companies. MercadoLibre is very successful there, and eBay didn't manage to penetrate. So we think having a native indigenous brand in Brazil built for Brazil that is focused primarily on domestic trade is the right way to go, and we're really excited about the Elo7 team and brand is our way to do that."

We are seeing that the brand marketing spend we're doing in Germany and the U.K. is making our performance marketing more effective, and therefore, we are spending more. 
The performance marketing spend is quite mechanical. We have very clear ROI thresholds, and we have quite clear ways to measure impact in nearly real-time. So as the performance of our performance marketing gets better, we just automatically increase spend. And if things happen to depress it, we automatically take spend down. 
But you're right that because the TV advertising is making brand awareness higher, it means the propensity to click on our ads is higher and the lifetime value of the customers is higher, and that allows us to spend incrementally more in those markets."

We said percentage that was paid was 19%, which is down from the previous quarter. Remember that one of the things that we do is we invest in top-of-funnel marketing, which we don't count in our paid spend because the traffic from top-of-funnel marketing comes in through the direct channel. So we spent a lot of money incrementally marketing in the second quarter. The dominant portion of that incremental spend was on top-of-funnel marketing in the U.K. and Germany, drove a lot of top line that we count as direct. So that's one of the answers to your question. 
The second answer is that we actually spent relatively flat amount of money on performance marketing, and we got the same or better ROI. And also recall that our performance marketing is now subsidized by our offsite ads product. We don't actually see that subsidy in the marketing line that shows up in revenue. So all of those factors together drove really high return on our performance marketing spend and relatively a lower percentage of total traffic coming from paid."

And really job 1 was to partner with the Reverb team to think about where can their product efforts be most focused to improve conversion rate. That makes the value of a visit go up and the lifetime value of a visitor and a customer go up. And at the same time, how can we optimize their marketing spend? 
And those 2 are actually a virtuous cycle because if conversion rate goes up, the value of a visit goes up, that allows you to actually invest more in marketing, right? And if your marketing is more efficient, you can really get the flywheel to turn. And so we're excited about how that has worked at Reverb, and we hope to execute similar ideas, not the exact same but similar kinds of playbooks at both Depop and Elo7. 
They're both very different marketplaces and they have different dynamics and they face different trends. And so step 1 is to get in and partner with their teams and understand where they are and see where we can add value and what their current road maps are. And so the teams are doing that very actively. I think we've owned those 2 businesses for 2 or 3 weeks in total. And the teams are already there and working, and we're excited about what the future can hold. 
I will say that this takes work and it takes time and it takes effort. And we are very conscious of the fact that the big prize here is the core Etsy Marketplace, which we are incredibly excited about the massive opportunity ahead of us at Etsy. And so we want to be thoughtful and disciplined, as we always are. So integrating Depop and Elo7, I think, is meaningful. And we want to take the time to integrate those 2 and make sure that they're successful and really set up for success. So that's very much our focus right now. 
To the question of are there other 2-sided marketplaces out there? Maybe. As I said, it's lightning in a bottle. It's not every day you come across a truly authentic organic 2-sided marketplace that really has mojo in a place that's additive to Etsy, where Etsy is really positioned to help, where we can acquire it at a fair price and where we have the bandwidth available to do it. So we've got a high bar, and I would say we're going to be patient and picky. And right now, we're very much focused on the core Etsy Marketplace and integrating Depop and Elo7."

We see huge opportunity for them but they are relatively minor impact to our total guide, and at Etsy, we try to think about focus, and we're very focused on continuing to grow the Etsy Marketplace. 
What we've disclosed for Depop, and when we announced the acquisition was that Depop did about $650 million of GMS in 2020 and about $70 million in revenue, and it was growing about 100% at the -- in 2020. You would expect that Depop is experiencing the same sort of macro headwinds from the economy reopening that all of e-commerce is experiencing. So we -- while we're not giving a specific guide for Depop now, you can consider that, that's factored into our guidance. 
Elo7 is much smaller. Also, they had -- they did not have a tailwind from the pandemic in 2020 like Depop and Etsy did a lot because there they've had significant impact from COVID in that region and also their business is much more concentrated in the event space that has been more hampered by shutdowns. We did, however, say in our guidance the addition of those 2 new businesses to our former consolidated numbers, so former consolidated, meaning Etsy plus Reverb, creates about a 300 basis point contraction to the bottom line. These are very new businesses. We've owned them for 2 weeks. Reverb is a perfect example of how we've been able to grow and optimize that business.

But even in the United States, there are still a lot of people who don't shop online, don't regularly shop online or haven't really heard of Etsy. Etsy is coming into the common vocabulary now and people are starting to say, ""Oh yes, my neighbor told me about that."" And, ""Oh yes, I hear that's really hip and cool."" There's a lot of people who still haven't yet experienced Etsy. 
And then there's new demographics that we're starting to really lean into. For example, men, that's about 50% of the population and it's very underrepresented at Etsy, as we've said. And we think that leaning in more there, we can do a lot to open up to new segments and new categories even within the United States."

I think one of the most important things it does, though, is it provides agency to sellers. It tells them very transparently, here are the customer service metrics that buyers care about the most and here is what good looks like. And that sets a bar, an aspiration for our sellers of where they want to go and where we want them to go. And one of the things we hear from sellers over and over again is, what can I do to be more prominent? And if you look online, what -- the tips and tricks they hear from a lot of others is like keyword stuffing, like put more keywords in your title.

Those are things that buyers really care about, and we want to focus sellers on those things. 
And so the Star Seller program is a great example.

First is things that are back office like G&A, where we don't necessarily need to replicate certain functions in every single business, and we can handle those things from a corporate perspective, things like legal and finance and treasury and things like that. 
Second tier are things that we can operate as services across all of our brands. So Payments might be an example of that and we'll certainly explore that. There might be other things like member support and trust and safety. There might be other services like our ad network. And then there's things that we think need to be operated directly and with the innovation and creativity of those management teams like product and engineering. 
And so we're just -- again, we've only owned them for 2 weeks. We will look -- we continually will look for opportunities to optimize and scale as we grow. Payments might be one of those areas and we'll be happy to talk to you more about it as we dig into it."

In fact, non-m",2016,"Thanks, Deb, and good evening, everyone. Etsy delivered a strong second quarter. I'm pleased to share highlights with you on our progress and our results. 
Consolidated GMS was $3 billion, up 10% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. In fact, non-mask GMS on an Etsy stand-alone basis grew 31% year-over-year which, frankly, I find remarkable, given the extraordinary comps from last year. And on a 2-year basis, this is 153% growth, also excluding face masks. 
Revenue grew 23%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%. We feel great about these returns we're seeing as our investments ramp. We also announced the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7 during the quarter, which I'll talk about in just a few minutes. 
Our Q2 '21 performance is particularly impressive when put in context of the year-ago period that we're comping. Remembering back to Q2 of 2020, brick-and-mortar stores were largely shut down with the exception of essential services. And even at those essential stores, lines were long and shelves were often empty. Even e-tailers faced similar challenges, with many products out of stock and long shipping delays for the rest. 
And in the midst of this crisis, Etsy mobilized cottage industry to the rescue. Etsy sellers had so much of what you needed and were ready to ship quickly, at a fair price and without significant supply chain challenges. In fact, Etsy was one of the few places where you could shop with confidence and convenience in Q2 of 2020. As a result, we delivered the highest growth rate of any company that we track in our sector. 
Flash forward to Q2 of 2021 and thankfully, things began to look dramatically different. While the situation is still evolving, people are moving about much more freely and beginning to travel and dine out again. Many brick-and-mortar stores have reopened, and there are a wide range of e-tailers ready to ship almost anything to your doorstep without delay. And even in the face of this renewed abundance of choice, again and again, shoppers chose to return to Etsy, in fact, about 90 million of them. And most importantly, they chose to shop with us more frequently. 
Given the massive pull forward in new buyer acquisition last year, it's no surprise that new buyer growth has decelerated materially in recent months. However, that deceleration has been offset by growth in GMS per active buyer, which as you know, is a big focus area for us. We're encouraged to see that shoppers love the experience they've had with Etsy over the past year and are coming back for more, even in a world of greatly expanded choice. 
As Rachel will talk about further, we're extremely pleased with the strength and stability we're seeing in our cohort performance and our conviction to invest in what we believe is Etsy's tremendous long-term opportunity. 
Turning to our most important focus area and job #1, growing the core etsy.com marketplace. We continue to make what we believe are very valuable long-term investments aligned with our Right to Win, driving continued material improvements in the customer experience in order to make Etsy even more special and deepen our competitive advantages. 
I'll now walk through some of the exciting progress we made in Q2. Starting with search and discovery. In our quest to close the semantic gap and create a platform that better understands our buyers, tastes and preferences, in Q2, our team created and launched a proprietary capability we call XWalk, a large-scale real-time graph retrieval engine that dramatically expands the amount of available data used to capture semantic meaning and to improve conversion rate by showing more relevant inventory to buyers. 
Every click and purchase on Etsy gives us information about the relationship between users, queries, listings, shops and more. And these events have long powered our ranking and retrieval systems. But due to the sheer volume of information, we could only use a relatively small slice of it. With XWalk, we're now able to use nearly all of our relevant data to better capture semantic meaning across all of our inventory. 
For example, XWalk has significantly reduced the number of dead ends, which are queries that return 0 search results, unlocking over 1 million incremental searches that are delivering relevant search results. We're only at the very beginning stages of leveraging XWalk, which has many other applications beyond search, for example, making recommendations more relevant, providing better on-site marketing experiences and improving technologies that keep the Marketplace safe. 
Turning to Slide 7 in our efforts to amplify the human element of the Etsy Marketplace. We've mentioned listing videos on our last few calls, and we're now starting to get real traction as they're incorporated throughout more and more of the Etsy experience on-site and off. In fact, there are now nearly 8 million videos uploaded on Etsy. Listing videos are driving engagement on social and we're seeing measurable wins from adding videos to the homepage. 
We're especially encouraged by the results our sellers are seeing from their process videos, which show how our sellers make their items, an especially Etsy-like experience. Many buyers are viewing these videos and watching them to completion. In fact, listing and process videos drove a significant sequential increase in engagement on our social channels, up 700% quarter-over-quarter. 
Our third pillar is, of course, about trust. And we've -- as we've said, we're laser focused this year on the post-purchase experience and we're making great progress. This quarter, I'd like to highlight the gains we've made with delivery predictability, setting clear expectations for when items will arrive and ensuring our sellers consistently meet those expectations. 
In the second quarter of 2020, only 73% of domestic orders on Etsy displayed an expected delivery date. In other words, before you placed an order, almost 30% of the time, we couldn't tell you when you could expect to receive it. Origin ZIP codes, which tell us from where in the U.S. an item is shipping, have also been an area of focus because they help us to more precisely estimate the time in transit. We've more than doubled origin ZIP code coverage over the past year, which has cut 1 full day from the expected delivery date, causing a meaningful positive impact to conversion rate. 
While we aren't in a race to be fastest, it's critical that we have transparent expectations that our sellers can meet reliably. This is a needle-mover for us. As we deliver on buyers' expectations, they've tended to come back and make more purchases more frequently. We're targeting to get both of these metrics over 90% in time for the holiday season. 
Last quarter, we told you that we would be exploring ways to define what good service looks like for Etsy sellers, leading to last week's global launch of our Star Seller program. The program's goal is to recognize and reward our best sellers while motivating all sellers to deliver exceptional customer service. As part of this program, we've defined a set of customer service metrics that we know are critical to buyers, such as on-time shipping, 5-star reviews and responsiveness to buyer convos. And we've set the bar for what good looks like, all while providing a transparent dashboard to show sellers where they stand versus each of these metrics. We believe that this creates a race to the top for sellers, who will understand even more what actions they can take in order to further delight customers. Later this year, we'll begin to surface Star Seller Badges throughout the buyer experience. 
Turning to Slide 10, let's talk about our continuing investments designed to increase frequency. As you know, we're laser-focused on this area. And in fact, the Etsy Marketplace delivered a 22% increase in GMS per active buyer in the quarter. I'm delighted to report that we're seeing encouraging signs of progress across multiple initiatives. Highlighting just 2: first, we're continuing to see progress with buyer triggers. For example, adding a badge in the upper corner of the ap icon, showing how many updates are pending drove a meaningful increase in repeat visit rate. 
And second, we've created faster and easier ways for sellers to invest in deepening relationships with their buyers while driving frequency to Etsy. A great example is seller thank you coupons. For example, get 10% off on your next purchase when you buy again from my shop, which during an experiment, saw 170% improvement in uptake. Now 11% of purchases include a thank you coupon. 
As many of you know, the Buy on Etsy app has historically been our highest converting experience. In Q2, we began to test more prominent ways to prompt buyers to download the app at key moments in their journey. We focused on organic product improvements and to date, have invested very few marketing dollars to drive app downloads. We've seen major wins. For example, by prompting app downloads on the post-purchase thank you page, encouraging you to download the app in order to easily track your order status. The results have been compelling. We're now running at about 1.3 million app downloads a month and have garnered 9 million downloads year-to-date. And Etsy is now the #7 shopping app in the iOS App Store, the highest it's ever been. 
Most importantly, newer cohorts of app users are showing promising engagement signals based on their visits, favoriting and purchase behavior. In Q2, new app users that made a purchase then went on to favorite and view listings roughly 20% more than new mobile web users that made a purchase during the same time frame. 
Turning to brand marketing. TV and digital video continue to be great tools to drive awareness and engagement with the Etsy brand. As we mentioned last quarter, our investments in the U.K. and Germany are showing encouraging results. Double clicking on Germany, in addition to our TV and digital video investments, we worked with German personalities to support our [ Etsy Hot Seat ] or Etsy Has It campaign. We saw 5 points of improvement in prompted and unprompted awareness, expanded social reach and generated over 4.5 million impressions in earned media during the campaign flight. 
Other benefits included an uptick in seller growth and a higher return on our performance marketing channels. We're very pleased with these results, which indicate that we're laying the foundation for growth in this important market. 
There are so many more product and marketing wins I'd love to tell you about, but I also want to give some time to our other marketplaces. We now have 4 highly differentiated e-commerce marketplaces in our House of Brands, and we couldn't be more excited to have found 2 more businesses that share our mission to Keep Commerce Human. 
In addition to common missions, strong leadership teams and performance-based cultures, each brand is connected at the core, with similar growth levers and requirements for success such as sophisticated search technology, compelling on-site customer experiences, an efficient payment platform, value-added seller services, effective shipping options, strong brand and performance marketing capabilities and a commitment to investments that protect the marketplace. As you know, we have deep expertise in each of these areas, and we'll be implementing knowledge sharing loops to drive value creation across the brands, all while enabling each to serve its customers in its own distinct way. 
First, turning to Depop on Slide 14. We believe Depop is the best asset in the resale space, given its high user engagement metrics. The U.S. secondhand market opportunity is projected to double to $77 billion by 2025. And the resale portion of secondhand is forecasted to grow 11x faster than retail clothing for the next 5 years. We're also seeing that young consumers are adopting secondhand fashion faster than any other audience. And Depop is the tenth most-visited shopping site among Gen Z consumers in the U.S. In fact, we think Depop is potentially to Etsy like Venmo was to PayPal, a new way to shop for the new generation. 
Let's take a look at a quick 30-second video that captures the excitement of Depop.

Now turning to Elo7. Elo7 is known as the Etsy of Brazil, a leader in custom and made-to-order merchandise. We now have a foothold in Latin America, a region with high barriers to entry where we previously did not have a meaningful customer base. Elo7 is ranked as a top 10 e-commerce site in Brazil, providing us with a strong local brand in the largest Latin American e-commerce region. E-commerce in Latin America is estimated to be less than 10% penetrated and is expected to reach approximately $160 billion by 2025. Brazil alone is forecasted to reach $50 billion in the same time period. Here's a quick glimpse of Elo7 through one of their TV ads. We hope you'll agree that the similarities with Etsy are obvious.

We've just kicked off integration work for both businesses, so it's important to keep in mind that it will take multiple quarters and years to operationalize all of the many ways that we believe we can help Depop and Elo7 grow. 
And last but certainly not least, Reverb delivered a solid quarter despite prior year comps that benefited from many competitors having to close their retail stores and warehouses. We're confident that the Reverb team is focused on the right areas and are excited about their future opportunities. In particular, this past quarter, we launched personalized recommendations and invited more music makers to add to their gear collections, which now includes over 175,000 pieces of gear from players across Reverb. 
This capability not only helps us to learn more about buyers and personalize their experience, it also helps players consider selling their gear through a greater understanding of how much it's worth. We launched a new premium ad platform for Bump, and we formed a new international product team that delivered its first global specific feature enhancements. 
Taking all of this together, we believe that Etsy is now an even more valuable company with an even larger opportunity than we had before. We have a large and expanding TAM and we're moving in a different direction than commoditized marketplaces. 
The pandemic proved just how many purchase occasions Etsy is relevant for, and we have more confidence than ever in our core opportunity. Reverb has a compelling value proposition in musical instruments and we see a clear path for future growth. Depop enables us to deepen our penetration into apparel, specifically in the exciting and fast-growing sector of resale. And Elo7 gives us a local presence in the large Brazilian market. Our ambition is driven by a true love of lightning in a bottle peer-to-peer marketplaces and a well-defined investment strategy that we believe can drive strong top line growth and profitability for these brands. 
Many of you have asked whether these deals are a sign of more to come. I can tell you that our primary focus now is to integrate Depop and Elo7 into the family while continuing to drive strong performance at Etsy and Reverb. We're incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished. And hopefully, we've demonstrated to you that we balance our ambition with discipline, making thoughtful and strategic moves that build long-term value for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rachel."

My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and etsy.com's stand-alone results, where appropriate. As a reminder, Depop and Elo7 results are not reflected in our consolidated financial results or KPIs for the second quarter. 
We had a strong quarter across the board despite macro headwinds and challenging year-over-year comps, delivering GMS, revenue and adjusted EBITDA squarely within our expectations. Before diving in, I want to point out that we're now growing off a meaningfully larger base. Just taking GMS, for example, we've added $2 billion incrementally to the 2019 base, and we're just beginning to benefit from the power of what this larger scale can do for Etsy over time. 
Moving to the financials. On a consolidated basis, Etsy's second quarter GMS grew 13% year-over-year to $3 billion, revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $529 million and adjusted EBITDA was $139 million with a margin of about 26%. On an etsy.com stand-alone basis, we see non-mask GMS growth as an important barometer of underlying trends in the core business. In Q2, face masks declined to 1.4% of etsy.com's stand-alone GMS, declining sequentially each quarter since Q2 of last year. 
And as you can see on Slide 23, non-mask GMS grew 31% year-over-year, particularly notable considering last year's unprecedented spike in new buyers with the onset of the pandemic. Non-mask GMS growth on a 2-year basis remained fairly stable relative to last quarter and the historical trend line. These are encouraging data points that highlight strong underlying trends in our business. 
While we don't anticipate showing the monthly cadence of growth in the future, we thought it was important to show the stability of our trends in light of the expected headwinds in the coming quarters. 
Here, you can see the monthly cadence of growth on a 2-year basis for the etsy.com stand-alone marketplace. April was up 177%, May was up 150% and June was up 143%. This trend details how we delivered strong growth throughout the quarter, particularly on a 2-year basis. But in light of the expected Q2 headwinds, there has been steady deceleration as the world has reopened. 
On a consolidated basis, percent international GMS expanded 900 basis points year-over-year to 41% of overall GMS. International GMS grew faster than our overall growth and was up 45% in Q2. Our fastest-growing trade route was once again international domestic, sales in which both the buyer and seller are in the same market. New and existing international buyer growth trended in line with each other, unlike in the U.S. where we are seeing deceleration in new buyer growth. Growth in international has been fueled by product investments such as an improved English to German translation model and higher investment in brand marketing in the U.K. and Germany. 
Consolidated Q2 revenue was again driven by growth in both Marketplace and services revenue, with key drivers being Etsy Ads revenue, Etsy Payments and GMS volume. Transaction fee revenue grew 15% year-over-year, driven by higher GMS from visit growth and frequency. Payments revenue was up 19% and we processed 92% of our etsy.com stand-alone GMS through Etsy Payments in Q2, a direct result of the expansion of Etsy Payments to 9 new countries in Q3 of 2020. 
Consolidated advertising revenue, which includes Etsy Ads and Reverb's Bump, was up 44% year-over-year. Consolidated take rate expanded to 17.4% in the second quarter, up 150 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. Etsy Ads revenue growth, excluding Reverb's Bump service, was up 47%, following nearly 100% revenue growth in the prior year. Etsy Ads revenue was driven by experiments that improved our ad ranking function, resulting in a significant increase in the post-click conversion rate while maintaining the same attractive return on ad spend for our sellers. As a result, sellers have continued to increase their overall budget for Etsy Ads to procure prominent placement and increased sales. In fact, for the month of June 2021, seller budget was 92% higher when compared to their overall budget in June of 2020. 
Gross margin was 72% on a consolidated basis, continuing to benefit from our shift to offsite ads, which delivers incremental revenue without an equal offset in cost of revenue and which we view as a significant subsidy to our performance marketing spend. As you may recall, our introduction of offsite ads, which we began to bill sellers for in May 2020, drove a 500 basis point expansion in gross margin at that time. 
In Q2 '21, offsite ads opt-out rates were still less than 2% and chargeability remained healthy. In fact, the number of sellers who've chosen to stay in the program is growing at a faster rate than active sellers, a testament to how many sellers value our offsite ads product. 
Our product development investments continue to deliver strong returns, driving higher conversion rates and frequency. For example, we now have more squads focused on frequency initiatives and have seen significant increases in hit rate. Q2 consolidated product development spend was $62 million, up 37% year-over-year, mostly driven by our planned increased headcount. Note that consolidated headcount was nearly 1,600 at quarter end, up 24% year-over-year, with much of this increase sitting in product development. 
We have continued to ramp our marketing spend to lean into this time when the Etsy brand is capturing global attention. Q2 consolidated marketing spend was $167 million, up 46% year-over-year. Brand spend was 23% of consolidated marketing, up 73% year-over-year. An important driver of the increased marketing spend in Q2 was our TV campaigns in the U.K. and Germany, which each performed well during the quarter. In Germany, where we had not tested upper funnel marketing before, we jumped 4 places in ComScore retail rankings during the month of May. In both markets, we also observed the halo effect of making other performance channels work harder. 
We're seeing significant progress prompting buyers to download the app, which represents our smallest share of visits, yet has the highest conversion rate. And nearly all of this is coming from product investments rather than marketing spend. We believe success here could lead to more traffic from repeat and existing buyers shifting from paid to organic, which will enable us to spend more to acquire new buyers through higher LTV as well as improvement to adjusted EBITDA as paid clicks and visits shift to organic. 
Moving to our operating metrics for the Etsy stand-alone marketplace. In Q2, active buyers grew 51% year-over-year to approximately 90 million. Repeat buyers, those who made purchases on 2 or more days in a 12-month period, grew 61% year-over-year to 36 million. And habitual buyers, our most loyal buyers, remained our fastest-growing buyer segment, up 115% for the quarter to nearly 8 million. As of Q2 2021, this buyer segment accounts for only 9% of active buyers that contributes on average about 40% of our GMS. These metrics demonstrate encouraging stability in our buyer base, signs we've all been looking for as barometers for how sticky the 2020 gains may be. 
As you know, the pandemic significantly accelerated our acquisition of new buyers. In 2020, we acquired 38 million new buyers, nearly 2x the number of new buyers we acquired in 2019. Remember, a new buyer is someone who has never before shopped on Etsy. As anticipated, our new buyer growth rate declined in Q2 but remained at a healthy level of 8 million, nearly double the number of new buyers acquired in Q2 2019. On a trailing 12-month basis, we've acquired over 40 million new buyers. 
We're excited to see that the underlying purchase trends for our new buyer cohorts remain healthy as well. For example, Q2 GMS per new buyer expanded to $46, growing 24% year-over-year. Many of you asked us during the past year if the buyers we acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic were valuable or only came to Etsy during the pandemic, given limited shopping options. We are only a few months into the world gradually reopening, and so far, all signs indicate that these buyers are at least as valuable as those we acquired prior to the pandemic. 
GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis accelerated to $129, a record 22% year-over-year growth, driven by repeat purchases and frequency. We're extremely pleased to see our cohorts continue to show stable underlying trends as we invest to drive further stickiness and habit-forming behavior. 
Moving to the balance sheet. As of 6/30, we had $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, in addition to a $200 million revolver that is currently undrawn. Note that the acquisitions of both Depop and Elo7 were completed in July, so these acquisitions are not reflected on the quarter-ending balance sheet. During the quarter, we also issued $1 billion of 7-year convertible senior notes. A portion of the proceeds was used to repurchase $180 million of our stock and to purchase capped calls. Free cash flow was impacted by the timing of cash payments compared to accruals for sizable expenses such as sales taxes and marketing spend. 
And now turning to our outlook. We currently estimate that our Q3 consolidated GMS, which will now include Etsy Reverb, Depop and Elo7, will be approximately $2.9 billion to $3 billion, up about 12.5% at the midpoint compared to Q3 of last year. Our Q3 revenue will be $500 million to $525 million, up about 13.5% at the midpoint versus Q3 of last year. And our adjusted EBITDA margin will be about 25%. 
Within our Q3 GMS guidance, we are forecasting very solid growth for the etsy.com stand-alone marketplace. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit GMS growth and growth in the mid-teens, excluding face masks. In Q3 2020, etsy.com's stand-alone marketplace GMS grew 116%, which was the highest growth rate among the U.S. publicly traded e-commerce peers that we track, a really big number to comp. Please also remember that 11% of Etsy's stand-alone GMS or $264 million was from face masks in Q3 2020. 
Consolidated revenue guidance assumes a take rate of about 17.4%. Excluding Depop and Elo7 from the Q3 guidance, our take rate guidance for just etsy.com and Reverb, our former consolidated reporting, would have been about 17.7%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for Q3 is also impacted by the addition of Depop and Elo7. The addition of these 2 businesses is about a 300 basis point contraction to what our guidance would have been without them. Given very similar fundamental economics to etsy.com and Reverb, we're confident that with scale, both can deliver strong margins and healthy levels of profitability. 
It is important to keep in mind that the etsy.com Marketplace will continue to be the vast majority of our top and bottom line performance, at least in the near term. In fact, given the transaction timing and the relative size of Depop and Elo7, we expect only modest contribution to our Q3 and FY '21 top line performance. Also for your models, I mentioned that Q2 consolidated headcount was up over 20%, and you can expect this rate of hiring to continue this quarter. And we recently welcomed 550 new employees to Etsy, Inc. with our July acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. 
As we look beyond Q3, we are excited about the upcoming holiday season, with so many product and marketing initiatives already bearing fruit and more to come. For Q4, keep in mind that we will be comparing to the very strong 2020 holiday period, which benefited from an extended shopping season, stimulus payments, continued shutdowns in certain regions and some logistics disruptions for other e-commerce players. Also recall that the fourth quarter had $133 million of face mask GMS or about 4% of our total. We are currently forecasting very little GMS from face masks in our Q4 2021 internal model. 
We've previously pointed out that our comps get tougher as we progress through 2021. With Q1 2022, potentially our hardest go-forward comp, given the sizable positive impact from government stimulus in Q1 2021. We operate Etsy with a disciplined approach that maintains a healthy balance between growth and margins, and our results have historically landed us between a rule of 40 and a rule of 50 company. We plan to continue to live by this principle and are confident that our long-term profitability model remains intact. 
Thank you for your time today. I will now turn the call over to Deb so we can take your questions."

So first, we feel really good about our Q3 guide. I mean, we're talking about Etsy stand-alone growing in the mid-teens Q-over-Q in a world where we anticipate that in Q3, the world will be largely reopened, and people are going about their lives much like they were not entirely like they were before COVID, of course, but much like they were before COVID. 
So some of the things that are powering that, we are seeing a resurgence of growth from some categories like weddings. So weddings, for example, was up over 100% quarter-over -- year-over-year in Q2, and it was the second sequential quarter of growth for weddings. So that's certainly helpful. We're also seeing building momentum in some categories like back-to-school. So last year was all about home schooling and people were buying desks for their kids at home. Now they're buying backpacks and they're buying all sorts of things to get ready to send their kids back to school and we're already seeing that. 
We're really pleased to see sustained momentum in many categories. So for example, home furnishings is seeing nice, sustained growth, and as you know, that's our largest category. And some of the things that are really hot in home furnishings right now are kids' furniture, garden, gardening activities and things like that. And then as always, we're seeing the viral trends. Whatever is hot and new right now is showing up on Etsy. So things that are hot on TikTok, for example, show up on Etsy within moments and actually can drive millions of dollars of GMS. So those are really the 4 buckets. And Deb, did I -- [ I forgot, like, ] at the beginning."

So you can see that without the new businesses, our take rate would have been 17.7%. And the new businesses, though much smaller than Etsy, have lower take rates and make some contraction to that overall number. 
Etsy has gotten take rate gains from the expansion of Etsy Payments to 9 new markets globally. And Reverb actually took a price increase last year as well, which helps keep the former consolidated Etsy take rate high. We look at take rate improvements as a value exchange, so where we can offer more services that are -- that benefit the seller. In exchange for some fee increase, we are open to doing those things. So for instance, last year, we added offsite ads and that was a win-win for sellers and for Etsy. 
So there's lots of opportunity to continue to add services, and where we see a fair exchange of value, would consider taking fees for that. But right now, we have no plans for that and there's nothing in our guidance that would suggest that we have any plans for that."

And in fact, cross-border trade between Brazil and other markets outside of Mercosur is really tough for a bunch of reasons. 
And so we expect that Elo7 will remain a stand-alone brand and a stand-alone business, giving us a presence in Brazil for the first time. And when we look at who has succeeded in Brazil, it has tended to be the native companies. MercadoLibre is very successful there, and eBay didn't manage to penetrate. So we think having a native indigenous brand in Brazil built for Brazil that is focused primarily on domestic trade is the right way to go, and we're really excited about the Elo7 team and brand is our way to do that."

We are seeing that the brand marketing spend we're doing in Germany and the U.K. is making our performance marketing more effective, and therefore, we are spending more. 
The performance marketing spend is quite mechanical. We have very clear ROI thresholds, and we have quite clear ways to measure impact in nearly real-time. So as the performance of our performance marketing gets better, we just automatically increase spend. And if things happen to depress it, we automatically take spend down. 
But you're right that because the TV advertising is making brand awareness higher, it means the propensity to click on our ads is higher and the lifetime value of the customers is higher, and that allows us to spend incrementally more in those markets."

We said percentage that was paid was 19%, which is down from the previous quarter. Remember that one of the things that we do is we invest in top-of-funnel marketing, which we don't count in our paid spend because the traffic from top-of-funnel marketing comes in through the direct channel. So we spent a lot of money incrementally marketing in the second quarter. The dominant portion of that incremental spend was on top-of-funnel marketing in the U.K. and Germany, drove a lot of top line that we count as direct. So that's one of the answers to your question. 
The second answer is that we actually spent relatively flat amount of money on performance marketing, and we got the same or better ROI. And also recall that our performance marketing is now subsidized by our offsite ads product. We don't actually see that subsidy in the marketing line that shows up in revenue. So all of those factors together drove really high return on our performance marketing spend and relatively a lower percentage of total traffic coming from paid."

And really job 1 was to partner with the Reverb team to think about where can their product efforts be most focused to improve conversion rate. That makes the value of a visit go up and the lifetime value of a visitor and a customer go up. And at the same time, how can we optimize their marketing spend? 
And those 2 are actually a virtuous cycle because if conversion rate goes up, the value of a visit goes up, that allows you to actually invest more in marketing, right? And if your marketing is more efficient, you can really get the flywheel to turn. And so we're excited about how that has worked at Reverb, and we hope to execute similar ideas, not the exact same but similar kinds of playbooks at both Depop and Elo7. 
They're both very different marketplaces and they have different dynamics and they face different trends. And so step 1 is to get in and partner with their teams and understand where they are and see where we can add value and what their current road maps are. And so the teams are doing that very actively. I think we've owned those 2 businesses for 2 or 3 weeks in total. And the teams are already there and working, and we're excited about what the future can hold. 
I will say that this takes work and it takes time and it takes effort. And we are very conscious of the fact that the big prize here is the core Etsy Marketplace, which we are incredibly excited about the massive opportunity ahead of us at Etsy. And so we want to be thoughtful and disciplined, as we always are. So integrating Depop and Elo7, I think, is meaningful. And we want to take the time to integrate those 2 and make sure that they're successful and really set up for success. So that's very much our focus right now. 
To the question of are there other 2-sided marketplaces out there? Maybe. As I said, it's lightning in a bottle. It's not every day you come across a truly authentic organic 2-sided marketplace that really has mojo in a place that's additive to Etsy, where Etsy is really positioned to help, where we can acquire it at a fair price and where we have the bandwidth available to do it. So we've got a high bar, and I would say we're going to be patient and picky. And right now, we're very much focused on the core Etsy Marketplace and integrating Depop and Elo7."

We see huge opportunity for them but they are relatively minor impact to our total guide, and at Etsy, we try to think about focus, and we're very focused on continuing to grow the Etsy Marketplace. 
What we've disclosed for Depop, and when we announced the acquisition was that Depop did about $650 million of GMS in 2020 and about $70 million in revenue, and it was growing about 100% at the -- in 2020. You would expect that Depop is experiencing the same sort of macro headwinds from the economy reopening that all of e-commerce is experiencing. So we -- while we're not giving a specific guide for Depop now, you can consider that, that's factored into our guidance. 
Elo7 is much smaller. Also, they had -- they did not have a tailwind from the pandemic in 2020 like Depop and Etsy did a lot because there they've had significant impact from COVID in that region and also their business is much more concentrated in the event space that has been more hampered by shutdowns. We did, however, say in our guidance the addition of those 2 new businesses to our former consolidated numbers, so former consolidated, meaning Etsy plus Reverb, creates about a 300 basis point contraction to the bottom line. These are very new businesses. We've owned them for 2 weeks. Reverb is a perfect example of how we've been able to grow and optimize that business.

But even in the United States, there are still a lot of people who don't shop online, don't regularly shop online or haven't really heard of Etsy.

That will show up in a few months. We might do featured marketing around our Star Sellers. It might influence your prominence in search. We're going to experiment with a lot of things. But at minimum, it will be a badge on your shop to highlight to buyers that you're one of the very best sellers. 
I think one of the most important things it does, though, is it provides agency to sellers. It tells them very transparently, here are the customer service metrics that buyers care about the most and here is what good looks like. And that sets a bar, an aspiration for our sellers of where they want to go and where we want them to go. And one of the things we hear from sellers over and over again is, what can I do to be more prominent? And if you look online, what -- the tips and tricks they hear from a lot of others is like keyword stuffing, like put more keywords in your title. That doesn't necessarily make the buyer experience better, right? Do you ship on time? Do you answer buyer convos in a really timely fashion? Do you get 5-star reviews on your products? Those are things that buyers really care about, and we want to focus sellers on those things. 
And so the Star Seller program is a great example. And by the way, it's not the only way we can do this, but it is a powerful example of how we can really tell sellers exactly what they can do to be more prominent and give them agency in their own success in a way that creates a race to the top and lifts all boats. And I'm really excited about this track of work in the coming years."

And that we have these really, really big numbers to comp. We said that non-mask sales in Q3 last year grew 119%. And we roughly added $2 billion of GMS on a 2-year basis. So these are really big numbers to comp. And so it's a mathematical gymnastics that we're doing but with lots of underlying growth opportunities in the core business."

Second tier are things that we can operate as services across all of our brands. So Payments might be an example of that and we'll certainly explore that. There might be other things like member support and trust and safety. There might be other services like our ad network. And then there's things that we think need to be operated directly and with the innovation and creativity of those management teams like product and engineering.

Last year, Etsy dramatically outperformed e-commerce industry benchmarks. Now in 2021, we're lapping that performance with flying colors reinforcing the significant market share gains we've made. These great Q3 results further reflect that we're moving the needle on frequency, and that many of the millions of buyers who found or refound Etsy during the pandemic are sticking with us and performing even better than historical cohorts.
Our consolidated GMS was $3.1 billion, up 17% on a year-over-year currency neutral basis. With the core Etsy marketplace being the main driver of GMS growth for the consolidated business, and responsible for the outperformance compared to our guidance. Excluding masks, GMS for the Etsy stand-alone marketplace grew 24% year-over-year and 138% on a 2-year basis.
This continued strength in our core on a 2-year basis is one of the main takeaways that we want to highlight today. Revenue grew 18%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 33%, with the sustained momentum in etsy.com's top line growth, contributing material flow-through to the bottom line. Etsy has truly risen to the moment due in large part to the focused investments we've made over the past 4 years to execute our long-term strategy.
As you know, this strategy hinges on building a sustainable competitive advantage around 4 elements that we believe differentiate us from our competition, what we call our right to win. In Q3, we again see significant evidence that the strategy is working, and we believe we're still just getting started.
We're investing aggressively to strengthen each element of this strategy, all to continue elevating the customer experience. And we've driven significant gains in visits, purchase frequency and average order value. In fact, GMS per active buyer for our Etsy.com marketplace was up 20% in the quarter, sustaining momentum over the past year.
We've been speaking to you for a while about our focus on frequency or better said, how we're working to position Etsy as a starting place for commerce. We believe that there are several factors that contribute to habit-forming behavior in e-commerce and to move the needle on frequency.
First, inspiration, having a fun and engaging experience that keeps you coming back for more. Second, efficiency, helping the buyer to quickly and easily get in, buy and get out when they already know what they want. And third, reliability, ensuring a stress-free and dependable purchase. We've invested in frequency-driving initiatives in each of these 3 areas, and these investments are made even more impactful by our increased traffic and much larger scale.
We now have more squads and more product teams focused on frequency than ever before. We know that changing habits takes time, and it's early days for this work, but we're seeing very encouraging signs of progress.
Here are a few examples of our frequency initiatives. We're investing in multiple areas focused on driving buyer inspiration, engaging buyers early in their life cycle and bringing them back to Etsy. For example, our new personalized onboarding, which you can see in the image on the left, allows the buyer to engage with Etsy to discover new trends and styles while giving us insights into their tastes and preferences. This new customer journey has driven increases in repeat visits and purchase frequency.
We've also had great success with our updates tab, which prompts buyer actions such as favoriting and in turn, helps us to improve the relevancy of their Etsy news feed. And we're leveraging machine learning to personalize the updates feed for each user. These initiatives collectively have enabled us to have a deeper understanding of our buyers, which we then use to segment and target them with relevant content on and off of Etsy.
Many of our visits are from buyers who are on a discovery journey, and there's so much more we can do to make this experience more fun and extend inspiring. In the past, Etsy recommendations have often felt like a rearview mirror, based on things you recently bought or searched for. Today, we're investing aggressively in machine learning tools attempting to understand your tastes and preferences in order to anticipate and inspire your next purchase. We want to make Etsy feel truly made for you.
For those buyers on a specific shopping mission, we're focused on driving efficiency, a fast and easy shopping experience. During the third quarter, we launched real-time personalization, which leverages in-session data about a buyer's tastes and preferences to help them define what they're looking for more quickly and easily, with the goal of ultimately making shopping on Etsy feel like having a personal shopper.
For example, shown on Slide 6, a user first searches for leather accessories. And later in the session, enters a search for wallets. We now incorporate the prior in-session search and prioritize results for leather wallets, knowing of the buyer's previously stated preference for leather. This can be especially relevant and time saving when you're shopping for multiple items that have something in common, a shared theme, style or preference.
Turning to Slide 7. We entered 2021 with a strong focus on making Etsy a more reliable place to shop. While our competitors invest capital building out logistics systems designed to ship one to many, we believe that our massive peer-to-peer fulfillment ecosystem is a core part of building Etsy's sustainable competitive advantage. We'll likely never promise to deliver every item on Etsy in 2 days or less. It's not what we're about. But we do think it's very important that we set clear expectations for when an item will arrive and reliably live up to those expectations. And we're doing a far better job of that.
For example, we talked about estimated delivery dates on our last call, and we continue to make progress. Looking at the left side of the slide, you can see that as recently as January of this year, we couldn't tell our buyers when an item would arrive on nearly 25% of U.S. listings. And now in time for the holiday season, nearly 100% of U.S. listings show an estimated delivery date.
This year, we've also markedly improved the accuracy of estimated delivery dates we provide to buyers while promising sellers to ship on time, cutting in half the number of shipments that arrive past their estimated delivery date is shown on the right.
In addition to our fulfillment goals, our Star Seller program launched in July looks to motivate sellers to deliver exceptional customer service, thereby creating a race to the top, which elevates the shopping experience and enhances reliability for buyers. In just 90 days, we've already seen the appeal of earning a Star Seller badge alter seller behavior, delivering meaningful improvements to several key customer service metrics critical to buyers.
For example, the percentage of buyer messages that got a response within 24 hours increased by 600 basis points in the 2 months post launch of our Star Seller initiative. And there's real tangible value for our Star Sellers. The September month-over-month repeat purchase rate, or RPR, for Star Sellers was 25% higher than the RPR for non-Star Sellers. We also recently launched a preview version of our new Sell on Etsy app, an area we haven't invested in for a while, and it's trending positively in seller engagement.
We mentioned our Buy on Etsy app on the last earnings call, and it's great to see this work continuing to pay dividends. We're driving buyers to the app at a higher rate than ever before. We believe there's no better place to experience our improved customer journeys than the app, which is why we've been aggressively promoting it to buyers. We've seen a 36% increase in app downloads year-to-date. -- and its surpassed mobile web GMS share now making the app the most used mobile channel for purchases on Etsy.
Once buyers transition to the app, their engagement and frequency are higher relative to our other platforms. Ultimately, as app usage increases, we can begin to inspire cross-category browsing earlier in the buyer journey, which has historically led to increased frequency and retention.
Moving on from frequency. As you know, we often talk about our impact initiatives being part and parcel of our business strategy. One I'd like to mention this quarter is tied to our efforts to lower our carbon footprint. In September, we launched an exciting sustainable packaging initiative. Etsy now offers planet-friendly packaging made from responsibly sourced and 100% recycled materials to enable U.S. sellers, the majority of whom believe it's important to run an environmentally friendly business, to join us on reducing the environmental impact from e-commerce. This initiative is not just about helping us to achieve our goal to be net zero by 2030. We know that consumers care about the impact of their purchases. In fact, 90% of Etsy's U.S. buyers have told us that they care about sustainability.
We have a lot of conviction that an initiative like this can drive business growth. So we'll be highlighting it in the buyer experience with a focus on driving conversion and loyalty at Etsy. We're still in the early days of our journey to help customers understand the positive impact they can make when they shop on Etsy.
Turning to our marketing initiatives, we've invested in creative new approaches to broaden the global reach of Etsy's brand. One great example of our team's innovation is the exciting launch of the Etsy House, our first-ever interactive, augmented reality experience that allows buyers to shop a digital home filled with curated Etsy items. We see this as a beautiful, powerful way to showcase the breadth and depth of high-quality items on Etsy. It's one more example of how we're evolving the perception of our brand so that buyers think of us not just for the cushion but also for the couch.
And while I don't have time to mention them all, other examples of novel approaches we're taking to attract new audiences and drive top-of-mind awareness, frequency and loyalty include testing bus and train ads in London as the city comes back to life; mail-focused brand campaigns in the U.S., think placements on ESPN and the History Channel, not just Hallmark and HGTV; and marketing partnerships with leading consumer brands.
We've kicked off an exciting holiday season on Etsy. With our product development initiatives, improved user experience and multichannel full funnel marketing campaigns, we believe we'll once again make Etsy a meaningfully better place to shop for the holidays. We've been encouraging buyers to start shopping earlier than last year, and are leaning into gift guides and personalized shopping missions, and we're creating localized experiences in our key geographies outside the U.S.
One initiative we're really excited about is our new gift finder feature. It's a fun and interactive way for us to help you find surprising and delightful gifts tailored exactly to the interests and tastes of the recipient. A uniquely Etsy way to help you get to the good stuff from among our almost 100 million items.
We'll continue to reinforce what is different and special about Etsy during the holiday season through many channels, including TV and digital video with our new give more than a gift campaign. Here's a 30-second spot that just started running in the U.S. this week, and you'll also see us on air in the U.K. and Germany this holiday season.

We've identified meaningful areas where we can share knowledge and expertise as we work to accelerate growth in Depop and Elo7. In fact, these initiatives will sound very familiar to our playbook for etsy.com and Reverb. Maria and Calico, the CEOs of Depop and Elo7, and their teams are concentrating on conversion rate optimization to increase the value of a visit. For example, things like signals and nudges and search relevancy.
Another key focus area for Depop is laying the foundation to invest profitably in performance marketing with improved LTV and attribution models and better Martech. And a top priority for Elo7 is to lower shipping costs through expanded carrier relationships. The Reverb team continues to invest in platform engagement, optimizing conversion rate, improving the user experience, advertising and driving international growth. I've always said that the important thing is to keep the main thing the main thing. And for our subsidiaries, the main things are the same things as for Etsy.
In conclusion, it's gratifying to see how shoppers have loved the experience they've had with Etsy and are coming back for more, even in a world of greatly expanded choice. Etsy is getting better as it gets bigger. As fast as e-commerce has grown over the past 18 months, we have grown substantially faster, indicating that we're gaining share. And we're expanding our TAM with depth across many categories and geographies. We're moving in a different direction than commoditized marketplaces and have more conviction than ever to invest with discipline in what we see is a multitrillion dollar market opportunity and to strengthen our positioning for further growth in 2022 and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to Rachel I wanted to welcome our 2 recently announced Board members, Andy Ballard and Marla Blow who bring great expertise to Etsy. I couldn't be more excited to have them joining our Board. I also want to take a moment to thank our incredible global team for their efforts to make the year-to-date outstanding. We've accomplished so much, and it's particularly heartening given the continued uncertainty in all of our lives. And with that, here's Rachel."
28492682,1685063007,2423794,"Etsy, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Etsy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Josh, and thank you to everyone for joining us on our call.

My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and Etsy marketplace stand-alone results where appropriate. As a reminder, Reverb, Depop and Elo7 are all reflected in our consolidated financial results and KPIs for the third quarter.
Against the backdrop of continuing volatility and uncertainty, Etsy's GMS outperformed our expectations in the third quarter, and we've seen notable stability with significantly less impact from reopening dynamics than we had been anticipating. As we often say, we love our marketplace model for its capital-light structure, with no logistics or warehousing, low infrastructure costs, the distributed nature of our sellers, the diversity of their products, which offer significant reach and depth to satisfy increasing global demand. This model is proving to be resilient in today's economy as constraints on the global supply of goods increase and create supply chain bottlenecks and cost escalation and fulfillment.
Etsy has unique positioning with over 5 million Etsy marketplace sellers distributed around the world, most businesses have 1 and working from their homes. Further, over 90% of U.S. Etsy marketplace sellers tell us that they source the materials locally and have limited overhead. As a result, we believe Etsy sellers stand ready to serve the world in ways many others can't.
So how did this drive our results in the quarter? On a consolidated basis, Etsy's third quarter GMS grew 18% year-over-year to $3.1 billion. Revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $532 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $174 million with a margin of about 33%. Excluding the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7, but inclusive of Reverb per our guidance, take rate was 17.5% and adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 36%. The primary driver for the significant beat in adjusted EBITDA margin was sustained momentum in the Etsy marketplace's top line growth, contributing significant flow-through to profitability. The majority of Etsy's GMS is derived organically this quarter, representing 83% of total GMS.
We plan to provide you with GMS and select KPIs for our subsidiary businesses on an annual basis, so you'll be able to track the success of our House of Brands portfolio companies over time, but we do not plan to provide quarterly details. The Etsy marketplace remains the vast majority of our business. Reverb, Depop and Elo7 collectively represented approximately 12% of Q3 consolidated GMS as Elo7 closed on July 2 and Depop closed on July 12. Integration is going well, and our teams are collaboratively developing product and operating plans to drive future growth and profitability improvements.
Our 2 new subsidiaries are experiencing slightly different market conditions at present. Depop is facing reopening headwinds similar to other e-commerce players, particularly as it compares to its enormous 2020 growth. And Elo7 has begun to see improved conditions in the Brazilian market towards the tail end of the quarter as more of the population became vaccinated. Last but not least, Reverb continues to outperform the musical instruments industry on a 2-year basis.
My next 2 slides will focus on the performance of the Etsy marketplace. During the third quarter of 2021, GMS grew 12% year-over-year, 24% year-over-year, excluding face masks, and the take rate was 18%. GMS was underpinned by continued strength in our top 6 categories, led by homewares and home furnishings, our largest and fastest-growing category on a trailing 12-month basis; jewelry and accessories; and apparel.
Fall and Halloween themes drove buyer demand in Q3 as there was a notable uptick in seasonal home decor such as ornaments and seasonal accent items. Halloween also drove our apparel category as it is an annual purchase occasion for many of our repeat buyers.
When you look at the monthly performance view for the Etsy marketplace, excluding masks during Q3, shown on the right of this slide, July 2-year GMS growth was 138%. August was also 138%, and September slightly accelerated to 139%. It was more stable than we had anticipated when we set guidance in early August. At that time, it was reasonable to expect that reopening trends would have had a more material impact to online shopping behavior and Etsy's performance in the third quarter. While we don't yet have full Q3 data for e-commerce growth, on the left side of this slide, we've mapped our 2-year performance to an e-commerce benchmark, highlighting continued share gains.
We've also continued to track the impact of face masks on our business and provide transparency around that. While face masks did gain some momentum in certain regions at specific times during the quarter due to changing COVID-19 guidelines, overall, they represented less than 2% of Etsy marketplace GMS in the quarter.
In Q3, non-mask GMS was up 138% on a 2-year basis, relatively stable compared to prior quarters. This growth was underpinned by significant growth in the U.K. despite all mobility restrictions being lifted in -- early in the quarter. This is quite encouraging, and we believe our brand is becoming more prominent and Etsy is gaining share in our largest core geography outside of the U.S.
 Consolidated Q3 revenue was again driven by growth in both marketplace and services revenue with Etsy Ads, GMS volume and the incremental benefit of Depop and Elo7 being the primary drivers. The average take rate for our subsidiary businesses is lower than the Etsy marketplaces and was approximately 10% in Q3, with marketplace fees representing the majority of the revenue.
Transaction fee revenue, inclusive of offsite ads grew 18% year-over-year, driven by higher GMS from frequency and average order value. In Q3, our off-site ads revenue offset nearly 40% of Etsy marketplace performance marketing spend, but contracted slightly compared to last year, as we ran incrementality tests and pulled back performance marketing on several chargeable channels. The reduced marketing spend from our incrementality test also contributed to a reduction in clicks on Etsy Ads, driving a modest contraction in take rate. However, Etsy Ads revenue was up 28% as ad relevance continues to drive improvements in click-through rate.
Our disciplined investments in product and marketing continue to deliver strong returns and serve as a foundation for future growth with many initiatives focused on conversion rate and frequency. Q3 consolidated marketing spend was $132 million, up 4% year-over-year and contracted as a percentage of revenue 700 basis points sequentially. The Q3 spend reflects the pullback in performance marketing for our incrementality testing.
After running successful television campaigns in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, we paused some campaigns for 2 to 3 weeks to measure the interaction effects between marketing channels and incrementality of our brand spend. In the fourth quarter, we're leveraging these learnings and applying them to our placements for the new holiday creative.
We are also investing in other marketing programs in the fourth quarter like expanding our Etsy coupons tool to proactively target new buyers. We'll continue to leverage our CRM capabilities to segment and target specific buyers on and off the Etsy platform.
Q3 consolidated product development spend was $74 million, up 60% year-over-year, reflecting our success in expanding our team to invest in critical areas that we believe will increase GMS. As of the end of Q3, consolidated headcount was slightly over 2,300, up 70% year-over-year, with much of this increase sitting in product development. Note that the large increase in consolidated head count includes nearly 600 employees at Depop and Elo7 even. The competition for talent is fierce, but we have been pleased with our ability to attract, retain and engage our employees in what has clearly become a very tight labor market.
Similar to our marketing investments, we apply an ROI lens to product and engineering development spend. As shown on Slide 23, we've significantly grown our product and engineering head count, and feel confident that we can generate a strong ROI even as we scale our spend. I'll also note that we continue to make strategic investments that don't directly generate incremental GMS, but that are necessary to effectively run and scale the business. These investment areas include development, infrastructure and support, cloud costs, trust and safety and financing compliance.
We've seen very encouraging performance in all of our Etsy marketplace buyer segments, particularly on a 2-year basis as we comp prior year pandemic-driven peaks. In Q3, active buyers grew 30% year-over-year to 89 million, stable with Q2 2021. Repeat buyers, those who made purchases on 2 or more days in a 12-month period, grew 35% year-over-year to 36 million. And habitual buyers, our most loyal buyers, remained our fastest-growing buyer segment, up 65% for the quarter to nearly 8 million and up 237% on a 2-year basis. These 3 metrics reflect stability in our buyer base over the past few quarters, a signal we've all been looking for to gauge the retention of our 2020 cohort.
We're also pleased to see healthy trends and stability within our new buyer cohorts on the Etsy marketplace. We acquired 7 million new buyers in Q3, very strong performance considering how many millions of new buyers we have attracted in the past year and still well ahead of our pre-pandemic quarterly new buyer acquisition rate. We're seeing particular strength internationally as Etsy new buyer growth outside the U.S. expanded as a percentage of total new buyer growth driven by investment in performance marketing in several new markets.
In fact, new buyers outside of the U.S. have expanded 600 basis points year-over-year as a percentage of total new buyers. Even more noteworthy, new buyer repeat purchase rate was up 25% in 2021 compared to 2019, further evidence of our success driving frequency.
When measuring the performance of the 2020 active buyer cohort, early data suggests they are all outperforming our historical cohorts as shown on Slide 26. In fact, of our 69 million active buyers in Q3 2020, 56% made another purchase over the next 12 months. This compares to 43% for our historical cohorts, a clear improvement. And as we've talked about in recent quarters, we've also had great success reactivating buyers. For instance, in Q3, we reengaged 4 million buyers who haven't made a purchase in over a year. With our investments in product and marketing, we are more able to reactivate a growing buyer base. We're very encouraged to see that when compared to the historical retention of active buyers over time, this newer cohort is significantly outperforming.
GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis expanded to $132, up 20% year-over-year, driven by frequency and AOV. Among our repeat buyers, we continue to see growth in the average number of purchase days per year from 4.6 purchases in 2019 to 5.2 purchases in 2021. Including all buyer segments, buyers now buy an average of 3.1x per year, which is up nearly 25% since 2019.
Now moving to the balance sheet. As of 9/30, we had approximately $907 million in cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments. in addition to a $200 million revolver that is currently undrawn. Note that the acquisitions of both Depop and Elo7 closed in July and are reflected on the quarter ending balance sheet. Also in the quarter, we had several uses of cash that did not impact adjusted EBITDA. These include approximately $32 million of transaction expenses related to our acquisitions of Depop and Elo7, a portion of which were accrued in the prior quarter as well as a cash tax payment of approximately $60 million.
In addition, we repurchased $54 million in shares during the quarter under our Board authorized repurchase plan. Our model remains highly cash generative asset light, and we generally convert the majority of adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow.
And now turning to our outlook. We currently estimate that our Q4 consolidated GMS, which will now include Etsy, Reverb and a full quarter for Depop and Elo7, will be $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion, up about 12% at the midpoint compared to Q4 of last year. We expect that our Q4 revenue will be $660 million to $690 million, up about 10% at the midpoint versus Q4 of last year. And our adjusted EBITDA margin will be about 26%. Within our Q4 GMS guidance, we are forecasting very solid growth for the Etsy marketplace of high single-digit GMS growth, implying relatively stable 2-year growth when compared to Q3. We think this is excellent given our year ago performance.
Drilling in a bit more on our guidance, the holiday season has kicked off early on the Etsy marketplace, and we have had a strong October. We note that during the month of October, keywords that have holiday terms in them have increased nearly 100% year-over-year. Buyers are anticipating longer shipping times driven by constraints in the supply chain. We recognized several important tailwinds, including external forecasts for strong holiday spending, consumer behavior that continues to rely on e-commerce, now becoming a habit not a substitute, and Etsy's distributed supply chain that may be less impacted than others in this environment.
On the flip side, we are also keeping an eye on several potential headwinds, including those associated with inflation, retail reopenings, potential carrier constraints and consumer confidence. It's important to keep in mind that Etsy's November and December year-over-year comps are challenging, so we factored this into our guidance as well.
Within the context of our guidance, here are a few additional items to keep in mind. Note that 4% of Etsy's marketplace GMS, or $133 million was from face masks in Q4 2020 and we expect facemask to be relatively inconsequential in Q4 2021. Also keep in mind that Depop and Elo7, while accretive to our top line, will be with us for a full quarter, meaning they will be dilutive to adjusted EBITDA margin similar to the impact they had in Q3 as we invest in their future growth. The majority of the contraction in take rate is driven by our subsidiary marketplace as having a lower average take rate than Etsy stand-alone. Also, we expect an increase in amortization based on the allocation of purchase price for both Depop and Elo7. Refer to our 10-Q, which will be filed shortly for more details.
You'll see us stepping back up our marketing spend in the fourth quarter, and hiring will continue to be at an elevated pace. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2020, U.S. stimulus checks were a significant boost to consumer spending that is not expected to repeat this year. Stimulus checks also remained an important factor in our elevated growth in Q1 2021 and a bit in the early part of Q2. So please keep those high growth levels in mind as you model 2022.

I think you won the most popular question of the earnings call award. So we feel great about our Q4 guide. And let me start with, as Rachel said, we're off to a strong start in October, and we feel great about that. Let's remember what we're comping. Last year, we had a really solid October, followed by a blow-the-doors-out November and December. And if we go back and remember why it was a tragic reason why. COVID cases were spiking dramatically. There were lockdown orders going in place in many parts of the country. Hospitals were overflowing. And as a result, people were largely trapped at home and had very few places for where to shop.
And so many people turn to Etsy, often for the first time, with a lack of a lot of other options. And so November and December last year were remarkable. And as a result, we delivered a fourth quarter at Etsy of 111%. That's what we're lapping 111%, vastly outstripping most of e-commerce.
We're off to a strong start in October. We feel great about that. The comps get a lot harder in November and in December. What we found is that looking at our growth rate relative to 2019 is the most helpful way to look at our growth rate because 2020 was so volatile with so many external factors.
And so if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, what we forecasted is that Q4 is absolutely stable to Q3, and we think that's great news. In a world where there's so much more choice where people are moving about largely freely, where hopefully, COVID cases continue to decline and people are moving about and shopping wherever they want, they continue to choose to come back to Etsy again and again. And in fact, we're growing meaningfully over those remarkable comps from last year. So we feel really good about the fourth quarter.
Could it come in stronger even than what we've guided to? Absolutely. It could turn out that people are spending more, that they're turning to Etsy more and more, that the trends we saw in October could continue in November and December.
Could it turn out that October was a pull forward of the holiday? And a lot of people are spending much earlier in the holiday in November and December will turn out to be weaker months for e-commerce generally? Yes, that's possible. We live in a world of unknown. So we're giving you the best guidance we have with the information that we have. And our main focus is to make sure that our customers, our buyers and our sellers have a really good experience this quarter. So that's what's under our control and that's what we're focused on. And again, I'm so delighted that so many people had such a great experience on Etsy back when they had relatively few choices that now that they have a ton of choices, they are choosing to come back to Etsy even more often, and I think that's incredibly encouraging."

Performance market has continued to be very effective for us. I know that there's a lot of discussion about CPCs going up a lot over the marketplace and other people's margins being under pressure with that. Etsy is so long tail that we have felt a lot less of that than others. So we continue to see very strong returns from performance marketing.
In terms of IDFA, I would describe that as a future opportunity cost to Etsy more than a present headwind. So really where IDFA is challenging is at least for us, and I think for many others, for paid app marketing efforts. It's hard to tell when you spend money to market your app how effective that performance marketing is. And truthfully, we've not been paying to market our app. So it's not a present headwind.
Now maybe we should be paying to market our app. And maybe that's something that would help us to grow even faster. We've talked about our earned efforts to market our app. Meaning through our own channels, through our free channels, we've been seeing great success marketing our app. So IDFA might be a headwind to the opportunity for us to be investing even more to market our app, but it hasn't been a material headwind to our present performance."

So we did say GMS per active buyer was up 20% in Q3, even though some of our buyer segments actually decelerated in the quarter. So it was a really strong quarter for GMS per active buyer. One of the factors that drives GMS is frequency. So more and more buyers buying more frequently, which is so heartening. So many of our cohorts -- so much more choice and share of wallet.
Reminder that the average number of purchase days for all of our buyers increased from 3.1 -- is down 3.1, and that is up from 2.5 a year ago. And then for repeat buyers, it went up to 5.2, another solid increase, up from 4.6 a year ago. So we're seeing improvement in frequency across the board, it's still low. So 3.1 is still far lower than we hope it can be. Your question was, could it be once per month, and we see no reason think that it couldn't be.
Another important factor is the habitual buyers was again our fastest-growing segment, and it grew 237% on a 2-year basis, and it represents about 40% of our GMS. So it's really a strong sort of testimony to that the most important segment is growing the fastest."

And most of those places are playing the same playbook, right? They're going to try to sell you commoditized products that are cheaper to buy and arrive faster.
And the more people consolidate their purchases there, the more they're going to crave an alternative. And if Etsy is the leading alternative to commoditized commerce, and I think we're better positioned than others, I personally believe we're as well positioned as any to be the leading alternative to that commoditized habit you go to all the time.
I think that's a huge opportunity. And when you look at GMS per active buyer at only $130 per year, it doesn't take much to believe that, that can go up substantially."

It is a little lighter on take rate, traditionally, seasonally for Etsy in the fourth quarter, simply because we get so much more GMS than we get on transaction fees than we get on things like Etsy Ads, which is not necessarily moving up seasonally.
Our other subs are also -- skew a little bit higher in the fourth quarter, but not as demonstrability as Etsy does. So Depop, Elo7 and Reverb all have slightly higher fourth quarters than they do the rest of the year. And -- but not as pronounced as you would see in Etsy.

The take rate being a little softer typically on Etsy in the fourth quarter is what I would classify as a high-class problem.

It's simply that, that GMS grows even faster than us, which is another way of saying conversion rate is strong in the fourth quarter, which means buyers are finding what they like, which is a good news story."

So they're very much focused on increasing conversion rate through a better customer experience. And there's a lot of opportunities that Etsy has to help them.

And things that streamline the path to purchase, so people can go from view to purchase even faster and more easily. And by improving the conversion rate, we improve the value of the visit. And that allows us to market more effectively, get a higher ROI.
The other area that we're very focused on is helping them with performance marketing and marketing attribution so that we can lean more into performance marketing in a way that drives growth and drives value in an ROI-positive way.
Specifically looking at Elo7. They're very focused right now on shipping and how do they lower the shipping costs through increased relationships with carriers in Brazil which we think is a meaningful opportunity. And also, as Brazil hopefully emerges from the pandemic as vaccination rates are growing there, people get back to events.

We had historically thought the app was the best place for experienced buyers to go. So you start on the mobile web or on the desktop. And after you've made a couple of purchases, you migrate to the app. That works and definitely more experienced buyers are having a really good experience on Etsy. And we see that once they download the app, their engagement goes up in almost every metric.
What's been an interesting finding over the past couple of quarters is even newer buyers seem ready to download the app and benefit by downloading the app. So you're seeing us lean into marketing the app even for people who maybe haven't bought before or first-time buyers. And what we're finding is, for those communities as well, when they download the app, we are seeing more engagement from them. And it does make sense that with the app, we have more opportunities to provide triggers for them to use the app through things like badging on the app to say there's 3 or 4 updates waiting for you and then driving them to an updates tab, which tells them, here's what's happened since you left. And then just a more dynamic and rich experience as is possible in an app and not in mobile web.
To give you some sense of proportionality it was just this quarter that the app became the largest platform as measured by GMS, overtaking mobile web and overtaking desktop. Mobile web is still the largest platform by visits. So there's meaningful opportunity still for the app to grow, and it's something that we think we're only just beginning to really lean into and tap to its full potential."

I think consumer confidence has held up better than many of us feared. Consumer spending has held up better than many of us feared, and that's certainly reflected in Etsy's Q3 results where you saw us come in over the top of guidance based almost entirely on the strength of the core Etsy business and the organic Etsy business.
So as you know, we pulled back on performance marketing to test incrementality. And even in light of that, the organic strength of the Etsy brand in this market is holding up really, really well. So we're incredibly pleased by that.
I would say we think it was reasonable to assume that as the world reopened and people had so much more choice, they would avail themselves of that choice and Etsy would face headwinds, and we would see some deceleration. And we expected that, and we think that's reasonable.
It's been delightful to see that certainly relative to 2019, that hasn't been, in fact, the case in that we've seen a lot of stability and in fact, GMS per active buyer growing. So we think that's great. As I move around the other subsidiaries, Reverb is growing on a 2-year stack, substantially faster than the musical instrument industry itself, which is great.
They see a little bit more variability as musical instrument stores open and close and open again. They see a little bit more variability. But as we said, with the Etsy marketplace with Reverb, we also find measuring them on a 2-year stack or measuring them relative to 2019 is the easiest way to forecast that business and we continue to see it grow substantially faster than the musical instrument industry as a whole. So we think that's great.
Elo7 in Brazil has faced headwinds because a substantial part of that business is based on events. People buying things for birthday parties or baby showers or quinceaneras or things like that. And obviously, with the pandemic and lockdowns, there have been far fewer events. We did see towards the end of the third quarter, vaccinations have been accelerating fairly rapidly in Brazil. And towards the end of the third quarter, we did see it the beginnings of an uptick in Elo7 as vaccination rate spread, and we think that that's really encouraging.
At Depop, we also feel very good about their 2-year growth rate. And as we have talked about, they had an exceptional 2020 where they grew at over 100% and far faster than all of the publicly traded e-commerce peers. As we expected, they did decline in the third quarter, and that was as expected, and it's because their population is disproportionately teenagers, it's Gen Z. And also, they're heavily weighted towards the U.K. where teenagers were pretty much locked at home for a substantial part of 2020. And the stay-at-home orders really began to ease in the third quarter.
And so it's not surprising that teenagers, after being locked at home for a year, want to go out, want to be with their friends, want to go to the mall. And so they're seeing some temporary headwinds from that. We continue to think e-commerce is an amazing space. We continue to think that apparel is the most attractive part of e-commerce, and we continue to think that Depop is the best brand in e-commerce and apparel. And again, we continue to feel great about their 2-year growth rate and the prospects for the medium and long term, and we're really excited to be partnering with all 3 of these brands to help them to unlock even more growth and achieve their full potential."

Tweaks and tunes in various channels to make them more accurate are really helpful. We do that all the time to optimize, but nothing that changes the thesis overall.
So we learned it helps us optimize our model. We might change a threshold here and there based on what we learned. And you can see that by doing that, we actually left profitable growth on the table. So we want to keep -- we have a very dynamic investment model in marketing where we spend up to when the last marginal dollar spend is no longer reaching our ROI threshold. So it's very dynamic. It pulls back automatically depending on where we set the ROI threshold. And so we'll keep investing those learnings to optimize and grow the channels that we think are the most profitability."

And said differently, incrementality testing can sound like what does that really mean? But it just means if we hadn't spent the money, might those people have found us anyway? And are we truly getting additive buyers for the money we're spending. We're constantly asking ourselves that question. I'm sure you're constantly asking it, did you really need to spend that much on marketing? And we're asking that, too, and we're testing that. And we're testing it at the margin, not just the overall thesis. 
Other thing I'll add about the third quarter is we did very little TV advertising. We were dark most of the third quarter on TV. We've just launched a brand-new campaign. We showed you one example of that campaign. And that campaign will be live for most of the fourth quarter. So you'll see us much more aggressively on TV in the fourth quarter. You'll see us lean into performance marketing. We think our brand is super relevant all the time, but especially relevant during the holidays. And we want to make sure that we're really in front of people.
And the performance marketing works really hard for people that are already down the purchase funnel and thinking about buying something. What you're seeing in our TV ads is we also want the chance to tell our story. We want to remind people why we're different. We want to make sure we have an emotional connection with people. We want to make sure that there's organic love for the Etsy brand and people continuing to come directly to our brand and not only finding us downstream.
And I will continue to point out how special we think that is of Etsy, that such a high proportion of our traffic comes direct to us, and we're not downstream independent on other channels, which we think is a real strength. So you should expect us to lean more into marketing in the fourth quarter as we typically do and as reflected in our margin guidance."

Because OSA is a cooperative spend when we spend on PLAs and there's a successful sale for our sellers, we charge an incremental transaction fee. So our pullback on performance marketing means that, that fee also went down a bit. However, we did say that 40% of our performance marketing now is offset by our OSA fees.

And those things are all working together.
Now we didn't pull performance marketing all the way back. So we did still spend significantly in the quarter. And like I said, we -- it's a dynamic. We just -- we can just change the ROI threshold to bring the spend down and it dynamically will reduce. So we're still feeling that we've got very great traffic.

And one of the things we talked about in the recorded part of the call was doing a better job of setting expectations and meeting expectations. When we talk about really becoming a habit. When we talk about taking that $130 of GMS per active buyer and making it something much, much larger, if you know that it's worry free to shop on Etsy. You know when it's going to arrive, it's going to be as expected. I think we can gain a much, much larger share of people's wallet over time. And so it's a really big focus of ours. And so the fact that we have so much more EDD coverage, expected delivery date coverage, and the fact that we're doing an ever better job of really meeting those expectations is, I think, really helpful.
We're never going to promise to deliver things everything on the site within 2 days or everything in the site within 24 hours. And I think when I look at our environment and sustainability, training the world to expect everything to arrive in a day is not good for our environment and largely not necessary. So I think a lot of people are questioning right now with all the supply chain issues, people are thinking, maybe I should shop a little earlier. And maybe I don't need to wait until the very last minute. That's likely helpful for Etsy for this year. But hopefully, I think for the long term, people starting to consider whether they really need to wait until the last minute, I think that would be good for the world and certainly also aligned with Etsy."

I'm super excited about the Star Seller program and what it can -- what it is today and even more importantly, what it can become over time. So I want to start with seller agency. What sellers really want is they want to know what can I do to make my shop more successful. And the more transparent we can be, the better they're going to be doing their job, right? They're busy. They have relatively little time. And so if we can focus their efforts on these are the 2 or 3 things that are going to drive the most improvement for you, that's really helpful for them, and it's something that Etsy is uniquely positioned to be able to do.
And so by giving them a few key customer service metrics to focus on, we're already seeing very meaningful improvements. We talked about, for example, responding to a buyer  convo within 24 hours. We saw a 600 basis point improvement across the entire marketplace on that one metric within 2 months of launching the program. So that's a really good example of how this can really lift all boats.
We do see that by surfacing on promoting the sellers that provide the most reliably good customer service, we're going to have a better buyer experience and a better seller experience. So the fact that sellers that are Star Sellers have a 25% higher repeat purchase rate, I think that's a factor of 2 things. One, the recognition of the Star Seller giving buyers confidence. But two, the fact that these sellers are delivering consistently good customer service and earning repeat business. And the more we can get every seller to look like a Star Seller the better off I think it is for everyone."

Etsy delivered a very strong third quarter. Last year, Etsy dramatically outperformed e-commerce industry benchmarks. Now in 2021, we're lapping that performance with flying colors reinforcing the significant market share gains we've made. These great Q3 results further reflect that we're moving the needle on frequency, and that many of the millions of buyers who found or refound Etsy during the pandemic are sticking with us and performing even better than historical cohorts.
Our consolidated GMS was $3.1 billion, up 17% on a year-over-year currency neutral basis, with the core Etsy marketplace being the main driver of GMS growth for the consolidated business and responsible for the outperformance compared to our guidance. Excluding masks, GMS for the Etsy stand-alone marketplace grew 24% year-over-year and 138% on a 2-year basis. This continued strength in our core on a 2-year basis is one of the main takeaways that we want to highlight today. 
Revenue grew 18%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 33%, with the sustained momentum in etsy.com's top line growth contributing material flow-through to the bottom line. Etsy has truly risen to the moment due in large part to the focused investments we've made over the past 4 years to execute our long-term strategy. As you know, this strategy hinges on building a sustainable competitive advantage around 4 elements that we believe differentiate us from our competition, what we call our right to win. In Q3, we again see significant evidence that the strategy is working, and we believe we're still just getting started.
We're investing aggressively to strengthen each element of this strategy, all to continue elevating the customer experience. And we've driven significant gains in visits, purchase frequency and average order value. In fact, GMS per active buyer for our Etsy.com marketplace was up 20% in the quarter, sustaining momentum over the past year. We've been speaking to you for a while about our focus on frequency or better said, how we're working to position Etsy as a starting place for commerce. We believe that there are several factors that contribute to habit-forming behavior in e-commerce and to move the needle on frequency.
First, inspiration, having a fun and engaging experience that keeps you coming back for more. Second, efficiency, helping the buyer to quickly and easily get in, buy and get out when they already know what they want. And third, reliability, ensuring a stress-free and dependable purchase. We've invested in frequency-driving initiatives in each of these 3 areas, and these investments are made even more impactful by our increased traffic and much larger scale. We now have more squads and more product teams focused on frequency than ever before. We know that changing habits takes time, and it's early days for this work, but we're seeing very encouraging signs of progress.
Here are a few examples of our frequency initiatives. We're investing in multiple areas focused on driving buyer inspiration, engaging buyers early in their life cycle and bringing them back to Etsy. For example, our new personalized onboarding, which you can see in the image on the left, allows the buyer to engage with Etsy to discover new trends and styles while giving us insights into their tastes and preferences. This new customer journey has driven increases in repeat visits and purchase frequency.
We've also had great success with our updates tab, which prompts buyer actions such as favoriting and in turn, helps us to improve the relevancy of their Etsy news feed. And we're leveraging machine learning to personalize the updates feed for each user. These initiatives collectively have enabled us to have a deeper understanding of our buyers, which we then use to segment and target them with relevant content on and off of Etsy.
Many of our visits are from buyers who are on a discovery journey, and there's so much more we can do to make this experience more fun and extend inspiring. In the past, Etsy recommendations have often felt like a rearview mirror, based on things you recently bought or searched for. Today, we're investing aggressively in machine learning tools attempting to understand your tastes and preferences in order to anticipate and inspire your next purchase. We want to make Etsy feel truly made for you.
For those buyers on a specific shopping mission, we're focused on driving efficiency, a fast and easy shopping experience. During the third quarter, we launched real-time personalization, which leverages in-session data about a buyer's tastes and preferences to help them define what they're looking for more quickly and easily, with the goal of ultimately making shopping on Etsy feel like having a personal shopper.
For example, shown on Slide 6, a user first searches for leather accessories. And later in the session, enters a search for wallets. We now incorporate the prior in-session search and prioritize results for leather wallets, knowing of the buyer's previously stated preference for leather. This can be especially relevant and time saving when you're shopping for multiple items that have something in common, a shared theme, style or preference.
Turning to Slide 7. We entered 2021 with a strong focus on making Etsy a more reliable place to shop. While our competitors invest capital building out logistics systems designed to ship one to many, we believe that our massive peer-to-peer fulfillment ecosystem is a core part of building Etsy's sustainable competitive advantage. We'll likely never promise to deliver every item on Etsy in 2 days or less. It's not what we're about. But we do think it's very important that we set clear expectations for when an item will arrive and reliably live up to those expectations. And we're doing a far better job of that.
For example, we talked about estimated delivery dates on our last call, and we continue to make progress. Looking at the left side of the slide, you can see that as recently as January of this year, we couldn't tell our buyers when an item would arrive on nearly 25% of U.S. listings. And now in time for the holiday season, nearly 100% of U.S. listings show an estimated delivery date. This year, we've also markedly improved the accuracy of estimated delivery dates we provide to buyers while promising sellers to ship on time, cutting in half the number of shipments that arrive past their estimated delivery date is shown on the right.
In addition to our fulfillment goals, our Star Seller program launched in July looks to motivate sellers to deliver exceptional customer service, thereby creating a race to the top, which elevates the shopping experience and enhances reliability for buyers. In just 90 days, we've already seen the appeal of earning a Star Seller badge alter seller behavior, delivering meaningful improvements to several key customer service metrics critical to buyers.
For example, the percentage of buyer messages that got a response within 24 hours increased by 600 basis points in the 2 months post launch of our Star Seller initiative. And there's real tangible value for our Star Sellers. The September month-over-month repeat purchase rate, or RPR, for Star Sellers was 25% higher than the RPR for non-Star Sellers. We also recently launched a preview version of our new Sell on Etsy app, an area we haven't invested in for a while, and it's trending positively in seller engagement.
We mentioned our Buy on Etsy app on the last earnings call, and it's great to see this work continuing to pay dividends. We're driving buyers to the app at a higher rate than ever before. We believe there's no better place to experience our improved customer journeys than the app, which is why we've been aggressively promoting it to buyers. We've seen a 36% increase in app downloads year-to-date. And its surpassed mobile web GMS share now making the app the most used mobile channel for purchases on Etsy. Once buyers transition to the app, their engagement and frequency are higher relative to our other platforms. Ultimately, as app usage increases, we can begin to inspire cross-category browsing earlier in the buyer journey, which has historically led to increased frequency and retention.
Moving on from frequency. As you know, we often talk about our impact initiatives being part and parcel of our business strategy. One I'd like to mention this quarter is tied to our efforts to lower our carbon footprint. In September, we launched an exciting sustainable packaging initiative. Etsy now offers planet-friendly packaging made from responsibly sourced and 100% recycled materials to enable U.S. sellers, the majority of whom believe it's important to run an environmentally friendly business, to join us on reducing the environmental impact from e-commerce. 
This initiative is not just about helping us to achieve our goal to be net zero by 2030, we know that consumers care about the impact of their purchases. In fact, 90% of Etsy's U.S. buyers have told us that they care about sustainability. We have a lot of conviction that an initiative like this can drive business growth, so we'll be highlighting it in the buyer experience with a focus on driving conversion and loyalty at Etsy. We're still in the early days of our journey to help customers understand the positive impact they can make when they shop on Etsy.
Turning to our marketing initiatives, we've invested in creative new approaches to broaden the global reach of Etsy's brand. One great example of our team's innovation is the exciting launch of the Etsy House, our first-ever interactive, augmented reality experience that allows buyers to shop a digital home filled with curated Etsy items. We see this as a beautiful, powerful way to showcase the breadth and depth of high-quality items on Etsy. It's one more example of how we're evolving the perception of our brand so that buyers think of us not just for the cushion but also for the couch.
And while I don't have time to mention them all, other examples of novel approaches we're taking to attract new audiences and drive top-of-mind awareness, frequency and loyalty include testing bus and train ads in London as the city comes back to life; mail-focused brand campaigns in the U.S.; and placements on ESPN and the History Channel, not just Hallmark and HGTV; and marketing partnerships with leading consumer brands.
We've kicked off an exciting holiday season on Etsy. With our product development initiatives, improved user experience and multichannel full funnel marketing campaigns, we believe we'll once again make Etsy a meaningfully better place to shop for the holidays. We've been encouraging buyers to start shopping earlier than last year, and are leaning into gift guides and personalized shopping missions, and we're creating localized experiences in our key geographies outside the U.S.
One initiative we're really excited about is our new gift finder feature. It's a fun and interactive way for us to help you find surprising and delightful gifts tailored exactly to the interests and tastes of the recipient, a uniquely Etsy way to help you get to the good stuff from among our almost 100 million items.
We'll continue to reinforce what is different and special about Etsy during the holiday season through many channels, including TV and digital video with our new Give More Than a Gift campaign. Here's a 30-second spot that just started running in the U.S. this week, and you'll also see us on air in the U.K. and Germany this holiday season.

We've identified meaningful areas where we can share knowledge and expertise as we work to accelerate growth in Depop and Elo7. In fact, these initiatives will sound very familiar to our playbook for etsy.com and Reverb. Maria and Calico, the CEOs of Depop and Elo7, and their teams are concentrating on conversion rate optimization to increase the value of a visit. For example, things like signals and nudges and search relevancy.
Another key focus area for Depop is laying the foundation to invest profitably in performance marketing with improved LTV and attribution models and better Martech. And a top priority for Elo7 is to lower shipping costs through expanded carrier relationships. The Reverb team continues to invest in platform engagement, optimizing conversion rate, improving the user experience, advertising and driving international growth. I've always said that the important thing is to keep the main thing the main thing. And for our subsidiaries, the main things are the same things as for Etsy.
In conclusion, it's gratifying to see how shoppers have loved the experience they've had with Etsy and are coming back for more, even in a world of greatly expanded choice. Etsy is getting better as it gets bigger. As fast as e-commerce has grown over the past 18 months, we have grown substantially faster, indicating that we're gaining share. And we're expanding our TAM with depth across many categories and geographies. We're moving in a different direction than commoditized marketplaces and have more conviction than ever to invest with discipline in what we see is a multitrillion dollar market opportunity and to strengthen our positioning for further growth in 2022 and beyond.
Before I turn the call over to Rachel, I wanted to welcome our 2 recently announced Board members, Andy Ballard and Marla Blow who bring great expertise to Etsy. I couldn't be more excited to have them joining our Board. I also want to take a moment to thank our incredible global team for their efforts to make the year-to-date outstanding. We've accomplished so much, and it's particularly heartening given the continued uncertainty in all of our lives.

As a reminder, Reverb, Depop and Elo7 are all reflected in our consolidated financial results and KPIs for the third quarter. Against the backdrop of continuing volatility and uncertainty, Etsy's GMS outperformed our expectations in the third quarter, and we've seen notable stability with significantly less impact from reopening dynamics than we had been anticipating. 
As we often say, we love our marketplace model for its capital-light structure, with no logistics or warehousing, low infrastructure costs, the distributed nature of our sellers, the diversity of their products, which offer significant reach and depth to satisfy increasing global demand. This model is proving to be resilient in today's economy as constraints on the global supply of goods increase and create supply chain bottlenecks and cost escalation and fulfillment.
Etsy has unique positioning with over 5 million Etsy marketplace sellers distributed around the world, most businesses have one and working from their homes. Further, over 90% of U.S. Etsy marketplace sellers tell us that they source the materials locally and have limited overhead. As a result, we believe Etsy sellers stand ready to serve the world in ways many others can't.
So how did this drive our results in the quarter? On a consolidated basis, Etsy's third quarter GMS grew 18% year-over-year to $3.1 billion. Revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $532 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $174 million with a margin of about 33%. Excluding the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7, but inclusive of Reverb per our guidance, take rate was 17.5% and adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 36%. The primary driver for the significant beat in adjusted EBITDA margin was sustained momentum in the Etsy marketplace's top line growth, contributing significant flow-through to profitability. The majority of Etsy's GMS is derived organically this quarter, representing 83% of total GMS.
We plan to provide you with GMS and select KPIs for our subsidiary businesses on an annual basis, so you'll be able to track the success of our House of Brands portfolio companies over time, but we do not plan to provide quarterly details. The Etsy marketplace remains the vast majority of our business. Reverb, Depop and Elo7 collectively represented approximately 12% of Q3 consolidated GMS as Elo7 closed on July 2 and Depop closed on July 12. Integration is going well, and our teams are collaboratively developing product and operating plans to drive future growth and profitability improvements.
Our 2 new subsidiaries are experiencing slightly different market conditions at present. Depop is facing reopening headwinds similar to other e-commerce players, particularly as it compares to its enormous 2020 growth. And Elo7 has begun to see improved conditions in the Brazilian market towards the tail end of the quarter as more of the population became vaccinated. Last but not least, Reverb continues to outperform the musical instruments industry on a 2-year basis.
My next 2 slides will focus on the performance of the Etsy marketplace. During the third quarter of 2021, GMS grew 12% year-over-year, 24% year-over-year, excluding face masks, and the take rate was 18%. GMS was underpinned by continued strength in our top 6 categories, led by homewares and home furnishings, our largest and fastest-growing category on a trailing 12-month basis; jewelry and accessories; and apparel. Fall and Halloween themes drove buyer demand in Q3 as there was a notable uptick in seasonal home decor such as ornaments and seasonal accent items. Halloween also drove our apparel category as it is an annual purchase occasion for many of our repeat buyers.
When you look at the monthly performance view for the Etsy marketplace, excluding masks during Q3, shown on the right of this slide, July 2-year GMS growth was 138%. August was also 138%, and September slightly accelerated to 139%. It was more stable than we had anticipated when we set guidance in early August. At that time, it was reasonable to expect that reopening trends would have had a more material impact to online shopping behavior and Etsy's performance in the third quarter. While we don't yet have full Q3 data for e-commerce growth, on the left side of this slide, we've mapped our 2-year performance to an e-commerce benchmark, highlighting continued share gains.
We've also continued to track the impact of face masks on our business and provide transparency around that. While face masks did gain some momentum in certain regions at specific times during the quarter due to changing COVID-19 guidelines, overall, they represented less than 2% of Etsy marketplace GMS in the quarter.
In Q3, non-mask GMS was up 138% on a 2-year basis, relatively stable compared to prior quarters. This growth was underpinned by significant growth in the U.K. despite all mobility restrictions being lifted in -- early in the quarter. This is quite encouraging, and we believe our brand is becoming more prominent and Etsy is gaining share in our largest core geography outside of the U.S.
Consolidated Q3 revenue was again driven by growth in both marketplace and services revenue with Etsy Ads, GMS volume and the incremental benefit of Depop and Elo7 being the primary drivers. The average take rate for our subsidiary businesses is lower than the Etsy marketplaces and was approximately 10% in Q3, with marketplace fees representing the majority of the revenue.
Transaction fee revenue, inclusive of offsite ads grew 18% year-over-year, driven by higher GMS from frequency and average order value. In Q3, our off-site ads revenue offset nearly 40% of Etsy marketplace performance marketing spend, but contracted slightly compared to last year, as we ran incrementality tests and pulled back performance marketing on several chargeable channels. The reduced marketing spend from our incrementality test also contributed to a reduction in clicks on Etsy Ads, driving a modest contraction in take rate. However, Etsy Ads revenue was up 28% as ad relevance continues to drive improvements in click-through rate.
Our disciplined investments in product and marketing continue to deliver strong returns and serve as a foundation for future growth with many initiatives focused on conversion rate and frequency. Q3 consolidated marketing spend was $132 million, up 4% year-over-year and contracted as a percentage of revenue 700 basis points sequentially. The Q3 spend reflects the pullback in performance marketing for our incrementality testing.
After running successful television campaigns in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, we paused some campaigns for 2 to 3 weeks to measure the interaction effects between marketing channels and incrementality of our brand spend. In the fourth quarter, we're leveraging these learnings and applying them to our placements for the new holiday creative. We are also investing in other marketing programs in the fourth quarter like expanding our Etsy coupons tool to proactively target new buyers. We'll continue to leverage our CRM capabilities to segment and target specific buyers on and off the Etsy platform.
Q3 consolidated product development spend was $74 million, up 60% year-over-year, reflecting our success in expanding our team to invest in critical areas that we believe will increase GMS. As of the end of Q3, consolidated headcount was slightly over 2,300, up 70% year-over-year, with much of this increase sitting in product development. Note that the large increase in consolidated head count includes nearly 600 employees at Depop and Elo7 even. The competition for talent is fierce, but we have been pleased with our ability to attract, retain and engage our employees in what has clearly become a very tight labor market.
Similar to our marketing investments, we apply an ROI lens to product and engineering development spend. As shown on Slide 23, we've significantly grown our product and engineering head count, and feel confident that we can generate a strong ROI even as we scale our spend. I'll also note that we continue to make strategic investments that don't directly generate incremental GMS, but that are necessary to effectively run and scale the business. These investment areas include development, infrastructure and support, cloud costs, trust and safety and financing compliance.
We've seen very encouraging performance in all of our Etsy marketplace buyer segments, particularly on a 2-year basis as we comp prior year pandemic-driven peaks. In Q3, active buyers grew 30% year-over-year to 89 million, stable with Q2 2021. Repeat buyers, those who made purchases on 2 or more days in a 12-month period, grew 35% year-over-year to 36 million. And habitual buyers, our most loyal buyers, remained our fastest-growing buyer segment, up 65% for the quarter to nearly 8 million and up 237% on a 2-year basis. These 3 metrics reflect stability in our buyer base over the past few quarters, a signal we've all been looking for to gauge the retention of our 2020 cohort.
We're also pleased to see healthy trends and stability within our new buyer cohorts on the Etsy marketplace. We acquired 7 million new buyers in Q3, very strong performance considering how many millions of new buyers we have attracted in the past year and still well ahead of our pre-pandemic quarterly new buyer acquisition rate. We're seeing particular strength internationally as Etsy new buyer growth outside the U.S. expanded as a percentage of total new buyer growth driven by investment in performance marketing in several new markets.
In fact, new buyers outside of the U.S. have expanded 600 basis points year-over-year as a percentage of total new buyers. Even more noteworthy, new buyer repeat purchase rate was up 25% in 2021 compared to 2019, further evidence of our success driving frequency.
When measuring the performance of the 2020 active buyer cohort, early data suggests they are all outperforming our historical cohorts as shown on Slide 26. In fact, of our 69 million active buyers in Q3 2020, 56% made another purchase over the next 12 months. This compares to 43% for our historical cohorts, a clear improvement. And as we've talked about in recent quarters, we've also had great success reactivating buyers. For instance, in Q3, we reengaged 4 million buyers who haven't made a purchase in over a year. With our investments in product and marketing, we are more able to reactivate a growing buyer base. We're very encouraged to see that when compared to the historical retention of active buyers over time, this newer cohort is significantly outperforming.
GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis expanded to $132, up 20% year-over-year, driven by frequency and AOV. Among our repeat buyers, we continue to see growth in the average number of purchase days per year from 4.6 purchases in 2019 to 5.2 purchases in 2021. Including all buyer segments, buyers now buy an average of 3.1x per year, which is up nearly 25% since 2019.
Now moving to the balance sheet. As of 9/30, we had approximately $907 million in cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments. in addition to a $200 million revolver that is currently undrawn. Note that the acquisitions of both Depop and Elo7 closed in July and are reflected on the quarter ending balance sheet. 
Also in the quarter, we had several uses of cash that did not impact adjusted EBITDA. These include approximately $32 million of transaction expenses related to our acquisitions of Depop and Elo7, a portion of which were accrued in the prior quarter as well as a cash tax payment of approximately $60 million. In addition, we repurchased $54 million in shares during the quarter under our Board authorized repurchase plan. Our model remains highly cash generative asset light, and we generally convert the majority of adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow.
And now turning to our outlook. We currently estimate that our Q4 consolidated GMS, which will now include Etsy, Reverb and a full quarter for Depop and Elo7, will be $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion, up about 12% at the midpoint compared to Q4 of last year. We expect that our Q4 revenue will be $660 million to $690 million, up about 10% at the midpoint versus Q4 of last year. And our adjusted EBITDA margin will be about 26%. Within our Q4 GMS guidance, we are forecasting very solid growth for the Etsy marketplace of high single-digit GMS growth, implying relatively stable 2-year growth when compared to Q3. We think this is excellent given our year ago performance.
Drilling in a bit more on our guidance, the holiday season has kicked off early on the Etsy marketplace, and we have had a strong October. We note that during the month of October, keywords that have holiday terms in them have increased nearly 100% year-over-year. Buyers are anticipating longer shipping times driven by constraints in the supply chain. We recognized several important tailwinds, including external forecasts for strong holiday spending, consumer behavior that continues to rely on e-commerce, now becoming a habit not a substitute, and Etsy's distributed supply chain that may be less impacted than others in this environment.
On the flip side, we are also keeping an eye on several potential headwinds, including those associated with inflation, retail reopenings, potential carrier constraints and consumer confidence. It's important to keep in mind that Etsy's November and December year-over-year comps are challenging, so we factored this into our guidance as well.
Within the context of our guidance, here are a few additional items to keep in mind. Note that 4% of Etsy's marketplace GMS, or $133 million was from face masks in Q4 2020 and we expect facemask to be relatively inconsequential in Q4 2021. Also keep in mind that Depop and Elo7, while accretive to our top line, will be with us for a full quarter, meaning they will be dilutive to adjusted EBITDA margin similar to the impact they had in Q3 as we invest in their future growth. The majority of the contraction in take rate is driven by our subsidiary marketplace as having a lower average take rate than Etsy stand-alone. Also, we expect an increase in amortization based on the allocation of purchase price for both Depop and Elo7. Refer to our 10-Q, which will be filed shortly for more details.
You'll see us stepping back up our marketing spend in the fourth quarter, and hiring will continue to be at an elevated pace. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2020, U.S. stimulus checks were a significant boost to consumer spending that is not expected to repeat this year. Stimulus checks also remained an important factor in our elevated growth in Q1 2021 and a bit in the early part of Q2. So please keep those high growth levels in mind as you model 2022.
Thank you all for your time today. I will now turn the call over to Deb, so we can take your questions."

We've got several versions of the guidance -- Q4 guidance question. I'll take this one from Laura Champine of Loop Capital.
Josh, I'll take this to you. Why do you expect GMS growth to decelerate despite the advantages of your mom-and-pop sellers of our main pop sellers may have when compared to big retailers that are facing major supply chain problems this holiday?"
28492682,1685063007,2423966,"Etsy, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Etsy, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Deb. And thanks all of you who asked it.

I think you won the most popular question of the earnings call award. 
So we feel great about our Q4 guide. And let me start with, as Rachel said, we're off to a strong start in October, and we feel great about that. Let's remember what we're comping. Last year, we had a really solid October, followed by a blow-the-doors-out November and December. And if we go back and remember why it was a tragic reason why. COVID cases were spiking dramatically. There were lockdown orders going in place in many parts of the country. Hospitals were overflowing. And as a result, people were largely trapped at home and had very few places for where to shop.
And so many people turn to Etsy, often for the first time, with a lack of a lot of other options. And so November and December last year were remarkable. And as a result, we delivered a fourth quarter at Etsy of 111%. That's what we're lapping 111%, vastly outstripping most of e-commerce.
We're off to a strong start in October. We feel great about that. The comps get a lot harder in November and in December. What we found is that looking at our growth rate relative to 2019 is the most helpful way to look at our growth rate because 2020 was so volatile with so many external factors.
And so if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, what we forecasted is that Q4 is absolutely stable to Q3, and we think that's great news. In a world where there's so much more choice, where people are moving about largely freely, where hopefully, COVID cases continue to decline and people are moving about and shopping wherever they want, they continue to choose to come back to Etsy again and again. And in fact, we're growing meaningfully over those remarkable comps from last year. So we feel really good about the fourth quarter.
Could it come in stronger even than what we've guided to? Absolutely. It could turn out that people are spending more, that they're turning to Etsy more and more, that the trends we saw in October could continue in November and December.
Could it turn out that October was a pull forward of the holiday? And a lot of people are spending much earlier in the holiday in November and December will turn out to be weaker months for e-commerce generally? Yes, that's possible. We live in a world of unknown. So we're giving you the best guidance we have with the information that we have. And our main focus is to make sure that our customers, our buyers and our sellers have a really good experience this quarter. So that's what's under our control and that's what we're focused on. And again, I'm so delighted that so many people had such a great experience on Etsy back when they had relatively few choices that now that they have a ton of choices, they are choosing to come back to Etsy even more often, and I think that's incredibly encouraging."

Performance market has continued to be very effective for us. I know that there's a lot of discussion about CPCs going up a lot over the marketplace and other people's margins being under pressure with that. Etsy is so long tail that we have felt a lot less of that than others. So we continue to see very strong returns from performance marketing.
In terms of IDFA, I would describe that as a future opportunity cost to Etsy more than a present headwind. So really where IDFA is challenging is at least for us, and I think for many others, for paid app marketing efforts. It's hard to tell when you spend money to market your app how effective that performance marketing is. And truthfully, we've not been paying to market our app. So it's not a present headwind.
Now maybe we should be paying to market our app. And maybe that's something that would help us to grow even faster. We've talked about our earned efforts to market our app. Meaning through our own channels, through our free channels, we've been seeing great success marketing our app. So IDFA might be a headwind to the opportunity for us to be investing even more to market our app, but it hasn't been a material headwind to our present performance."

So we did say GMS per active buyer was up 20% in Q3, even though some of our buyer segments actually decelerated in the quarter. So it was a really strong quarter for GMS per active buyer. One of the factors that drives GMS is frequency. So more and more buyers buying more frequently, which is so heartening. So many of our cohorts are -- so much more choice and share of wallet.
Reminder that the average number of purchase days for all of our buyers increased from 3.1 -- is down 3.1, and that is up from 2.5 a year ago. And then for repeat buyers, it went up to 5.2, another solid increase, up from 4.6 a year ago. So we're seeing improvement in frequency across the board. It's still low. So 3.1 is still far lower than we hope it can be. Your question was, could it be once per month, and we see no reason think that it couldn't be.
Another important factor is the habitual buyers was again our fastest-growing segment, and it grew 237% on a 2-year basis, and it represents about 40% of our GMS. So it's really a strong sort of testimony that the most important segment is growing the fastest."

And most of those places are playing the same playbook, right? They're going to try to sell you commoditized products that are cheaper to buy and arrive faster.
And the more people consolidate their purchases there, the more they're going to crave an alternative. And if Etsy is the leading alternative to commoditized commerce, and I think we're better positioned than others, I personally believe we're as well positioned as any to be the leading alternative to that commoditized habit you go to all the time.
I think that's a huge opportunity. And when you look at GMS per active buyer at only $130 per year, it doesn't take much to believe that, that can go up substantially."

It is a little lighter on take rate, traditionally, seasonally for Etsy in the fourth quarter, simply because we get so much more GMS than we get on transaction fees than we get on things like Etsy Ads, which is not necessarily moving up seasonally.
Our other subs are also -- skew a little bit higher in the fourth quarter, but not as demonstrability as Etsy does. So Depop, Elo7 and Reverb all have slightly higher fourth quarters than they do the rest of the year. And -- but not as pronounced as you would see in Etsy. We haven't broken out the seasonality for some of those subs, so I'll leave the answer at that."

The take rate being a little softer typically on Etsy in the fourth quarter is what I would classify as a high-class problem. Transaction rates are based on purchases and advertising is based on views. And because conversion rate historically goes up in the fourth quarter, GMS grows faster than views. 
So our sellers are happy to advertise. They're putting in a budget to advertise. They're -- that's not the constraint. It's simply that, that GMS grows even faster than us, which is another way of saying conversion rate is strong in the fourth quarter, which means buyers are finding what they like, which is a good news story."

So they're very much focused on increasing conversion rate through a better customer experience. And there's a lot of opportunities that Etsy has to help them. So we're working closely with them, looking at, for example, their search technology to figure out how we can deliver more relevant search experiences. And things that streamline the path to purchase, so people can go from view to purchase even faster and more easily. And by improving the conversion rate, we improve the value of the visit. And that allows us to market more effectively, get a higher ROI.
The other area that we're very focused on is helping them with performance marketing and marketing attribution so that we can lean more into performance marketing in a way that drives growth and drives value in an ROI-positive way.
Specifically looking at Elo7. They're very focused right now on shipping and how do they lower the shipping costs through increased relationships with carriers in Brazil which we think is a meaningful opportunity. And also, as Brazil hopefully emerges from the pandemic as vaccination rates are growing there, people get back to events. And the Depop business is much more event heavy than is Etsy or the other subsidiaries."

We had historically thought the app was the best place for experienced buyers to go. So you start on the mobile web or on the desktop. And after you've made a couple of purchases, you migrate to the app. That works and definitely more experienced buyers are having a really good experience on Etsy. And we see that once they download the app, their engagement goes up in almost every metric.
What's been an interesting finding over the past couple of quarters is even newer buyers seem ready to download the app and benefit by downloading the app. So you're seeing us lean into marketing the app even for people who maybe haven't bought before or first-time buyers. And what we're finding is, for those communities as well, when they download the app, we are seeing more engagement from them. And it does make sense that with the app, we have more opportunities to provide triggers for them to use the app through things like badging on the app to say there's 3 or 4 updates waiting for you and then driving them to an updates tab, which tells them, here's what's happened since you left. And then just a more dynamic and rich experience as is possible in an app and not in mobile web.
To give you some sense of proportionality it was just this quarter that the app became the largest platform as measured by GMS, overtaking mobile web and overtaking desktop. Mobile web is still the largest platform by visits. So there's meaningful opportunity still for the app to grow, and it's something that we think we're only just beginning to really lean into and tap to its full potential."

I think consumer confidence has held up better than many of us feared. Consumer spending has held up better than many of us feared, and that's certainly reflected in Etsy's Q3 results where you saw us come in over the top of guidance based almost entirely on the strength of the core Etsy business and the organic Etsy business.
So as you know, we pulled back on performance marketing to test incrementality. And even in light of that, the organic strength of the Etsy brand in this market is holding up really, really well. So we're incredibly pleased by that.
I would say we think it was reasonable to assume that as the world reopened and people had so much more choice, they would avail themselves of that choice and Etsy would face headwinds, and we would see some deceleration. And we expected that, and we think that's reasonable.
It's been delightful to see that certainly relative to 2019, that hasn't been, in fact, the case in that we've seen a lot of stability and in fact, GMS per active buyer growing. So we think that's great. As I move around the other subsidiaries, Reverb is growing on a 2-year stack, substantially faster than the musical instrument industry itself, which is great.
They see a little bit more variability as musical instrument stores open and close and open again. They see a little bit more variability. But as we said, with the Etsy marketplace with Reverb, we also find measuring them on a 2-year stack or measuring them relative to 2019 is the easiest way to forecast that business and we continue to see it grow substantially faster than the musical instrument industry as a whole. So we think that's great.
Elo7 in Brazil has faced headwinds because a substantial part of that business is based on events. People buying things for birthday parties or baby showers or quinceaneras or things like that. And obviously, with the pandemic and lockdowns, there have been far fewer events. We did see towards the end of the third quarter, vaccinations have been accelerating fairly rapidly in Brazil. And towards the end of the third quarter, we did see it the beginnings of an uptick in Elo7 as vaccination rate spread, and we think that that's really encouraging.
At Depop, we also feel very good about their 2-year growth rate. And as we have talked about, they had an exceptional 2020 where they grew at over 100% and far faster than all of the publicly traded e-commerce peers. As we expected, they did decline in the third quarter, and that was as expected, and it's because their population is disproportionately teenagers, it's Gen Z. And also, they're heavily weighted towards the U.K. where teenagers were pretty much locked at home for a substantial part of 2020. And the stay-at-home orders really began to ease in the third quarter.
And so it's not surprising that teenagers, after being locked at home for a year, want to go out, want to be with their friends, want to go to the mall. And so they're seeing some temporary headwinds from that. We continue to think e-commerce is an amazing space. We continue to think that apparel is the most attractive part of e-commerce, and we continue to think that Depop is the best brand in e-commerce and apparel. And again, we continue to feel great about their 2-year growth rate and the prospects for the medium and long term, and we're really excited to be partnering with all 3 of these brands to help them to unlock even more growth and achieve their full potential."

Tweaks and tunes in various channels to make them more accurate are really helpful. We do that all the time to optimize, but nothing that changes the thesis overall.
So we learned it helps us optimize our model. We might change a threshold here and there based on what we learned. And you can see that by doing that, we actually left profitable growth on the table. So we want to keep -- we have a very dynamic investment model in marketing where we spend up to when the last marginal dollar spend is no longer reaching our ROI threshold. So it's very dynamic. It pulls back automatically depending on where we set the ROI threshold. And so we'll keep investing those learnings to optimize and grow the channels that we think are the most profitability."

And said differently, incrementality testing can sound like what does that really mean? But it just means if we hadn't spent the money, might those people have found us anyway? And are we truly getting additive buyers for the money we're spending. We're constantly asking ourselves that question. I'm sure you're constantly asking it, did you really need to spend that much on marketing? And we're asking that, too, and we're testing that. And we're testing it at the margin, not just the overall thesis. 
Other thing I'll add about the third quarter is we did very little TV advertising. We were dark most of the third quarter on TV. We've just launched a brand-new campaign. We showed you one example of that campaign. And that campaign will be live for most of the fourth quarter. So you'll see us much more aggressively on TV in the fourth quarter. You'll see us lean into performance marketing. We think our brand is super relevant all the time, but especially relevant during the holidays. And we want to make sure that we're really in front of people.
And the performance marketing works really hard for people that are already down the purchase funnel and thinking about buying something. What you're seeing in our TV ads is we also want the chance to tell our story. We want to remind people why we're different. We want to make sure we have an emotional connection with people. We want to make sure that there's organic love for the Etsy brand and people continuing to come directly to our brand and not only finding us downstream.
And I will continue to point out how special we think that is of Etsy, that such a high proportion of our traffic comes direct to us, and we're not downstream independent on other channels, which we think is a real strength. So you should expect us to lean more into marketing in the fourth quarter as we typically do and as reflected in our margin guidance."

Because OSA is a cooperative spend when we spend on PLAs and there's a successful sale for our sellers, we charge an incremental transaction fee. So our pullback on performance marketing means that, that fee also went down a bit. However, we did say that 40% of our performance marketing now is offset by our OSA fees. So that's a very healthy program for us and still less than 2% churn from our sellers who participate in the OSA program."

So we have a significant amount of demand that is coming from top of mind awareness or our investments in other forms of marketing -- other marketing channels like our CRM efforts, our social efforts and our brand marketing to drive top of awareness. And those things are all working together.
Now we didn't pull performance marketing all the way back. So we did still spend significantly in the quarter. And like I said, we -- it's a dynamic. We just -- we can just change the ROI threshold to bring the spend down and it dynamically will reduce. So we're still feeling that we've got very great traffic. In fact, added 7 million new buyers in the third quarter, even though our marketing spend came down."

And one of the things we talked about in the recorded part of the call was doing a better job of setting expectations and meeting expectations. When we talk about really becoming a habit. When we talk about taking that $130 of GMS per active buyer and making it something much, much larger, if you know that it's worry free to shop on Etsy. You know when it's going to arrive, it's going to be as expected. I think we can gain a much, much larger share of people's wallet over time. And so it's a really big focus of ours. And so the fact that we have so much more EDD coverage, expected delivery date coverage, and the fact that we're doing an ever better job of really meeting those expectations is, I think, really helpful.
We're never going to promise to deliver things everything on the site within 2 days or everything in the site within 24 hours. And I think when I look at our environment and sustainability, training the world to expect everything to arrive in a day is not good for our environment and largely not necessary. So I think a lot of people are questioning right now with all the supply chain issues, people are thinking, maybe I should shop a little earlier. And maybe I don't need to wait until the very last minute. That's likely helpful for Etsy for this year. But hopefully, I think for the long term, people starting to consider whether they really need to wait until the last minute, I think that would be good for the world and certainly also aligned with Etsy."

I'm super excited about the Star Seller program and what it can -- what it is today and even more importantly, what it can become over time. So I want to start with seller agency. What sellers really want is they want to know what can I do to make my shop more successful. And the more transparent we can be, the better they're going to be doing their job, right? They're busy. They have relatively little time. And so if we can focus their efforts on these are the 2 or 3 things that are going to drive the most improvement for you, that's really helpful for them, and it's something that Etsy is uniquely positioned to be able to do.
And so by giving them a few key customer service metrics to focus on, we're already seeing very meaningful improvements. We talked about, for example, responding to a buyer  convo within 24 hours. We saw a 600 basis point improvement across the entire marketplace on that one metric within 2 months of launching the program. So that's a really good example of how this can really lift all boats.
We do see that by surfacing on promoting the sellers that provide the most reliably good customer service, we're going to have a better buyer experience and a better seller experience. So the fact that sellers that are Star Sellers have a 25% higher repeat purchase rate, I think that's a factor of 2 things. One, the recognition of the Star Seller giving buyers confidence. But two, the fact that these sellers are delivering consistently good customer service and earning repeat business. And the more we can get every seller to look like a Star Seller the better off I think it is for everyone."
