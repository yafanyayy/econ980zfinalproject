No matter which lends you used to look at MetLife's performance, the fourth quarter full year 2020 or the progress we've made toward our next horizon strategy, the portrait that emerges is one of a resilient company with consistent execution that delivers for its stakeholders. 
The year 2020 was an especially unforgiving environment for life insurers, marked by the worst pandemic in a century, record low interest rates and extreme market volatility. And yet at MetLife, by reducing and diversifying our risk, controlling expenses, staying true to our investment principles and executing on our capital deployment philosophy, we overcame these challenges to produce strong earnings, cash and book value per share growth. 
Let's begin with our fourth quarter 2020 results. As you saw last night, we delivered quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $2.03 per share. One of the primary drivers was the exceptionally strong returns we earned on our private equity portfolio, which has long been an important source of value creation for MetLife. 
Overall, adjusted earnings, excluding notable, rose 30% year-over-year. Just as noteworthy during the quarter was the resilience of our business in the face of COVID-19. MetLife's balanced risk exposure across the spectrum of mortality, morbidity and longevity was clearly evident in the quarter and the year. Certain parts of our business experienced significant adverse mortality, such as Group Life and Mexico. But those effects were more than offset by lower utilization and growth and EMEA and favorable underwriting in MetLife Holdings. We believe the strong diversification of our businesses represents a meaningful differentiator for net life and the current crisis and beyond. 
If we look at 2020 as a whole, some additional attributes of MetLife's culture, strategy and performance come into view. I must begin by commending the way MetLife's people stepped up for each other and our customers during the pandemic. It is our very purpose as a company to provide financial production and support for people during lives mostly stabilizing moments. The pandemic was one of those moments for so many people who rely on MetLife, and we were pleased to go above and beyond for them and for our broader communities. 
Between premium credits and contributions from the Metlife Foundation, we provided more than $250 million of relief to help people cope with COVID-19. What enabled us to preserve our financial strength through the crisis was having the right strategy and an unwavering commitment to execution. We are a less interest-sensitive company than we used to be. In a year where the 10-year treasury spent 9 months below 1%, we delivered an adjusted return on equity, excluding notables of 12.3%. And the positive earnings impact from volume growth significantly outweighed the drag from lower recurring investment income. That volume growth showed up in a number of ways. We recorded our second highest year of pension risk transfer sales ever. Our stable value sales jumped significantly, helping our reported liability balances within retirement and income solutions to grow by a very strong 14%. And we successfully entered the U.K. longevity reinsurance market where we see the potential for additional deals. 
Our expense discipline, which is one of the most critical levers we control, was exceptional. We promised to deliver a 2020 direct expense ratio of 12.3%. Despite the challenges we faced during the year, our actual direct expense ratio came in at 12% or 30 basis points lower. Year-over-year, this represents an enterprise-wide direct expense reduction of roughly $300 million, all while continuing to make critical technology to improve the customer experience. 
Our cash generation, the ultimate measure of value creation, was strong. We ended the year with $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding company. This is well above the top end of our target buffer and comes during a year when we deployed approximately $4.5 billion toward common stock dividends, share repurchases and accretive M&A, in addition to continuing to invest in new business growth. 
M&A remains a strategic asset for MetLife and a key tool as we evolve our portfolio to in the future. For example, we have long the premier group benefits platform and the life insurance space and continue to deepen our competitive advantage in this highly profitable business. In 2019, we announced a suite of attractive new voluntary benefits, digital wealths, health savings accounts and pet insurance. In 2020, we grew group benefits adjusted PFOs by 5% and positioned the business for double-digit adjusted PFO growth in 2021 with the acquisition of Versant Health. And in the second quarter of this year, we expect to close on the sale of MetLife Auto and Home to farmers insurance. This transaction includes a 10-year strategic partnership that allows each company to do what it does best, farmers to manufacture high-quality P&C products and MetLife to distribute those products through the 3,800 employers in our U.S. group benefits network. 
At MetLife, the process of planting and pruning to ensure we have the optimal business mix is nothing new. In 2020, we closed on the sale of our Hong Kong business, sold our Argentina annuity business and agreed to sell our Russia business, which closed last month. I am so proud of what the team at MetLife has been able to accomplish during an atmosphere of disruption and chaos. 
I have heard 2020 refer to as a last year. For MetLife, it was anything but. We seized on the opportunities in front of us and we will use our momentum as a springboard to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. Consider our P&C divestiture, we expect the accretion benefits will start to materialize in 2021 and will drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2022. 
If we pull back further and look at MetLife's performance relative to our next horizon strategy, and to the commitments we made at our Investor Day in December 2019, we remain firmly on track. This was far from a given in light of the unprecedented challenges we faced in 2020. As a reminder, 3 of our anchoring commitments were: first, maintain a 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%; second, preserve a $3 billion to $4 billion cash buffer; and third, generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over 5 years. We are confident in our ability to achieve each of these commitments. 
As you know, based on market conditions at the end of March, we discussed a scenario in which our free cash flow ratio could fall below our 2-year average target range of 65% to 75%. As John will discuss later, this is not a scenario we currently contemplate, and we are affirming a 65% to 75% target range for our near-term outlook. As I mentioned earlier, the cash balance at our holding companies at the end of the year totaled $4.5 billion. Keep in mind that we expect to receive $3.5 billion in net cash as soon as our P&C divestiture closes. 
And perhaps most impressive, given the economic backdrop, we remain on course to generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over the 5-year period from 2020 through 2024, an amount equal to more than 40% of our current market cap. 
We believe that no matter which you use, the evidence of MetLife's transformation is clear. It begins with our purpose of building a more confident future for all. By inspiring and enabling our people to deliver for our customers, we create value that extends to our shareholders and communities. Our commitment to preserving MetLife's financial strength is really just another way of saying that we will always keep our promises and manage this company sustainably for the long run. This requires discipline, determination and dedication to consistent performance. More than ever, we are convinced that we have the right ingredients to generate strong value creation, a sound strategy, an attractive set of businesses and the management team with a relentless focus on execution. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our financial results in greater detail and to discuss our 2021 outlook."

I will start with the 4Q '20 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $124 million or $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses from higher long-term interest rates and stronger equity markets. For the full year, net income of $5.2 billion, which included net driven gains of $1.1 billion, was more in line with adjusted earnings.  Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continue to perform as expected. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. This comparison excludes net favorable notable items of $420 million in the fourth quarter of '19, which were accounted for in corporate and other. Excluding such items, adjusted earnings per share were up 33% and 34% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving to the segments, starting with the U.S. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 16% year-over-year, driven by expense margins, underwriting and volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 96.3%, which is above the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, and included roughly 9 percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. 
For approved non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 61.7%, below our annual target range of 72% to 77%, due to favorable dental and disability results. The higher dental utilization at the end of the third quarter did not continue in 4Q as we had anticipated, most likely due to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases. 
Turning to top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 10% year-over-year on solid product growth as well as the release of approximately $200 million of the remaining unearned dental premium reserve established in 2Q. Excluding this reserve release, Group Benefits PFO growth fell within our annual target range of 4% to 6%. 
Retirement and Income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 64% year-over-year. The primary drivers were strong investment margins, mostly due to higher variable investment income and volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 177 basis points, up 71 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 104 basis points, up 21 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. 
RIS liability exposures, excluding U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 14.3% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. We completed 5 pension risk transfer deals totaling $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a very strong result. For the full year of 2020, PRT sales were $4.7 billion. As Michel noted, that was our second highest year ever, and we see a good pipeline going forward in 2021. 
Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings of $112 million were up $87 million, as fewer miles driven led to favorable auto underwriting margins. As previously announced, we expect to close the sale of the auto and home business to farmers insurance in the second quarter. The purchase price is not subject to any adjustment for changes to the business performance or economic conditions from the deal announcement through closing. And starting with the first quarter of 2021, Property and Casualty results will be reflected as a divested business in our financial statements and excluded from adjusted earnings for all of 2021. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 45% and 42% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting, volume growth and expense margins. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 5% on a constant currency basis. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were down $139 million on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting. Elevated COVID-19-related claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $160 million after tax. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 23% and 27% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable expense and underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 58%. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns as well as favorable long-term care underwriting and expense margins. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.6%, higher than the prior year quarter of 55.5% and our annual target range of 50% to 55%. While life claims were elevated due to COVID-19, this was more than offset by favorable long-term care results, which benefited from both lower claim incidents and higher policy termination rates. 
Corporate and other adjusted loss was $198 million. This result is consistent with the expectation that we laid out for the second half of 2020. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% and at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the 4 quarters and full year of 2020. VII was $778 million in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had an 8.4% return in the quarter. For the full year 2020, VII was $1.2 billion and above our 2020 target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This outperformance was primarily attributable to exceptional private equity returns in the second half of the year. 
On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. The attribution of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As a general rule of thumb, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split around 1/3 each. 
Turning to Page 7. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2020 and each quarter of 2020. In 4Q, our direct expense ratio was 12.3%. More significantly, our full year 2020 direct expense ratio was 12% and better than our annual target of 12.3%. Our 5-year goal was to realize at least $800 million of pretax profit margin improvement by 2020, which represents an approximate 200 basis point decline from the 2015 baseline year. We exceeded that goal and reduced our direct expense ratio by 230 basis points, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at December 31, which is down from $7.8 billion at September 30, but still above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the completion of the Versant Health acquisition and the previously discussed redemption of preferred stock. Further, cash on the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $571 million in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
In 2020, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. So far in 2021, we have repurchased another $434 million of shares with roughly $2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. For the 2-year period, 2019 and 2020, our free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items, totaled 78%, which was above the high end of our 65% to 75% target rate. 
In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2020 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2020 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $4.3 billion, while net income was approximately $3.6 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Operating earnings more than offset dividends paid to the holding company.  Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 906% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. 
Before I shift to our near-term outlook on Page 10, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 14 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments, updated for 2019. We continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. MetLife invested $3.8 billion of capital in 2019 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 15% with a payback period of 7 years.  Also, Pages 15 through 18 provide interest rate assumptions and key sensitivities by line of business. 
Turning back to Slide 10. The macro environment remains uncertain, and we expect COVID-19 impact to remain with us through the first half of 2021. Also, we expect pent-up demand in certain utilization products to emerge in 2021, albeit more noticeably post first quarter. 
While we expect interest rates will remain low, the steepening of the yield curve has helped support our investment spreads. Finally, based on the forward curve, the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken. 
Moving to near term targets. We are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. Despite the headwinds associated with the lower interest rates and the realized gain from the sale of our P&C business, we expect to migrate back to the range over the near-term period. We also expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. In the early part of 2020, we presented a scenario based on economic conditions as of March 31, indicating that such conditions for an extended period of time could pressure our free cash flow ratio. However, since then, macroeconomic conditions, credit markets as well as the company's business mix and performance have been resilient and support our current outlook. 
In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a direct expense ratio below 12.3%, while the sale of the P&C operation will put pressure on this target in 2021 due to its lower expense ratio. We expect to be back below the target starting in 2022 as a result of our commitment to an efficiency mindset. 
We are raising our VII guidance range in 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We project private equity to remain strong in 2021. Our plan assumes a 12% annual return on an average balance of approximately $9 billion. In addition, a portion of our real estate exposure has been shifting from direct ownership to indirect ownership through certain real estate funds. The net result will be a migration of around $100 million of recurring net investment income to VII in 2021 and beyond. 
Our corporate and other adjusted loss is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax, and we are maintaining our effective tax rate of 20% to 22%. 
At the bottom of the page, you will see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31. The takeaway is that the changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments.  Our comments will be anchored off full year 2020 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. 
Let's start with the U.S. on Page 11. For group benefits, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to have low double-digit growth in 2021, aided by the Versant Health acquisition. Following 2021, we expect top line growth to revert to our historical target range of 4% to 6% annually. 
Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual group life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. However, we do expect the first quarter of 2021 Group Life mortality ratio to be above the range as COVID-19-related mortality remained elevated. The group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio of 65.3% in 2020 was extremely favorable, driven by unusually low utilization in dental, and lower incidence in disability. Although we do not believe the 2020 ratio is sustainable, dental utilization remains low so far in '21. In addition, we are lowering our expected annual Group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio to 70% to 75% from 72% to 77%. The reduction reflects our continued shift in business mix towards products, with lower benefit ratios, including voluntary products and the addition of Versant Health. 
For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability attritions across our general account spread business and fee-based businesses. We are also maintaining our expected annual RIS investment spread of 90 to 115 basis points in 2021. 
For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 5% to 7% annually, roughly consistent with the natural runoff of this legacy business. While the top line continues to decline, we are widening our adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. 
Finally, we are also maintaining the life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 50% to 55% in 2021. While COVID-19-related life claims are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2021, this will be more than offset in lower top policyholder dividend scale. 
Now let's look at our non-U.S. businesses near-term guidance on Page 12, which is presented on a reported basis for adjusted earnings and PFOs and on a constant currency basis for sales and AUM. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate double-digit growth in 2021, followed by mid- to high single-digit growth in '22 and '23. 
In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid single-digit growth, we are expecting adjusted earnings to be essentially flat in 2021, increasing to mid single-digit growth in '22 and '23. Our Latin America business has been the most negatively impacted by COVID-19. And the environment remains less certain as vaccine protocols are still emerging. Given this backdrop, we expect adjusted PFOs to have high single to low double-digit annual growth over the near term. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings to grow high teens, aided by favorable FX impacts of approximately $25 million. 
For the first quarter, adjusted earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2010 with gradual improvement, particularly in the second half of the year. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect Latin America's adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels. 
In contrast to Latin America, EMEA had a very strong 2020, benefiting from lower utilization in group Medical and accident and health businesses due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Regarding the top line, we expect EMEA sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid- to high single digits over the near term. Given the unsustainable benefit ratio in 2020, we expect EMEA's adjusted earnings to grow low to mid-single digits against the more appropriate baseline year of 2019. 
Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, fulfilling our financial commitments to shareholders and keeping our promises to customers. Our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment and come out stronger. We are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company, will continue to create long-term, sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

So let me start by just reiterating, and you've heard me say this many times that we believe excess capital above and beyond what's required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders. And we would use it for share repurchases, common dividends and strategic acquisitions that clear a risk-adjusted hurdle rates. So no change there. And that's why we also announced in December that our Board had approved $50 billion buyback authorization. We repurchased 571 million of MetLife shares in the fourth quarter. In total, for the year, we repurchased approximately 1.2 billion. And so far in 2021, we've repurchased another 434 million shares. So we still have roughly $2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. We would expect to complete the new $3 billion authorization in 2021. 
And look, I think we've also built a track record here of being deliberate in how we manage capital.

So for dental, we did see a significant dip as COVID hit and the dental offices were closed. And as you recall at the time, because of lack of availability of services, we did set up unearned premium reserve back in the second quarter. From a utilization perspective, we did expect some sort of catch-up effect or pent-up demand. And we did see some of that in the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, that kind of pulled back. And in particular, it's pulled back for preventative services, so think regular checkups, cleaning, et cetera. And as we go into Q1 for dental, we're still seeing some softness in that utilization. So it is coming in below expectations, again, driven by those preventative services. So that's kind of the dental picture last year and coming into this quarter in terms of what we have visibility into. 
For disability, just let's dimensionalize the book for you. So disability is about 12% of our PFO. 1/3 of that book is short-term disability and 2/3 is long term disability. So for the FTD book, it's not really a macro unemployment story. It's really all about injuries and minor surgeries, et cetera. And what we've seen in that book last year and what we continue to see this year, so far, is the rising COVID claims have been basically offset by a decrease in some of the other claims with respect to injuries and surgeries. So it's basically flat on the STD portion of the book. 
The LTD portion of the book is -- continues to be favorable. Now if past recessions or any guide, you would expect to see some impact in terms of frequency and recoveries on the LTD book, we typically see those impacts coming in with a lag. We continue to monitor this very carefully, but we're not yet seeing any unfavorability, but we're seeing favorability rather in terms of frequency for the LTV book so far."

We really continue to favor high-quality names in the public markets.

Regarding the -- looking ahead, the rollout of the vaccine, we expect delays and -- especially in Mexico. However, we are very pleased with the fundamentals and the financial strength of our business in the region, and that remains strong, and a leading franchise in the region remains intact. We expect our revenues to grow also, really supported by strong persistency, which we've seen across the region. And a good example is our flagship product in Mexico, our net 99 product. And this will support growth in 2021. 
So just to close, as you've seen on John's comments in our outlook, we expect '22 earnings to really come back and return to historical levels by then."

But if you were just to step back and look at that franchise and look at the 2020 results, we're seeing very strong momentum here. Our value proposition is resonating with our customers and intermediaries. And our 2020 results, full year had a 5% PFO growth, and I would remind you that includes about 1 point of headwind from the dental premium discount that we provided in the second quarter. So this is -- the results, we're really pleased with, especially in the context of a challenging external environment. But looking forward, in terms of our confidence in the outlook, we talked about Versant. And we -- the strategic fit is there. We continue to see a very good reaction from our customers and intermediaries about Versant. And the integration is well underway. We continue to see very strong persistency across our book, and rate actions that have been consistent with our expectations in the jumbo market, which was light in 2020, the activity has returned in 2021. And we are kind of winning our fair share. So we are expecting to see strong sales figures coming into Q1. 
And then finally, if you think about our outlook, I would say, what's coming into sharp focus here is the increasing importance of the investments we have been making and continue to make in our capabilities broadly and specifically, our digital capabilities to kind of meet changing needs of our customers. And this is where our scale and ability to invest is paying off dividends. So to give you just a sense of that, in voluntary PFOs, we saw a 20% growth in our PFOs in 2020 over '19, and we're expecting a similar growth in '21. Those numbers compound. So our 2020 PFOs in voluntary were more than double our 2017 numbers. But this is a big shift to move. And hence, kind of the guidance is, we think, is the right one, beyond '21."

No matter which lens you used to look at MetLife's performance, the fourth quarter, full year 2020 or the progress we've made toward our Next Horizon strategy, the portrait that emerges is one of a resilient company with consistent execution that delivers for its stakeholders. 
The year 2020 was an especially unforgiving environment for life insurers, marked by the worst pandemic in a century, record low interest rates and extreme market volatility. And yet at MetLife, by reducing and diversifying our risk, controlling expenses, staying true to our investment principles and executing on our capital deployment philosophy, we overcame these challenges to produce strong earnings, cash and book value per share growth. 
Let's begin with our fourth quarter 2020 results. As you saw last night, we delivered quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $2.03 per share. One of the primary drivers was the exceptionally strong returns we earned on our private equity portfolio, which has long been an important source of value creation for MetLife. 
Overall, adjusted earnings, excluding notables, rose 30% year-over-year. Just as noteworthy during the quarter was the resilience of our business in the face of COVID-19. MetLife's balanced risk exposure across the spectrum of mortality, morbidity and longevity was clearly evident in the quarter and the year. Certain parts of our business experienced significant adverse mortality, such as Group Life and Mexico. But those effects were more than offset by lower utilization and growth and EMEA and favorable underwriting in MetLife Holdings. We believe the strong diversification of our businesses represents a meaningful differentiator for MetLife and the current crisis and beyond. 
If we look at 2020 as a whole, some additional attributes of MetLife's culture, strategy and performance come into view. I must begin by commending the way MetLife's people stepped up for each other and our customers during the pandemic. It is our very purpose as a company to provide financial protection and support for people during lives most de-stabilizing moments. The pandemic was one of those moments for so many people who rely on MetLife, and we were pleased to go above and beyond for them and for our broader communities. 
Between premium credits and contributions from the Metlife Foundation, we provided more than $250 million of relief to help people cope with COVID-19. What enabled us to preserve our financial strength through the crisis was having the right strategy and an unwavering commitment to execution. We are a less interest-sensitive company than we used to be. In a year where the 10-year treasury spent 9 months below 1%, we delivered an adjusted return on equity, excluding notables, of 12.3%. And the positive earnings impact from volume growth significantly outweighed the drag from lower recurring investment income. That volume growth showed up in a number of ways. We recorded our second highest year of pension risk transfer sales ever. Our stable value sales jumped significantly, helping our reported liability balances within retirement and income solutions to grow by a very strong 14%. And we successfully entered the U.K. longevity reinsurance market where we see the potential for additional deals. 
Our expense discipline, which is one of the most critical levers we control, was exceptional. We promised to deliver a 2020 direct expense ratio of 12.3%. Despite the challenges we faced during the year, our actual direct expense ratio came in at 12% or 30 basis points lower. Year-over-year, this represents an enterprise-wide direct expense reduction of roughly $300 million, all while continuing to make critical technology investments to improve the customer experience. 
Our cash generation, the ultimate measure of value creation, was strong. We ended the year with $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding company. This is well above the top end of our target buffer and comes during a year when we deployed approximately $4.5 billion toward common stock dividends, share repurchases and accretive M&A, in addition to continuing to invest in new business growth. 
M&A remains a strategic asset for MetLife and a key tool as we evolve our portfolio too in the future. For example, we have long the premier group benefits platform in the life insurance space and continue to deepen our competitive advantage in this highly profitable business. In 2019, we announced a suite of attractive new voluntary benefits, digital wealths, health savings accounts and pet insurance. In 2020, we grew group benefits adjusted PFOs by 5% and positioned the business for double-digit adjusted PFO growth in 2021 with the acquisition of Versant Health. And in the second quarter of this year, we expect to close on the sale of MetLife Auto and Home to Farmers insurance. This transaction includes a 10-year strategic partnership that allows each company to do what it does best, Farmers to manufacture high-quality P&C products and MetLife to distribute those products through the 3,800 employers in our U.S. group benefits network. 
At MetLife, the process of planting and pruning to ensure we have the optimal business mix is nothing new. In 2020, we closed on the sale of our Hong Kong business, sold our Argentina annuity business and agreed to sell our Russia business, which closed last month. I am so proud of what the team at MetLife has been able to accomplish during an atmosphere of disruption and chaos. 
I have heard 2020 referred to as a lost year. For MetLife, it was anything but. We seized on the opportunities in front of us and we will use our momentum as a springboard to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. Consider our P&C divestiture.   We expect the accretion benefits will start to materialize in 2021 and will drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2022. 
If we pull back further and look at MetLife's performance relative to our Next Horizon strategy, and to the commitments we made at our Investor Day in December 2019, we remain firmly on track. This was far from a given in light of the unprecedented challenges we faced in 2020. As a reminder, 3 of our anchoring commitments were: first, maintain a 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%; second, preserve a $3 billion to $4 billion cash buffer; and third, generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over 5 years. We are confident in our ability to achieve each of these commitments. 
As you know, based on market conditions at the end of March, we discussed a scenario in which our free cash flow ratio could fall below our 2-year average target range of 65% to 75%. As John will discuss later, this is not a scenario we currently contemplate, and we are affirming a 65% to 75% target range for our near-term outlook. As I mentioned earlier, the cash balance at our holding companies at the end of the year totaled $4.5 billion. Keep in mind that we expect to receive $3.5 billion in net cash as soon as our P&C divestiture closes. 
And perhaps most impressive, given the economic backdrop, we remain on course to generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over the 5-year period from 2020 through 2024, an amount equal to more than 40% of our current market cap. 
We believe that no matter which lens you use, the evidence of MetLife's transformation is clear. It begins with our purpose of building a more confident future for all. By inspiring and enabling our people to deliver for our customers, we create value that extends to our shareholders and communities. Our commitment to preserving MetLife's financial strength is really just another way of saying that we will always keep our promises and manage this company sustainably for the long run. This requires discipline, determination and dedication to consistent performance. More than ever, we are convinced that we have the right ingredients to generate strong value creation, a sound strategy, an attractive set of businesses and the management team with a relentless focus on execution. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our financial results in greater detail and to discuss our 2021 outlook."

I will start with the 4Q '20 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $124 million or $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses from higher long-term interest rates and stronger equity markets. For the full year, net income of $5.2 billion, which included net derivative gains of $1.1 billion, was more in line with adjusted earnings.  Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continued to perform as expected. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. This comparison excludes net favorable notable items of $420 million in the fourth quarter of '19, which were accounted for in corporate and other. Excluding such items, adjusted earnings per share were up 33% and 34% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving to the segments, starting with the U.S. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 16% year-over-year, driven by expense margins, underwriting and volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 96.3%, which is above the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, and included roughly 9 percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. 
For approved non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 61.7%, below our annual target range of 72% to 77%, due to favorable dental and disability results. The higher dental utilization at the end of the third quarter did not continue in 4Q as we had anticipated, most likely due to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases. 
Turning to top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 10% year-over-year on solid product growth as well as the release of approximately $200 million of the remaining unearned dental premium reserve established in 2Q. Excluding this reserve release, Group Benefits PFO growth fell within our annual target range of 4% to 6%. 
Retirement and Income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 64% year-over-year. The primary drivers were strong investment margins, mostly due to higher variable investment income and volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 177 basis points, up 71 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 104 basis points, up 21 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. 
RIS liability exposures, excluding U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 14.3% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. We completed 5 pension risk transfer deals totaling $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a very strong result. For the full year of 2020, PRT sales were $4.7 billion. As Michel noted, that was our second highest year ever, and we see a good pipeline going forward in 2021. 
Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings of $112 million were up $87 million, as fewer miles driven led to favorable auto underwriting margins. As previously announced, we expect to close the sale of the auto and home business to farmers insurance in the second quarter. The purchase price is not subject to any adjustment for changes to the business performance or economic conditions from the deal announcement through closing. And starting with the first quarter of 2021, Property and Casualty results will be reflected as a divested business in our financial statements and excluded from adjusted earnings for all of 2021. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 45% and 42% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting, volume growth and expense margins. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 5% on a constant currency basis. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were down $139 million on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting. Elevated COVID-19-related claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $150 million after tax. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 23% and 27% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable expense and underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 58%. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns as well as favorable long-term care underwriting and expense margins. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.6%, higher than the prior year quarter of 55.5% and our annual target range of 50% to 55%. While life claims were elevated due to COVID-19, this was more than offset by favorable long-term care results, which benefited from both lower claim incidents and higher policy termination rates. 
Corporate and other adjusted loss was $198 million. This result is consistent with the expectation that we laid out for the second half of 2020. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the 4 quarters and full year of 2020. VII was $778 million in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had an 8.4% return in the quarter. For the full year 2020, VII was $1.2 billion and above our 2020 target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This outperformance was primarily attributable to exceptional private equity returns in the second half of the year. 
On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. The attribution of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As a general rule of thumb, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split around 1/3 each. 
Turning to Page 7. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2020 and each quarter of 2020. In 4Q, our direct expense ratio was 12.3%. More significantly, our full year 2020 direct expense ratio was 12% and better than our annual target of 12.3%. Our 5-year goal was to realize at least $800 million of pretax profit margin improvement by 2020, which represents an approximate 200 basis point decline from the 2015 baseline year. We exceeded that goal and reduced our direct expense ratio by 230 basis points, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at December 31, which is down from $7.8 billion at September 30, but still above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the completion of the Versant Health acquisition and the previously discussed redemption of preferred stock. Further, cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $571 million in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
In 2020, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. So far in 2021, we have repurchased another $434 million of shares with roughly $2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. For the 2-year period, 2019 and 2020, our free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items, totaled 78%, which was above the high end of our 65% to 75% target rate. 
In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2020 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2020 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $4.3 billion, while net income was approximately $3.6 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Operating earnings more than offset dividends paid to the holding company.  Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 906% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. 
Before I shift to our near-term outlook on Page 10, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 14 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments, updated for 2019. We continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. MetLife invested $3.8 billion of capital in 2019 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 15% with a payback period of 7 years.  Also, Pages 15 through 18 provide interest rate assumptions and key sensitivities by line of business. 
Turning back to Slide 10. The macro environment remains uncertain, and we expect COVID-19 impacts to remain with us through the first half of 2021. Also, we expect pent-up demand in certain utilization products to emerge in 2021, albeit more noticeably post first quarter. 
While we expect interest rates will remain low, the steepening of the yield curve has helped support our investment spreads. Finally, based on the forward curve, the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken. 
Moving to near term targets. We are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. Despite the headwinds associated with the lower interest rates and the realized gain from the sale of our P&C business, we expect to migrate back to the range over the near-term period. We also expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. In the early part of 2020, we presented a scenario based on economic conditions as of March 31, indicating that such conditions for an extended period of time could pressure our free cash flow ratio. However, since then, macroeconomic conditions, credit markets as well as the company's business mix and performance have been resilient and support our current outlook. 
In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a direct expense ratio below 12.3%, while the sale of the P&C operation will put pressure on this target in 2021 due to its lower expense ratio. We expect to be back below the target starting in 2022 as a result of our commitment to an efficiency mindset. 
We are raising our VII guidance range in 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We project private equity to remain strong in 2021. Our plan assumes a 12% annual return on an average balance of approximately $9 billion. In addition, a portion of our real estate exposure has been shifting from direct ownership to indirect ownership through certain real estate funds. The net result will be a migration of around $100 million of recurring net investment income to VII in 2021 and beyond. 
Our corporate and other adjusted loss is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax, and we are maintaining our effective tax rate of 20% to 22%. 
At the bottom of the page, you will see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31. The takeaway is that the changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments.  Our comments will be anchored off full year 2020 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. 
Let's start with the U.S. on Page 11. For group benefits, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to have low double-digit growth in 2021, aided by the Versant Health acquisition. Following 2021, we expect top line growth to revert to our historical target range of 4% to 6% annually. 
Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual group life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. However, we do expect the first quarter of 2021 Group Life mortality ratio to be above the range as COVID-19-related mortality remains elevated. The group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio of 65.3% in 2020 was extremely favorable, driven by unusually low utilization in dental, and lower incidence in disability. Although we do not believe the 2020 ratio is sustainable, dental utilization remains low so far in '21. In addition, we are lowering our expected annual Group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio to 70% to 75% from 72% to 77%. The reduction reflects our continued shift in business mix towards products, with lower benefit ratios, including voluntary products and the addition of Versant Health. 
For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability attritions across our general account spread business and fee-based businesses. We are also maintaining our expected annual RIS investment spread of 90 to 115 basis points in 2021. 
For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 5% to 7% annually, roughly consistent with the natural runoff of this legacy business. While the top line continues to decline, we are widening our adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. 
Finally, we are also maintaining the life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 50% to 55% in 2021. While COVID-19-related life claims are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2021, this will be more than offset by the benefit from a lower approved policyholder dividend scale. 
Now let's look at our non-U.S. businesses near-term guidance on Page 12, which is presented on a reported basis for adjusted earnings and PFOs and on a constant currency basis for sales and AUM. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate double-digit growth in 2021, followed by mid- to high single-digit growth in '22 and '23. 
In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid single-digit growth, we are expecting adjusted earnings to be essentially flat in 2021, increasing to mid single-digit growth in '22 and '23. Our Latin America business has been the most negatively impacted by COVID-19. And the environment remains less certain as vaccine protocols are still emerging. Given this backdrop, we expect adjusted PFOs to have high single to low double-digit annual growth over the near term. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings to grow high teens, aided by favorable FX impacts of approximately $25 million. 
For the first quarter, adjusted earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2020 with gradual improvement, particularly in the second half of the year. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect Latin America's adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels. 
In contrast to Latin America, EMEA had a very strong 2020, benefiting from lower utilization in group Medical and accident and health businesses due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Regarding the top line, we expect EMEA sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid- to high single digits over the near term. Given the unsustainable benefit ratio in 2020, we expect EMEA's adjusted earnings to grow low to mid-single digits against the more appropriate baseline year of 2019. 
Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, fulfilling our financial commitments to shareholders and keeping our promises to customers. Our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment and come out stronger. We are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company, will continue to create long-term, sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And we would use it for share repurchases, common dividends and strategic acquisitions that clear a risk-adjusted hurdle rates. So no change there. And that's why we also announced in December that our Board had approved a [$3] billion buyback authorization. We repurchased 571 million of MetLife shares in the fourth quarter. In total, for the year, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion. And so far in 2021, we've repurchased another 434 million shares. So we still have roughly $2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. We would expect to complete the new $3 billion authorization in 2021. 
And look, I think we've also built a track record here of being deliberate in how we manage capital. So expect that once we complete the current authorization, we will review, assess the environment and then we will have a discussion with our Board about potentially a new authorization.

So for dental, we did see a significant dip as COVID hit and the dental offices were closed. And as you recall at the time, because of lack of availability of services, we did set up an unearned premium reserve back in the second quarter. From a utilization perspective, we did expect some sort of catch-up effect or pent-up demand. And we did see some of that in the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, that kind of pulled back. And in particular, it's pulled back for preventative services, so think regular checkups, cleaning, et cetera. And as we go into Q1 for dental, we're still seeing some softness in that utilization. So it is coming in below expectations, again, driven by those preventative services. So that's kind of the dental picture last year and coming into this quarter in terms of what we have visibility into. 
For disability, just let's dimensionalize the book for you. So disability is about 12% of our PFO. 1/3 of that book is short-term disability and 2/3 is long term disability. So for the FTD book, it's not really a macro unemployment story. It's really all about injuries and minor surgeries, et cetera. And what we've seen in that book last year and what we continue to see this year, so far, is the rising COVID claims have been basically offset by a decrease in some of the other claims with respect to injuries and surgeries. So it's basically flat on the STD portion of the book. 
The LTD portion of the book is -- continues to be favorable. Now if past recessions are any guide, you would expect to see some impact in terms of frequency and recoveries on the LTD book, we typically see those impacts coming in with a lag. We continue to monitor this very carefully, but we're not yet seeing any unfavorability, but we're seeing favorability rather in terms of frequency for the LTV book so far."

And just to help reconcile and reiterate some of the things I just said in my opening remarks. We gave a scenario back in Q1 that assumed an extension really of the March 31 macroeconomic conditions. And then as Steve articulated in that call, some assumptions around credit losses and downgrades. So what's different, right? As we said, market conditions have improved, interest rates are higher, equity and credit markets are resilient. And as a result, we've seen limited credit losses with the portfolio. And it's -- but notwithstanding the fact that environment remains uncertain here. So that's kind of one. 
The other thing is we have gone through as a result of those macro factors and kind of completing our year-end cash flow testing requirements and the final update for our VA principal-based reserving in New York. And as a result, we expect our combined NAIC-RBC ratio to remain above our target. And again, I'd just say that's a real testament to the team's approach and proactive approach to ALM and hedging. So therefore, we -- our outlook for our cash flow guidance stays intact. So maybe Steve, can give some color on credit outlook?"

Since then, we've seen, obviously, the Fed is really playing an active role in the markets. We've seen fiscal stimulus. And so the markets continue to trundle along. However, what I'd say on all of that is our watchword continues to be one of caution in these markets. Again, some of the fundamentals are positive. The economic recovery continues -- seems to be continuing, although a lot of it is going to be based on the vaccine rollout now and what happens there. I look at some of the actions we made over the past 9 months or so, continuing to really manage the portfolio, particularly in those sectors that we thought were more exposed in this economic environment. And we're very pleased with how we are positioned today. But again, we're cautious. And we look at spreads in the market today. Spreads are very tight. And it's not clear that the return we're getting, particularly in the public fixed income markets, really matches the risk there. So we are cautious. We really continue to favor high-quality names in the public markets. And most importantly, we continue to move to private assets and then private markets, which are a strength of ours and really do continue to show relative value and better risk reward trade-offs that we see in a number of the private markets. And that's where we're continuing to put the majority of our new investment flows."

Our value proposition is resonating with our customers and intermediaries. And our 2020 results, full year had a 5% PFO growth, and I would remind you that includes about 1 point of headwind from the dental premium discount that we provided in the second quarter. So this is -- the results, we're really pleased with, especially in the context of a challenging external environment. But looking forward, in terms of our confidence in the outlook, we talked about Versant. And we -- the strategic fit is there. We continue to see a very good reaction from our customers and intermediaries about Versant. And the integration is well underway. We continue to see very strong persistency across our book, and rate actions that have been consistent with our expectations.   In the jumbo market, which was light in 2020, the activity has returned in 2021. And we are kind of winning our fair share. So we are expecting to see strong sales figures coming into Q1. 
And then finally, if you think about our outlook, I would say, what's coming into sharp focus here is the increasing importance of the investments we have been making and continue to make in our capabilities broadly and specifically, our digital capabilities to kind of meet changing needs of our customers. And this is where our scale and ability to invest is paying off dividends. So to give you just a sense of that, in voluntary PFOs, we saw a 20% growth in our PFOs in 2020 over '19, and we're expecting a similar growth in '21. Those numbers compound. So our 2020 PFOs in voluntary were more than double our 2017 numbers. But this is a big ship to move. And hence, kind of the guidance is, we think, is the right one, beyond '21."

No matter which lens you used to look at MetLife's performance, the fourth quarter, full year 2020 or the progress we've made toward our Next Horizon strategy, the portrait that emerges is one of a resilient co",1357,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. No matter which lens you used to look at MetLife's performance, the fourth quarter, full year 2020 or the progress we've made toward our Next Horizon strategy, the portrait that emerges is one of a resilient company with consistent execution that delivers for its stakeholders. 
The year 2020 was an especially unforgiving environment for life insurers, marked by the worst pandemic in a century, record low interest rates and extreme market volatility. And yet at MetLife, by reducing and diversifying our risk, controlling expenses, staying true to our investment principles and executing on our capital deployment philosophy, we overcame these challenges to produce strong earnings, cash and book value per share growth. 
Let's begin with our fourth quarter 2020 results. As you saw last night, we delivered quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $2.03 per share. One of the primary drivers was the exceptionally strong returns we earned on our private equity portfolio, which has long been an important source of value creation for MetLife. 
Overall, adjusted earnings, excluding notable, rose 30% year-over-year. Just as noteworthy during the quarter was the resilience of our business in the face of COVID-19. MetLife's balanced risk exposure across the spectrum of mortality, morbidity and longevity was clearly evident in the quarter and the year. Certain parts of our business experienced significant adverse mortality, such as Group Life and Mexico. But those effects were more than offset by lower utilization in group and EMEA and favorable underwriting in MetLife Holdings. We believe the strong diversification of our businesses represents a meaningful differentiator for MetLife and the current crisis and beyond. 
If we look at 2020 as a whole, some additional attributes of MetLife's culture, strategy and performance come into view. I must begin by commending the way MetLife's people stepped up for each other and our customers during the pandemic. It is our very purpose as a company to provide financial protection and support for people during lives most de-stabilizing moments. The pandemic was one of those moments for so many people who rely on MetLife, and we were pleased to go above and beyond for them and for our broader communities. 
Between premium credits and contributions from the MetLife Foundation, we provided more than $0.25 billion of relief to help people cope with COVID-19. What enabled us to preserve our financial strength through the crisis was having the right strategy and an unwavering commitment to execution. We are a less interest-sensitive company than we used to be. In a year where the 10-year treasury spent 9 months below 1%, we delivered an adjusted return on equity, excluding notable, of 12.3%. And the positive earnings impact from volume growth significantly outweighed the drag from lower recurring investment income. 
That volume growth showed up in a number of ways. We recorded our second highest year of pension risk transfer sales ever. Our stable value sales jumped significantly, helping our reported liability balances within Retirement and Income Solutions to grow by a very strong 14%. And we successfully entered the U.K. longevity reinsurance market where we see the potential for additional deal. 
Our expense discipline, which is one of the most critical levers we control, was exceptional. We promised to deliver a 2020 direct expense ratio of 12.3%. Despite the challenges we faced during the year, our actual direct expense ratio came in at 12% or 30 basis points lower. Year-over-year, this represents an enterprise-wide direct expense reduction of roughly $300 million, all while continuing to make critical technology investments to improve the customer experience. 
Our cash generation, the ultimate measure of value creation, was strong. We ended the year with $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding company. This is well above the top end of our target buffer and comes during a year when we deployed approximately $4.5 billion toward common stock dividends, share repurchases and accretive M&A, in addition to continuing to invest in new business growth. 
M&A remains a strategic asset for MetLife and a key tool as we evolve our portfolio too in the future. For example, we have long had the premier Group Benefits platform in the life insurance space and continue to deepen our competitive advantage in this highly profitable business. In 2019, we announced a suite of attractive new voluntary benefit, digital wealth, health savings accounts and pet insurance. In 2020, we grew Group Benefits adjusted PFOs by 5% and positioned the business for double-digit adjusted PFO growth in 2021 with the acquisition of Versant Health. And in the second quarter of this year, we expect to close on the sale of MetLife Auto & Home to Farmers Insurance. This transaction includes a 10-year strategic partnership that allows each company to do what it does best, Farmers to manufacture high-quality P&C products and MetLife to distribute those products through the 3,800 employers in our U.S. Group Benefits network. 
At MetLife, the process of planting and pruning to ensure we have the optimal business mix is nothing new. In 2020, we closed on the sale of our Hong Kong business, sold our Argentina annuity business and agreed to sell our Russia business, which closed last month. I am so proud of what the team at MetLife has been able to accomplish during an atmosphere of disruption and chaos. 
I have heard 2020 referred to as a loss year. For MetLife, it was anything but. We seized on the opportunities in front of us and we will use our momentum as a springboard to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. Consider our P&C divestiture. We expect the accretion benefits will start to materialize in 2021 and will drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2022. 
If we pull back further and look at MetLife's performance relative to our Next Horizon strategy and to the commitments we made at our Investor Day in December 2019, we remain firmly on track. This was far from a given in light of the unprecedented challenges we faced in 2020. As a reminder, 3 of our anchoring commitments were: first, maintain a 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%; second, preserve a $3 billion to $4 billion cash buffer; and third, generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over 5 years. We are confident in our ability to achieve each of these commitments. 
As you know, based on market conditions at the end of March, we discussed a scenario in which our free cash flow ratio could fall below our 2-year average target range of 65% to 75%. As John will discuss later, this is not a scenario we currently contemplate, and we are affirming a 65% to 75% target range for our near-term outlook. As I mentioned earlier, the cash balance at our holding companies at the end of the year totaled $4.5 billion. Keep in mind that we expect to receive $3.5 billion in net cash as soon as our P&C divestiture closes. 
And perhaps most impressive, given the economic backdrop, we remain on course to generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over the 5-year period from 2020 through 2024, an amount equal to more than 40% of our current market cap. 
We believe that no matter which lens you use, the evidence of MetLife's transformation is clear. It begins with our purpose of building a more confident future for all. By inspiring and enabling our people to deliver for our customers, we create value that extends to our shareholders and communities. Our commitment to preserving MetLife's financial strength is really just another way of saying that we will always keep our promises and manage this company sustainably for the long run. This requires discipline, determination and dedication to consistent performance. More than ever, we are convinced that we have the right ingredients to generate strong value creation, a sound strategy, an attractive set of businesses and the management team with a relentless focus on execution. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our financial results in greater detail and to discuss our 2021 outlook."

I will start with the 4Q '20 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $124 million or $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses from higher long-term interest rates and stronger equity markets. For the full year, net income of $5.2 billion, which included net derivative gains of $1.1 billion, was more in line with adjusted earnings. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continue to perform as expected. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. This comparison excludes net favorable notable items of $420 million in the fourth quarter of '19, which were accounted for in Corporate & Other. Excluding such items, adjusted earnings per share were up 33% and 34% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving to the segments. Starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 16% year-over-year driven by expense margins, underwriting and volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 96.3%, which is above the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and included roughly 9 percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. 
For group non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 61.7%, below our annual target range of 72% to 77% due to favorable dental and disability results. The higher dental utilization at the end of the third quarter did not continue in 4Q as we had anticipated, most likely due to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases. 
Turning to top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 10% year-over-year on solid product growth as well as the release of approximately $200 million of the remaining unearned dental premium reserve established in 2Q. Excluding this reserve release, Group Benefits PFO growth fell within our annual target range of 4% to 6%. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 64% year-over-year. The primary drivers were strong investment margins, mostly due to higher variable investment income and volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 177 basis points, up 71 basis points year-over-year primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 104 basis points, up 21 basis points year-over-year primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. 
RIS liability exposures, excluding U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 14.3% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. We completed 5 pension risk transfer deals totaling $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a very strong result. For the full year of 2020, PRT sales were $4.7 billion. As Michel noted, that was our second highest year ever, and we see a good pipeline going forward in 2021. 
Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings of $112 million were up $87 million as fewer miles driven led to favorable auto underwriting margins. As previously announced, we expect to close the sale of the Auto & Home business to Farmers Insurance in the second quarter. The purchase price is not subject to any adjustment for changes to the business performance or economic conditions from the deal announcement through closing. And starting with the first quarter of 2021, Property & Casualty results will be reflected as a divested business in our financial statements and excluded from adjusted earnings for all of 2021. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 45% and 42% on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting, volume growth and expense margins. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Latin America adjusted earnings were down $139 million on a constant currency basis primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting. Elevated COVID-19-related claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $160 million after tax. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 23% and 27% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by favorable expense and underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 58%. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns as well as favorable long-term care underwriting and expense margins. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.6%, higher than the prior year quarter of 55.5% and our annual target range of 50% to 55%. While life claims were elevated due to COVID-19, this was more than offset by favorable long-term care results, which benefited from both lower claim incidents and higher policy termination rates. 
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $198 million. This result is consistent with the expectation that we laid out for the second half of 2020. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the 4 quarters and full year of 2020. VII was $778 million in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had an 8.4% return in the quarter. For the full year of 2020, VII was $1.2 billion and above our 2020 target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This outperformance was primarily attributable to exceptional private equity returns in the second half of the year. 
On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. The attribution of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns for each segment individual portfolio. As a general rule of thumb, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split around 1/3 each. 
Turning to Page 7. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2020 and each quarter of 2020. In 4Q, our direct expense ratio was 12.3%. More significantly, our full year 2020 direct expense ratio was 12% and better than our annual target of 12.3%. Our 5-year goal was to realize at least $800 million of pretax profit margin improvement by 2020, which represents an approximate 200 basis point decline from the 2015 baseline year. We exceeded that goal and reduced our direct expense ratio by 230 basis points, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at December 31, which is down from $7.8 billion at September 30, but still above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the completion of the Versant Health acquisition and the previously discussed redemption of preferred stock. Further, cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividend, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $571 million in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
In 2020, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. So far in 2021, we have repurchased another $434 million of shares with roughly $2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. For the 2-year period, 2019 and 2020, our free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items, totaled 78%, which was above the high end of our 65% to 75% target range. 
In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2020 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2020 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $4.3 billion, while net income was approximately $3.6 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Operating earnings more than offset dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 906% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. 
Before I shift to our near-term outlook on Page 10, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 14 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments updated for 2019. We continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. MetLife invested $3.8 billion of capital in 2019 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 15% with a payback period of 7 years. Also, Pages 15 through 18 provide interest rate assumptions and key sensitivities by line of business. 
Turning back to Slide 10. The macro environment remains uncertain, and we expect COVID-19 impacts to remain with us through the first half of 2021. Also, we expect pent-up demand in certain utilization products to emerge in 2021, albeit more noticeably post first quarter. While we expect interest rates will remain low, the steepening of the yield curve has helped support our investment spreads. Finally, based on the forward curve, the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken. 
Moving to near-term targets. We are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. Despite the headwinds associated with the lower interest rates and the realized gain from the sale of our P&C business, we expect to migrate back to the range over the near-term period. We also expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. In the early part of 2020, we presented a scenario based on economic conditions as of March 31, indicating that such conditions for an extended period of time could pressure our free cash flow ratio. However, since then, macroeconomic conditions, credit markets as well as the company's business mix and performance have been resilient and support our current outlook. 
In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a direct expense ratio below 12.3%, while the sale of the P&C operation will put pressure on this target in 2021 due to its lower expense ratio, we expect to be back below the target starting in 2022 as a result of our commitment to an efficiency mindset. We are raising our VII guidance range in 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We project private equity to remain strong in 2021. Our plan assumes a 12% annual return on an average balance of approximately $9 billion. 
In addition, a portion of our real estate exposure has been shifting from direct ownership to indirect ownership through certain real estate funds. The net result will be a migration of around $100 million of recurring net investment income to VII in 2021 and beyond. Our Corporate & Other adjusted loss is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax, and we are maintaining our effective tax rate of 20% to 22%. 
At the bottom of the page, you will see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31. The takeaway is that the changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored off full year 2020 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. 
Let's start with the U.S. on Page 11. For Group Benefits, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to have low double-digit growth in 2021 aided by the Versant Health acquisition. Following 2021, we expect top line growth to revert to our historical target range of 4% to 6% annually. Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. However, we do expect the first quarter of 2021 Group Life mortality ratio to be above the range as COVID-19-related mortality remains elevated. The group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio of 65.3% in 2020 was extremely favorable driven by unusually low utilization in dental and lower incidence in disability. Although we do not believe the 2020 ratio is sustainable, dental utilization remains low so far in '21. In addition, we are lowering our expected annual group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio to 70% to 75% from 72% to 77%. The reduction reflects our continued shift in business mix towards products with lower benefit ratios, including voluntary products and the addition of Versant Health. 
For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread business and fee-based businesses. We are also maintaining our expected annual RIS investment spread of 90 to 115 basis points in 2021. 
For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 5% to 7% annually, roughly consistent with the natural runoff of this legacy business. While the top line continues to decline, we are widening our adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. Finally, we are also maintaining the life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 50% to 55% in 2021. While COVID-19-related life claims are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2021, this will be more than offset by the benefit from a lower approved policyholder dividend scale. 
Now let's look at our non-U.S. businesses near-term guidance on Page 12, which is presented on a reported basis for adjusted earnings and PFOs and on a constant currency basis for sales and AUM. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate double-digit growth in 2021, followed by mid to high single-digit growth in '22 and '23. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to be essentially flat in 2021, increasing the mid-single-digit growth in '22 and '23. 
Our Latin America business has been the most negatively impacted by COVID-19. And the environment remains less certain as vaccine protocols are still emerging. Given this backdrop, we expect adjusted PFOs to have high single to low double-digit annual growth over the near term. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings to grow high teens aided by favorable FX impacts of approximately $25 million. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2020 with gradual improvement, particularly in the second half of the year. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect Latin America's adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels. 
In contrast to Latin America, EMEA had a very strong 2020, benefiting from lower utilization in group medical and accident and health businesses due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Regarding the top line, we expect EMEA sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid to high single digits over the near term. Given the unsustainable benefit ratio in 2020, we expect EMEA's adjusted earnings to grow low to mid-single digits against the more appropriate baseline year of 2019. 
Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, fulfilling our financial commitments to shareholders and keeping our promises to customers. Our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment and come out stronger. We are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company will continue to create long-term, sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And we would use it for share repurchases, common dividends and strategic acquisitions that clear a risk-adjusted hurdle rate. So no change there. And that's why we also announced in December that our Board had approved a $3 billion buyback authorization. 
We repurchased $571 million of MetLife shares in the fourth quarter. In total, for the year, we repurchased approximately 1.2 billion. And so far in 2021, we've repurchased another 434 million shares. So we still have roughly 2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. We would expect to complete the new $3 billion authorization in 2021. 
And look, I think we've also built a track record here of being deliberate on how we manage capital. So expect that once we complete the current authorization, we will review, assess the environment and then we would have a discussion with our Board about potentially a new authorization. So I hope that gives you a bit of color in terms of how we would sort of use the proceeds."

I think it's -- we're not immune to low rates, but I think we have a number of diverse set of products and businesses that where some performed well in low rates and others, quite honestly, there is some roll-off reinvest risk.

And as I said before, part of our process in holdings is we take a third-party external perspective of this business. We're working through different combinations, ideas to think about how do we optimize and optimization can be how do we do things better internally to manage this business as well as look for ways that there might be kind of value-enhancing transaction for us and for someone else. 
But no one transaction can be replicated. I think that's certainly one thing we've all learned. I think everyone has a unique situation. And so we're working through -- we work through our own and see if we can find an optimal solution, but we don't have to do anything. And I think that's important.

So for dental, we did see a significant dip as COVID hit and the dental offices were closed. And as you recall at the time, because of lack of availability of services, we did set up an unearned premium reserve back in the second quarter. 
From a utilization perspective, we did expect some sort of catch-up effect or pent-up demand. And we did see some of that in the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, that kind of pulled back. And in particular, it's pulled back for preventative services, so think regular checkups, cleaning, et cetera. And as we go into Q1 for dental, we're still seeing some softness in that utilization. So it is coming in below expectations, again, driven by those preventative services. So that's kind of the dental picture last year and coming into this quarter in terms of what we have visibility into. 
For disability, just let's dimensionalize the book for you. So disability is about 12% of our PFO. 1/3 of that book is short-term disability and 2/3 is long-term disability. So for the STD book, it's not really a macro unemployment story. It's really all about injuries and minor surgeries, et cetera. And what we've seen in that book last year and what we continue to see this year, so far, is the rising COVID claims have been basically offset by a decrease in some of the other claims with respect to injuries and surgeries. So it's basically flat on the STD portion of the book. 
The LTD portion of the book is -- continues to be favorable. Now if past recessions or any guide, you would expect to see some impact in terms of frequency and recoveries. On the LTD book, we typically see those impacts coming in with a lag. We continue to monitor this very carefully, but we're not yet seeing any unfavorability, but we're seeing favorability rather in terms of frequency for the LTD book so far."

Obviously, we put some of that mark-to-market noncash time horizon below the line just because the -- what we're hedging doesn't move in the same direction, so it could be confusing otherwise. And yes, I think as markets rise and you saw equity markets rise significantly, you can think that's where predominantly a level of our losses came.

As we said, market conditions have improved, interest rates are higher, equity and credit markets are resilient. And as a result, we've seen limited credit losses with the portfolio. And it's -- but notwithstanding the fact that environment remains uncertain here. So that's kind of one. 
The other thing is we have gone through as a result of those macro factors and kind of completing our year-end cash flow testing requirements and the final update for our VA principle-based reserving in New York. And as a result, we expect our combined NAIC RBC ratio to remain above our target. And again, I'd just say that's a real testament to the team's approach and proactive approach to ALM and hedging.

However, what I'd say on all of that is our watch word continues to be one of caution in these markets. 
Again, some of the fundamentals are positive. The economic recovery continues -- seems to be continuing, although a lot of it is going to be based on the vaccine rollout now and what happens there. I look at some of the actions we made over the past 9 months or so, continuing to really manage the portfolio, particularly in those sectors that we thought were more exposed in this economic environment. And we're very pleased with how we are positioned today. 
But again, we're cautious. And we look at spreads in the market today. Spreads are very tight. And it's not clear that the return we're getting, particularly in the public fixed income markets really matches the risk there. So we are cautious. We really continue to favor high-quality names in the public markets. And most importantly, we continue to move to private assets and then private markets, which are a strength of ours and really do continue to show relative value and better risk reward trade-offs that we see in a number of the private markets.

Our value proposition is resonating with our customers and intermediaries. And our 2020 results, full year had a 5% PFO growth, and I would remind you that includes about 1 point of headwind from the dental premium discount that we provided in the second quarter. So this is -- the results, we're really pleased with, especially in the context of a challenging external environment. 
But looking forward, in terms of our confidence in the outlook, we talked about Versant. And we -- the strategic fit is there. We continue to see a very good reaction from our customers and intermediaries about Versant. And the integration is well underway. We continue to see very strong persistency across our book and rate actions that have been consistent with our expectations. In the jumbo market, which was light in 2020, the activity has returned in 2021. And we are kind of winning our fair share. So we are expecting to see strong sales figures coming into Q1. 
And then finally, if you think about our outlook, I would say, what's coming into sharp focus here is the increasing importance of the investments we have been making and continue to make in our capabilities broadly and specifically our digital capabilities to kind of meet changing needs of our customers. And this is where our scale and ability to invest is paying off dividends. So to give you just a sense of that, in voluntary PFOs, we saw a 20% growth in our PFOs in 2020 over '19, and we're expecting a similar growth in '21. Those numbers compound. So our 2020 PFOs in voluntary were more than double our 2017 numbers. But this is a big ship to move. And hence, kind of the guidance is, we think, is the right one, beyond '21."

No matter which lens you used to look at MetLife's performance, the fourth quarter, full year 2020 or the progress we've made toward our Next Horizon strategy, the portrait that emerges is one of a resilient co",1357,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. No matter which lens you used to look at MetLife's performance, the fourth quarter, full year 2020 or the progress we've made toward our Next Horizon strategy, the portrait that emerges is one of a resilient company with consistent execution that delivers for its stakeholders. 
The year 2020 was an especially unforgiving environment for life insurers, marked by the worst pandemic in a century, record low interest rates and extreme market volatility. And yet at MetLife, by reducing and diversifying our risk, controlling expenses, staying true to our investment principles and executing on our capital deployment philosophy, we overcame these challenges to produce strong earnings, cash and book value per share growth. 
Let's begin with our fourth quarter 2020 results. As you saw last night, we delivered quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $2.03 per share. One of the primary drivers was the exceptionally strong returns we earned on our private equity portfolio, which has long been an important source of value creation for MetLife. 
Overall, adjusted earnings, excluding notable, rose 30% year-over-year. Just as noteworthy during the quarter was the resilience of our business in the face of COVID-19. MetLife's balanced risk exposure across the spectrum of mortality, morbidity and longevity was clearly evident in the quarter and the year. Certain parts of our business experienced significant adverse mortality, such as Group Life and Mexico. But those effects were more than offset by lower utilization in group and EMEA and favorable underwriting in MetLife Holdings. We believe the strong diversification of our businesses represents a meaningful differentiator for MetLife and the current crisis and beyond. 
If we look at 2020 as a whole, some additional attributes of MetLife's culture, strategy and performance come into view. I must begin by commending the way MetLife's people stepped up for each other and our customers during the pandemic. It is our very purpose as a company to provide financial protection and support for people during lives most de-stabilizing moments. The pandemic was one of those moments for so many people who rely on MetLife, and we were pleased to go above and beyond for them and for our broader communities. 
Between premium credits and contributions from the MetLife Foundation, we provided more than $0.25 billion of relief to help people cope with COVID-19. What enabled us to preserve our financial strength through the crisis was having the right strategy and an unwavering commitment to execution. We are a less interest-sensitive company than we used to be. In a year where the 10-year treasury spent 9 months below 1%, we delivered an adjusted return on equity, excluding notable, of 12.3%. And the positive earnings impact from volume growth significantly outweighed the drag from lower recurring investment income. 
That volume growth showed up in a number of ways. We recorded our second highest year of pension risk transfer sales ever. Our stable value sales jumped significantly, helping our reported liability balances within Retirement and Income Solutions to grow by a very strong 14%. And we successfully entered the U.K. longevity reinsurance market where we see the potential for additional deal. 
Our expense discipline, which is one of the most critical levers we control, was exceptional. We promised to deliver a 2020 direct expense ratio of 12.3%. Despite the challenges we faced during the year, our actual direct expense ratio came in at 12% or 30 basis points lower. Year-over-year, this represents an enterprise-wide direct expense reduction of roughly $300 million, all while continuing to make critical technology investments to improve the customer experience. 
Our cash generation, the ultimate measure of value creation, was strong. We ended the year with $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding company. This is well above the top end of our target buffer and comes during a year when we deployed approximately $4.5 billion toward common stock dividends, share repurchases and accretive M&A, in addition to continuing to invest in new business growth. 
M&A remains a strategic asset for MetLife and a key tool as we evolve our portfolio too in the future. For example, we have long had the premier Group Benefits platform in the life insurance space and continue to deepen our competitive advantage in this highly profitable business. In 2019, we announced a suite of attractive new voluntary benefit, digital wealth, health savings accounts and pet insurance. In 2020, we grew Group Benefits adjusted PFOs by 5% and positioned the business for double-digit adjusted PFO growth in 2021 with the acquisition of Versant Health. And in the second quarter of this year, we expect to close on the sale of MetLife Auto & Home to Farmers Insurance. This transaction includes a 10-year strategic partnership that allows each company to do what it does best, Farmers to manufacture high-quality P&C products and MetLife to distribute those products through the 3,800 employers in our U.S. Group Benefits network. 
At MetLife, the process of planting and pruning to ensure we have the optimal business mix is nothing new. In 2020, we closed on the sale of our Hong Kong business, sold our Argentina annuity business and agreed to sell our Russia business, which closed last month. I am so proud of what the team at MetLife has been able to accomplish during an atmosphere of disruption and chaos. 
I have heard 2020 referred to as a loss year. For MetLife, it was anything but. We seized on the opportunities in front of us and we will use our momentum as a springboard to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. Consider our P&C divestiture. We expect the accretion benefits will start to materialize in 2021 and will drive double-digit earnings per share growth in 2022. 
If we pull back further and look at MetLife's performance relative to our Next Horizon strategy and to the commitments we made at our Investor Day in December 2019, we remain firmly on track. This was far from a given in light of the unprecedented challenges we faced in 2020. As a reminder, 3 of our anchoring commitments were: first, maintain a 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%; second, preserve a $3 billion to $4 billion cash buffer; and third, generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over 5 years. We are confident in our ability to achieve each of these commitments. 
As you know, based on market conditions at the end of March, we discussed a scenario in which our free cash flow ratio could fall below our 2-year average target range of 65% to 75%. As John will discuss later, this is not a scenario we currently contemplate, and we are affirming a 65% to 75% target range for our near-term outlook. As I mentioned earlier, the cash balance at our holding companies at the end of the year totaled $4.5 billion. Keep in mind that we expect to receive $3.5 billion in net cash as soon as our P&C divestiture closes. 
And perhaps most impressive, given the economic backdrop, we remain on course to generate approximately $20 billion of free cash flow over the 5-year period from 2020 through 2024, an amount equal to more than 40% of our current market cap. 
We believe that no matter which lens you use, the evidence of MetLife's transformation is clear. It begins with our purpose of building a more confident future for all. By inspiring and enabling our people to deliver for our customers, we create value that extends to our shareholders and communities. Our commitment to preserving MetLife's financial strength is really just another way of saying that we will always keep our promises and manage this company sustainably for the long run. This requires discipline, determination and dedication to consistent performance. More than ever, we are convinced that we have the right ingredients to generate strong value creation, a sound strategy, an attractive set of businesses and the management team with a relentless focus on execution. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our financial results in greater detail and to discuss our 2021 outlook."

I will start with the 4Q '20 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook.

I will start with the 4Q '20 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update on our cash and capital positions and more detail on our near-term outlook. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year. Net income in the quarter was $124 million or $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses from higher long-term interest rates and stronger equity markets. For the full year, net income of $5.2 billion, which included net derivative gains of $1.1 billion, was more in line with adjusted earnings. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continue to perform as expected. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. This comparison excludes net favorable notable items of $420 million in the fourth quarter of '19, which were accounted for in Corporate & Other. Excluding such items, adjusted earnings per share were up 33% and 34% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving to the segments. Starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 16% year-over-year driven by expense margins, underwriting and volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 96.3%, which is above the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and included roughly 9 percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. 
For group non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 61.7%, below our annual target range of 72% to 77% due to favorable dental and disability results. The higher dental utilization at the end of the third quarter did not continue in 4Q as we had anticipated, most likely due to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases. 
Turning to top line. Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 10% year-over-year on solid product growth as well as the release of approximately $200 million of the remaining unearned dental premium reserve established in 2Q. Excluding this reserve release, Group Benefits PFO growth fell within our annual target range of 4% to 6%. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 64% year-over-year. The primary drivers were strong investment margins, mostly due to higher variable investment income and volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 177 basis points, up 71 basis points year-over-year primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 104 basis points, up 21 basis points year-over-year primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. 
RIS liability exposures, excluding U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 14.3% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. We completed 5 pension risk transfer deals totaling $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a very strong result. For the full year of 2020, PRT sales were $4.7 billion. As Michel noted, that was our second highest year ever, and we see a good pipeline going forward in 2021. 
Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings of $112 million were up $87 million as fewer miles driven led to favorable auto underwriting margins. As previously announced, we expect to close the sale of the Auto & Home business to Farmers Insurance in the second quarter. The purchase price is not subject to any adjustment for changes to the business performance or economic conditions from the deal announcement through closing. And starting with the first quarter of 2021, Property & Casualty results will be reflected as a divested business in our financial statements and excluded from adjusted earnings for all of 2021. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 45% and 42% on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting, volume growth and expense margins. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Latin America adjusted earnings were down $139 million on a constant currency basis primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting. Elevated COVID-19-related claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $160 million after tax. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 23% and 27% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by favorable expense and underwriting margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 58%. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns as well as favorable long-term care underwriting and expense margins. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.6%, higher than the prior year quarter of 55.5% and our annual target range of 50% to 55%. While life claims were elevated due to COVID-19, this was more than offset by favorable long-term care results, which benefited from both lower claim incidents and higher policy termination rates. 
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $198 million. This result is consistent with the expectation that we laid out for the second half of 2020. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the 4 quarters and full year of 2020. VII was $778 million in the fourth quarter. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had an 8.4% return in the quarter. For the full year of 2020, VII was $1.2 billion and above our 2020 target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This outperformance was primarily attributable to exceptional private equity returns in the second half of the year. 
On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. The attribution of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns for each segment individual portfolio. As a general rule of thumb, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split around 1/3 each. 
Turning to Page 7. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2020 and each quarter of 2020. In 4Q, our direct expense ratio was 12.3%. More significantly, our full year 2020 direct expense ratio was 12% and better than our annual target of 12.3%. Our 5-year goal was to realize at least $800 million of pretax profit margin improvement by 2020, which represents an approximate 200 basis point decline from the 2015 baseline year. We exceeded that goal and reduced our direct expense ratio by 230 basis points, clearly demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 8. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at December 31, which is down from $7.8 billion at September 30, but still above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the completion of the Versant Health acquisition and the previously discussed redemption of preferred stock. Further, cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividend, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $571 million in the fourth quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
In 2020, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. So far in 2021, we have repurchased another $434 million of shares with roughly $2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. For the 2-year period, 2019 and 2020, our free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items, totaled 78%, which was above the high end of our 65% to 75% target range. 
In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, we expect our combined 2020 NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. Preliminary 2020 statutory operating earnings for our U.S. companies were approximately $4.3 billion, while net income was approximately $3.6 billion. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Operating earnings more than offset dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 906% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. 
Before I shift to our near-term outlook on Page 10, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 14 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments updated for 2019. We continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. MetLife invested $3.8 billion of capital in 2019 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 15% with a payback period of 7 years. Also, Pages 15 through 18 provide interest rate assumptions and key sensitivities by line of business. 
Turning back to Slide 10. The macro environment remains uncertain, and we expect COVID-19 impacts to remain with us through the first half of 2021. Also, we expect pent-up demand in certain utilization products to emerge in 2021, albeit more noticeably post first quarter. While we expect interest rates will remain low, the steepening of the yield curve has helped support our investment spreads. Finally, based on the forward curve, the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken. 
Moving to near-term targets. We are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 12% to 14%. Despite the headwinds associated with the lower interest rates and the realized gain from the sale of our P&C business, we expect to migrate back to the range over the near-term period. We also expect to maintain our 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings. In the early part of 2020, we presented a scenario based on economic conditions as of March 31, indicating that such conditions for an extended period of time could pressure our free cash flow ratio. However, since then, macroeconomic conditions, credit markets as well as the company's business mix and performance have been resilient and support our current outlook. 
In addition, we remain committed to maintaining a direct expense ratio below 12.3%, while the sale of the P&C operation will put pressure on this target in 2021 due to its lower expense ratio, we expect to be back below the target starting in 2022 as a result of our commitment to an efficiency mindset. We are raising our VII guidance range in 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We project private equity to remain strong in 2021. Our plan assumes a 12% annual return on an average balance of approximately $9 billion. 
In addition, a portion of our real estate exposure has been shifting from direct ownership to indirect ownership through certain real estate funds. The net result will be a migration of around $100 million of recurring net investment income to VII in 2021 and beyond. Our Corporate & Other adjusted loss is expected to remain at $650 million to $750 million after tax, and we are maintaining our effective tax rate of 20% to 22%. 
At the bottom of the page, you will see expected key interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, which incorporates the forward curve as of December 31. The takeaway is that the changes in interest rates are expected to have a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near term. So now I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Our comments will be anchored off full year 2020 reported results in our QFS, unless otherwise noted. 
Let's start with the U.S. on Page 11. For Group Benefits, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to have low double-digit growth in 2021 aided by the Versant Health acquisition. Following 2021, we expect top line growth to revert to our historical target range of 4% to 6% annually. Regarding underwriting, we expect the annual Group Life mortality ratio to be between 85% to 90%. However, we do expect the first quarter of 2021 Group Life mortality ratio to be above the range as COVID-19-related mortality remains elevated. The group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio of 65.3% in 2020 was extremely favorable driven by unusually low utilization in dental and lower incidence in disability. Although we do not believe the 2020 ratio is sustainable, dental utilization remains low so far in '21. In addition, we are lowering our expected annual group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio to 70% to 75% from 72% to 77%. The reduction reflects our continued shift in business mix towards products with lower benefit ratios, including voluntary products and the addition of Versant Health. 
For RIS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread business and fee-based businesses. We are also maintaining our expected annual RIS investment spread of 90 to 115 basis points in 2021. 
For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline between 5% to 7% annually, roughly consistent with the natural runoff of this legacy business. While the top line continues to decline, we are widening our adjusted earnings guidance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. Finally, we are also maintaining the life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 50% to 55% in 2021. While COVID-19-related life claims are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2021, this will be more than offset by the benefit from a lower approved policyholder dividend scale. 
Now let's look at our non-U.S. businesses near-term guidance on Page 12, which is presented on a reported basis for adjusted earnings and PFOs and on a constant currency basis for sales and AUM. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate double-digit growth in 2021, followed by mid to high single-digit growth in '22 and '23. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single-digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to be essentially flat in 2021, increasing the mid-single-digit growth in '22 and '23. 
Our Latin America business has been the most negatively impacted by COVID-19. And the environment remains less certain as vaccine protocols are still emerging. Given this backdrop, we expect adjusted PFOs to have high single to low double-digit annual growth over the near term. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings to grow high teens aided by favorable FX impacts of approximately $25 million. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2020 with gradual improvement, particularly in the second half of the year. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect Latin America's adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels. 
In contrast to Latin America, EMEA had a very strong 2020, benefiting from lower utilization in group medical and accident and health businesses due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. Regarding the top line, we expect EMEA sales and adjusted PFOs to grow mid to high single digits over the near term. Given the unsustainable benefit ratio in 2020, we expect EMEA's adjusted earnings to grow low to mid-single digits against the more appropriate baseline year of 2019. 
Let me conclude by saying MetLife delivered another strong quarter to close out a very strong year, fulfilling our financial commitments to shareholders and keeping our promises to customers. Our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment and come out stronger. We are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company will continue to create long-term, sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

So let me start by just reiterating and you've heard me say this many times that we believe excess capital above and beyond what's required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders. And we would use it for share repurchases, common dividends and strategic acquisitions that clear a risk-adjusted hurdle rate. So no change there. And that's why we also announced in December that our Board had approved a $3 billion buyback authorization. 
We repurchased $571 million of MetLife shares in the fourth quarter. In total, for the year, we repurchased approximately 1.2 billion. And so far in 2021, we've repurchased another 434 million shares. So we still have roughly 2.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. We would expect to complete the new $3 billion authorization in 2021. 
And look, I think we've also built a track record here of being deliberate on how we manage capital. So expect that once we complete the current authorization, we will review, assess the environment and then we would have a discussion with our Board about potentially a new authorization. So I hope that gives you a bit of color in terms of how we would sort of use the proceeds."

And we talked about this in the third quarter from things like, we had some higher prepayment activity on some RMBS securities that were purchased at a discount several years ago. We actually saw that continue into the fourth quarter. So all in all, the way we see it is we're able to maintain spreads despite the low rate environment. I think it's -- we're not immune to low rates, but I think we have a number of diverse set of products and businesses that where some performed well in low rates and others, quite honestly, there is some roll-off reinvest risk.

And as I said before, part of our process in holdings is we take a third-party external perspective of this business. We're working through different combinations, ideas to think about how do we optimize and optimization can be how do we do things better internally to manage this business as well as look for ways that there might be kind of value-enhancing transaction for us and for someone else. 
But no one transaction can be replicated. I think that's certainly one thing we've all learned. I think everyone has a unique situation. And so we're working through -- we work through our own and see if we can find an optimal solution, but we don't have to do anything. And I think that's important. We have some pretty, I'd say, best-in-class capabilities to manage the runoff. But nonetheless, we continue to take a third-party and external perspective."

And we're strong in [ banker ]. We've got 120-plus [ banker ] relationships that run for quite extended period with a lot of depth there. We also are a very strong player in the IA channel, where our relationship with some of our federated agents run many, many, many years and similar to the large agencies as well. In addition, we have a fantastic resilient career agency channel, which we've been investing in. And for the past couple of years, we've actually made significant investments in that channel for growth as well. 
And similarly, on the product side, we're also well diversified with focus on annuities and as well as A&H and as well as life. And so we play in all segments of that too. So that's a pretty different orientation with regards to that. Now certainly, the other Asia also helps to that story because we are in a number of markets where the growth is pretty aggressive. And you saw that play out over the last couple of years, and that's -- and we expect that to play out down the road as well."

So for dental, we did see a significant dip as COVID hit and the dental offices were closed. And as you recall at the time, because of lack of availability of services, we did set up an unearned premium reserve back in the second quarter. 
From a utilization perspective, we did expect some sort of catch-up effect or pent-up demand. And we did see some of that in the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, that kind of pulled back. And in particular, it's pulled back for preventative services, so think regular checkups, cleaning, et cetera. And as we go into Q1 for dental, we're still seeing some softness in that utilization. So it is coming in below expectations, again, driven by those preventative services. So that's kind of the dental picture last year and coming into this quarter in terms of what we have visibility into. 
For disability, just let's dimensionalize the book for you. So disability is about 12% of our PFO. 1/3 of that book is short-term disability and 2/3 is long-term disability. So for the STD book, it's not really a macro unemployment story. It's really all about injuries and minor surgeries, et cetera. And what we've seen in that book last year and what we continue to see this year, so far, is the rising COVID claims have been basically offset by a decrease in some of the other claims with respect to injuries and surgeries. So it's basically flat on the STD portion of the book. 
The LTD portion of the book is -- continues to be favorable. Now if past recessions or any guide, you would expect to see some impact in terms of frequency and recoveries. On the LTD book, we typically see those impacts coming in with a lag. We continue to monitor this very carefully, but we're not yet seeing any unfavorability, but we're seeing favorability rather in terms of frequency for the LTD book so far."

As we said, market conditions have improved, interest rates are higher, equity and credit markets are resilient. And as a result, we've seen limited credit losses with the portfolio. And it's -- but notwithstanding the fact that environment remains uncertain here. So that's kind of one. 
The other thing is we have gone through as a result of those macro factors and kind of completing our year-end cash flow testing requirements and the final update for our VA principle-based reserving in New York. And as a result, we expect our combined NAIC RBC ratio to remain above our target. And again, I'd just say that's a real testament to the team's approach and proactive approach to ALM and hedging.

However, what I'd say on all of that is our watch word continues to be one of caution in these markets. 
Again, some of the fundamentals are positive. The economic recovery continues -- seems to be continuing, although a lot of it is going to be based on the vaccine rollout now and what happens there. I look at some of the actions we made over the past 9 months or so, continuing to really manage the portfolio, particularly in those sectors that we thought were more exposed in this economic environment. And we're very pleased with how we are positioned today. 
But again, we're cautious. And we look at spreads in the market today. Spreads are very tight. And it's not clear that the return we're getting, particularly in the public fixed income markets really matches the risk there. So we are cautious. We really continue to favor high-quality names in the public markets. And most importantly, we continue to move to private assets and then private markets, which are a strength of ours and really do continue to show relative value and better risk reward trade-offs that we see in a number of the private markets.

So this is -- the results, we're really pleased with, especially in the context of a challenging external environment. 
But looking forward, in terms of our confidence in the outlook, we talked about Versant. And we -- the strategic fit is there. We continue to see a very good reaction from our customers and intermediaries about Versant. And the integration is well underway. We continue to see very strong persistency across our book and rate actions that have been consistent with our expectations. In the jumbo market, which was light in 2020, the activity has returned in 2021. And we are kind of winning our fair share. So we are expecting to see strong sales figures coming into Q1. 
And then finally, if you think about our outlook, I would say, what's coming into sharp focus here is the increasing importance of the investments we have been making and continue to make in our capabilities broadly and specifically our digital capabilities to kind of meet changing needs of our customers. And this is where our scale and ability to invest is paying off dividends. So to give you just a sense of that, in voluntary PFOs, we saw a 20% growth in our PFOs in 2020 over '19, and we're expecting a similar growth in '21. Those numbers compound. So our 2020 PFOs in voluntary were more than double our 2017 numbers. But this is a big ship to move. And hence, kind of the guidance is, we think, is the right one, beyond '21."

By the numbers, we reported first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $2 billion or $2.20 per share, up 39% from $1.58 a year ago. The primary driver was exceptionally strong variable investment income, or VII, partially offset by elevated COVID-19 related claims. 
Net income for the quarter was $290 million, down from $4.4 billion a year ago, primarily due to losses on derivatives that protect our balance sheet from declines in equity markets and interest rates. Such gains and losses are the result of GAAP accounting rules that require us to mark certain of our derivative hedges to market through net income without similar treatment for the assets and liabilities being hedged. We believe the economics and the free cash flow of our business are captured in adjusted earnings. 
Regarding variable investment income, the key driver of gains in the first quarter was our private equity portfolio, which delivered returns of 13.3%. Recall that private equity returns are reported on a 1 quarter lag. The strong performance in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by 3 private equity sectors: domestic leveraged buyout funds, European LBOs and venture capital. 
In the second half of 2020, IPOs from U.S.-based LBOs and venture capital firms more than doubled over the prior year, and the market rewarded many entrants with strong valuation. Venture capital was our best performer across the 3 subsectors, largely due to the market's appetite for tech companies. The C deal volumes hit a record in 2020, and the increase in digital activity, spurred by the pandemic, drove attractive valuations for early-stage tech firms positioned to capitalize on that trend. 
While our private equity portfolio return in the quarter was robust, it was in line with industry benchmarks, most notably, Cambridge Associates Private Equity Index. We are confident this asset class will continue to be a significant source of alpha format life in the future. 
Turning to the performance of our business segments. I'll begin with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings were down 70% year-over-year on elevated COVID-19 life claims. In the U.S., overall, COVID-19 related deaths were 40% higher in the first quarter of 2021 than they were in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
For MetLife, our group life mortality ratio was 106.3%, well above the high end of our target range of 85% to 90%, with approximately 17 percentage points attributable to COVID-19 claims. The top line performance of the Group Benefits business was strong, with sales up 45% year-over-year. We are doing especially well with national accounts. And if trends hold, we expect the group business to deliver a record sales year. Adjusted PFO growth was also solid at 16% with the addition of Versant Health being a large contributor. 
In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 92% year-over-year, driven by higher VII. Beyond VII, adjusted earnings were still strong on favorable underwriting and volume growth. 
Looking ahead, we continue to see a robust pension risk transfer pipeline. Rising equity markets and interest rates have improved pension plan funding levels and lowered the cost for plan sponsors to transact with an insurer. 
Within Asia, we saw a similar earnings pattern to RIS. Adjusted earnings were up 70% year-over-year on a constant currency basis driven by higher VII. However, even allowing for VII, adjusted earnings were strong driven by favorable foreign exchange rates, volume growth and underwriting. Sales in the region were up 12% on a constant currency basis, even with the COVID resurgence in certain markets. 
In Latin America, adjusted earnings were down 57% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the pandemic. COVID related claims in the quarter totaled approximately $150 million, mainly in Mexico. 
In EMEA, adjusted earnings of $71 million were down 11% on a constant currency basis on higher COVID related claims as well as higher expenses compared to the favorable prior year quarter. Sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis, with strong momentum in the U.K. employee benefits space. 
To finish my business segment discussion, I think a theme is clear. If you look past higher VII and mortality in the quarter, the underlying performance of the business was very solid. On the fundamentals, we continue to demonstrate consistent execution with strong earnings power across a range of different economic scenarios. 
Turning to cash and capital management. MetLife ended the first quarter with cash at the holding company of $3.8 billion, near the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. Our 2-year average free cash flow ratio remains within our guidance range of 65% to 75%. Currently, our cash balances are much higher following the receipt of $3.94 billion of proceeds on the sale of our U.S. P&C business. 
During the quarter, we were pleased to return $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders, $1 billion in share repurchases and approximately $400 million in common stock dividends. So far in Q2, we have bought back an additional $210 million of common shares, and we have roughly $1.6 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization. 
Last week, our Board of Directors approved a second quarter 2021 common stock dividend of $0.48 per share, up 4.3% from the first quarter. Over the last decade, we have increased our common dividend at a 10% compound annual growth rate. Our consistent execution continues to generate strong free cash flow that allows us to invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders, all with the goal of driving long-term value creation. 
As we look ahead, we see a path to a brighter future from both an economic and health perspective. In the United States, conditions look promising for a period of employment growth, which is always good for our group business. On the pandemic front, we believe the worst of the underwriting effects on our company are behind us as the vaccine rollout continues to advance. The progress is not yet uniform across the world, and certain areas are still struggling, but the trend line is clear, a slow but steady return to something we can call normalcy. 
While we welcome an improving external environment, we also remain laser-focused on executing our strategy to ensure we are prepared for the post pandemic world. For our customers, we continue to accelerate our digital transformation to meet their evolving needs. 
In Japan, for example, 95% of our policy submissions are now done digitally. For our employees, we will be implementing a more flexible workplace model in Q3, which for most will be a hybrid approach. While our people have performed exceptionally well, working from home during the pandemic, we believe the office will continue to play a critical role in fostering collaboration, innovation and career development. We are equally confident that by incorporating more virtual work into our model, we will enhance productivity gain access to a broader talent pool and strengthen employee engagement. 
To close this morning, I want to emphasize the urgency we are filling up MetLife to keep raising our game. As I said in my annual letter to shareholders, consistent execution is our new baseline. Continuous improvement is our new aspiration and expectation. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John."

I will start with the 1Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. 
Starting on Page 3. We provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the quarter was $290 million or approximately $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net derivative losses as a result of the significant rise in long-term interest rates as well as stronger equity markets in 1Q '21. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continue to perform as expected. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. There were no notable items for either period. Adjusted earnings per share benefited from exceptionally strong returns in our private equity portfolio and were up 39% and 38% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted earnings were down 70% year-over-year, largely driven by unfavorable group life mortality due to elevated COVID-19 related life claims. 
Favorable non-medical health underwriting and volume growth were partial offsets. Overall, results for Group Benefits were mixed. Adjusted earnings were down, but underlying fundamentals, including top line growth and persistency were strong. Group Benefits sales were up 45% year-over-year, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity. 
We believe that we are on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across most products, the addition of Versant Health and roughly 5 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claims experience. I will discuss Group Benefits underwriting in more detail shortly. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 92% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. In addition, elevated COVID-19 mortality and volume growth were positive contributors. RIS investment spreads were 234 basis points up 120 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 88 basis points, up 5 basis points year-over-year primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates. 
RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 12% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. 
With regard to U.K. longevity reinsurance, we have continued to see strong growth since completing our initial transaction in 2Q '20. The notional balance stands at $8.8 billion at March 31, up nearly $5 billion from year-end 2020. 
And as previously announced, first quarter results for Property & Casualty are reflected as a divested business in our quarterly financial statements. The sale of the auto and home business to farmers insurance closed on April 7, and we expect to record an after-tax gain of approximately $1 billion in 2Q '21. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 78% and 70% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 6% and  4% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, with growth across most markets. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 58% and 57% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting, partially offset by the improvement in equity markets. Elevated COVID-19 related claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $150 million after tax. 
Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19 claims to decrease throughout the year, more significantly in the second half, and adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels in 2022, which is consistent with our outlook. 
Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis due to lower single premium immediate annuities to ILS in Chile. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher COVID-19 related claims as well as higher expenses compared to the favorable prior year quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 5% on a constant currency basis, but sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis, due to strong growth in U.K. employee benefits. 
Metlife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 123%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income, largely due to private equity returns. Also, favorable equity markets and long-term care underwriting were positive drivers. Long-term care benefited from higher policy and claim terminations as well as lower claim incidences. 
The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, higher than the prior year quarter of 51% and at the top end of our annual target range of 50% to 55% due to elevated COVID-19 mortality. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $171 million. This result is consistent with our 2021 adjusted loss guidance range of $650 million to $750 million. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.8% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits 1Q '21 underwriting performance on Page 5. There were approximately 200,000 COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S. in the first quarter, the highest single quarter since the pandemic began and up nearly 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition to the higher number of claims, there were more deaths at younger ages below 65, which resulted in increased claim severity. 
Apart from COVID-19, the number of life insurance claims of greater than $2 million nearly doubled versus a typical quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the first quarter, which included roughly 17 percentage points related to COVID-19 life claims. This reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $280 million after tax. 
For group non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 71.1% in the first quarter, with favorable experience across most products. The 1Q '21 ratio was below the prior year quarter of 71.7% and at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%. 
Now let's turn to VII in the quarter on Page 6. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the last 5 quarters, including approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 13.3% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a 1 quarter lag. Our first quarter results were essentially in line with private equity industry benchmarks. While all private equity classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 20% of our PE account balance of $10.3 billion, were the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 25% quarterly return due to a broad increase in tech company valuations. 
On Page 7, first quarter VII of $1.1 billion post tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As noted previously, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. 
VII results in 1Q '21 were more heavily weighted toward RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's portfolio has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters and full year 2020, including 11% in the first quarter of 2021. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. 
In 1Q '21, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline as well as delayed investment spending in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be consistent with our full year outlook. 
Now I will discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.8 billion at March 31, which is down from $4.5 billion at December 31 but well within our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $1 billion in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Looking ahead, we expect holdco cash will be significantly higher in the second quarter as a result of the sale of our auto and home business to farmers insurance. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 392% at year-end 2020 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, excluding our Property & Casualty business, preliminary first quarter 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.5 billion, while statutory net income was approximately $570 million. 
Statutory operating earnings increased by roughly $2.3 billion year-over-year driven by lower VA rider reserves, an increase in interest margins, higher net investment income and lower operating expenses. Statutory net income, excluding our P&C business, increased by roughly $430 million year-over-year driven by higher operating earnings, partially offset by an increase in after-tax derivative losses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital, excluding P&C, was approximately $16.7 billion as of March 31, down 2% compared to December 31. Favorable operating earnings were more than offset by after-tax derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 967% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. 
In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter, which benefited from exceptional private equity returns, solid business fundamentals and ongoing expense discipline. While higher mortality in the U.S. and Mexico dampened adjusted earnings in Group Benefits and Latin America, our financial performance demonstrates the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. 
In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and position us for success. We are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

So we saw the significant increase in the total number of population deaths. And that was accompanied by a secondary effect, which is a severity effect, whereby we did see an increase in the percentage of claims under 65. And those claims, which tend to be for working employees, do have a higher face amount. 
So if you think about it and if you think about the outlook going forward, we're watching that composition very carefully. But I would say that the primary driver in the second quarter is still going to be the frequency, right? So as you know, with the rollout of the vaccine, the COVID related deaths in the population have been declining. If you do any comparison between, say, January average death number to April has been a significant decline. So while we still have a substantial number of deaths coming through, therefore, expect to see an elevated mortality ratio in the second quarter. We do expect the underwriting ratio to come down from its Q1 highs."

This is certainly a good performance, especially given the COVID environment. Even in Japan, we had several prefectures under the state of emergency there during much of Q1. And then the other Asia markets had varying degrees of social distancing measures in place. Clearly, COVID and the resurgence here in Asia is a significant headwind given that the vast majority of our sales are face-to-face. 
However, as I mentioned earlier, the diversity of our channels and products, the strength of our bank partnerships and the strong execution focus of our businesses, that's what powers Metlife sales resiliency even in this tough environment. In addition, we've been making significant investments in digitizing our sales processes, all the way from video conferencing, co-browsing, remote closing, they've certainly aided our performance as well. As Michel mentioned in his opening remarks, 95% of our new sales application submissions in Japan are digital. 
And the other markets are in a similar range as well. For example, in China, almost all our agent onboarding and new business submissions are done digitally. Specifically with regards to Japan, it's, again, 8% up sequentially. And even after taking seasonality into account, our face-to-face channels that sell life and A&H products were quite resilient, while we recorded strong annuity sales growth to the bank channel. 
Clearly, we have strengthened the FX-denominated products and our bank relationships, and that strength shows. Other Asia, 8% up, sequentially up 30% year-over-year. Again, this speaks to, I think, the strength of our market presence across these markets and strong execution across the board. And our digital solutions are also helping us in a big way. 
With regards to the outlook for the rest of the year, we're very comfortable and on track to meet the full guidance of double-digit sales growth."

Again, here, I would just maybe start with sort of our approach and philosophy, which again, is -- has been very consistent and no change there. So we will always look for M&A opportunities that fit our strategy that are accretive over time for our shareholders. We have a constant basis globally through which we evaluate opportunities based on value and cash generation. All M&A opportunities will need to earn more than their cost of capital. And we determine what we're willing to pay for a business by evaluating capital markets, the cost of raising capital and synergies. And acquisition opportunities will need to be more attractive than share repurchases. 
So what we do is we try to achieve a healthy balance between returning cash to our shareholders and investing in attractive future growth through M&A. And I think some of the sort of recent transactions that we've done, such as Versant Health last year, the first acquisition prior to that, Logan Circle a couple of years back, I think those give you a sense of sort of what that sort of approach or strategy that I outlined.

Let me talk a little bit about the overall strategy because we've been investing in private equity for a number of years and have always felt it to be a very strong component of our overall strategy. 
Venture capital, of course, is a significant portion of the portfolio. But basically, we take a look at this portfolio the same way we look at our credit portfolio, our real estate portfolio. It's about diversification, and that's what we've really tried to build in this. 
Again, just sort of recapping some of the numbers. Our PE portfolio produced income of almost $1.3 billion or 13.3% return. Again, venture capital was -- led the way as far as its total return. But think about what was happening in the market, too, with a lot of IPO activity and the like of things that Michel cited in his comments. 
So the important thing is that our returns were attractive across the portfolio. And I'd look at things like our LBO portfolio, both domestically and in Europe. And again, this reflects the diversity that's in the entire portfolio. And when we look to invest, we continue to invest in a diverse way across all the different sectors as well. 
I mean just to give you a little bit more flavor on it, we have over 600 funds that we've invested in. We have almost 200 managers. So again, very broad, very deep exposure across all of the sectors of private equity. 
And again, I think you have to take into consideration what was happening in the environment. And when we think about it, despite the pandemic, equity valuations continued to climb in the fourth quarter. The combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus continue to be major contributors that led to strong equity performance really across all sectors. 
And so I would think about it in that respect that we really think of this as a diversified private equity portfolio. 
Now that all said, we do think that the past quarter was probably something of an anomaly because when we look at our historical experience, at least until this quarter, it has been that our PE returns have always been moderated versus the S&P 500, particularly in high market return quarters. 
So this was an unusual quarter in that respect. And when we think about future returns or relationships, we still think that what we've been saying for the last couple of years as far as our plans go, the kind of low single -- or low double digits, 12% is still the right way for us to think about these returns. Again, it's going to be -- vary quarter-by-quarter, but that's how we think about this on a long-term basis. And again, it just reflects our continued efforts to have a very diversified portfolio across all sectors."

And then Erik was asking a question a little earlier about Asian sales in the Asia region. And I'm still trying to reconcile those numbers with what we've been seeing at other companies, which is sales pressures, flattish premium growth. And Met being -- having a very large proportion of its business in Japan, which is a more mature market, it's just kind of striking to see 12% year-over-year sales growth and then a target of double digit. So if you could flesh that out a little bit more specifically? And what particular other countries are kind of driving growth in other parts of Asia?"

So if you -- if we parse out the total Asia sales into Japan and other Asia, stay with Japan for a minute. Well, sequentially -- and even in the previous calls, right, we've been making steady progress in Japan sales since Q2, right? Q3 was better than Q2 last year. Q4 was better than Q3. And Q1, just a build-off of Q4 from last year. And if you then say, okay, where is this coming from? A couple of things. We have 3 broad product lines, life, NH and annuities. And then we have a couple of channels, right? We've got essentially what I would broadly classify as face-to-face channels. We can go further breakdown of that, but that's not needed for this call and the good news for us is even in this tough environment, our face-to-face channels were pretty resilient from a year-over-year perspective. There's a little bit of pressure on A&H, but our life segment pretty much held flat. And then much of the growth came in from the annuities, which are primarily sold through banks. And in the previous calls, I talked a lot about our advantages in the annuity space of the effects because these are all foreign currency or dollar denominated. And we have many advantages that we bring to the table on that and also the strength of the bank partnerships that we bring to the table as well. 
So because of that, because of this diversification of products and diversification of channels and our lean in on our strengths that's basically contributed to the resiliency of our sales in Japan. 
Now with regards to -- and by the way, this has not been easy. I have to tell you that. But our teams on the ground have done, I think, a fantastic job with regards to that. Now again, this is playing out, right? I can't sit here and say, this is definitive because COVID is a factor that's an ongoing concern across Asia. 
With regards to other Asia, again, very strong sales growth. But remember, last year, the pressure started early outside of Japan, in China, right, because of COVID. And so the year-over-year comparisons look very favorable on the other Asia segment. But again, I think I'd lean more on the strength of our businesses and our market presence in terms of how we've executed this quarter. Korea was very strong in terms of performance. India was also strong in performance from a sales perspective. We've recovered nicely in China, which is a major factor. Again, COVID is still a factor in all these markets. And we continue to stay focused on execution. At the end, that's what it boils down to. I hope that helps."

Second is we did reference that new reclass and real estate funds up into VII. And that probably cost another 4 points of shift. So we really kind of migrate back to the range.

Now obviously, we came in at 11% in Q1. 
A few factors that contributed to this. One is the PFO growth, obviously. And I think there were -- in John's comments, we mentioned some of the impact of participating group life contracts, for example, on that PFO growth. Versant was an important also factor there. Then we had really good expense discipline across our businesses. And we did have also some, I would say, timing related expenses that maybe benefited us by about 25 basis points. 
So our expectation for the second to fourth quarter is that the expense ratio will be consistent with our full year outlook guidance. And as I said, we believe that 12.3% is the right level for us because that allows us to continue to make important investments in our business. So no change in terms of how you should look at the balance of the year."

And as John mentioned, 2021 is shaping up to be a record year for us in terms of Group Benefits. 
I would say the 3 drivers of sales, the first one is a significant uptick in the jumbo activity in national accounts. Now that's coming off low in 2020, but this is our sweet spot. This is where we excel, and we've done exceptionally well this quarter there. I would also remind you, just for jumbo accounts, these sales can be lumpy from year-to-year. 
Beyond that, if you look at products and markets, we've just seen, I would say, strength across the board from a product perspective as well as increased sales in both regional and small. So it's pretty even. 
And then the last driver of sales I would point to is we continue to successfully execute on our enrollment and reenrollment strategy at the work site that we've talked about on prior occasions. So we're seeing pretty strong underlying sales growth there. 
When it comes to PFO growth, which we think is the actual measure that best captures the top line of this business, you really need to peel back from that 16%, 5 points due to these participating contracts. So think about 11 as the underlying growth there, and that is in line with our expectations and in line with our outlook. So we're very pleased with that result as well. 
And the PFO drivers in addition to sales would be strong persistency. We continue to see very high persistency with our customers. And our value proposition is resonating with those customers, and they're doing more business with us. We're getting all of our rate actions at renewals also in line with our expectations. And then also what's driving the PFO number, coming back to that reenrollment strategy, is very disciplined execution of our voluntary strategy in the work site. And so we continue to see those double-digit growth in voluntary in that PFO number."

Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides which address the quarter. They are available on our website. John McCallion is under the weather today. We are going to let him rest his voice, and I will speak to the supplemental slides following Michel's remarks.  
An appendix to the supplemental slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, all of which you should also review. After our prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. [Operator Instructions] 
With that, over to Michel."

As we reported last evening, MetLife delivered very strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021.

As we reported last evening, MetLife delivered very strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Our diverse business mix, sound investment strategy and strong expense discipline combined to generate earnings well above consensus expectations.  
By the numbers, we reported first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $2 billion or $2.20 per share, up 39% from $1.58 a year ago. The primary driver was exceptionally strong variable investment income, or VII, partially offset by elevated COVID-19-related claims.  
Net income for the quarter was $290 million, down from $4.4 billion a year ago, primarily due to losses on derivatives that protect our balance sheet from declines in equity markets and interest rates. Such gains and losses are the result of GAAP accounting rules that require us to mark certain of our derivative hedges to market through net income without similar treatment for the assets and liabilities being hedged. We believe the economics and the free cash flow of our business are captured in adjusted earnings.  
Regarding variable investment income, the key driver of gains in the first quarter was our private equity portfolio, which delivered returns of 13.3%. Recall that private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag. The strong performance in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by 3 private equity sectors: domestic leveraged buyout funds, European LBOs and venture capital.  
In the second half of 2020, IPOs from U.S.-based LBOs and venture capital firms more than doubled over the prior year, and the market rewarded many entrants with strong valuation. Venture capital was our best performer across the 3 subsectors, largely due to the market's appetite for tech companies. VC deal volumes hit a record in 2020, and the increase in digital activity, spurred by the pandemic, drove attractive valuations for early-stage tech firms positioned to capitalize on that trend.  
While our private equity portfolio return in the quarter was robust, it was in line with industry benchmarks, most notably Cambridge Associates Private Equity Index. We are confident this asset class will continue to be a significant source of alpha for MetLife in the future.  
Turning to the performance of our business segments, I'll begin with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings were down 70% year-over-year on elevated COVID-19 life claims. In the U.S., overall, COVID-19-related deaths were 40% higher in the first quarter of 2021 than they were in the fourth quarter of 2020.  
For MetLife, our Group Life mortality ratio was 106.3%, well above the high end of our target range of 85% to 90%, with approximately 17 percentage points attributable to COVID-19 claims. The top line performance of the Group Benefits business was strong with sales up 45% year-over-year. We are doing especially well with national accounts. And if trends hold, we expect the group business to deliver a record sales year. Adjusted PFO growth was also solid at 16% with the addition of Versant Health being a large contributor.  
In Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 92% year-over-year, driven by higher VII. Beyond VII, adjusted earnings were still strong on favorable underwriting and volume growth. Looking ahead, we continue to see a robust pension risk transfer pipeline. Rising equity markets and interest rates have improved pension plan funding levels and lowered the cost for plan sponsors to transact with an insurer.  
Within Asia, we saw a similar earnings pattern to RIS. Adjusted earnings were up 70% year-over-year on a constant currency basis driven by higher VII. However, even allowing for VII, adjusted earnings were strong, driven by favorable foreign exchange rates, volume growth and underwriting. Sales in the region were up 12% on a constant currency basis even with the COVID resurgence in certain markets.  
In Latin America, adjusted earnings were down 57% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the pandemic. COVID-related claims in the quarter totaled approximately $150 million, mainly in Mexico.  
In EMEA, adjusted earnings of $71 million were down 11% on a constant currency basis on higher COVID-related claims as well as higher expenses compared to the favorable prior year quarter. Sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis with strong momentum in the U.K. employee benefits space.  
To finish my business segment discussion, I think a theme is clear. If you look past higher VII and mortality in the quarter, the underlying performance of the business was very solid. On the fundamentals, we continue to demonstrate consistent execution with strong earnings power across a range of different economic scenarios.  
Turning to cash and capital management, MetLife ended the first quarter with cash at the holding company of $3.8 billion, near the top end of our $3 billion to $4 billion target buffer. Our 2-year average free cash flow ratio remains within our guidance range of 65% to 75%. Currently, our cash balances are much higher following the receipt of $3.94 billion of proceeds on the sale of our U.S. P&C business.  
During the quarter, we were pleased to return $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders, $1 billion in share repurchases and approximately $400 million in common stock dividends. So far in Q2, we have bought back an additional $210 million of common shares, and we have roughly $1.6 billion remaining under our current repurchase authorization.  
Last week, our Board of Directors approved a second quarter 2021 common stock dividend of $0.48 per share, up 4.3% from the first quarter. Over the last decade, we have increased our common dividend at a 10% compound annual growth rate. Our consistent execution continues to generate strong free cash flow that allows us to invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders, all with the goal of driving long-term value creation.  
As we look ahead, we see a path to a brighter future from both an economic and health perspective. In the United States, conditions look promising for a period of employment growth, which is always good for our group business. On the pandemic front, we believe the worst of the underwriting effects on our company are behind us as the vaccine rollout continues to advance. The progress is not yet uniform across the world, and certain areas are still struggling, but the trend line is clear, a slow but steady return to something we can call normalcy.  
While we welcome an improving external environment, we also remain laser-focused on executing our strategy to ensure we are prepared for the post-pandemic world. For our customers, we continue to accelerate our digital transformation to meet their evolving needs. In Japan, for example, 95% of our policy submissions are now done digitally.
For our employees, we will be implementing a more flexible workplace model in Q3, which for most will be a hybrid approach. While our people have performed exceptionally well working from home during the pandemic, we believe the office will continue to play a critical role in fostering collaboration, innovation and career development. We are equally confident that by incorporating more virtual work into our model, we will enhance productivity, gain access to a broader talent pool and strengthen employee engagement.  
To close this morning, I want to emphasize the urgency we are feeling at MetLife to keep raising our game. As I said in my annual letter to shareholders, consistent execution is our new baseline. Continuous improvement is our new aspiration and expectation.  
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John."

I will start with the 1Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions.

I will start with the 1Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions.  
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the quarter was $290 million or approximately $1.7 billion lower than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net derivative losses as a result of the significant rise in long-term interest rates as well as stronger equity markets in 1Q '21. Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continue to perform as expected.  
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment. There were no notable items for either period. Adjusted earnings per share benefited from exceptionally strong returns in our private equity portfolio and were up 39% and 38% on a constant currency basis.  
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted earnings were down 70% year-over-year, largely driven by unfavorable Group Life mortality due to elevated COVID-19-related life claims. Favorable nonmedical health underwriting and volume growth were partial offsets. Overall, results for Group Benefits were mixed. Adjusted earnings were down, but underlying fundamentals, including top line growth and persistency, were strong. Group Benefits sales were up 45% year-over-year, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity.  
We believe that we are on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across most products, the addition of Versant Health and roughly 5 percentage points related to higher premiums from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claims experience. I will discuss Group Benefits underwriting in more detail shortly.  
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 92% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. In addition, elevated COVID-19 mortality and volume growth were positive contributors. RIS investment spreads were 234 basis points, up 120 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 88 basis points, up 5 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates.  
RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 12% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. With regard to U.K. longevity reinsurance, we have continued to see strong growth since completing our initial transaction in 2Q '20. The notional balance stands at $8.8 billion at March 31, up nearly $5 billion from year-end 2020. 
As previously announced, first quarter results for Property & Casualty are reflected as a divested business in our quarterly financial statements. The sale of the Auto & Home business to Farmers Insurance closed on April 7, and we expect to record an after-tax gain of approximately $1 billion in 2Q '21.  
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 78% and 70% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Asia's solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 6% and 4% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis with growth across most markets.  
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 58% and 57% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting, partially offset by the improvement in equity markets. Elevated COVID-19-related claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $150 million after tax.  
Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19 claims to decrease throughout the year, more significantly in the second half, and adjusted earnings to return to 2019 levels in 2022, which is consistent with our outlook. Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis due to lower single premium immediate annuities in Chile.  
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher COVID-19-related claims as well as higher expenses compared to the favorable prior year quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 5% on a constant currency basis, but sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in U.K. employee benefits.  
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 123%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable investment income, largely due to private equity returns. Also, favorable equity markets and long-term care underwriting were positive drivers. Long-term care benefited from higher policy and claim terminations as well as lower claim incidences.  
The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, higher than the prior year quarter of 51% and at the top end of our annual target range of 50% to 55% due to elevated COVID-19 mortality.
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $171 million. This result is consistent with our 2021 adjusted loss guidance range of $650 million to $750 million. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.8% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%.  
Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits 1Q '21 underwriting performance on Page 5. There were approximately 200,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. in the first quarter, the highest single quarter since the pandemic began and up nearly 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition to the higher number of claims, there were more deaths at younger ages below 65, which resulted in increased claim severity.  
Apart from COVID-19, the number of life insurance claims of greater than $2 million nearly doubled versus a typical quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 106.3% in the first quarter, which included roughly 17 percentage points related to COVID-19 life claims. This reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $280 million after tax.  
For Group Non-Medical Health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 71.1% in the first quarter with favorable experience across most products. The 1Q '21 ratio was below the prior year quarter of 71.7% and at the low end of our annual target range of 70% to 75%.  
Now let's turn to VII in the quarter on Page 6. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the last 5 quarters, including approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 13.3% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag.
Our first quarter results were essentially in line with private equity industry benchmarks. While all private equity classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 20% of our PE account balance of $10.3 billion, were the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 25% quarterly return due to a broad increase in tech company valuations.  
On Page 7, first quarter VII of $1.1 billion post tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As noted previously, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each, although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. VII results in 1Q '21 were more heavily weighted toward RIS and MetLife Holdings, as Asia's portfolio has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier.  
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters and full year 2020, including 11% in the first quarter of 2021. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. In 1Q '21, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline as well as delayed investment spending in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be consistent with our full year outlook.  
Now I will discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.8 billion at March 31, which is down from $4.5 billion at December 31, but well within our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of approximately $1 billion in the first quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. Looking ahead, we expect holdco cash will be significantly higher in the second quarter as a result of the sale of our Auto & Home business to Farmers Insurance.  
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 392% at year-end 2020 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, excluding our Property & Casualty business, preliminary first quarter 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.5 billion, while statutory net income was approximately $570 million.  
Statutory operating earnings increased by roughly $2.3 billion year-over-year, driven by lower VA rider reserves, an increase in interest margins, higher net investment income and lower operating expenses. Statutory net income, excluding our P&C business, increased by roughly $430 million year-over-year, driven by higher operating earnings, partially offset by an increase in after-tax derivative losses.
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital, excluding P&C, was approximately $16.7 billion as of March 31, down 2% compared to December 31. Favorable operating earnings were more than offset by after-tax derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 967% as of December 31, which is the latest public data.  
In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter, which benefited from exceptional private equity returns, solid business fundamentals and ongoing expense discipline. While higher mortality in the U.S. and Mexico dampened adjusted earnings in Group Benefits and Latin America, our financial performance demonstrates the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. 
In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and position us for success. We are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler, more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.  
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

So we saw the significant increase in the total number of population deaths. And that was accompanied by a secondary effect, which is a severity effect, whereby we did see an increase in the percentage of claims under 65. And those claims, which tend to be for working employees, do have a higher phased amount.  
So if you think about it and if you think about the outlook going forward, we're watching that composition very carefully. But I would say that the primary driver in the second quarter is still going to be the frequency, right? So as you know, with the rollout of the vaccine, the COVID-related deaths in the population have been declining. And if you do any comparison between, say, January average death number to an April, there's been a significant decline. So while we still have a substantial number of deaths coming through, therefore, expect to see an elevated mortality ratio in the second quarter, we do expect the underwriting ratio to come down from its Q1 high."

This is certainly a good performance, especially given the COVID environment. Even in Japan, we had several prefectures under the state of emergency there during much of Q1. And then the other Asia markets had varying degrees of social distancing measures in place. Clearly, COVID and the resurgence here in Asia is a significant headwind given that the vast majority of our sales are face-to-face.  
However, as I mentioned earlier, the diversity of our channels and products, the strength of our bank partnerships and the strong execution focus of our businesses, that's what powers MetLife sales resiliency even in this tough environment. In addition, we've been making significant investments in digitizing our sales processes, all the way from video conferencing, quote browsing, remote closing, and they've certainly aided our performance as well. As Michel mentioned in his opening remarks, 95% of our new sales application submissions in Japan are digital.
And the other markets are in a similar range as well. For example, in China, almost all our agent onboarding and new business submissions are done digitally. Specifically with regards to Japan, it's again 8% up sequentially. And even after taking seasonality into account, our face-to-face channels that sell life and A&H products were quite resilient, while we recorded strong annuity sales growth through the bank channel. Clearly, we have strengthened the FX-denominated products and our bank relationships, and that strength shows. 
Other Asia, 8% up, sequentially up 30% year-over-year. Again, this speaks to, I think, the strength of our market presence across these markets and strong execution across the board. And our digital solutions are also helping us in a big way. With regards to the outlook for the rest of the year, we're very comfortable and on track to meet the full guidance of a double-digit sales growth."

Again, here, I would just maybe start with sort of our approach and philosophy, which again is -- has been very consistent and no change there. So we will always look for M&A opportunities that fit our strategy that are accretive over time for our shareholders. We have a constant basis globally through which we evaluate opportunities based on value and cash generation. All M&A opportunities will need to earn more than their cost of capital. And we determine what we're willing to pay for a business by evaluating capital markets, the cost of raising capital and synergies. And acquisition opportunities will need to be more attractive than share repurchases. 
So what we do is we try to achieve a healthy balance between returning cash to our shareholders and investing in attractive future growth through M&A. And I think some of the sort of recent transactions that we've done, such as Versant Health last year, the -- at first, the acquisition prior to that, Logan Circle a couple of years back, I think those give you a sense of sort of what that sort of approach or strategy that I outlined.

185648,710591564,2272866,"MetLife, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Andrew, it's Steve Goulart. Let me talk a little bit about the overall strategy because we've been investing in private equity for a number of years and have always felt it to be a very strong component of our overall strategy. Venture capital, of course,",475,"Andrew, it's Steve Goulart. Let me talk a little bit about the overall strategy because we've been investing in private equity for a number of years and have always felt it to be a very strong component of our overall strategy. Venture capital, of course, is a significant portion of the portfolio. But basically, we take a look at this portfolio the same way we look at our credit portfolio, our real estate portfolio. It's about diversification, and that's what we've really tried to build in this. 
Again, just sort of recapping some of the numbers. Our PE portfolio produced income of almost $1.3 billion or 13.3% return. Again, venture capital was -- led the way as far as its total return. But think about what was happening in the market, too, with a lot of IPO activity and the like, things that Michel cited in his comments. 
So the important thing is that our returns were attractive across the portfolio. And I'd look at things like our LBO portfolio, both domestically and in Europe. And again, this reflects the diversity that's in the entire portfolio. And when we look to invest, we continue to invest in a diverse way across all the different sectors as well. I mean just to give you a little bit more flavor on it, we have over 600 funds that we've invested in. We have almost 200 managers. So again, very broad, very deep exposure across all of the sectors of private equity. 
And again, I think you have to take into consideration what was happening in the environment. And when we think about it, despite the pandemic, equity valuations continued to climb in the fourth quarter. The combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus continue to be major contributors that led to strong equity performance really across all sectors. And so I would think about it in that respect that we really think of this as a diversified private equity portfolio. 
Now that all said, we do think that the past quarter was probably something of an anomaly because when we look at our historical experience, at least until this quarter, it has been that our PE returns have always been moderated versus the S&P 500, particularly in high market return quarters. So this was an unusual quarter in that respect.
And when we think about future returns or relationships, we still think that, what we've been saying for the last couple of years as far as our plans go, the kind of low single -- or low double digits, 12% is still the right way for us to think about these returns. Again, it's going to be -- vary quarter-by-quarter, but that's how we think about this on a long-term basis. And again, it just reflects our continued efforts to have a very diversified portfolio across all sectors."

And then Erik was asking a question a little earlier about Asian sales in the Asia region. And I'm still trying to reconcile those numbers with what we've been seeing at other companies, which is sales pressures, flattish premium growth. And Met being -- having a very large proportion of its business in Japan, which is a more mature market, it's just kind of striking to see 12% year-over-year sales growth and then a target of double digit. So if you could flesh that out a little bit more specifically. Is it the banks that are driving the sales growth in Japan? And what particular other countries are kind of driving growth in other parts of Asia?"
185648,710591564,2272866,"MetLife, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Sure, Andrew. So if you -- if we parse out the total Asia sales into Japan and Other Asia, let's stay with Japan for a minute, while sequentially, and even in the previous calls, right, we've been making steady progress in Japan sales since Q2, right? Q3",462,"Sure, Andrew. So if you -- if we parse out the total Asia sales into Japan and Other Asia, let's stay with Japan for a minute, while sequentially, and even in the previous calls, right, we've been making steady progress in Japan sales since Q2, right? Q3 was better than Q2 last year. Q4 was better than Q3. And Q1, just a build-off of Q4 from last year.
And if you then say, okay, where is this coming from? A couple of things. We have 3 broad product lines, which is life, A&H and annuities. And then we have a couple of channels, right? We've got essentially what I would broadly classify as face-to-face channels, we can go further breakdown on that, but that's not needed for this call, and Banco.
The good news for us is even in this tough environment, our face-to-face channels were pretty resilient from a year-over-year perspective. There's a little bit of pressure on A&H, but our life segment pretty much held flat. And then much of the growth came in from the annuities, which are primarily sold through banks.
And in the previous calls, I talked a lot about our advantages in the annuity space on the FX because these are all foreign currency or dollar denominated. And we have many advantages that we bring to the table on that and also the strength of the bank partnerships that we bring to the table as well. So because of that, because of this diversification of products and diversification of channels and our lean in on our strengths, that's basically contributed to the resiliency of our sales in Japan. 
Now with regards to -- and by the way, this has not been easy, I have to tell you that. But our teams on the ground have done, I think, a fantastic job with regards to that. Now again, this is playing out, right? I can't sit here and say, this is definitive because COVID is a factor that's an ongoing concern across Asia. 
With regards to Other Asia, again, very strong sales growth. But remember, last year, the pressure started early outside of Japan, in China, right, because of COVID. And so the year-over-year comparisons look very favorable on the Other Asia segment.
But again, I think I'd lean more on the strength of our businesses and our market presence in terms of how we've executed this quarter. Korea was very strong in terms of performance. India was also strong in performance from a sales perspective. We've recovered nicely in China, which is a major factor. Again, COVID is still a factor in all these markets. And we continue to stay focused on execution. At the end, that's what it boils down to. I hope that helps."

Now obviously, we came in at 11% in Q1. 
A few factors that contributed to this. One is the PFO growth, obviously. And I think there were -- in John's comments, we mentioned some of the impact of participating Group Life contracts, for example, on that PFO growth. Versant was an important also factor there. Then we had really good expense discipline across our businesses. And we did have also some, I would say, timing-related expenses that maybe benefited us by about 25 basis points. 
So our expectation for the second to fourth quarter is that the expense ratio will be consistent with our full year outlook guidance. And as I said, we believe that 12.3% is the right level for us because that allows us to continue to make important investments in our business.

And as John mentioned, 2021 is shaping up to be a record year for us in terms of Group Benefits. I would say the 3 drivers of sales, the first one is a significant uptick in the jumbo activity in national accounts. Now that's coming up -- coming off a low in 2020, but this is our sweet spot. This is where we excel, and we've done exceptionally well this quarter there. I would also remind you, just for jumbo accounts, these sales can be lumpy from year-to-year. 
Beyond that, if you look at products and markets, we've just seen, I would say, strength across the board from a product perspective as well as increased sales in both regional and small. So it's pretty even. And then the last driver of sales I would point to is we continue to successfully execute on our enrollment and re-enrollment strategy at the worksite that we've talked about on prior occasions. So we're seeing pretty strong underlying sales growth there. 
When it comes to PFO growth, which we think is the actual measure that best captures the top line of this business, you really need to peel back from that 16%, 5 points due to these participating contracts. So think about 11% as the underlying growth there, and that is in line with our expectations and in line with our outlook. So we're very pleased with that result as well. 
And the PFO drivers, in addition to sales, would be strong persistency. We continue to see very high persistency with our customers. And our value proposition is resonating with those customers, and they're doing more business with us. We're getting all of our rate actions at renewals, also in line with our expectations. And then also what's driving the PFO number, coming back to that re-enrollment strategy, is very disciplined execution of our voluntary strategy in the worksite. And so we continue to see those double-digit growth in voluntary in that PFO number."

MetLife's outstanding financial results in the second quarter provide further evidence of the tremendous progress we're making on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We're continuing to focus with the rig",1560,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife's outstanding financial results in the second quarter provide further evidence of the tremendous progress we're making on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We're continuing to focus with the right capital allocation and investment decisions. We're continuing to simplify with exceptional expense discipline. And we're continuing to differentiate with enhancements to our market-leading group benefits platform that are helping to drive record sales. 
When it comes to our strategy, we've transitioned from a period of execution risk to one of additional opportunity. Net income in the second quarter was $3.4 billion, up from $68 million a year ago. The primary drivers were growth in adjusted earnings, the gain we booked on the sale of our Auto & Home business and derivative gains in the current quarter relative to derivative losses a year ago. 
Strong net income drove book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA growth of 8%. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter were $2.1 billion or $2.37 per share, up 186% from $0.83 per share a year ago. As in the first quarter, our investment portfolio generated exceptionally strong variable investment income. Private equity remains the key driver of VII. 
As you know, private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag, so the strong Q2 performance reflected gains from Q1. We reported private equity gains of 9.7% in the second quarter compared with a negative 8.2% a year ago. Equity markets continued to perform well from April through June, which we anticipate being reflected in our Q3 earnings. 
When we unveiled our Next Horizon strategy at Investor Day in December 2019, we pointed to the scale and expertise that we have in investments as a competitive advantage for MetLife. The strategic approach we have taken on private equity is a case in point. Our decision to sell most of our $2.5 billion hedge fund portfolio and increase the allocation to private equity has provided a better match for our long-dated liabilities while creating significant value for our shareholders. 
This was no accident, but the latest in a series of successful investment decisions from derisking our portfolio ahead of the financial crisis to selling Peter Cooper Village -- town near a market top. 
Turning to our reporting segments. John McCallion will provide a complete overview shortly. I would like to focus on how our results show that COVID-19 is both still with us but lessening in its impact. 
From an underwriting perspective, we've seen a sizable improvement, but we are still experiencing excess mortality. In the quarter, the Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3%, below the 106.3% from last quarter but still above the top end of our guidance range. In Latin America, we had $66 million of COVID losses, again, below the $150 million of COVID losses from Q1, but still above normal. Yet at the same time, COVID-19's economic group is easing somewhat. At MetLife, we see this emerging in sales trends. 
In the U.S. group business, sales through the first half of 2021 are 39% higher than they were in the first half of 2020. And if current trends hold, 2021 will be a record sales year. In Latin America, sales are up 55% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Asia sales are up 42%, while EMEA sales are up 20%. 
By their nature, claims are a backward-looking indicator and sales are a forward-looking indicator. So while we are not out of the woods, we are starting to see a clearing in the trees ahead. The path of the pandemic is something outside of our control. But as we have demonstrated over the past 1.5 years, we are not standing still. We are moving ahead with urgency to accelerate our strategy. 
To further differentiate our Group Benefits business, we acquired Versant Health and immediately became the third largest vision care provider in the United States. Versant has now been part of our results for 2 quarters. And in Q2, it contributed 6 points of year-over-year growth in U.S. group premiums, fees and other revenues consistent with our expectations. 
Year-over-year, requests for vision care proposals are up more than 20% among our national account customers. We are pleased with how our new vision care offering is performing in the marketplace and expect it to contribute meaningfully to growth going forward. 
Similarly, we have enhanced our pet insurance offering to make it even more attractive to customers. We now offer telehealth -- care services, rollover benefits from the prior year and family plans covering multiple paths. And what we believe is the first for the industry, we also cover preexisting conditions when an employee switches to MetLife pet insurance from another carrier as long as the condition was covered by the prior plan. More than 500 employers now offer MetLife pet insurance as a voluntary benefit to their employees, and we believe our best-in-class product will continue to make gains in this highly attractive and underpenetrated market. 
To strengthen our focus, we made a decision to sell our businesses in Poland and Greece to an end group. This was another promise we made at Investor Day, to continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and ability to achieve scale and clear our hurdle rate. Since that time, we have sold or reached agreement to sell our businesses in 4 markets, and we will continue to apply this disciplined approach. 
In early April, we also closed on the sale of our Auto & Home business to Farmers Insurance for $3.94 billion in cash. The 10-year strategic partnership we forged allows each company to focus on its core strength. Farmers 90 years of P&C underwriting and service excellence and MetLife's unrivaled distribution reach in the U.S. group benefits space. 
The simplified pillar of our strategy was evident in our exceptional expense management. In the quarter, we delivered a direct expense ratio of 11.4% and we now expect to beat our 12.3% target ratio, not only for all of 2021 but for 2022 as well. We are making this commitment despite selling our Auto & Home business, which operated at a lower expense ratio than the overall enterprise. 
As we have said many times, we are embedding an efficiency mindset across everything we do. It is central to our ability to deliver continuous improvement. At MetLife, we no longer have expense reduction programs. We do not need them. What we have instead is a publicly disclosed direct expense ratio target that we have brought down by 200 basis points over the past 5 years and promise to keep there. This is how we hold ourselves accountable, and this is how investors can hold us accountable as well. 
Our strategic decision to sell Auto & Home contributed to a $6.5 billion cash buffer as of June 30, well above our target range. We repurchased $1.1 billion of common shares in the second quarter and another $248 million of common shares so far in the third. And yesterday, our Board approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. This is on top of the $475 million we have remaining on our December 2020 authorization. 
We believe that investing in responsible growth, steadily increasing our common dividend and buying back common stock are all vital parts of a balanced approach to creating long-term shareholder value. COVID-19 continues to present MetLife with the opportunity and the obligation to step up for our employees, our customers and our communities. That work is ongoing. We are in a new phase of the pandemic. The primary focus now is on vaccinating as many people as possible. Nothing will do more to prevent needless deaths and a potential resurgence of the lockdown measures that caused so much economic harm. 
As we did over 100 years ago with our visiting nurses program, MetLife has mobilized to make a positive contribution to advance public health. First and foremost, this means doing all we can to give our own employees and their families access to the vaccines. Examples from our markets include giving employees paid leave to get vaccinated, covering vaccine-related expenses such as travel and childcare and holding free vaccine clinics for employees and their families in locations as varied as -- New York and Osaka, Japan but it also means helping to vaccinate the broader population as well. In Nagasaki, Japan, we've opened 6,500 square feet of our headquarters as a free vaccination site. MetLife Foundation has committed $500,000 to delivering vaccines to underserved communities across the U.S., and our medically trained staff are volunteering to administer doses at vaccine sites. 
In closing, to perform as well as we have through a pandemic highlights some fundamental truth about MetLife. We have an all-weather strategy that holds up well to stress. We have an investment portfolio that captures meaningful upside. We have competitive advantages that enable us to grow in the most attractive markets, and we have a relentless focus on execution. 
At our 2019 Investor Day, we said our Next Horizon strategy would generate tangible benefits for shareholders, a 12% to 14% adjusted ROE, $20 billion of distributable cash over 5 years and an additional $1 billion of operating leverage to self-fund growth. We are on track to meet every one of those commitments. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John."
185648,1673288848,2364515,"MetLife, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Please note in the appendix, we have also provided an updated 25",2047,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Please note in the appendix, we have also provided an updated 25 basis point sensitivity for our U.S. long-term interest rate assumption. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the quarter was $3.4 billion, or approximately $1.3 billion higher than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net investment gains of $1.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion relates to the sale of our Property and Casualty business to Farmers Insurance. 
Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continued to perform as expected. Additionally, adjusted earnings include one notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. As I previously noted, there was one notable item of $66 million in 2Q of '21 and no notable items for the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item was $2.30, benefiting from strong returns in our private equity portfolio, which drove most of the year-over-year variance. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S.. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were flat year-over-year as volume growth and the Versant Health acquisition largely offset unfavorable underwriting margins. Group Life mortality improved sequentially but remain elevated in the quarter. I will discuss in more detail shortly. 
Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.8% in 2Q of '21, within its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 58.5%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. We've seen a return to more normal utilization rates for nonmedical health and expect this trend to continue. Therefore, we expect the interest-adjusted benefit ratio to remain within its annual target range for the remainder of the year. 
Overall, business fundamentals for group benefits remain healthy, highlighted by strong top line growth and persistency. Group Benefit sales were up 39% year-to-date, primarily due to higher genral case activity and remain on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. 
Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Several factors contributed to the strong year-over-year growth, including a $500 million impact relating to dental premium credits and the establishment of a dental unearned premium reserve both reducing premiums in the second quarter of 2020, which collectively contributed 13 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. In addition, 4 percentage points were related to higher premiums in the current quarter from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. 
After considering these factors, underlying PFO growth for Group Benefits was roughly 12% and driven by solid volume growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary and the addition of Versant Health. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, while Group Benefits reported PFO growth rates will be impacted by the dental unearned premium reserve release in Q3 and Q4, we expect the underlying PFO growth to maintain its strength and resilience for the remainder of 2021. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS. Adjusted earnings were $654 million, up $462 million year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income largely due to strong private equity returns. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins compared to 2Q of '20. RIS investment spreads were 224 basis points, up 199 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points, up 13 basis points year-over-year due in part to sustained paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage-backed securities, a partial recovery in real estate equities and lower LIBOR rates. 
RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 8% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. 
With regards to pension risk transfers, we continue to see a robust PRT pipeline. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 103% and 91% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis which were up 7% and 6% on a constant currency basis. Additionally, while against a weak 2Q of '20, Asia sales were up 42% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. demonstrating the resiliency in the business. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 27% and 38% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and unfavorable equity markets related to the Chilean encaje, which had a negative 1.5% return in the quarter versus a positive 14% in 2Q of '20. This was partially offset by favorable investment margins. 
COVID-19-related claims improved sequentially. The impact on Latin America's second quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $66 million after tax. While Latin America's bottom line has been dampened by the elevated COVID-19-related claims, the underlying fundamentals of the business remain robust as evidenced by strong sales and persistency throughout the region. 
Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 55% driven by solid growth in all markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 19% and 23% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by higher COVID-19-related claims in the current period compared to low utilization in the prior year period. Solid volume growth was a partial offset. 
The current quarter has also benefited from a favorable refinement to an unearned premium reserve positively impacting adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings by approximately $15 million after tax. In addition, Poland and Greece contribute roughly 10% to run rate earnings that will be reported in divested businesses beginning in the third quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 8% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 20% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher credit life sales in Turkey and solid growth in U.K. Employee Benefits. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up $515 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. In addition, Life underwriting margins were favorable. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 47.1%, lower than the prior year quarter of 59.1% and below our annual target range of 50% to 55%.
 Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding the favorable notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release, was $126 million. This result compared favorably to the adjusted loss of $289 million in 2Q of '20 due to higher net investment income, lower expenses and lower preferred stock dividends. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. The Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3% in the second quarter of 2021, which is above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. And COVID reported claims in 2Q of '21 were roughly 4.5 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $75 million after tax. 
Additionally, the quarter included a higher level of life claims above $2.5 million and an additional level of excess mortality that appears to be COVID related. These collectively impacted the ratio by an additional 2.7 percentage points or $40 million after tax. 
There were approximately 50,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. in the second quarter of '21. While still elevated, total deaths have moderated versus the prior year and sequential quarters. Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19-related deaths and group benefits to continue to trend lower. 
Now let's turn to Page 6. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the last 5 quarters, including approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 9.7% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. 
Our second quarter results are essentially in line with PE industry benchmarks. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 22% of our PE account balance of $11.3 billion, were the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 19% quarterly return. 
On Page 7, second quarter VII of $950 million post tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each, although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. VII results in 2Q of '21 were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters and full year 2020, including 11.4% in the second quarter of '21. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. 
In 2Q of '21, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline as well as lower employee-related benefits in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be elevated compared to the first half of 2021 due to timing of investments and seasonality. But as Michel noted, we expect full year '21 and '22 direct expense ratio to beat our 12.3% guidance. 
Now I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $3.8 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the proceeds received from our P&C sale to Farmers Insurance of $3.9 billion. In addition, holdco cash includes the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, a $500 million redemption of preferred stock, share repurchases of $1.1 billion as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.8 billion, while net income was approximately $1.6 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year, driven by lower variable annuity rider reserves and an increase in investment margin. 
Year-to-date 2021 net income decreased by $286 million as compared to the first half of 2020. The primary drivers were derivative losses mostly offset by increases in operating earnings and net investment gains in the current 6-month period compared to large derivative gains in the prior year 6-month period. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.5 billion as of June 30, 2021, up 9% compared to December 31, 2020, when excluding our P&C business sold to farmers. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 873% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The sequential decline in the Japan SMR from 967% at December 31 reflects seasonal dividends and the rise in U.S. interest rates in the quarter ending March 31. 
In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter driven by exceptional private equity returns, good business fundamentals, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While higher mortality due to COVID-19 has masked the earnings power of Group Benefits in Latin America, the strength of these franchises remain healthy and intact. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and position us for success. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And I think as Michel said in his opening remarks, this has really become part of our culture and it's a cultural shift that we've made, our efficiency mindset is built into our strategy. It's built into our everyday activities, and I think the results are -- kind of speak for themselves. 
As I mentioned, in this quarter, there's a few timing-related items. So we do see an uptick in expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half. We did have some benefit from some employee-related costs, particularly as they relate to the impact of how markets move. And so that came -- that was a benefit this quarter. And then there's seasonality with regards to preferred stock dividends. So the second and the fourth quarter typically are low quarters for those dividends. 
As we look to the second half of this year, directionally speaking, we would see -- just typically do see seasonally higher expenses in the second half. Some of that's related, obviously, to our group business and the enrollment activities we go through. And oftentimes, too, there's been some delays just as a result of a number of activities going on in some of the investments. So we do see kind of an uptick. 
Having said that, one of the things that we both pointed out is our expectation, which is different than where we were on our outlook call in February, is to now be under our 12.3% guidance despite the removal of our Property & Casualty business, which had a lower expense ratio. 
So all in all, I think our efficiency mindset just built into the culture, it's all working. And we expect that to continue as we look forward. I think I would probably stop there on your last question and probably leave that for another day."

And I'll essentially just give you a bit of a walk from the headline number of 94.3% in terms of the major drivers of that. 
So the first is COVID-related -- COVID deaths in the quarter. That's the $50,000 population -- 50,000 population death number impacting our portfolio. And that's worth about 4.5 points, as John pointed out. 
There's another piece in the quarter, which is that from time to time, we do experience higher volume of claims with larger face amounts, which does impact our mortality ratio. This is non-COVID related, and that was about -- worth about a point to our loss ratio in this quarter. 
And then the third piece of this is when we look at our claims data, we did see an increase in certain death codes, which are highly correlated to COVID. So while the cause of death for those claims is not explicitly stated as COVID the, excess mortality does appear to be COVID related, and that was worth another 1.7% on our ratio. 
So if I think about the quarter and looking forward, there are probably 2 headlines I'd leave you with. One is that if you strip out those 3 factors, our loss ratio is very close to the midpoint of our range. And the second headline is that we have seen significant declines in death in Q2 versus Q1. We've also seen sequential declines in deaths month-on-month continuing into July. 
So despite the current uncertainty with the Delta variant, we're also encouraged by the increase in the pace of vaccination. We're encouraged by the actions undertaken by many large employers, which are impacting the vaccination rates for that insured population. So sitting here in August on a go-forward basis, we do think that the impact of the pandemic will gradually subside and you should expect from a run rate perspective, our loss ratio to return back to pre-pandemic levels."

And I presume with rates remaining low, that's going to remain strong. So probably the base spread in that business will remain strong, assuming mortgage prepaid remain high. 
But then there's sort of the back-end question, which is as we kind of go -- as this levels off and diminishes, then there's the reinvestment pressure that kind of emerges. So would you ultimately expect this to be a negative for base spreads? And if so, when would we likely see that?"

So it's a number of factors, right? We got lower LIBOR year-over-year. You have a partial recovery in real estate equity returns we saw -- we've had very good, strong new business spreads as particularly -- or I should say, in RIS there. 
And then as you said, the last thing is we've seen elevated levels of the residential mortgage paydown activity. I would use the word paydown just to not confuse that with prepayment fees that we categorize in VII. 
And so what that really is, is that, that acceleration of the recognition of income on those securities that were purchased at a discount previously. So we do think this will stay elevated. I think it's a combination of low rates coupled with the home price appreciation that we've seen in a lot of markets. So that has spurred others. And I think also, if you think of it in combination with more remote work opportunities, there's been probably some movement in terms of the residential housing market. 
So we do see that continuing particularly although they've probably peaked, the time between when action occurs and when it hits our securities or mortgage loans is usually a 2 to 5-month lag. So we think the second half of the year, we'll still see an elevated level, maybe not to this level that we saw in the second quarter. We expect it to probably be somewhat less than that. 
But -- so that's kind of our expectation. As you look forward, look, this is all just part of our broader portfolio. And I wouldn't say this in and of itself is going to change the trajectory. I think what it's done is it's changed the trajectory upwards. We don't consider that to be a long-term trend, probably remains a trend for the remainder of this year but probably goes back to more baseline run rate in '22."

So if I take a step back, if you don't mind me and think about this in the overall Asia context, Overall, Asia, we did well this quarter, 42% up year-over-year, 71% in Japan, 11% in Asia ex Japan, still positive in Asia ex Japan as well. And this is despite COVID spurts in many of our markets. And if you take the first half, all in total, we have a 25% year-over-year collectively for the first half. And so there are a number of reasons which certainly drove that strong performance. 
On a sequential basis -- and if you look at Japan, and I'll come to other Asia very quickly. And if you look at the sequentially both on the life side and as well as the A&H sales, we were up, right? And that speaks to the resilience of our face-to-face channels in our markets in Japan, in particular. And the pressure on a sequential basis came in from the annuities because the banker channel is certainly -- they have a March end. And so therefore, they're much stronger on the banker side and that's what the annuity shows drop sequentially. 
On other Asia, if you think about it, this is -- COVID is playing out significantly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. There's a fair amount of pressure in all these markets. And we're very much a face-to-face sales business, and that certainly is weighing in despite, by the way, all our efforts in terms of strong execution, our success of our new products and certainly, our digitization efforts are paying off as well. 
Now as I said, this corporate uncertainty is continuing on. And a vast majority of our market significantly lagged the U.S., say, for example, in terms of vaccination rate. And right now, because of the resurgence of COVID in some of our markets, social distancing measures are being reintroduced, right? 
So while we did well year-over-year in other Asia, sequentially, we've been impacted. And both in Japan and other Asia, we expect to see Q3 sales to be sequentially flat to Q2 as well. But considering everything at this point, if you think about our guidance for the full year, we expect to be on track to meet the double-digit guidance that we provided in February. I hope that helps."

On the LTC side metrics, there was -- it was really -- there was no material positive from LTC. It was in line with expectations. What we're seeing is that -- and I'd say in line with, I'll say, pre-pandemic expectations. And so what we're seeing is metrics and results really trending back towards those pre-COVID levels. 
New claims are, I'd say, marginally below trend, but all indications are showing that we'll be back to trend very soon. The only metric that's lagging -- but again, I will say, trending back to pre-pandemic is the relationship of home care versus nursing home claims.

And we expect overall revenues to continue to grow, supported by strong persistency and recovery in sales. We've had good momentum in sales we created since the beginning of this year. We reported $222 million for the quarter back in line with the levels of pre-pandemic. And this really demonstrates the strength, diversity and resiliency of our distribution channel and product mix.

MetLife's outstanding financial results in the second quarter provide further evidence of the tremendous progress we're making on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We're continuing to focus with the rig",1559,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife's outstanding financial results in the second quarter provide further evidence of the tremendous progress we're making on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We're continuing to focus with the right capital allocation and investment decisions. We're continuing to simplify with exceptional expense discipline. And we're continuing to differentiate with enhancements to our market-leading group benefits platform that are helping to drive record sales. 
When it comes to our strategy, we've transitioned from a period of execution risk to one of additional opportunity. Net income in the second quarter was $3.4 billion, up from $68 million a year ago. The primary drivers were growth in adjusted earnings, the gain we booked on the sale of our Auto & Home business and derivative gains in the current quarter relative to derivative losses a year ago. 
Strong net income drove book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA growth of 8%. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter were $2.1 billion or $2.37 per share, up 186% from $0.83 per share a year ago. As in the first quarter, our investment portfolio generated exceptionally strong variable investment income. Private equity remains the key driver of VII. 
As you know, private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag, so the strong Q2 performance reflected gains from Q1. We reported private equity gains of 9.7% in the second quarter compared with a negative 8.2% a year ago. Equity markets continued to perform well from April through June, which we anticipate being reflected in our Q3 earnings. 
When we unveiled our Next Horizon strategy at Investor Day in December 2019, we pointed to the scale and expertise that we have in investments as a competitive advantage for MetLife. The strategic approach we have taken on private equity is a case in point. Our decision to sell most of our $2.5 billion hedge fund portfolio and increase the allocation to private equity has provided a better match for our long-dated liabilities while creating significant value for our shareholders. 
This was no accident, but the latest in a series of successful investment decisions from derisking our portfolio ahead of the financial crisis to selling Peter Cooper Village Stuyvesant Town near a market top. 
Turning to our reporting segments. John McCallion will provide a complete overview shortly. I would like to focus on how our results show that COVID-19 is both still with us but lessening in its impact. 
From an underwriting perspective, we've seen a sizable improvement, but we are still experiencing excess mortality. In the quarter, the Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3%, below the 106.3% from last quarter but still above the top end of our guidance range. In Latin America, we had $66 million of COVID losses, again, below the $150 million of COVID losses from Q1 but still above normal. Yet, at the same time, COVID-19's economic group is easing somewhat. At MetLife, we see this emerging in sales trends. 
In the U.S. group business, sales through the first half of 2021 are 39% higher than they were in the first half of 2020. And if current trends hold, 2021 will be a record sales year. In Latin America, sales are up 55% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Asia sales are up 42%, while EMEA sales are up 20%. 
By their nature, claims are a backward-looking indicator and sales are a forward-looking indicator. So while we are not out of the woods, we are starting to see a clearing in the trees ahead. The path of the pandemic is something outside of our control. But as we have demonstrated over the past 1.5 years, we are not standing still. We are moving ahead with urgency to accelerate our strategy. 
To further differentiate our Group Benefits business, we acquired Versant Health and immediately became the third largest vision care provider in the United States. Versant has now been part of our results for 2 quarters. And in Q2, it contributed 6 points of year-over-year growth in U.S. group premiums, fees and other revenues consistent with our expectations. 
Year-over-year, requests for vision care proposals are up more than 20% among our national account customers. We are pleased with how our new vision care offering is performing in the marketplace and expect it to contribute meaningfully to growth going forward. 
Similarly, we have enhanced our pet insurance offering to make it even more attractive to customers. We now offer telehealth concierge services, rollover benefits from the prior year and family plans covering multiple paths. And what we believe is the first for the industry. We also cover preexisting conditions when an employee switches to MetLife pet insurance from another carrier as long as the condition was covered by the prior plan. More than 500 employers now offer MetLife pet insurance as a voluntary benefit to their employees, and we believe our best-in-class product will continue to make gains in this highly attractive and underpenetrated market. 
To strengthen our focus, we made a decision to sell our businesses in Poland and Greece to an end group. This was another promise we made at Investor Day, to continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and ability to achieve scale and clear our hurdle rate. Since that time, we have sold or reached agreements to sell our businesses in 4 markets, and we will continue to apply this disciplined approach. 
In early April, we also closed on the sale of our Auto & Home business to Farmers Insurance for $3.94 billion in cash. The 10-year strategic partnership we forged allows each company to focus on its core strength. Farmers 90 years of P&C underwriting and service excellence and MetLife's unrivaled distribution reach in the U.S. group benefits space. 
The simplified pillar of our strategy was evident in our exceptional expense management. In the quarter, we delivered a direct expense ratio of 11.4%, and we now expect to beat our 12.3% target ratio, not only for all of 2021 but for 2022 as well. We are making this commitment despite selling our Auto & Home business, which operated at a lower expense ratio than the overall enterprise. 
As we have said many times, we are embedding an efficiency mindset across everything we do. It is central to our ability to deliver continuous improvement. At MetLife, we no longer have expense reduction programs. We do not need them. What we have instead is a publicly disclosed direct expense ratio target that we have brought down by 200 basis points over the past 5 years and promise to keep there. This is how we hold ourselves accountable, and this is how investors can hold us accountable as well. 
Our strategic decision to sell Auto & Home contributed to a $6.5 billion cash buffer as of June 30, well above our target range. We repurchased $1.1 billion of common shares in the second quarter and another $248 million of common shares so far in the third. And yesterday, our Board approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. This is on top of the $475 million we have remaining on our December 2020 authorization. 
We believe that investing in responsible growth, steadily increasing our common dividend and buying back common stock are all vital parts of a balanced approach to creating long-term shareholder value. COVID-19 continues to present MetLife with the opportunity and the obligation to step up for our employees, our customers and our communities. That work is ongoing. We are in a new phase of the pandemic. The primary focus now is on vaccinating as many people as possible. Nothing will do more to prevent needless deaths and a potential resurgence of the lockdown measures that caused so much economic harm. 
As we did over 100 years ago with our visiting nurses program, MetLife has mobilized to make a positive contribution to advance public health. First and foremost, this means doing all we can to give our own employees and their families access to the vaccines. Examples from our markets include giving employees paid leave to get vaccinated, covering vaccine-related expenses such as travel and childcare and holding free vaccine clinics for employees and their families in locations as varied as Oriskany, New York and Osaka, Japan but it also means helping to vaccinate the broader population as well. 
In Nagasaki, Japan, we've opened 6,500 square feet of our headquarters as a free vaccination site. MetLife Foundation has committed $500,000 to delivering vaccines to underserved communities across the U.S., and our medically trained staff are volunteering to administer doses at vaccine sites. 
In closing, to perform as well as we have through a pandemic highlights some fundamental truth about MetLife. We have an all-weather strategy that holds up well to stress. We have an investment portfolio that captures meaningful upside. We have competitive advantages that enable us to grow in the most attractive markets, and we have a relentless focus on execution. 
At our 2019 Investor Day, we said our Next Horizon strategy would generate tangible benefits for shareholders, a 12% to 14% adjusted ROE, $20 billion of distributable cash over 5 years and an additional $1 billion of operating leverage to self-fund growth. We are on track to meet every one of those commitments. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John."
185648,1673288848,2365134,"MetLife, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Please note in the appendix, we have also provided an updated 25",2046,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Please note in the appendix, we have also provided an updated 25 basis point sensitivity for our U.S. long-term interest rate assumption. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the quarter was $3.4 billion, or approximately $1.3 billion higher than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net investment gains of $1.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion relates to the sale of our Property and Casualty business to Farmers Insurance. 
Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continued to perform as expected. Additionally, adjusted earnings include one notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. As I previously noted, there was one notable item of $66 million in 2Q of '21 and no notable items for the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item was $2.30, benefiting from strong returns in our private equity portfolio, which drove most of the year-over-year variance. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were flat year-over-year as volume growth and the Versant Health acquisition largely offset unfavorable underwriting margins. Group's life mortality improved sequentially but remain elevated in the quarter. I will discuss in more detail shortly. 
Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.8% in 2Q of '21, within its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 58.5%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. We've seen a return to more normal utilization rates for nonmedical health and expect this trend to continue. Therefore, we expect the interest-adjusted benefit ratio to remain within its annual target range for the remainder of the year. 
Overall, business fundamentals for group benefits remain healthy, highlighted by strong top line growth and persistency. Group Benefit sales were up 39% year-to-date, primarily due to higher genral case activity and remain on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. 
Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Several factors contributed to the strong year-over-year growth, including a $500 million impact relating to dental premium credits and the establishment of a dental unearned premium reserve both reducing premiums in the second quarter of 2020, which collectively contributed 13 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. In addition, 4 percentage points were related to higher premiums in the current quarter from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. 
After considering these factors, underlying PFO growth for Group Benefits was roughly 12% and driven by solid volume growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary and the addition of Versant Health. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, while Group Benefits reported PFO growth rates will be impacted by the dental unearned premium reserve release in Q3 and Q4, we expect the underlying PFO growth to maintain its strength and resilience for the remainder of 2021. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $654 million, up $462 million year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income largely due to strong private equity returns. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins compared to 2Q of '20. RIS investment spreads were 224 basis points, up 199 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points, up 13 basis points year-over-year due in part to sustained paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage-backed securities, a partial recovery in real estate equities and lower LIBOR rates. 
RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 8% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. 
With regards to pension risk transfers, we continue to see a robust PRT pipeline. 
Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were up 103% and 91% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis which were up 7% and 6% on a constant currency basis. Additionally, while against a weak 2Q of '20, Asia sales were up 42% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, demonstrating the resiliency in the business. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 27% and 38% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and unfavorable equity markets related to the Chilean encaje, which had a negative 1.5% return in the quarter versus a positive 14% in 2Q of '20. This was partially offset by favorable investment margins. 
COVID-19-related claims improved sequentially. The impact on Latin America's second quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $66 million after tax. While Latin America's bottom line has been dampened by the elevated COVID-19-related claims, the underlying fundamentals of the business remain robust as evidenced by strong sales and persistency throughout the region. 
Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 55% driven by solid growth in all markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 19% and 23% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by higher COVID-19-related claims in the current period compared to low utilization in the prior year period. Solid volume growth was a partial offset. 
The current quarter has also benefited from a favorable refinement to an unearned premium reserve positively impacting adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings by approximately $15 million after tax. In addition, Poland and Greece contribute roughly 10% to run rate earnings that will be reported in divested businesses beginning in the third quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 8% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 20% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher credit life sales in Turkey and solid growth in U.K. Employee Benefits. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up $515 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. In addition, Life underwriting margins were favorable. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 47.1%, lower than the prior year quarter of 59.1% and below our annual target range of 50% to 55%.
 Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding the favorable notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release, was $126 million. This result compared favorably to the adjusted loss of $289 million in 2Q of '20 due to higher net investment income, lower expenses and lower preferred stock dividends. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. The Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3% in the second quarter of 2021, which is above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 2Q of '21 were roughly 4.5 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $75 million after tax. 
Additionally, the quarter included a higher level of life claims above $2.5 million and an additional level of excess mortality that appears to be COVID related. These collectively impacted the ratio by an additional 2.7 percentage points or $40 million after tax. 
There were approximately 50,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. in the second quarter of '21. While still elevated, total deaths have moderated versus the prior year and sequential quarters. Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19-related deaths and group benefits to continue to trend lower. 
Now let's turn to Page 6. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the last 5 quarters, including approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 9.7% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. 
Our second quarter results are essentially in line with PE industry benchmarks. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 22% of our PE account balance of $11.3 billion, were the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 19% quarterly return. 
On Page 7, second quarter VII of $950 million post tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each, although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. VII results in 2Q of '21 were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters and full year 2020, including 11.4% in the second quarter of '21. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. 
In 2Q of '21, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline as well as lower employee-related benefits in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be elevated compared to the first half of 2021 due to timing of investments and seasonality. But as Michel noted, we expect full year '21 and '22 direct expense ratio to beat our 12.3% guidance. 
Now I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $3.8 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the proceeds received from our P&C sale to Farmers Insurance of $3.9 billion. In addition, holdco cash includes the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, a $500 million redemption of preferred stock, share repurchases of $1.1 billion as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.8 billion, while net income was approximately $1.6 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year, driven by lower variable annuity rider reserves and an increase in investment margin. 
Year-to-date 2021 net income decreased by $286 million as compared to the first half of 2020. The primary drivers were derivative losses mostly offset by increases in operating earnings and net investment gains in the current 6-month period compared to large derivative gains in the prior year 6-month period. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.5 billion as of June 30, 2021, up 9% compared to December 31, 2020, when excluding our P&C business sold to farmers. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 873% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The sequential decline in the Japan SMR from 967% at December 31 reflects seasonal dividends and the rise in U.S. interest rates in the quarter ending March 31. 
In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter driven by exceptional private equity returns, good business fundamentals, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While higher mortality due to COVID-19 has masked the earnings power of Group Benefits in Latin America, the strength of these franchises remain healthy and intact. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and position us for success. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And I think as Michel said in his opening remarks, this has really become part of our culture, and it's a cultural shift that we've made. Our efficiency mindset is built into our strategy. It's built into our everyday activities. And I think the results are -- kind of speak for themselves. 
As I mentioned, in this quarter, there's a few timing-related items. So we do see an uptick in expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half. We did have some benefit from some employee-related costs, particularly as they relate to the impact of how markets move. And so that came -- that was a benefit this quarter. And then there's seasonality with regards to preferred stock dividends. So the second and the fourth quarter typically are low quarters for those dividends. 
As we look to the second half of this year, directionally speaking, we would see -- just typically do see seasonally higher expenses in the second half. Some of it is related, obviously, to our group business and the enrollment activities we go through. And oftentimes, too, there's been some delays just as a result of a number of activities going on in some of the investments. So we do see kind of an uptick. 
Having said that, one of the things that we both pointed out is our expectation, which is different than where we were on our outlook call in February, is to now be under our 12.3% guidance despite the removal of our Property & Casualty business, which had a lower expense ratio. 
So all in all, I think our efficiency mindset just built into the culture. It's all working. And we expect that to continue as we look forward. I think I would probably stop there on your last question and probably leave that for another day."

And I'll essentially just give you a bit of a walk from the headline number of 94.3% in terms of the major drivers of that. 
So the first is COVID-related COVID deaths in the quarter. That's the $50,000 population -- 50,000 population death number impacting our portfolio. And that's worth about 4.5 points, as John pointed out. 
There's another piece in the quarter, which is that from time to time, we do experience higher volume of claims with larger face amounts, which does impact our mortality ratio. This is non-COVID related. And that was about -- worth about a point to our loss ratio in this quarter. 
And then the third piece of this is when we look at our claims data, we did see an increase in certain death codes, which are highly correlated to COVID. So while the cause of death for those claims is not explicitly stated as COVID, that excess mortality does appear to be COVID related. And that was worth another 1.7% on our ratio. 
So if I think about the quarter and looking forward, there are probably 2 headlines I'd leave you with. One is that if you strip out those 3 factors, our loss ratio is very close to the midpoint of our range. And the second headline is that we have seen significant declines in deaths in Q2 versus Q1. We've also seen sequential declines in deaths month-on-month continuing into July. 
So despite the current uncertainty with the Delta variant, we're also encouraged by the increase in the pace of vaccination. We're encouraged by the actions undertaken by many large employers, which are impacting the vaccination rates for that insured population. So sitting here in August on a go-forward basis, we do think that the impact of the pandemic will gradually subside. And you should expect from a run rate perspective, our loss ratio to return back to pre-pandemic levels."

How should we think about that from a timing standpoint? Because tell me if I'm thinking about this right. It definitely creates near-term gains. And I presume with rates remaining low, that's going to remain strong. So probably the base spread in that business will remain strong, assuming mortgage prepaid remain high. 
But then there's sort of the back-end question, which is as we kind of go -- as this levels off and diminishes, then there's the reinvestment pressure that kind of emerges. So would you ultimately expect this to be a negative for base spreads? And if so, when would we likely see that?"

So it's a number of factors, right? We got lower LIBOR year-over-year. You have a partial recovery in real estate equity returns. We saw -- we've had very good, strong new business spreads as particularly -- or I should say, in RIS there. 
And then as you said, the last thing is we've seen elevated levels of the residential mortgage paydown activity. I would use the word paydown just to not confuse that with prepayment fees that we categorize in VII. 
And so what that really is, is that, that acceleration of the recognition of income on those securities that were purchased at a discount previously. So we do think this will stay elevated. I think it's a combination of low rates coupled with the home price appreciation that we've seen in a lot of markets. So that has spurred others. And I think also, if you think of it in combination with more remote work opportunities, there's been probably some movement in terms of the residential housing market. 
So we do see that continuing particularly, although they've probably peaked, the time between when action occurs and when it hits our securities or mortgage loans is usually a 2 to 5-month lag. So we think the second half of the year, we'll still see an elevated level, maybe not to this level that we saw in the second quarter. We expect it to probably be somewhat less than that. 
But -- so that's kind of our expectation. As you look forward, look, this is all just part of our broader portfolio. And I wouldn't say this in and of itself is going to change the trajectory. I think what it's done is it's changed the trajectory upwards. We don't consider that to be a long-term trend, probably remains a trend for the remainder of this year but probably goes back to more baseline run rate in '22."

So certainly, we have to think about sequential in the context of overall sales environment in which we're in. So if I take a step back, if you don't mind me, and think about this in the overall Asia context, overall, Asia, we did well this quarter, 42% up year-over-year, 71% in Japan, 11% in Asia ex Japan, still positive in Asia ex Japan as well. And this is despite COVID spurts in many of our markets. And if you take the first half, all in total, we have a 25% year-over-year collectively for the first half. And so there are a number of reasons, which certainly drove that strong performance. 
On a sequential basis -- and if you look at Japan, and I'll come to other Asia very quickly. And if you look at the sequentially both on the life side and as well as the A&H sales, we were up, right? And that speaks to the resilience of our face-to-face channels in our markets in Japan, in particular. And the pressure on a sequential basis came in from the annuities because the banker channel is certainly -- they have a March end. And so therefore, they're much stronger on the banker side. And that's what the annuity shows drop sequentially. 
On other Asia, if you think about it, this is -- COVID is playing out significantly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. There's a fair amount of pressure in all these markets. And we're very much a face-to-face sales business, and that certainly is weighing in despite, by the way, all our efforts in terms of strong execution, our success of our new products. And certainly, our digitization efforts are paying off as well. 
Now as I said, this corporate uncertainty is continuing on. And a vast majority of our market significantly lagged the U.S., say, for example, in terms of vaccination rate. And right now, because of the resurgence of COVID in some of our markets, social distancing measures are being reintroduced, right? 
So while we did well year-over-year in other Asia, sequentially, we've been impacted. And both in Japan and other Asia, we expect to see Q3 sales to be sequentially flat to Q2 as well. But considering everything at this point, if you think about our guidance for the full year, we expect to be on track to meet the double-digit guidance that we provided in February. I hope that helps."

On the LTC side metrics, there was -- it was really -- there was no material positive from LTC. It was in line with expectations. What we're seeing is that -- and I'd say in line with, I'll say, pre-pandemic expectations. And so what we're seeing is metrics and results really trending back towards those pre-COVID levels. 
New claims are, I'd say, marginally below trend, but all indications are showing that we'll be back to trend very soon. The only metric that's lagging -- but again, I will say, trending back to pre-pandemic is the relationship of home care versus nursing home claims.

As I sort of referenced before, it's predominantly a protection business with high free cash flow generation. So it plays a role in terms of -- and how it contributes to the enterprise. 
Since the Alico acquisition, we've reduced our footprint globally in terms of the markets that we're in. We were in 66 markets. We're now in 40. And so this sort of -- the process that we are committed to, which is to continue to look at our businesses through the lens of strategic fit in terms of whether they clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate, whether we see a path to them achieving that and achieving scale, I think that applies sort of across the board. And I expect us to continue to look at our portfolio through that lens. But nothing in particular that I would point to in terms of EMEA. 
I think if you think about Poland and Greece, those were 2 businesses that sat outside of our European super carrier. As you know, we have an efficient operating model in EMEA, especially in Europe, where we -- all of our businesses are branches of our Irish entity. Poland and Greece were both subsidiaries that sat outside of that. So in a way, this transaction helps us simplify the region and the business operationally. 
But I think in terms of the market environment, I mean we continue to see sort of -- we were not the first company to divest from Poland. There was -- Aviva was also -- had a transaction prior to that. So there continues to be interest by mainly European players in terms of opportunities in those markets. That's what I would sort of point to there."

MetLife's outstanding financial results in the second quarter provide further evidence of the tremendous progress we're making on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We're continuing to focus with the rig",1559,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife's outstanding financial results in the second quarter provide further evidence of the tremendous progress we're making on the pillars of our Next Horizon strategy. We're continuing to focus with the right capital allocation and investment decisions. We're continuing to simplify with exceptional expense discipline. And we're continuing to differentiate with enhancements to our market-leading group benefits platform that are helping to drive record sales. 
When it comes to our strategy, we've transitioned from a period of execution risk to one of additional opportunity. Net income in the second quarter was $3.4 billion, up from $68 million a year ago. The primary drivers were growth in adjusted earnings, the gain we booked on the sale of our Auto & Home business and derivative gains in the current quarter relative to derivative losses a year ago. 
Strong net income drove book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA growth of 8%. Adjusted earnings in the second quarter were $2.1 billion or $2.37 per share, up 186% from $0.83 per share a year ago. As in the first quarter, our investment portfolio generated exceptionally strong variable investment income. Private equity remains the key driver of VII. 
As you know, private equity returns are reported on a 1-quarter lag, so the strong Q2 performance reflected gains from Q1. We reported private equity gains of 9.7% in the second quarter compared with a negative 8.2% a year ago. Equity markets continued to perform well from April through June, which we anticipate being reflected in our Q3 earnings. 
When we unveiled our Next Horizon strategy at Investor Day in December 2019, we pointed to the scale and expertise that we have in investments as a competitive advantage for MetLife. The strategic approach we have taken on private equity is a case in point. Our decision to sell most of our $2.5 billion hedge fund portfolio and increase the allocation to private equity has provided a better match for our long-dated liabilities while creating significant value for our shareholders. 
This was no accident, but the latest in a series of successful investment decisions from derisking our portfolio ahead of the financial crisis to selling Peter Cooper Village Stuyvesant Town near a market top. 
Turning to our reporting segments. John McCallion will provide a complete overview shortly. I would like to focus on how our results show that COVID-19 is both still with us but lessening in its impact. 
From an underwriting perspective, we've seen a sizable improvement, but we are still experiencing excess mortality. In the quarter, the Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3%, below the 106.3% from last quarter but still above the top end of our guidance range. In Latin America, we had $66 million of COVID losses, again, below the $150 million of COVID losses from Q1 but still above normal. Yet, at the same time, COVID-19's economic group is easing somewhat. At MetLife, we see this emerging in sales trends. 
In the U.S. group business, sales through the first half of 2021 are 39% higher than they were in the first half of 2020. And if current trends hold, 2021 will be a record sales year. In Latin America, sales are up 55% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Asia sales are up 42%, while EMEA sales are up 20%. 
By their nature, claims are a backward-looking indicator and sales are a forward-looking indicator. So while we are not out of the woods, we are starting to see a clearing in the trees ahead. The path of the pandemic is something outside of our control. But as we have demonstrated over the past 1.5 years, we are not standing still. We are moving ahead with urgency to accelerate our strategy. 
To further differentiate our Group Benefits business, we acquired Versant Health and immediately became the third largest vision care provider in the United States. Versant has now been part of our results for 2 quarters. And in Q2, it contributed 6 points of year-over-year growth in U.S. group premiums, fees and other revenues consistent with our expectations. 
Year-over-year, requests for vision care proposals are up more than 20% among our national account customers. We are pleased with how our new vision care offering is performing in the marketplace and expect it to contribute meaningfully to growth going forward. 
Similarly, we have enhanced our pet insurance offering to make it even more attractive to customers. We now offer telehealth concierge services, rollover benefits from the prior year and family plans covering multiple paths. And what we believe is the first for the industry. We also cover preexisting conditions when an employee switches to MetLife pet insurance from another carrier as long as the condition was covered by the prior plan. More than 500 employers now offer MetLife pet insurance as a voluntary benefit to their employees, and we believe our best-in-class product will continue to make gains in this highly attractive and underpenetrated market. 
To strengthen our focus, we made a decision to sell our businesses in Poland and Greece to an end group. This was another promise we made at Investor Day, to continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and ability to achieve scale and clear our hurdle rate. Since that time, we have sold or reached agreements to sell our businesses in 4 markets, and we will continue to apply this disciplined approach. 
In early April, we also closed on the sale of our Auto & Home business to Farmers Insurance for $3.94 billion in cash. The 10-year strategic partnership we forged allows each company to focus on its core strength. Farmers 90 years of P&C underwriting and service excellence and MetLife's unrivaled distribution reach in the U.S. group benefits space. 
The simplified pillar of our strategy was evident in our exceptional expense management. In the quarter, we delivered a direct expense ratio of 11.4%, and we now expect to beat our 12.3% target ratio, not only for all of 2021 but for 2022 as well. We are making this commitment despite selling our Auto & Home business, which operated at a lower expense ratio than the overall enterprise. 
As we have said many times, we are embedding an efficiency mindset across everything we do. It is central to our ability to deliver continuous improvement. At MetLife, we no longer have expense reduction programs. We do not need them. What we have instead is a publicly disclosed direct expense ratio target that we have brought down by 200 basis points over the past 5 years and promise to keep there. This is how we hold ourselves accountable, and this is how investors can hold us accountable as well. 
Our strategic decision to sell Auto & Home contributed to a $6.5 billion cash buffer as of June 30, well above our target range. We repurchased $1.1 billion of common shares in the second quarter and another $248 million of common shares so far in the third. And yesterday, our Board approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. This is on top of the $475 million we have remaining on our December 2020 authorization. 
We believe that investing in responsible growth, steadily increasing our common dividend and buying back common stock are all vital parts of a balanced approach to creating long-term shareholder value. COVID-19 continues to present MetLife with the opportunity and the obligation to step up for our employees, our customers and our communities. That work is ongoing. We are in a new phase of the pandemic. The primary focus now is on vaccinating as many people as possible. Nothing will do more to prevent needless deaths and a potential resurgence of the lockdown measures that caused so much economic harm. 
As we did over 100 years ago with our visiting nurses program, MetLife has mobilized to make a positive contribution to advance public health. First and foremost, this means doing all we can to give our own employees and their families access to the vaccines. Examples from our markets include giving employees paid leave to get vaccinated, covering vaccine-related expenses such as travel and childcare and holding free vaccine clinics for employees and their families in locations as varied as Oriskany, New York and Osaka, Japan but it also means helping to vaccinate the broader population as well. 
In Nagasaki, Japan, we've opened 6,500 square feet of our headquarters as a free vaccination site. MetLife Foundation has committed $500,000 to delivering vaccines to underserved communities across the U.S., and our medically trained staff are volunteering to administer doses at vaccine sites. 
In closing, to perform as well as we have through a pandemic highlights some fundamental truth about MetLife. We have an all-weather strategy that holds up well to stress. We have an investment portfolio that captures meaningful upside. We have competitive advantages that enable us to grow in the most attractive markets, and we have a relentless focus on execution. 
At our 2019 Investor Day, we said our Next Horizon strategy would generate tangible benefits for shareholders, a 12% to 14% adjusted ROE, $20 billion of distributable cash over 5 years and an additional $1 billion of operating leverage to self-fund growth. We are on track to meet every one of those commitments. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to John."
185648,1673288848,2365150,"MetLife, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Please note in the appendix, we have also provided an updated 25",2046,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 2Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our cash and capital positions. Please note in the appendix, we have also provided an updated 25 basis point sensitivity for our U.S. long-term interest rate assumption. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the quarter was $3.4 billion, or approximately $1.3 billion higher than adjusted earnings. This variance was primarily due to net investment gains of $1.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion relates to the sale of our Property and Casualty business to Farmers Insurance. 
Our investment portfolio and our hedging program continued to perform as expected. Additionally, adjusted earnings include one notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. As I previously noted, there was one notable item of $66 million in 2Q of '21 and no notable items for the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the notable item was $2.30, benefiting from strong returns in our private equity portfolio, which drove most of the year-over-year variance. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were flat year-over-year as volume growth and the Versant Health acquisition largely offset unfavorable underwriting margins. Group's life mortality improved sequentially but remain elevated in the quarter. I will discuss in more detail shortly. 
Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 73.8% in 2Q of '21, within its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 58.5%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. We've seen a return to more normal utilization rates for nonmedical health and expect this trend to continue. Therefore, we expect the interest-adjusted benefit ratio to remain within its annual target range for the remainder of the year. 
Overall, business fundamentals for group benefits remain healthy, highlighted by strong top line growth and persistency. Group Benefit sales were up 39% year-to-date, primarily due to higher genral case activity and remain on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021. 
Adjusted PFOs were $5.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Several factors contributed to the strong year-over-year growth, including a $500 million impact relating to dental premium credits and the establishment of a dental unearned premium reserve both reducing premiums in the second quarter of 2020, which collectively contributed 13 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. In addition, 4 percentage points were related to higher premiums in the current quarter from participating contracts, which can fluctuate with claim experience. 
After considering these factors, underlying PFO growth for Group Benefits was roughly 12% and driven by solid volume growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary and the addition of Versant Health. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, while Group Benefits reported PFO growth rates will be impacted by the dental unearned premium reserve release in Q3 and Q4, we expect the underlying PFO growth to maintain its strength and resilience for the remainder of 2021. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $654 million, up $462 million year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income largely due to strong private equity returns. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins compared to 2Q of '20. RIS investment spreads were 224 basis points, up 199 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points, up 13 basis points year-over-year due in part to sustained paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage-backed securities, a partial recovery in real estate equities and lower LIBOR rates. 
RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, grew 8% year-over-year due to strong volume growth across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. 
With regards to pension risk transfers, we continue to see a robust PRT pipeline. 
Moving to Asia, adjusted earnings were up 103% and 91% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis which were up 7% and 6% on a constant currency basis. Additionally, while against a weak 2Q of '20, Asia sales were up 42% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, demonstrating the resiliency in the business. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 27% and 38% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and unfavorable equity markets related to the Chilean encaje, which had a negative 1.5% return in the quarter versus a positive 14% in 2Q of '20. This was partially offset by favorable investment margins. 
COVID-19-related claims improved sequentially. The impact on Latin America's second quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $66 million after tax. While Latin America's bottom line has been dampened by the elevated COVID-19-related claims, the underlying fundamentals of the business remain robust as evidenced by strong sales and persistency throughout the region. 
Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 55% driven by solid growth in all markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were down 19% and 23% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by higher COVID-19-related claims in the current period compared to low utilization in the prior year period. Solid volume growth was a partial offset. 
The current quarter has also benefited from a favorable refinement to an unearned premium reserve positively impacting adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings by approximately $15 million after tax. In addition, Poland and Greece contribute roughly 10% to run rate earnings that will be reported in divested businesses beginning in the third quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 8% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 20% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher credit life sales in Turkey and solid growth in U.K. Employee Benefits. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up $515 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. In addition, Life underwriting margins were favorable. The life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 47.1%, lower than the prior year quarter of 59.1% and below our annual target range of 50% to 55%.
 Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding the favorable notable item of $66 million related to a legal reserve release, was $126 million. This result compared favorably to the adjusted loss of $289 million in 2Q of '20 due to higher net investment income, lower expenses and lower preferred stock dividends. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 21.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
Now I will provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 5. The Group Life mortality ratio was 94.3% in the second quarter of 2021, which is above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 2Q of '21 were roughly 4.5 percentage points, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $75 million after tax. 
Additionally, the quarter included a higher level of life claims above $2.5 million and an additional level of excess mortality that appears to be COVID related. These collectively impacted the ratio by an additional 2.7 percentage points or $40 million after tax. 
There were approximately 50,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. in the second quarter of '21. While still elevated, total deaths have moderated versus the prior year and sequential quarters. Looking ahead, we expect COVID-19-related deaths and group benefits to continue to trend lower. 
Now let's turn to Page 6. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the last 5 quarters, including approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 9.7% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. 
Our second quarter results are essentially in line with PE industry benchmarks. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 22% of our PE account balance of $11.3 billion, were the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 19% quarterly return. 
On Page 7, second quarter VII of $950 million post tax is shown by segment. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for approximately 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each, although it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. VII results in 2Q of '21 were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of the venture capital funds that I referenced earlier. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters and full year 2020, including 11.4% in the second quarter of '21. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. 
In 2Q of '21, our favorable direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline as well as lower employee-related benefits in the quarter. We expect the direct expense ratio for the remainder of 2021 to be elevated compared to the first half of 2021 due to timing of investments and seasonality. But as Michel noted, we expect full year '21 and '22 direct expense ratio to beat our 12.3% guidance. 
Now I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $3.8 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily due to the proceeds received from our P&C sale to Farmers Insurance of $3.9 billion. In addition, holdco cash includes the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, a $500 million redemption of preferred stock, share repurchases of $1.1 billion as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.8 billion, while net income was approximately $1.6 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year, driven by lower variable annuity rider reserves and an increase in investment margin. 
Year-to-date 2021 net income decreased by $286 million as compared to the first half of 2020. The primary drivers were derivative losses mostly offset by increases in operating earnings and net investment gains in the current 6-month period compared to large derivative gains in the prior year 6-month period. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.5 billion as of June 30, 2021, up 9% compared to December 31, 2020, when excluding our P&C business sold to farmers. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 873% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. The sequential decline in the Japan SMR from 967% at December 31 reflects seasonal dividends and the rise in U.S. interest rates in the quarter ending March 31. 
In summary, MetLife delivered another strong quarter driven by exceptional private equity returns, good business fundamentals, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While higher mortality due to COVID-19 has masked the earnings power of Group Benefits in Latin America, the strength of these franchises remain healthy and intact.

And I think as Michel said in his opening remarks, this has really become part of our culture, and it's a cultural shift that we've made. Our efficiency mindset is built into our strategy. It's built into our everyday activities. And I think the results are -- kind of speak for themselves. 
As I mentioned, in this quarter, there's a few timing-related items. So we do see an uptick in expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half. We did have some benefit from some employee-related costs, particularly as they relate to the impact of how markets move. And so that came -- that was a benefit this quarter. And then there's seasonality with regards to preferred stock dividends. So the second and the fourth quarter typically are low quarters for those dividends. 
As we look to the second half of this year, directionally speaking, we would see -- just typically do see seasonally higher expenses in the second half. Some of it is related, obviously, to our group business and the enrollment activities we go through. And oftentimes, too, there's been some delays just as a result of a number of activities going on in some of the investments. So we do see kind of an uptick. 
Having said that, one of the things that we both pointed out is our expectation, which is different than where we were on our outlook call in February, is to now be under our 12.3% guidance despite the removal of our Property & Casualty business, which had a lower expense ratio. 
So all in all, I think our efficiency mindset just built into the culture. It's all working. And we expect that to continue as we look forward. I think I would probably stop there on your last question and probably leave that for another day."

And I'll essentially just give you a bit of a walk from the headline number of 94.3% in terms of the major drivers of that. 
So the first is COVID-related COVID deaths in the quarter. That's the $50,000 population -- 50,000 population death number impacting our portfolio. And that's worth about 4.5 points, as John pointed out. 
There's another piece in the quarter, which is that from time to time, we do experience higher volume of claims with larger face amounts, which does impact our mortality ratio. This is non-COVID related. And that was about -- worth about a point to our loss ratio in this quarter. 
And then the third piece of this is when we look at our claims data, we did see an increase in certain death codes, which are highly correlated to COVID. So while the cause of death for those claims is not explicitly stated as COVID, that excess mortality does appear to be COVID related. And that was worth another 1.7% on our ratio. 
So if I think about the quarter and looking forward, there are probably 2 headlines I'd leave you with. One is that if you strip out those 3 factors, our loss ratio is very close to the midpoint of our range. And the second headline is that we have seen significant declines in deaths in Q2 versus Q1. We've also seen sequential declines in deaths month-on-month continuing into July. 
So despite the current uncertainty with the Delta variant, we're also encouraged by the increase in the pace of vaccination. We're encouraged by the actions undertaken by many large employers, which are impacting the vaccination rates for that insured population. So sitting here in August on a go-forward basis, we do think that the impact of the pandemic will gradually subside. And you should expect from a run rate perspective, our loss ratio to return back to pre-pandemic levels."

How should we think about that from a timing standpoint? Because tell me if I'm thinking about this right. It definitely creates near-term gains. And I presume with rates remaining low, that's going to remain strong. So probably the base spread in that business will remain strong, assuming mortgage prepaid remain high. 
But then there's sort of the back-end question, which is as we kind of go -- as this levels off and diminishes, then there's the reinvestment pressure that kind of emerges. So would you ultimately expect this to be a negative for base spreads? And if so, when would we likely see that?"

So it's a number of factors, right? We got lower LIBOR year-over-year. You have a partial recovery in real estate equity returns. We saw -- we've had very good, strong new business spreads as particularly -- or I should say, in RIS there. 
And then as you said, the last thing is we've seen elevated levels of the residential mortgage paydown activity. I would use the word paydown just to not confuse that with prepayment fees that we categorize in VII. 
And so what that really is, is that, that acceleration of the recognition of income on those securities that were purchased at a discount previously. So we do think this will stay elevated. I think it's a combination of low rates coupled with the home price appreciation that we've seen in a lot of markets. So that has spurred others. And I think also, if you think of it in combination with more remote work opportunities, there's been probably some movement in terms of the residential housing market. 
So we do see that continuing particularly, although they've probably peaked, the time between when action occurs and when it hits our securities or mortgage loans is usually a 2 to 5-month lag. So we think the second half of the year, we'll still see an elevated level, maybe not to this level that we saw in the second quarter. We expect it to probably be somewhat less than that. 
But -- so that's kind of our expectation. As you look forward, look, this is all just part of our broader portfolio. And I wouldn't say this in and of itself is going to change the trajectory. I think what it's done is it's changed the trajectory upwards. We don't consider that to be a long-term trend, probably remains a trend for the remainder of this year but probably goes back to more baseline run rate in '22."

So certainly, we have to think about sequential in the context of overall sales environment in which we're in. So if I take a step back, if you don't mind me, and think about this in the overall Asia context, overall, Asia, we did well this quarter, 42% up year-over-year, 71% in Japan, 11% in Asia ex Japan, still positive in Asia ex Japan as well. And this is despite COVID spurts in many of our markets. And if you take the first half, all in total, we have a 25% year-over-year collectively for the first half. And so there are a number of reasons, which certainly drove that strong performance. 
On a sequential basis -- and if you look at Japan, and I'll come to other Asia very quickly. And if you look at the sequentially both on the life side and as well as the A&H sales, we were up, right? And that speaks to the resilience of our face-to-face channels in our markets in Japan, in particular. And the pressure on a sequential basis came in from the annuities because the banker channel is certainly -- they have a March end. And so therefore, they're much stronger on the banker side. And that's what the annuity shows drop sequentially. 
On other Asia, if you think about it, this is -- COVID is playing out significantly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. There's a fair amount of pressure in all these markets. And we're very much a face-to-face sales business, and that certainly is weighing in despite, by the way, all our efforts in terms of strong execution, our success of our new products. And certainly, our digitization efforts are paying off as well. 
Now as I said, this corporate uncertainty is continuing on. And a vast majority of our market significantly lagged the U.S., say, for example, in terms of vaccination rate. And right now, because of the resurgence of COVID in some of our markets, social distancing measures are being reintroduced, right? 
So while we did well year-over-year in other Asia, sequentially, we've been impacted. And both in Japan and other Asia, we expect to see Q3 sales to be sequentially flat to Q2 as well. But considering everything at this point, if you think about our guidance for the full year, we expect to be on track to meet the double-digit guidance that we provided in February. I hope that helps."

On the LTC side metrics, there was -- it was really -- there was no material positive from LTC. It was in line with expectations. What we're seeing is that -- and I'd say in line with, I'll say, pre-pandemic expectations. And so what we're seeing is metrics and results really trending back towards those pre-COVID levels. 
New claims are, I'd say, marginally below trend, but all indications are showing that we'll be back to trend very soon. The only metric that's lagging -- but again, I will say, trending back to pre-pandemic is the relationship of home care versus nursing home claims.

You see we're on track for a record year in terms of sales in 2021. And a lot of that activity happened in 2020, if you think about this in terms of when these cases came to market and our dialogue with the employers. 
So from that perspective, we have not seen a real disruption, and we're very, very pleased with our sales results the year. And as John and Michel referenced, we're on track for a record year in group sales. And our national account segment is an important driver of that, and so is our momentum in voluntary, where we're less reliant on face-to-face distribution given the digital capabilities that we have and that has continued to drive our sales momentum there. 
The last thing I would just say is if you just really take a big step back, think about the impacts that COVID had on the environment, we've seen a significant increase in awareness on the part of employees for needs of protection for obvious reasons. But we've also seen employers be really, really focused on benefits as a key lever in terms of engaging with their talent. So we're seeing very high receptivity and more strategic dialogue, I would say, with some of the large employers on how to utilize those benefits to attract, retain and motivate talent."

And they're going to drive momentum going forward. 
With respect to the sales numbers, I would also just remind you that the sales in the jumbo market can be lumpy from year to year. So you saw a dip in 2020. You saw a spike in '21. So some of those can be lumpy year-over-year from a jumbo perspective. But the secular trends on employer and employee I think we're seeing, and we're seeing providing overall tailwinds for our business here."

As I sort of referenced before, it's predominantly a protection business with high free cash flow generation. So it plays a role in terms of -- and how it contributes to the enterprise. 
Since the Alico acquisition, we've reduced our footprint globally in terms of the markets that we're in. We were in 66 markets. We're now in 40. And so this sort of -- the process that we are committed to, which is to continue to look at our businesses through the lens of strategic fit in terms of whether they clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate, whether we see a path to them achieving that and achieving scale, I think that applies sort of across the board. And I expect us to continue to look at our portfolio through that lens. But nothing in particular that I would point to in terms of EMEA. 
I think if you think about Poland and Greece, those were 2 businesses that sat outside of our European super carrier. As you know, we have an efficient operating model in EMEA, especially in Europe, where we -- all of our businesses are branches of our Irish entity. Poland and Greece were both subsidiaries that sat outside of that. So in a way, this transaction helps us simplify the region and the business operationally. 
But I think in terms of the market environment, I mean we continue to see sort of -- we were not the first company to divest from Poland. There was -- Aviva was also -- had a transaction prior to that. So there continues to be interest by mainly European players in terms of opportunities in those markets. That's what I would sort of point to there."

As I reflect on the journey MetLife has been on these past 2 years, I am more convinced than ever that we are focused on what matters most. We are a purpose-driven company at a time when stakeholders will accept nothing less. We have the right strategy to see us through even the most turbulent environments, and we have a strong culture of execution that gives our shareholders confidence. All of these attributes were on display in the third quarter of 2021. 
Starting with our financial results. Adjusted earnings were $2.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.39, up 38% year-over-year. Excluding total notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 24% and adjusted EPS was up 31%. 
Looking at the quarterly performance of the enterprise as a whole, variable investment income was outstanding, underlying PFOs were strong and expense disciplined held firm. The main area where we have seen headwinds is from elevated COVID claims. 
In key respects, the third quarter of 2021 looks very much like the first quarter with exceptionally strong VII more than offsetting excess mortality. 
On the investment side, our private equity portfolio returned $1.5 billion in Q3, its highest quarterly contribution in 2021 and the major contributor to VII, which was well above the top end of our implied quarterly guidance range. 
On underwriting in our U.S. business, the Group Life mortality ratio was elevated at 106.2% in Q3 on higher claim severity and frequency due to a shift younger in the age distribution of COVID deaths. 
Our Latin America business incurred COVID losses of $137 million in Q3. Two aspects of our underwriting results are noteworthy. From a social perspective, paying COVID claims is precisely how life insurance companies make a positive difference in the world. The human toll of the pandemic on families is catastrophic but where life insurance is present, the financial burden is eased. This is our purpose to help prepare the financial damage after lives most destabilizing moments. Pandemic to date, in our U.S. group business, we've incurred U.S. life claims of around $2.1 billion. Life insurance is not like other businesses where losses are just losses. 
Every underwriting claim represents a beneficiary who is receiving the financial help they were promised. From a financial perspective, even though our Life businesses have been hit with the most severe pandemic in more than 100 years, they remain profitable. MetLife has actually paid out more in COVID-related claims in 2021 than we did in 2020. And yet, our adjusted earnings per share are higher this year than last year, as is our adjusted return on equity. 
What has enhanced MetLife's capacity to pay outsized claims while still generating exceptional earnings is our strategic decision to allocate a prudent portion of our investment portfolio to private equity. While not a direct COVID offset, the valuation of our PE and VC funds with significant technology exposure has benefited from global capital flows to this growth sector. The return on our PE portfolio in the quarter was an outstanding [ 12.6% ] and stands at approximately 36% year-to-date. The gains on our well-seasoned portfolio are not mere accounting marks. Year-to-date, we have received $1.9 billion in cash distributions from RPE funds. Since 2016, the figure is $7.6 billion. 
While we often reinvest the e-cash proceeds as funds mature and terminate, the cash generated is steady and significant. 
Turning to the underlying performance of MetLife's businesses, we are seeing solid momentum.  
In U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted PFOs grew 13% year-over-year, excluding on strong jumbo sales and persistency, and we expect to end the year near the top end of our guidance range. Involuntary benefits, which for us consists of accident and health legal plans and pet insurance, we saw strong double-digit PFO growth in the third quarter. The trend in sales is even stronger. Year-to-date, sales are up 40% over the prior period, and we remain on track for a record sales year. While group sales can fluctuate from year-to-year due to jumbo cases, we believe the robust U.S. job market and the competition for talent are creating a strong tailwind. 
In connection with open enrollment season this fall, we conducted consumer research on benefit preferences among millennials, who are now the largest age group cohort in the U.S. with more than 70 million members. Millennials are expressing strong interest in both traditional benefits such as life insurance and dental and involuntary benefits such as legal plans and pet insurance. Another top desire is for help with financial planning. 
MetLife entered the space in late September with a digital financial wellness tool called Upwise, which helps us connect with employees directly. The app is designed to address the emotional barriers to financial progress and help people tackle death, save more or even create a digital will. 
Within our RIS business, after a quiet first 3 quarters, we have already booked 4 cases totaling $3.5 billion of pension risk transfer deals in the first month of the fourth quarter. Next Tuesday marks the 100th anniversary of the first group annuity contract MetLife ever wrote with the William Rodge printing company. We are pleased to be a leader in the business of helping companies honor the retirement promises they have made to their workers. 
Last month, MetLife released the results of our annual pension risk transfer pull. We only survey companies that want to derisk. 
Of the 253 respondents, nearly 7 in 10 have pension plan assets of $500 million or more and 93% intend to divest all of the defined benefit pension liabilities at some point in the future, up from 76% in 2019. 
Elsewhere in RIS, excluding PRTs from both periods, adjusted PFOs were up 70% year-over-year. There were 2 main drivers. The first was longevity reinsurance, a market we entered in the U.K. last year. The second was post-retirement benefits, where we take on blocks of retiree life insurance from employers. This is an attractive adjacency to our group business that plays to MetLife's competitive advantages. 
In Latin America, we delivered exceptional sales growth in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In fact, sales were higher in Q3 2021 than they were in Q3 2019 before the COVID pandemic began. 
In most markets across the region, we saw double-digit growth in both sales and PFOs. 
Moving to cash and capital, MetLife ended the third quarter with $5.1 billion of cash at its holding companies. During the quarter, we paid [ 400 million  ] in common stock dividends and repurchased $1 billion worth of outstanding common shares with another [ 233 million  ] repurchased so far in Q4. We have $2.5 billion remaining on the $3 billion share repurchase authorization we announced in August. 
We are on track to return more than $5.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2021, and we continue to strive for a balanced mix between business investment and capital return. 
In 2020, for example, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders and invested approximately $5 billion in organic growth and M&A. Our test for capital deployment remains consistent. Does it clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate? As John will describe in greater detail, the new business we wrote in 2020, a period when interest rates were at all-time lows, was the most attractive of the past 5 years. It had the shortest payback period, the highest internal rate of return and the highest value of new business relative to the amount of capital deployed. This was the natural outgrowth of our Accelerating Value initiative. 
By optimizing our portfolio of businesses, shifting our product mix to be more capital efficient and fully embracing an efficiency mindset, we have consistently improved VNB over time, and it is now an integral part of our capital allocation process. 
This year, in addition to organic growth, we increased the stake in our India joint venture, PNB MetLife to 47% from 32%. India is 1 of the 5 secular growth markets we identified in our Next Horizon strategy. 
Consistent with that strategy, we are increasing our exposure to a market where PNB MetLife has access to more than 200 million customers across 15,000 sales locations. 
In September, we held an in-depth session with our Board of Directors to pressure test every aspect of our Next Horizon strategy. We've done this each year of my tenure as CEO. As representatives of our shareholders and shareholders themselves, our Board challenged us to make sure we are positioned and on track to deliver on our goals. I believe the alignment between the Board and management is as strong as it's ever been, and our shared commitments remain clear, focus on deploying capital to its best use, simplify the company to improve efficiency and the customer experience and truly differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. 
Now I'll turn it over to John for a detailed review of our quarterly performance."

I'll start with the 3Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review and updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions. 
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings. Net income in the third quarter was $1.5 billion or $541 million lower than adjusted earnings. Net derivative losses of $172 million were primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. Mission, our actuarial assumption review accounted for $76 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings. 
In total, the assumption review reduced net income by $216 million, including a notable item to adjusted earnings of $140 million. 
The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review with the breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business segment. We have kept our U.S. mean reversion interest rate unchanged at 2.75% and maintain our long-term mortality assumptions despite the near-term impacts from COVID-19. 
Most of the net income impact was in MetLife Holdings and Asia. For MetLife Holdings, the primary driver was a refinement to the variable annuity lapse rate function to better reflect policyholder behavior based on withdrawal status. 
In Asia, the largest impact was due to the lowering of the earned rate assumption in Japan, where we assume current earned rates for our long-term rate assumption. 
On Page 5, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $2.2 billion, up 24% and up 23% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong returns in our private equity portfolio. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $2.56, up 31% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis, aided by capital management. 
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. 
Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 72% year-over-year, driven by unfavorable underwriting margins in Group Life, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in 3Q of '21 at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 67.4%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. Volume growth, the addition of Versant Health and favorable expense margins were partial offsets to the decline in year-over-year results. 
Group Benefits continues to have strong top line growth. Year-to-date sales were up 40%, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter were up 13% year-over-year, driven by solid volume growth across most products, including voluntary and the addition of Versant Health. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, were up 60% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable underwriting margins and volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 256 basis points, up 100 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income. 
Spreads, excluding VII, were 93 basis points, down 5 basis points year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to lower paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, increased 4% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across the product portfolio. 
With regards to pension risk transfers, as Michelle noted, we have already completed $3.5 billion of transactions in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 31% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance, driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis. Lower accident and health utilization in the prior period was a partial offset. 
Asia sales were down 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting pressure from COVID-related lockdowns in the region. Asia year-to-date sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis and remain on target to achieve double-digit growth in 2021. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 35% and down 38% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to elevated COVID-19-related claims, mainly in Mexico. The impact to Latin America's third quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $137 million. 
While the situation remains fluid, we have seen COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths in Latin America significantly declined in October. Favorable investment in expense margins as well as lower taxes versus the prior year quarter were partial offsets. 
While Latin America's adjusted earnings have been pressured by elevated COVID-19-related claims, sales and persistency throughout the region remains strong. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 45% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across most markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis primarily driven by volume growth across the region and favorable underwriting margins, primarily in the Gulf. 
We expect EMEA adjusted earnings to decline in the fourth quarter due to the timing of certain technology investments across the region. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 2% on a constant currency basis and sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting divested businesses, partially offset by growth in Turkey and Europe. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in both periods, were up $271 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. Underwriting margins did reflect higher life claims severity than expected during the third quarter of 2021. However, the Life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 53.3% was within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. 
In addition, LTC new claims returned to more normal levels in the quarter versus very low new claims submissions in the [ prior year  ] quarter. 
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million in both periods. Lower tax benefits were mostly offset by higher net investment income year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
Now I'll provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 6. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the first 3 quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. Group Life mortality ratio is 106.2% in the third quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 3Q of '21 were roughly 18 percentage points which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $290 million. The primary drivers were higher claim frequency and severity. Approximately 40% of U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter were under age 65, about double the rate of the first quarter of this year and the highest percentage in any quarter since the pandemic began and therefore, having a greater proportional impact on the working age population. 
In addition, we estimate that the quarter included roughly 1 to 2 incremental percentage points impact on the mortality ratio from claims that appear to be COVID-related but were not specifically identified as COVID on the death certificate. 
Despite the impact from COVID, Group Benefits remains a profitable and growing business for MetLife. Group Benefits reported adjusted earnings of roughly $450 million year-to-date and adjusted PFO growth of 13%. 
Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the last 5 quarters, including approximately $1.8 billion in the third quarter. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a 12.6% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, the private equities are generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 23% of our PE account balance of $12.8 billion. We're the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 18% quarterly return. 
Page 8 highlights VII by segment for the first 3 quarters of 2021 including $1.4 billion post tax in the third quarter. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio. 
As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each, although can vary from quarter-to-quarter. The VII results in the quarter were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of venture capital funds I referenced earlier. 
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters and full year 2020, including 11.1% in the third quarter of '21. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. This did include approximately 20 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases and 20 basis points from a single premium Group Life sale in RIS. 
In addition, the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and timing of certain technology investments are expected to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Therefore, we do expect the direct expense ratio to be elevated in 4Q. 
Now let's turn to Page 10. This chart reflects new business value metrics from MetLife's major segments for the past 5 years, including an update for 2020. 
Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $3.2 billion of capital in 2020 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of 6 years. 
New business written in 2020 reflects our disciplined approach to building profitable growth while creating value, generating cash and mitigating risk. 
Despite the sales challenges in 2020 associated with lockdowns related to the pandemic, we were able to increase our value of new business and IRR while lowering our cash payback period versus 2019. 
Now I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.1 billion as of September 30, which is down from $6.5 billion at June 30 but still well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash of the holding companies include the net effects of share repurchases of $1 billion, payment of our common stock dividend of roughly $400 million, subsidiary dividends as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we had a long-term debt repayment of $500 million in the third quarter. Our next long-term debt maturity is not until September 2023. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by higher variable investment income and lower variable annuity right of reserves. Year-to-date 2021 net income increased by roughly $400 million as compared to the first 9 months of 2020. The primary drivers were higher operating earnings and net investment gains which was partially offset by derivative losses. 
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.7 billion as of September 30, 2021, up 16% compared to December 31, 2020. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was [ 960%  ] as of June 30, which is the latest public data. 
In summary, MetLife delivered another very strong quarter, driven by exceptional private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While earnings power of our group benefits in Latin America businesses has been dampened by COVID-19 excess mortality. We are pleased with the momentum behind these market-leading franchises. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success. 
Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And I can give you some color based on both the LTD and the STD portions of the book. So for the LTD side, what we saw is an incidence rate this quarter that's much more in line with our historical norms. It was higher than last year but last year was a favorable incidence here from a disability perspective. So we're seeing it tick back to where it was historically from a frequency perspective. And then the recoveries continue to be pretty strong. The other thing I would add there on the LTD side is so far, we have not seen any significant impact on the business from kind of COVID or long COVID effect, neither have we seen any material impacts from the overall economy. So it's been pretty much a return to, call it, a pre-pandemic levels as far as the LTD book. 
For the STD side, it's a bit different. So think about that 12% of disability premium, 2/3 of it is sitting in the LTD only, 1/3 of it sits in the STD. And then for that 1/3 that's in STD, about 1/2 of those employees are comprised of ASO only business. So we are administering the disability claims but not on the hook for the actual claims themselves. 
So while for the STD portion, we have seen and continue to see elevated STD COVID claims. The actual impact on the nonmedical health ratio is pretty de minimis given the composition of our book and the ASO exposure."

So let me give you some comments and then we'll see if Eric would want to add anything. Jack to public to date for a number of years now, I would say, and that debate tends to head up around elections. One thing I would say is that despite the general perception to the contrary, if you think about the pension system, I mean it's functioned quite well, and the returns have been quite good as well for the industry as a whole. The problem with the system is that due to inconsistent contributions, the fact that you have widespread in formal labor in Chile. And the contribution rates are low. That's led to sort of low projected replacement rates at retirement. The debate is continuing now with presidential elections, round 1 is in late November, and then you'll have the second round in December and different candidates are taking very different views. Some are supportive of the system, others are in favor of radical reform. So we'll have to see how that plays out. The other thing that's happening in Chile is that there's the redrafting of the constitution that's taking place that's going to play out next year as well. So we'll see what comes out of that. We are very much engaged with the local authorities. We have great relationships in Chile. We're a leading player there. As you know, we're also in collaboration with the industry, making sure that our point of view is being heard and hopefully addressed as well. And look, we're not we're in favor of reform that makes sense for the participants in the system that protects them their retirement. But we are also cautioning against any measures that ultimately do with damage Chile's capital markets as well as investor perceptions of the Chile as an investment destination. So we continue to be engaged. As you know, there's been 3 rounds of withdrawals already. There's another proposal for a fourth round of pension with roles. We see whether that got surpassed or not. Clearly, if it does, whereas these withdrawals don't have a material impact on earnings, the damage sort of the viability of the system, if you like, which is something that we advocate against. And then on the annuities front that you referenced, this -- there's been 1 withdrawal there. 
Again, we don't know if there'll be another one. I think probably our view is that the likelihood of that is not very high, but we'll have to wait and see. 
All in all, our pension business is 2% of MetLife's overall earnings. But our view is that we continue to engage, we continue to keep a close eye on the situation, and we'll have to see how this plays out over the coming weeks and months. Anything to add, Erik?"

Quite honestly, it's not much different than the trend you saw a year ago in terms of how things transpired for most of the year and then we saw an uptick. And so if we're above 12.3% in the fourth quarter by a bit, that would not be a surprise per se, but that's not our focus. So I'm just using that as an example, when you talk about the 12.3%. What's important to us is the 12.3% for the full year. And so that's kind of our mindset when we think about our expense ratio, and we continue to anticipate to be under that on a full year basis."

And so -- and at the same time, if we see headwinds in an economy, we can use that capacity as a protection for profit margins. So that's kind of our philosophy when it comes to our efficiency mindset, and I'd say nothing would kind of take us off that track at this point."

As I reflect on the journey MetLife has been on these past 2 years, I am more convinced than ever that we are focused on what matters most. We are a purpose-driven company at a time when stakeholders will accept nothing less. We have the right strategy to see us through even the most turbulent environments, and we have a strong culture of execution that gives our shareholders confidence. All of these attributes were on display in the third quarter of 2021.  
Starting with our financial results. Adjusted earnings were $2.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.39, up 38% year-over-year. Excluding total notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 24% and adjusted EPS was up 31%.  
Looking at the quarterly performance of the enterprise as a whole, variable investment income was outstanding, underlying PFOs were strong and expense disciplines held firm. The main area where we have seen headwinds is from elevated COVID claims.  
In key respects, the third quarter of 2021 looks very much like the first quarter with exceptionally strong VII more than offsetting excess mortality.  
On the investment side, our private equity portfolio returned $1.5 billion in Q3, its highest quarterly contribution in 2021 and the major contributor to VII, which was well above the top end of our implied quarterly guidance range.  
On underwriting in our U.S. business, the Group Life mortality ratio was elevated at 106.2% in Q3 on higher claim severity and frequency due to a shift younger in the age distribution of COVID deaths.  
Our Latin America business incurred COVID losses of $137 million in Q3. Two aspects of our underwriting results are noteworthy. From a social perspective, paying COVID claims is precisely how life insurance companies make a positive difference in the world. The human toll of the pandemic on families is catastrophic but where life insurance is present, the financial burden is eased. This is our purpose to help prepare the financial damage after life's most destabilizing moments. Pandemic to date, in our U.S. group business, we've incurred U.S. life claims of around $2.1 billion. Life insurance is not like other businesses where losses are just losses.  
Every underwriting claim represents a beneficiary who is receiving the financial help they were promised. From a financial perspective, even though our Life businesses have been hit with the most severe pandemic in more than 100 years, they remain profitable. MetLife has actually paid out more in COVID-related claims in 2021 than we did in 2020. And yet, our adjusted earnings per share are higher this year than last year, as is our adjusted return on equity.  
What has enhanced MetLife's capacity to pay outsized claims while still generating exceptional earnings is our strategic decision to allocate a prudent portion of our investment portfolio to private equity. While not a direct COVID offset, the valuation of our PE and VC funds with significant technology exposure has benefited from global capital flows to this growth sector. The return on our PE portfolio in the quarter was an outstanding 12.6% and stands at approximately 36% year-to-date. The gains on our well-seasoned portfolio are not mere accounting marks. Year-to-date, we have received $1.9 billion in cash distributions from RPE funds. Since 2016, the figure is $7.6 billion.  
While we often reinvest the e-cash proceeds as funds mature and terminate, the cash generated is steady and significant.  
Turning to the underlying performance of MetLife's businesses, we are seeing solid momentum.   
In U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted PFOs grew 13% year-over-year, excluding Versant Health, PFO growth was 6.2% on strong jumbo sales and persistency, and we expect to end the year near the top end of our guidance range. Involuntary benefits, which for us consists of accident and health, legal plans and pet insurance, we saw strong double-digit PFO growth in the third quarter. The trend in sales is even stronger. Year-to-date, sales are up 40% over the prior period, and we remain on track for a record sales year. While group sales can fluctuate from year-to-year due to jumbo cases, we believe the robust U.S. job market and the competition for talent are creating a strong tailwind.  
In connection with open enrollment season this fall, we conducted consumer research on benefit preferences among millennials, who are now the largest age group cohort in the U.S. with more than 70 million members. Millennials are expressing strong interest in both traditional benefits such as life insurance and dental and involuntary benefits such as legal plans and pet insurance. Another top desire is for help with financial planning.  
MetLife entered the space in late September with a digital financial wellness tool called Upwise, which helps us connect with employees directly. The app is designed to address the emotional barriers to financial progress and help people tackle death, save more or even create a digital will.  
Within our RIS business, after a quiet first 3 quarters, we have already booked 4 cases totaling $3.5 billion of pension risk transfer deals in the first month of the fourth quarter. Next Tuesday marks the 100th anniversary of the first group annuity contract MetLife ever wrote with the William Rodge printing company. We are pleased to be a leader in the business of helping companies honor the retirement promises they have made to their workers.  
Last month, MetLife released the results of our annual pension risk transfer pull. We only survey companies that want to derisk.  
Of the 253 respondents, nearly 7 in 10 have pension plan assets of $500 million or more and 93% intend to divest all of the defined benefit pension liabilities at some point in the future, up from 76% in 2019.  
Elsewhere in RIS, excluding PRTs from both periods, adjusted PFOs were up 70% year-over-year. There were 2 main drivers. The first was longevity reinsurance, a market we entered in the U.K. last year. The second was post-retirement benefits, where we take on blocks of retiree life insurance from employers. This is an attractive adjacency to our group business that plays to MetLife's competitive advantages.  
In Latin America, we delivered exceptional sales growth in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In fact, sales were higher in Q3 2021 than they were in Q3 2019 before the COVID pandemic began.  
In most markets across the region, we saw double-digit growth in both sales and PFOs.  
Moving to cash and capital, MetLife ended the third quarter with $5.1 billion of cash at its holding companies. During the quarter, we paid $400 million in common stock dividends and repurchased $1 billion worth of outstanding common shares with another 233 million repurchased so far in Q4. We have $2.5 billion remaining on the $3 billion share repurchase authorization we announced in August.  
We are on track to return more than $5.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2021, and we continue to strive for a balanced mix between business investment and capital return.  
In 2020, for example, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders and invested approximately $5 billion in organic growth and M&A. Our test for capital deployment remains consistent. Does it clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate? As John will describe in greater detail, the new business we wrote in 2020, a period when interest rates were at all-time lows, was the most attractive of the past 5 years. It had the shortest payback period, the highest internal rate of return and the highest value of new business relative to the amount of capital deployed. This was the natural outgrowth of our Accelerating Value initiative.  
By optimizing our portfolio of businesses, shifting our product mix to be more capital efficient and fully embracing an efficiency mindset, we have consistently improved VNB over time, and it is now an integral part of our capital allocation process.  
This year, in addition to organic growth, we increased the stake in our India joint venture, PNB MetLife to 47% from 32%. India is 1 of the 5 secular growth markets we identified in our Next Horizon strategy.  
Consistent with that strategy, we are increasing our exposure to a market where PNB MetLife has access to more than 200 million customers across 15,000 sales locations.  
In September, we held an in-depth session with our Board of Directors to pressure test every aspect of our Next Horizon strategy. We've done this each year of my tenure as CEO. As representatives of our shareholders and shareholders themselves, our Board challenged us to make sure we are positioned and on track to deliver on our goals. I believe the alignment between the Board and management is as strong as it's ever been, and our shared commitments remain clear: Focus on deploying capital to its best use, simplify the company to improve efficiency and the customer experience and truly differentiate ourselves in the marketplace.  
Now I'll turn it over to John for a detailed review of our quarterly performance."

I'll start with the 3Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review and updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions.  
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings. Net income in the third quarter was $1.5 billion or $541 million lower than adjusted earnings. Net derivative losses of $172 million were primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. In addition, our actuarial assumption review accounted for $76 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings.  
In total, the assumption review reduced net income by $216 million, including a notable item to adjusted earnings of $140 million.  
The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review with the breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business segment. We have kept our U.S. mean reversion interest rate unchanged at 2.75% and maintain our long-term mortality assumptions despite the near-term impacts from COVID-19.  
Most of the net income impact was in MetLife Holdings and Asia. For MetLife Holdings, the primary driver was a refinement to the variable annuity lapse rate function to better reflect policyholder behavior based on withdrawal status.  
In Asia, the largest impact was due to the lowering of the earned rate assumption in Japan, where we assume current earned rates for our long-term rate assumption.  
On Page 5, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $2.2 billion, up 24% and up 23% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong returns in our private equity portfolio. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $2.56, up 31% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis, aided by capital management.  
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S.  
Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 72% year-over-year, driven by unfavorable underwriting margins in Group Life, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in 3Q of '21 at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 67.4%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. Volume growth, the addition of Versant Health and favorable expense margins were partial offsets to the decline in year-over-year results.  
Group Benefits continues to have strong top line growth. Year-to-date sales were up 40%, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter were up 13% year-over-year, driven by solid volume growth across most products, including voluntary and the addition of Versant Health.  
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, were up 60% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable underwriting margins and volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 256 basis points, up 100 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income.  
Spreads, excluding VII, were 93 basis points, down 5 basis points year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to lower paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, increased 4% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across the product portfolio.  
With regards to pension risk transfers, as Michel noted, we have already completed $3.5 billion of transactions in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market.  
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 31% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance, driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis. Lower accident and health utilization in the prior period was a partial offset.  
Asia sales were down 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting pressure from COVID-related lockdowns in the region. Asia year-to-date sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis and remain on target to achieve double-digit growth in 2021.  
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 35% and down 38% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to elevated COVID-19-related claims, mainly in Mexico. The impact to Latin America's third quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $137 million.  
While the situation remains fluid, we have seen COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths in Latin America significantly declined in October. Favorable investment in expense margins as well as lower taxes versus the prior year quarter were partial offsets.  
While Latin America's adjusted earnings have been pressured by elevated COVID-19-related claims, sales and persistency throughout the region remains strong. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 45% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across most markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis primarily driven by volume growth across the region and favorable underwriting margins, primarily in the Gulf.  
We expect EMEA adjusted earnings to decline in the fourth quarter due to the timing of certain technology investments across the region. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 2% on a constant currency basis and sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting divested businesses, partially offset by growth in Turkey and Europe.  
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in both periods, were up $271 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. Underwriting margins did reflect higher life claims severity than expected during the third quarter of 2021. However, the Life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 53.3% was within our annual target range of 50% to 55%.  
In addition, LTC new claims returned to more normal levels in the quarter versus very low new claims submissions in the prior year quarter.  
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million in both periods. Lower tax benefits were mostly offset by higher net investment income year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%.  
Now I'll provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 6. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the first 3 quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. Group Life mortality ratio is 106.2% in the third quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 3Q of '21 were roughly 18 percentage points which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $290 million. The primary drivers were higher claim frequency and severity. Approximately 40% of U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter were under age 65, about double the rate of the first quarter of this year and the highest percentage in any quarter since the pandemic began and therefore, having a greater proportional impact on the working age population. 
In addition, we estimate that the quarter included roughly 1 to 2 incremental percentage points impact on the mortality ratio from claims that appear to be COVID-related but were not specifically identified as COVID on the death certificate.  
Despite the impacts from COVID, Group Benefits remains a profitable and growing business for MetLife. Group Benefits reported adjusted earnings of roughly $450 million year-to-date and adjusted PFO growth of 13%.  
Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the last 5 quarters, including approximately $1.8 billion in the third quarter. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a 12.6% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, the private equities are generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 23% of our PE account balance of $12.8 billion. We're the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 18% quarterly return.  
Page 8 highlights VII by segment for the first 3 quarters of 2021 including $1.4 billion post tax in the third quarter. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio.  
As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each, although can vary from quarter-to-quarter. The VII results in the quarter were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of venture capital funds I referenced earlier.  
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters and full year 2020, including 11.1% in the third quarter of '21. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. This did include approximately 20 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases and 20 basis points from a single premium Group Life sale in RIS.  
In addition, the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and timing of certain technology investments are expected to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Therefore, we do expect the direct expense ratio to be elevated in 4Q.  
Now let's turn to Page 10. This chart reflects new business value metrics from MetLife's major segments for the past 5 years, including an update for 2020.  
Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $3.2 billion of capital in 2020 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of 6 years.  
New business written in 2020 reflects our disciplined approach to building profitable growth while creating value, generating cash and mitigating risk.  
Despite the sales challenges in 2020 associated with lockdowns related to the pandemic, we were able to increase our value of new business and IRR while lowering our cash payback period versus 2019.  
Now I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.1 billion as of September 30, which is down from $6.5 billion at June 30 but still well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash of the holding companies include the net effects of share repurchases of $1 billion, payment of our common stock dividend of roughly $400 million, subsidiary dividends as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we had a long-term debt repayment of $500 million in the third quarter. Our next long-term debt maturity is not until September 2023.  
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by higher variable investment income and lower variable annuity right of reserves. Year-to-date 2021 net income increased by roughly $400 million as compared to the first 9 months of 2020. The primary drivers were higher operating earnings and net investment gains which was partially offset by derivative losses.  
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.7 billion as of September 30, 2021, up 16% compared to December 31, 2020. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 960% as of June 30, which is the latest public data.  
In summary, MetLife delivered another very strong quarter, driven by exceptional private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While earnings power of our group benefits in Latin America businesses has been dampened by COVID-19 excess mortality. We are pleased with the momentum behind these market-leading franchises. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success.  
Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

So on the disability front, as you noted, it's -- relative to our premium, it's about 12% of our overall PFOs in group. And I can give you some color based on both the LTD and the STD portions of the book. So for the LTD side, what we saw is an incidence rate this quarter that's much more in line with our historical norms. It was higher than last year but last year was a favorable incidence here from a disability perspective. So we're seeing it tick back to where it was historically from a frequency perspective. And then the recoveries continue to be pretty strong. The other thing I would add there on the LTD side is so far, we have not seen any significant impact on the business from kind of COVID or long COVID effect, neither have we seen any material impacts from the overall economy. So it's been pretty much a return to, call it, a pre-pandemic levels as far as the LTD book. 
For the STD side, it's a bit different. So think about that 12% of disability premium, 2/3 of it is sitting in the LTD only, 1/3 of it sits in the STD. And then for that 1/3 that's in STD, about 1/2 of those employees are comprised of ASO-only business. So we are administering the disability claims but not on the hook for the actual claims themselves. 
So while for the STD portion, we have seen and continue to see elevated STD COVID claims. The actual impact on the nonmedical health ratio is pretty de minimis given the composition of our book and the ASO exposure."

But pretty much in line with what we set back 90 days ago. So you're referencing that continued elevated levels of paydown activity on the residential mortgage book, and that accelerates the income from those securities or loans that we purchased at a discount. 
But as we said, we believe we've seen the peak of that. And so that 5 basis point runoff was generally expected. We would expect that to continue into 4Q and kind of start to make its way down. And -- but I think kind of a similar trajectory seems reasonable at this point."

So let me give you some comments and then we'll see if Eric would want to add anything.

So let me give you some comments and then we'll see if Eric would want to add anything. The pension is usually subject to public debate for a number of years now, I would say, and that debate tends to heat up around elections. One thing I would say is that despite the general perception to the contrary, if you think about the pension system, I mean it's functioned quite well, and the returns have been quite good as well for the industry as a whole. The problem with the system is that due to inconsistent contributions, the fact that you have widespread informal labor in Chile. And the contribution rates are low. That's led to sort of low projected replacement rates at retirement. 
The debate is continuing now with presidential elections, round 1 is in late November, and then you'll have the second round in December and different candidates are taking very different views. Some are supportive of the system, others are in favor of radical reform. So we'll have to see how that plays out. 
The other thing that's happening in Chile is that there's the redrafting of the constitution that's taking place that's going to play out next year as well. So we'll see what comes out of that. We are very much engaged with the local authorities. We have great relationships in Chile. We're a leading player there. As you know, we're also in collaboration with the industry, making sure that our point of view is being heard and hopefully addressed as well. And look, we're not -- we're in favor of reform that makes sense for the participants in the system that protects them -- their retirement. But we are also cautioning against any measures that ultimately would do -- would damage Chile's capital markets as well as investor perceptions of the Chilean -- Chile as an investment destination. 
So we continue to be engaged. As you know, there's been 3 rounds of withdrawals already. There's another proposal for a fourth round of pension with roles. We see whether that gets surpassed or not. Clearly, if it does, whereas these withdrawals don't have a material impact on earnings, the damage sort of the viability of the system, if you like, which is something that we advocate against. And then on the annuities front that you referenced, this -- there's been 1 withdrawal there. 
Again, we don't know if there'll be another one. I think probably our view is that the likelihood of that is not very high, but we'll have to wait and see. 
All in all, our pension business is 2% of MetLife's overall earnings. But our view is that we continue to engage, we continue to keep a close eye on the situation, and we'll have to see how this plays out over the coming weeks and months. Anything to add, Eric?"

On the other aspect of counterparty, I would say we come at it probably the same way that our New York domiciles -- partners would come at it as well. So I don't know if it changes who or how we would do a transaction, I think we probably take somewhat of a similar construct because at the end of the day, our situation would be a reinsurance transaction from the New York domiciled entity and so credit risk would matter.

As I reflect on the journey MetLife has been on these past 2 years, I am more convinced than ever that we are focused on what matters most. We are a purpose-driven company at a time when stakeholders will accept nothing less. We have the right strategy to see us through even the most turbulent environments, and we have a strong culture of execution that gives our shareholders confidence. All of these attributes were on display in the third quarter of 2021.  
Starting with our financial results. Adjusted earnings were $2.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.39, up 38% year-over-year. Excluding total notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 24% and adjusted EPS was up 31%.  
Looking at the quarterly performance of the enterprise as a whole, variable investment income was outstanding, underlying PFOs were strong and expense disciplines held firm. The main area where we have seen headwinds is from elevated COVID claims.  
In key respects, the third quarter of 2021 looks very much like the first quarter with exceptionally strong VII more than offsetting excess mortality.  
On the investment side, our private equity portfolio returned $1.5 billion in Q3, its highest quarterly contribution in 2021 and the major contributor to VII, which was well above the top end of our implied quarterly guidance range.  
On underwriting in our U.S. business, the Group Life mortality ratio was elevated at 106.2% in Q3 on higher claim severity and frequency due to a shift younger in the age distribution of COVID deaths.  
Our Latin America business incurred COVID losses of $137 million in Q3. Two aspects of our underwriting results are noteworthy. From a social perspective, paying COVID claims is precisely how life insurance companies make a positive difference in the world. The human toll of the pandemic on families is catastrophic but where life insurance is present, the financial burden is eased. This is our purpose to help prepare the financial damage after life's most destabilizing moments. Pandemic to date, in our U.S. group business, we've incurred U.S. life claims of around $2.1 billion. Life insurance is not like other businesses where losses are just losses.  
Every underwriting claim represents a beneficiary who is receiving the financial help they were promised. From a financial perspective, even though our Life businesses have been hit with the most severe pandemic in more than 100 years, they remain profitable. MetLife has actually paid out more in COVID-related claims in 2021 than we did in 2020. And yet, our adjusted earnings per share are higher this year than last year, as is our adjusted return on equity.  
What has enhanced MetLife's capacity to pay outsized claims while still generating exceptional earnings is our strategic decision to allocate a prudent portion of our investment portfolio to private equity. While not a direct COVID offset, the valuation of our PE and VC funds with significant technology exposure has benefited from global capital flows to this growth sector. The return on our PE portfolio in the quarter was an outstanding 12.6% and stands at approximately 36% year-to-date. The gains on our well-seasoned portfolio are not mere accounting marks. Year-to-date, we have received $1.9 billion in cash distributions from RPE funds. Since 2016, the figure is $7.6 billion.  
While we often reinvest the e-cash proceeds as funds mature and terminate, the cash generated is steady and significant.  
Turning to the underlying performance of MetLife's businesses, we are seeing solid momentum.   
In U.S. Group Benefits, adjusted PFOs grew 13% year-over-year, excluding Versant Health, PFO growth was 6.2% on strong jumbo sales and persistency, and we expect to end the year near the top end of our guidance range. Involuntary benefits, which for us consists of accident and health, legal plans and pet insurance, we saw strong double-digit PFO growth in the third quarter. The trend in sales is even stronger. Year-to-date, sales are up 40% over the prior period, and we remain on track for a record sales year. While group sales can fluctuate from year-to-year due to jumbo cases, we believe the robust U.S. job market and the competition for talent are creating a strong tailwind.  
In connection with open enrollment season this fall, we conducted consumer research on benefit preferences among millennials, who are now the largest age group cohort in the U.S. with more than 70 million members. Millennials are expressing strong interest in both traditional benefits such as life insurance and dental and involuntary benefits such as legal plans and pet insurance. Another top desire is for help with financial planning.  
MetLife entered the space in late September with a digital financial wellness tool called Upwise, which helps us connect with employees directly. The app is designed to address the emotional barriers to financial progress and help people tackle death, save more or even create a digital will.  
Within our RIS business, after a quiet first 3 quarters, we have already booked 4 cases totaling $3.5 billion of pension risk transfer deals in the first month of the fourth quarter. Next Tuesday marks the 100th anniversary of the first group annuity contract MetLife ever wrote with the William Rodge printing company. We are pleased to be a leader in the business of helping companies honor the retirement promises they have made to their workers.  
Last month, MetLife released the results of our annual pension risk transfer pull. We only survey companies that want to derisk.  
Of the 253 respondents, nearly 7 in 10 have pension plan assets of $500 million or more and 93% intend to divest all of the defined benefit pension liabilities at some point in the future, up from 76% in 2019.  
Elsewhere in RIS, excluding PRTs from both periods, adjusted PFOs were up 70% year-over-year. There were 2 main drivers. The first was longevity reinsurance, a market we entered in the U.K. last year. The second was post-retirement benefits, where we take on blocks of retiree life insurance from employers. This is an attractive adjacency to our group business that plays to MetLife's competitive advantages.  
In Latin America, we delivered exceptional sales growth in the quarter, up 45% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In fact, sales were higher in Q3 2021 than they were in Q3 2019 before the COVID pandemic began.  
In most markets across the region, we saw double-digit growth in both sales and PFOs.  
Moving to cash and capital, MetLife ended the third quarter with $5.1 billion of cash at its holding companies. During the quarter, we paid $400 million in common stock dividends and repurchased $1 billion worth of outstanding common shares with another 233 million repurchased so far in Q4. We have $2.5 billion remaining on the $3 billion share repurchase authorization we announced in August.  
We are on track to return more than $5.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2021, and we continue to strive for a balanced mix between business investment and capital return.  
In 2020, for example, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders and invested approximately $5 billion in organic growth and M&A. Our test for capital deployment remains consistent. Does it clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate? As John will describe in greater detail, the new business we wrote in 2020, a period when interest rates were at all-time lows, was the most attractive of the past 5 years. It had the shortest payback period, the highest internal rate of return and the highest value of new business relative to the amount of capital deployed. This was the natural outgrowth of our Accelerating Value initiative.  
By optimizing our portfolio of businesses, shifting our product mix to be more capital efficient and fully embracing an efficiency mindset, we have consistently improved VNB over time, and it is now an integral part of our capital allocation process.  
This year, in addition to organic growth, we increased the stake in our India joint venture, PNB MetLife to 47% from 32%. India is 1 of the 5 secular growth markets we identified in our Next Horizon strategy.  
Consistent with that strategy, we are increasing our exposure to a market where PNB MetLife has access to more than 200 million customers across 15,000 sales locations.  
In September, we held an in-depth session with our Board of Directors to pressure test every aspect of our Next Horizon strategy. We've done this each year of my tenure as CEO. As representatives of our shareholders and shareholders themselves, our Board challenged us to make sure we are positioned and on track to deliver on our goals. I believe the alignment between the Board and management is as strong as it's ever been, and our shared commitments remain clear: Focus on deploying capital to its best use, simplify the company to improve efficiency and the customer experience and truly differentiate ourselves in the marketplace.  
Now I'll turn it over to John for a detailed review of our quarterly performance."

I'll start with the 3Q '21 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, details of our annual global actuarial assumption review and updates on our value of new business metrics and our cash and capital positions.  
Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings. Net income in the third quarter was $1.5 billion or $541 million lower than adjusted earnings. Net derivative losses of $172 million were primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter. In addition, our actuarial assumption review accounted for $76 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings.  
In total, the assumption review reduced net income by $216 million, including a notable item to adjusted earnings of $140 million.  
The table on Page 4 provides highlights of the actuarial assumption review with the breakdown of the adjusted earnings and net income impact by business segment. We have kept our U.S. mean reversion interest rate unchanged at 2.75% and maintain our long-term mortality assumptions despite the near-term impacts from COVID-19.  
Most of the net income impact was in MetLife Holdings and Asia. For MetLife Holdings, the primary driver was a refinement to the variable annuity lapse rate function to better reflect policyholder behavior based on withdrawal status.  
In Asia, the largest impact was due to the lowering of the earned rate assumption in Japan, where we assume current earned rates for our long-term rate assumption.  
On Page 5, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $2.2 billion, up 24% and up 23% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong returns in our private equity portfolio. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding notable items, was $2.56, up 31% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis, aided by capital management.  
Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S.  
Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 72% year-over-year, driven by unfavorable underwriting margins in Group Life, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in 3Q of '21 at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75% but higher than the prior year quarter of 67.4%, which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidents. Volume growth, the addition of Versant Health and favorable expense margins were partial offsets to the decline in year-over-year results.  
Group Benefits continues to have strong top line growth. Year-to-date sales were up 40%, primarily due to higher jumbo case activity. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter were up 13% year-over-year, driven by solid volume growth across most products, including voluntary and the addition of Versant Health.  
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings, were up 60% year-over-year. The primary driver was higher variable investment income, largely due to strong private equity returns. Favorable underwriting margins and volume growth also contributed to year-over-year performance. RIS investment spreads were 256 basis points, up 100 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income.  
Spreads, excluding VII, were 93 basis points, down 5 basis points year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to lower paydowns in our portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage loans. RIS liability exposures, including U.K. longevity reinsurance, increased 4% year-over-year due to solid volume growth across the product portfolio.  
With regards to pension risk transfers, as Michel noted, we have already completed $3.5 billion of transactions in the fourth quarter and continue to see an active market.  
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 31% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Asia's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance, driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% on a constant currency basis. Lower accident and health utilization in the prior period was a partial offset.  
Asia sales were down 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting pressure from COVID-related lockdowns in the region. Asia year-to-date sales were up 10% on a constant currency basis and remain on target to achieve double-digit growth in 2021.  
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 35% and down 38% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to elevated COVID-19-related claims, mainly in Mexico. The impact to Latin America's third quarter adjusted earnings was approximately $137 million.  
While the situation remains fluid, we have seen COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths in Latin America significantly declined in October. Favorable investment in expense margins as well as lower taxes versus the prior year quarter were partial offsets.  
While Latin America's adjusted earnings have been pressured by elevated COVID-19-related claims, sales and persistency throughout the region remains strong. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 22% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 45% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid growth across most markets. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis primarily driven by volume growth across the region and favorable underwriting margins, primarily in the Gulf.  
We expect EMEA adjusted earnings to decline in the fourth quarter due to the timing of certain technology investments across the region. EMEA adjusted PFOs were down 2% on a constant currency basis and sales were down 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting divested businesses, partially offset by growth in Turkey and Europe.  
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in both periods, were up $271 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. Underwriting margins did reflect higher life claims severity than expected during the third quarter of 2021. However, the Life interest adjusted benefit ratio of 53.3% was within our annual target range of 50% to 55%.  
In addition, LTC new claims returned to more normal levels in the quarter versus very low new claims submissions in the prior year quarter.  
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million in both periods. Lower tax benefits were mostly offset by higher net investment income year-over-year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20.6% and within our 2021 guidance range of 20% to 22%.  
Now I'll provide more detail on Group Benefits mortality results on Page 6. This chart reflects our Group Life mortality ratio for the first 3 quarters of 2021, including the COVID-19 impact on the ratio and on Group Benefits adjusted earnings. Group Life mortality ratio is 106.2% in the third quarter of 2021, which is well above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. COVID reported claims in 3Q of '21 were roughly 18 percentage points which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $290 million. The primary drivers were higher claim frequency and severity. Approximately 40% of U.S. COVID deaths in the quarter were under age 65, about double the rate of the first quarter of this year and the highest percentage in any quarter since the pandemic began and therefore, having a greater proportional impact on the working age population. 
In addition, we estimate that the quarter included roughly 1 to 2 incremental percentage points impact on the mortality ratio from claims that appear to be COVID-related but were not specifically identified as COVID on the death certificate.  
Despite the impacts from COVID, Group Benefits remains a profitable and growing business for MetLife. Group Benefits reported adjusted earnings of roughly $450 million year-to-date and adjusted PFO growth of 13%.  
Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the last 5 quarters, including approximately $1.8 billion in the third quarter. This very strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a 12.6% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, the private equities are generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag. While all private equity asset classes performed well in the quarter, our venture capital funds, which account for roughly 23% of our PE account balance of $12.8 billion. We're the strongest performer across subsectors with a roughly 18% quarterly return.  
Page 8 highlights VII by segment for the first 3 quarters of 2021 including $1.4 billion post tax in the third quarter. The attribution of VII by business is based on the quarterly returns for each segment's individual portfolio.  
As we have previously noted, RIS, MetLife Holdings and Asia generally account for 90% or more of the total VII and are split roughly 1/3 each, although can vary from quarter-to-quarter. The VII results in the quarter were more heavily weighted towards RIS and MetLife Holdings as Asia's private equity portfolio is less mature and has a smaller proportion of venture capital funds I referenced earlier.  
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio over the prior 5 quarters and full year 2020, including 11.1% in the third quarter of '21. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our third quarter direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. This did include approximately 20 basis points from premiums that relate to participating cases and 20 basis points from a single premium Group Life sale in RIS.  
In addition, the impact from seasonal enrollment costs and timing of certain technology investments are expected to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Therefore, we do expect the direct expense ratio to be elevated in 4Q.  
Now let's turn to Page 10. This chart reflects new business value metrics from MetLife's major segments for the past 5 years, including an update for 2020.  
Consistent with our Next Horizon strategy, we continue to have a relentless focus on deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities. As evidence of that commitment, MetLife invested $3.2 billion of capital in 2020 to support new business, which was deployed at an average unlevered IRR of approximately 17% with a payback period of 6 years.  
New business written in 2020 reflects our disciplined approach to building profitable growth while creating value, generating cash and mitigating risk.  
Despite the sales challenges in 2020 associated with lockdowns related to the pandemic, we were able to increase our value of new business and IRR while lowering our cash payback period versus 2019.  
Now I'll discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were $5.1 billion as of September 30, which is down from $6.5 billion at June 30 but still well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The sequential decrease in cash of the holding companies include the net effects of share repurchases of $1 billion, payment of our common stock dividend of roughly $400 million, subsidiary dividends as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. In addition, we had a long-term debt repayment of $500 million in the third quarter. Our next long-term debt maturity is not until September 2023.  
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2021 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4 billion, while net income was approximately $3 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by higher variable investment income and lower variable annuity right of reserves. Year-to-date 2021 net income increased by roughly $400 million as compared to the first 9 months of 2020. The primary drivers were higher operating earnings and net investment gains which was partially offset by derivative losses.  
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.7 billion as of September 30, 2021, up 16% compared to December 31, 2020. Favorable operating earnings and net investment gains were partially offset by derivative losses and dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 960% as of June 30, which is the latest public data.  
In summary, MetLife delivered another very strong quarter, driven by exceptional private equity returns, solid top line growth, ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of our diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities. While earnings power of our group benefits in Latin America businesses has been dampened by COVID-19 excess mortality. We are pleased with the momentum behind these market-leading franchises. In addition, our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio remains strong and position us for further success.  
Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

So on the disability front, as you noted, it's -- relative to our premium, it's about 12% of our overall PFOs in group. And I can give you some color based on both the LTD and the STD portions of the book. So for the LTD side, what we saw is an incidence rate this quarter that's much more in line with our historical norms. It was higher than last year but last year was a favorable incidence here from a disability perspective. So we're seeing it tick back to where it was historically from a frequency perspective. And then the recoveries continue to be pretty strong. The other thing I would add there on the LTD side is so far, we have not seen any significant impact on the business from kind of COVID or long COVID effect, neither have we seen any material impacts from the overall economy. So it's been pretty much a return to, call it, a pre-pandemic levels as far as the LTD book. 
For the STD side, it's a bit different. So think about that 12% of disability premium, 2/3 of it is sitting in the LTD only, 1/3 of it sits in the STD. And then for that 1/3 that's in STD, about 1/2 of those employees are comprised of ASO-only business. So we are administering the disability claims but not on the hook for the actual claims themselves. 
So while for the STD portion, we have seen and continue to see elevated STD COVID claims. The actual impact on the nonmedical health ratio is pretty de minimis given the composition of our book and the ASO exposure."

But pretty much in line with what we set back 90 days ago. So you're referencing that continued elevated levels of paydown activity on the residential mortgage book, and that accelerates the income from those securities or loans that we purchased at a discount. 
But as we said, we believe we've seen the peak of that. And so that 5 basis point runoff was generally expected. We would expect that to continue into 4Q and kind of start to make its way down. And -- but I think kind of a similar trajectory seems reasonable at this point."

So let me give you some comments and then we'll see if Eric would want to add anything.

So let me give you some comments and then we'll see if Eric would want to add anything. The pension is usually subject to public debate for a number of years now, I would say, and that debate tends to heat up around elections. One thing I would say is that despite the general perception to the contrary, if you think about the pension system, I mean it's functioned quite well, and the returns have been quite good as well for the industry as a whole. The problem with the system is that due to inconsistent contributions, the fact that you have widespread informal labor in Chile. And the contribution rates are low. That's led to sort of low projected replacement rates at retirement. 
The debate is continuing now with presidential elections, round 1 is in late November, and then you'll have the second round in December and different candidates are taking very different views. Some are supportive of the system, others are in favor of radical reform. So we'll have to see how that plays out. 
The other thing that's happening in Chile is that there's the redrafting of the constitution that's taking place that's going to play out next year as well. So we'll see what comes out of that. We are very much engaged with the local authorities. We have great relationships in Chile. We're a leading player there. As you know, we're also in collaboration with the industry, making sure that our point of view is being heard and hopefully addressed as well. And look, we're not -- we're in favor of reform that makes sense for the participants in the system that protects them -- their retirement. But we are also cautioning against any measures that ultimately would do -- would damage Chile's capital markets as well as investor perceptions of the Chilean -- Chile as an investment destination. 
So we continue to be engaged. As you know, there's been 3 rounds of withdrawals already. There's another proposal for a fourth round of pension with roles. We see whether that gets surpassed or not. Clearly, if it does, whereas these withdrawals don't have a material impact on earnings, the damage sort of the viability of the system, if you like, which is something that we advocate against. And then on the annuities front that you referenced, this -- there's been 1 withdrawal there. 
Again, we don't know if there'll be another one. I think probably our view is that the likelihood of that is not very high, but we'll have to wait and see. 
All in all, our pension business is 2% of MetLife's overall earnings. But our view is that we continue to engage, we continue to keep a close eye on the situation, and we'll have to see how this plays out over the coming weeks and months. Anything to add, Eric?"

I wouldn't exclude anything outside of, let's say, LTC just given where I think pricing is, there's a pretty big divergence in what people think at this point. On the other aspect of counterparty, I would say we come at it probably the same way that our New York domiciles -- partners would come at it as well. So I don't know if it changes who or how we would do a transaction, I think we probably take somewhat of a similar construct because at the end of the day, our situation would be a reinsurance transaction from the New York domiciled entity and so credit risk would matter.

With respect to what's going to change and what is changing on the Life side is pricing. So we did talk about this in the last quarter we have, and we continue to make rate adjustments in the Group Life business in line with our prospective view of the pandemic. So it's not operations related, it's related to the underwriting and the mortality. And as you look at the upcoming renewal season, we have been able to achieve rate adjustments and rate increases in line with our prospective view of mortality while maintaining pretty strong persistency in our book. 
So -- and that's going to be an ongoing process that we're undertaking. So that's kind of what's changing, if you will, with respect to the Group Life piece."

Again, wha",183,"Yes. And then I can take the second question you had, John. This is John as well. Yes, look, our target is 12.3%. You said is it possible? Sure, anything is possible, I guess. But ultimately, we are kind of steadfast on being at or below 12.3%. Again, what we also are trying to do is shift the mix of expenses that are within our expense base and continue to drive savings and capacity for reinvestment. So we want to maintain being at or below 12.3% on a persistent basis every year. But at the same time, we want to continue to drive efficiencies that free up the allocation of resources to invest in the customer, invest in our processes and to continue to drive growth for the firm. 
And so -- and at the same time, if we see headwinds in an economy, we can use that capacity as a protection for profit margins. So that's kind of our philosophy when it comes to our efficiency mindset, and I'd say nothing would kind of take us off that track at this point."
