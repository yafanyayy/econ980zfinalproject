Good afternoon, everybody. Today, I'd like to address 3 topics with you. Namely, a brief summary of the fourth quarter, our continuing progress executing our strategy and our confidence about the future. Let me start with Q4. Fourth qu",2017,"Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everybody. Today, I'd like to address 3 topics with you. Namely, a brief summary of the fourth quarter, our continuing progress executing our strategy and our confidence about the future. 
Let me start with Q4. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, a decline of 3% year-over-year in constant currency. This included a negative 120 basis point impact from the exit of content moderation services and a negative 250 basis points impact related to the anticipated exit from a large financial services engagement. This relates to a complex ambitious project that was scoped in late 2018. Over time, both parties realized that the transformation aspect of the project as initially conceived, was unlikely to achieve our shared expectations. I'm confident that it is in everyone's interest to manage to an exit. 
Jan will provide more details on the financial implications of this exit in his remarks. However, I want to underscore that I'm confident in both our client portfolio and our deal review and solutioning processes. Many aspects of which we've overhauled in the last year. 
Excluding the impact from the anticipated exits from this engagement, we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations and our guidance. Gross margins increased, cash flow is strong, and we continue to invest significantly to fuel our growth priorities. 
We maintained our momentum in the quarter with full year 2020 bookings growth in the mid-teens. With over 1 year of data, assumption tweaks and refinements behind us, our analytics have been improved on going to bookings, bookings growth, including renewals and new business and bookings to revenue. We entered 2021 with growing confidence in our strategic, operational and commercial progress and a strengthening demand environment. 
In fact, we're on track to bring in more new hires in Q1 than ever before as we ramp our hiring capacity to accommodate our growth plans for 2021 and beyond. That said, the market for scale digital talent is intensely competitive, creating demand supply imbalances for certain skills. This, coupled with other factors, including our more rigorous approach to mirror based promotions and salary adjustments, has led to meaningful sequential increases in voluntary attrition. 
We will continue to closely monitor and action this, including reviewing remuneration, underscoring our employee value proposition and reinforcing the career path opportunities created by our growing momentum. 
From an industry point of view, we believe financial services will see a gradual recovery in 2021, returning to growth over the course of the year. Notwithstanding the anticipated date of the engagement referenced earlier. 
During 2020, we took a series of actions in financial services, including refreshing more than 1/4 of our commercial teams, adding more commercial coverage and strengthening our partnership ecosystem and industry solutions. We closed the year with a healthy book-to-bill ratio in both insurance and banking. With these actions and our enhanced portfolio at the intersection of cloud and digital, we are now better positioned to help financial services clients with their transformation and innovation agendas. 
Health care growth slowed modestly in Q4 as we lapped the Zenith Technologies' acquisition in life sciences. However, the fundamentals of our payer health care business has been improving in recent quarters. We anticipate further growth acceleration in the first half of 2021, driven by a reinvigorated U.S. health care business, including our strategic product portfolio and a strong outlook in life sciences. 
Products and resources continues to be impacted by COVID-19 related to weakness in travel and hospitality and retail and consumer goods. Meanwhile, we see continued momentum in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Communications, media and technology continues to grow double digits year-over-year when adjusted for the effects of the exit of the nonstrategic content services business. Jan will provide more insights on the quarter in his prepared remarks. 
Macro trends are largely unchanged from those I discussed in our third quarter call. Clients are making investment decisions. They know it must be agile, innovative, software-driven enterprises. We see continued focus on customer and employee experience initiatives, Customer 360, cloud acceleration, packaged applications, platform capabilities and automation. Hyperpersonalization and the need for intelligent decision-making are fueling significant demand in analytics, AI and ML. 
Clients are embracing new ways of working, including distributed agile, following their successful COVID-induced experience in 2020. Our strategy to focus on industry-specific and horizontal digital workflows is resonating with clients. The next phase of digital is about transforming processes to become agile, data-driven and automated and always with an eye on customer experience. This moves digital beyond technology and into the heart of business operating models and processes. 
Finally, we continue to see clients determine their strategic partners. Cognizant stands the benefit from this trend, given our high levels of customer satisfaction or enhanced portfolio and our growing reputation in digital. I'm particularly pleased by our growing client momentum. We see meaningful opportunity for cross-selling in our existing accounts, given our refresh client-facing teams, stronger portfolio and enhance the can planning. A recent example is a Fortune 500 resources company, that sought to digitally transform its workplace experience for employees while eliminating the operational inefficiencies caused by an over reliance on multiple in-country outsourcers and contractors. 
Cognizant's work next digital workplace solutions suite match the client's requirement for transformation through self-service and automation. This led to a 45% reduction in operating costs, and higher levels of customer satisfaction, given 70% plus first coal resolution. While we see a huge opportunity to cross-sell in our existing accounts and are naturally focused on that. We're also focused on extending our market coverage by leveraging the commercial investments made in 2020. 
In the past year, we broke into more than 40 new Global 2000 accounts, providing meaningful cross-sell opportunities for ore delivery and commercial teams. One such client is a leading credit ratings agency that aims to transform into an agile DevOps engineering-led operating model. Whilst consolidating its vendors and eliminating legacy systems and technology. We led with digital engineering to build innovative solutions using modern cloud-native and digital technologies by full stack product teams. We are applying a lean, agile approach to drive a product development mindset and the adoption of an agile software development framework. 
Moving now to strategy. To realize our revenue growth, we are now several quarters into executing a strategy focused on 4 priorities: repositioning the Cognizant brand, globalizing Cognizant, accelerating digital and increasing our client relevance. There's a quick update on each priority, starting at our brand. 
In the coming months, we will launch a breakthrough global brand campaign that will increase the stature of our brands. With a focus on scaling Cognizant's brand globally, we will execute a series of experiential marketing initiatives and sponsorships. For example, we recently announced that we're the title partner of Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One team. Aston Martin, an iconic brand, is returning to the Formula One grade after more than 60 years away from the sport. This is much more than a sponsorship. It's a broader strategic partnership aligned with our automotive industry focus, and one that's at the intersection of cloud and digital. For the Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One team will be heavily focused trackside, applying 5G, IoT and data analytics to support critical decision-making. 
For Aston Martin Lagonda, the road car company, will help execute their digital transformation agenda, focusing on outcomes like hyper-personalized experiences for their customers and building a direct-to-consumer value proposition. We'll also partner with Aston Martin to evolve its facilities into smart factories, leveraging 5G and IoT to achieve optimal performance and output. 
Given the rate circuit across 22 countries and the global following of Formula One in Europe, Middle East and Asia, this sponsorship also aligns with our second priority, that of globalizing our company. We see a huge opportunity internationally, having hired a diverse group of senior country managing directors in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, the Nordics, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. And a new President of our international business, we are in a stronger position than ever to drive towards this goal. These seniors bring both client networks and talent followership. They will also lead the business transformation we are undergoing at a local level as we pivot to helping clients realize their digital ambitions. 
I'm extremely excited about our ability to drive exponential growth in our international business. Once this team settles in. We are committed to invest behind this ambition, both organically and inorganically. In January, we agreed to acquire Servian, an Australia based enterprise transformation consultancy that specializes in data analytics, AI, digital services, experience design and cloud, serve and expands our integrated end-to-end digital transformation capabilities in both Australia and New Zealand. 
This brings me to our third strategic priority, accelerating digital. For the last 18 months, we've sharpened our ability to support clients as they transform into software-driven enterprises. Since January 2020, we've announced approximately $1.6 billion in acquisitions, all focused on our strategic priorities of digital engineering, data and AI, cloud and IoT, which together enable clients to compete as modern digital businesses. 
Earlier this week, we closed the acquisition of Magenic, a 25-year-old custom software development services company, which will broaden our global software product engineering network, adding hundreds of engineers in the U.S. and the Philippines. Magenic is our second digital engineering acquisition in recent months, making us one of the world's largest digital engineering firms. We also closed the acquisition of Linium this week, which broadens our enterprise service management capabilities and complements our ServiceNow practice. 
I'm pleased with the growing intimacy we share with our key partners, including the leading hyperscale and SaaS companies. Long-established relationships with Oracle and SAP have been complemented with growing commitments to next-generation companies like Workday, Salesforce, Snowflake and ServiceNow. In fact, we just committed to deploy Workday internally as our HCM partner. 
In digital business operations, we are committed to infusing intelligent automation across our operations to deliver end-to-end, adaptable and responsive processes. Our deep and long-standing global partnerships with leading companies such as UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Indico and Appian, enables us to enhance the automation spectrum from robotic to cognitive process. Our fourth strategic priority is about increasing our relevance to clients. To support this, in 2020, we've been investing in our industry and sub industry knowledge, strengthening our partnership ecosystem and refreshing our client-facing teams to ensure deeper industry expertise and technology consulting skills. We aim to be even more proactive with our clients, leading with a point of view on technology strategy, architecture and agile digital workflows. 
We aim to build upon our excellent reputation and build operate and further strengthen our growing reputation in transformation and innovation. This is a multiyear journey, but one that our clients are happy to see us embrace as they look for alternative strategic partners. 
In closing, we are now almost 2 years into a project to ensure Cognizant returns to its rightful place as an industry bellwether. We accomplished a great deal in 2020 despite being faced with the complexities of COVID and a ransomware attack. This progress scorecard includes rallying the company behind a clear purpose and vision, improving employee engagement levels to multiyear highs, refreshing our leadership team and talent executing against our refined corporate strategy, including adjusting our portfolio via targeted mergers and acquisitions and the exit of nonstrategic businesses, improving our backlog, win rates and bookings trajectory, completing our restructuring program, investing in strategic ESG and D&I initiatives and accelerating investments in our future growth. 
A new reinvigorated Cognizant is emerging, having successfully completed a good deal of our transformation work. I'm pleased with the progress we've made and our ability to start demonstrating this in 2021. And there is, of course, more work to do, but we are on track executing well, united as a leadership team and doing what it takes to become a preeminent technology services partner to the Global 2000 C-suite. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal year outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you."

I'm delighted to be with you on my second earnings call and to be reporting another good quarter, excluding the onetime impact I'll discuss more later. 
The business performed well, modestly exceeding our expectations during the quarter, driven by solid performance across the board, excluding financial services, and the industry's most directly impacted by COVID, notably retail, consumer goods and travel and hospitality. For the full year, revenue was $16.7 billion representing a decline of 0.8% compared to 2019 and a decline of 0.7% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year, this includes a negative 110 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services, a negative 70 basis point impact of the anticipated exit from a large engagement in our Financial Services segment and a positive approximately 210 basis points of contribution from our acquired businesses. 
For the full year, digital grew over 13%, it represented approximately 42% of total revenue, an increase of 5 points as a percentage of total revenue from 2019. Our Q4 revenue was $4.2 billion, representing a decline of 2.3% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year period, this includes a negative 250 basis points impact of the anticipated exit from a large engagement in our Financial Services segment a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services and a positive 270 basis points of contribution from our acquisitions. 
Before moving on, I will provide some additional details relating to the anticipated exit from the previously mentioned large engagement. In discussions, the parties agreed that a clean separation would be to our mutual benefit. As a result of those discussions, in the fourth quarter, we made an offer that includes among other terms, a proposed payment and the forgiveness of certain receivables. As a result of this offer, we recorded a $140 million charge in the fourth quarter, which included a reduction to Q4 revenue of $107 million and additional expenses of $33 million, which impacted SG&A primarily related to the impairment of long lived assets. The charge exclusively impacts our Financial Services segment.  We are in active discussions and hope to have a finalized agreement in the near future. 
Now moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services declined 11.4% and including a negative 730 basis points impact from the anticipated contract exit. Excluding this impact, banking and insurance both declined mid-single digits in banking, growth in regional and retail banking in North America was more than offset by weakness in cards and payments clients. 
Insurance also performed below our expectations driven primarily by weakness in North America. Health care grew 3.3%, which included similar performance in both in the U.S. payer business and life sciences. Life sciences revenue was strong among our pharmaceutical clients, further enhanced by the expansion of our portfolio of services as a result of our acquisitions of Zenith Technologies. 
Growth was partially offset by the continued weakness in medical device clients, which have been impacted by reduced elective procedures volumes. Our Healthcare payer business had the best performance in 7 quarters. With strength in software license sales from the addition of several new logos. 
Products and resources declined 2.4% as low double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities was offset by double-digit declines in the travel and hospitality industry and a high single-digit decline in retail and consumer goods. While still challenged on a year-over-year basis, we have witnessed some stabilization in the last 2 quarters, particularly within retail and consumer goods, which grew modestly on a sequential basis. Communications, media and technology grew 3.4%, which included a negative 790 basis points impact from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. Outside of this impact, we remain very pleased with the business momentum within technology. 
Communications and media growth accelerated sequentially and grew low double-digit growth year-over-year, helped in part by several of our acquisitions. 
Now moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP operating margin was 11.1% and adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 12.3%. Both our GAAP and adjusted operating margin included a negative 300 basis points impact related to the anticipated contract exit, which includes an approximately 160 basis points impact to gross margin. 
Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.59 and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, which both included a negative $0.25 per share impact from the anticipated contract exit. Our adjusted tax rate was 32.9% in the quarter, reflecting the change -- the charge related to the anticipated contract exit, which generated losses that are not tax deductible. 
Adjusted operating margin declined approximately 470 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the charge related to the anticipated contract exit, high incentive compensation, annual merit increases and investments in organic and inorganic revenue growth. Savings from our Fit for Growth program, lower T&E and favorable movement in the rupee partially offset this pressure. 
During the quarter, we completed our Fit for Growth program, achieving $530 million in gross annualized savings through continued cost discipline, which has allowed us to accelerate our growth investments. The majority of savings achieved under this program benefits our gross margin, while the accelerated pace of investments is primarily being captured in SG&A. These investments include an accelerated pace of acquisitions which we believe are key to our business transformation, additional sales hiring, repositioning the Cognizant brand and hiring more senior talent in international markets to drive growth. We manage the business at the operating margin level and therefore, believe it is a better metric to judge the profitability of the business. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or $2 billion net of debt. As a reminder, at the end of October, we fully repaid our outstanding revolving credit facility of $1.7 billion. 
Cash flow in Q4 was again strong, with free cash flow of $809 million. This brought our full year free cash flow to $2.9 billion. DSO ended the year at 70 days, representing a year-over-year improvement of 3 days. 
In '21, we expect to see our free cash flow decline from 2020 levels as a result of several benefits we experienced this year, which will not repeat in 2021. These include government offered deferrals of certain tax payments and a lower cash payment related to our 2019 annual incentive compensation, which was paid in Q1 2020. 
Our outlook for '21 assumes free cash flow conversion will return to more normalized levels around 100% of net income as we focus on building upon the DSO improvements achieved this year. We opportunistically utilized our strong free cash flow in 2020 and continue to achieve capital deployment strategy, utilizing over 110% of annual free cash flow. 
In 2020, we spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions, representing approximately 40% of our full year free cash flow. We returned approximately 70% of our free cash flow through $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $480 million in dividends. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we have reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on India earnings. This decision allows us to more efficiently utilize 100% of free cash flow globally, giving us greater flexibility in our ongoing capital allocation program. 
Over the next several years, we plan to deploy 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. We intend to allocate 50% of free cash flow towards M&A in areas aligned with our strategic priorities. The remaining 50% will be allocated to dividends and share repurchases, targeting a consistent dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% and repurchases to offset dilution annually. While these are a set of guiding principles, we will continue to be opportunistic in our allocation of capital as well as leverage our strong balance sheet. 
In support of this strategy, during the fourth quarter, the Board approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, and today, we are announcing a 9% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, the second consecutive year of increase since initiated the dividend in 2017. 
Turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $4.34 billion to $4.38 billion, representing 2.8% to 3.8% growth or 1% to 2% in constant currency based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable 180 basis points impact. This outlook assumes an improving yet still cautious start to the year with continued macro uncertainty. We expect stabilization in financial services and continued pressure across retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality and communication center media, Q1 also still includes an approximately 85 basis points of headwind from the exit of certain content services. 
For the full year, we expect revenue of $17.6 billion to $18.1 billion, representing 5.5% to 8.5% growth or 4% to 7% in constant currency, based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable 150 basis points impact. This outlook includes approximately 300 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue and assumes improving revenue momentum from Q1 levels. 
Our full year outlook assumes an approximately 30 basis point headwind from the exit of content services. To put the full year guidance and better perspective, there are several factors impacting the quarterly guidance to highlight. First, keep in mind, our Q2 2020 actuals included a combined impact of COVID and the ransomware attack, which will lead to easier year-over-year comparison Q2 2021 and growth levels above our full year outlook. Second, the charge recognized in Q4 related to the anticipated exit from the customer engagement will create challenging year-over-year compares through Q3 and then an easy compare in Q4. However, this does not impact full year revenue comparisons. 
Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. We expect margins to be at the low end of that range and to operate within the range each quarterly period for the full year. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $3.90 to $4.02. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $20 million to $30 million versus $119 million in 2020, as a result, of the $1.2 billion cash repatriation in the fourth quarter, which moved cash from India to other jurisdictions with lower yields. 
Our outlook soon average shares outstanding of approximately $530 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. 
Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies. 
With that, we will open the call for questions."

And I think we still have a few years of work ahead of us, but we've made huge progress, and I'm very proud of the team and grateful for everything that they've helped us to do. If you go back 2 years ago, we talked about a transformation office that started with our strategic direction and refinements, which naturally led to refinements of our company portfolio, both exiting nonstrategic elements. Such as content moderation as well as strengthening our digital capabilities with an intensive targeted set of M&A transactions. We're now much more in the strategic execution mode, and there are 4 elements to that. Core to this is globalizing and repositioning the brand. You've seen some recent announcements. We'll have more to go through in the coming weeks and months. That will actually help us with our second goal, that of globalizing Cognizant, which involves really getting after underpenetrated markets internationally, which today still represent approximately 1/4 of our revenue as well as giving clients around the world, greater assurance that we have a robust and resilient delivery network. The third goal will be around accelerating digital, and we made good progress there, and we will continue to invest behind this strategic goal and I should point out that clients are very pleased that we are actually showing up with a broader portfolio, giving them optionality and alternatives. And then the fourth point that you'll see us continue to invest in as part of our transformation is increasing our relevance to clients. That has involved us changing out some of our commercial teams, refreshing them bringing in people with much deeper industry knowledge and indeed sub industry knowledge and making sure we have client-facing teams who can interface across the entire C-suite of Global 2000 companies. So we've accomplished a great deal. Some would say against the odds, particularly given COVID and ransomware in the last year. But the team are energized. We're in this together, and we're all committed to do something incredible in the coming years. But that's why, to be very honest, we've also left room in our financial plan in the coming years to continue to invest behind the transformation because we're not done yet."

I believe we're more client-facing than we have been in recent years. That starts with a tone from the top, but we've also added significant coverage in the course of the last year. In some regards, that's positive, but it should be more positive on a go-forward basis as well because these people that we brought into the company will ultimately become more productive as time goes on. And some of the goodness from that, which will ramp over time, will also be complemented by the fact we've had some disruption this year because we've been upgrading our client-facing teams. Because we wanted to have a set of client-facing teams who are better capable of conversing across the entire C-suite. So I think we're stronger. We're more energized. We're more client centric. Frankly, we also have a stronger portfolio. We have been aggressive in our M&A stance in the past year. We got a lot of momentum behind the assets we've acquired, and that puts us in a position where we can show up well beyond the CIO, CTO organization and now engage much more broadly at the C-suite. Similarly, I think it is fair to say that the -- there is growing optimism in the market. If I think about client behavior, clients are certainly making investment decisions it's somewhat of an uncertain background because of where we are with vaccine rollout spread to world. But clients are being decisive. And in decision is the enemy of services company. So I'm happy to see them making decisions. What are they putting their money behind? Ultimately, growth acceleration, efficiency, agility, scalability, business continuity, of course, this leads to investment decisions, if you will, around Customer 360, customer experience, cloud acceleration, automation, hyper personalization, of course, which brings me with the core and data modernization, AI analytics and machine learning. So this is all happening in a period where we're working in a different manner. And clients have gotten used to working via distributed agile, which I think will fuel different ways of working going forward. I believe it's also giving rise to questions around who strategic partners are, which is why we're really committed to continuing to invest behind industry thought leadership, industry solutions, partnerships, technology consulting and vendor consolidation is real, and I'm delighted to say Cognizant can truly play across build, operate and indeed into transformation innovation with our extended brand. So I feel very good about our position. The market is getting stronger. If anything, right now, what we have is a disconnect between demand supply economics. And I'm worried about skill shortages across the industry."

And that is built into as well as our continued investment of building out our organic growth capabilities. Our investments into marketing, et cetera. So the guidance includes the substantive continuation of our strategic initiatives into '21. That was very important for Brian and me as we devised our budget process that we continue committed to executing that strategy, which is a multiyear strategy. Future acquisitions, as I indicated, we're planning to continue on our M&A strategy, illustrated our capital allocation outlook and plan. So if we were spend another $1 billion on acquisitions, that would be incremental margin pressure that is now built could be incremental margin page. That's not built into our guidance as always will be incremental. But I think the plan as it is, provides full support of the strategic direction that Brian illustrated earlier."

First of all, yes, we feel good about our guidance for 2021. It sees us accelerate revenue, show margin expansion, whilst ultimately investing materially into the future. But I always want to be crystal clear on these calls that our goal is to drive shareholder value creation by positioning Cognizant for medium and long-term success and sustained earnings growth, and I think the best way for us to get about doing that is to get after the revenue opportunities. Look, we're in the middle of a -- what we're calling a multiyear project to reposition the company. And genuinely, pleased with how the team has come together. We're united, we're ambitious. We're eager to prove our potential. In 2020, I ask the team to pull together to operationalize the transformation agenda. That included strategic, organizational, cultural indeed financial elements, and some of it was uncomfortable for certain segments of the employee base. But we executed an aggressive M&A strategy to complement our portfolio. We executed a restructuring program. The savings of which allowed us to start reinvesting in the business, including hiring those commercial resources we referenced earlier. And with bookings now up in the mid-teens, the P&L can start to work again. And that was the secret sauce of Cognizant over the years. It was always a growth company fueling investments in our clients with delivery excellence, which afforded us to continue to drive that on a sustainable basis. That's the direction we're taking the company forward. We've got so much more work to do, but I think so much more optimism about the future. And I definitely feel a lot better about our position because a lot of the heavy lifting of the initial portion of the transformation is behind us. We'll continue to invest in delivery excellence, commercial coverage, our talent, our systems and tools, which were not, in my mind, fit-for-purpose for a Fortune 200 company. That's why we announced today, our intent to go forward with Workday and HCM. You know we're investing heavily between IT and security remediation and modernization. We'll continue to invest in our portfolio and in our brand, and we're feeling pretty comfortable in terms of where we are."

So first of all, with regards to the delivery organization of where we stand on that, look, we have a demand supply imbalance, if you will. The market has snapped back aggressively, as evidenced in our strong bookings momentum. I would say that the competition for digital talent is extremely competitive. All major digital domain skills are in high demand across cloud, digital engineering, data, AI and we are, therefore, very much focused on recruitment and attrition. For those of you who track media, you'll see us be much more aggressive in terms of social platforms for hiring. We're doing a luck with our employee base around making sure they see the potential of the company, making sure they understand the growth ambitions of the company, their career opportunities. And so we look forward to trying to optimize that as best we can. But you guys know as much as we do that in a high demand environment, where you have an imbalance, it can lead to certain outcomes. Now we've got to understand what that means in terms of pricing environment as well to be very, very clear. 
With regards to utilization, there's a few things happening simultaneously from my perspective. First of all, clients are embracing new ways of working, including distributed agile, and that has been somewhat forced upon them in 2020. But actually, I think it's worked well. And now many clients are looking at real estate consolidation policies and understanding that we can work for them nearshore, onshore or indeed, offshore. The higher the offshore mix can actually help margin rate, but it's not necessarily helpful to margin dollars or indeed revenue dollars. So we're seeing a trend certainly towards offshore leverage which is pushing the short-term offshore utilization higher as we consume the bench. But I don't know that that's likely to be sustained over the longer-term because we plan to increase our hiring, rebuild our benches, and though we are, as I said earlier, in a high demand environment at this moment in time. We're also doing some tactical things internally. We've recently moved our India-based workforce onto a 9-hour Workday, which is in line, I should add, with industry practice which will result in a reduction of utilization in India, in theory, in the next quarter or so by 1 to 2 points. But we'll continue to look at utilization and track it and understand how these dynamics play in."

These projects are monitored constantly actions and frankly, senior management right up to me get involved in client discussions as needed. I will say we're on top of this. I've reviewed our entire portfolio over the last few years. I know where we stand. We have enhanced rigor in our dealer review and solutioning processes. Many of those aspects, by the way, have been changed in the past year. And just as a reminder, we have a new CFO who's pretty hands on. We have a new global delivery leader who came into last year.

We were quite intentional in the last year that as we're globalizing the company, so too, that we want to localize the company to a certain extent. So that means, as an example, we've recently changed that our Head of Japan. We've hired a Japanese local previously was the Head of Microsoft Japan, prior experience in Oracle, HP, IBM Japan. So somebody with followership amongst clients, somebody would followership with talent and a roster of C-suite networks in the country. That's important to me, but we also need the people who can fit in with Cognizant culture, are extremely energetic and really want to do something incredible in the years ahead. I've got to say it's been an absolute pleasure. We've been able to attract incredible talent to Cognizant across upgrades we've made in the U.K., Ireland, in the Nordics, in Germany, in Australia, New Zealand, in Japan and indeed as the new Head of Global Growth Markets, Ursula, who joined us in the month of December as well. And I'm very optimistic that they will ramp rapidly because there are a class A type personalities, very senior, quick studies. We've helped them already with multiyear business plans to see how we can drive exponential growth in these geographies. Of course, I want to give them time to settle in, but they know that they've been hired with great expectations. And of course, they're charged not just with delivering commercially and from a delivery point of view locally and spending for the principles of the company, but also we are pivoting, transforming the company, the classic, very heavy leverage of application outsourcing, labor arbitrage, India model is being complemented, of course, with much more local selling, solutioning and delivery as we're driving across the entire C-suite to sell projects. So I'm very optimistic. I'm very excited about the potential we have overseas. And I think it's an area that we haven't adequately mined internationally, and it's an area that, frankly, should enable us to drive nice growth. The broader talent question ultimately goes back to the market dynamics, which are stronger. If you look at the industry analysts these days, many of them are thinking about growth rate in the 3% to 6% for the entire industry going forward. Digital skills are particularly in demand. And that's something I think the entire industry is facing into. We can control what we will. So we are 100% focused as the management team around recruitment and around attrition and making sure we can fulfill against our bookings momentum. In the same vein, I'm proud to say we promoted tens of thousands of associates recently and rewarded the majority of our employees with a merit-based salary increase and indeed, this year, we accrued and we will pay bonuses at higher levels than last year, notwithstanding COVID-19 and a ransomware attack. So we have a more rigorous approach to talent. You will see that process continue. We will probably be faced with still sequential pressure in involuntary attrition simply because we're going through end of year cycles. And after bonuses are paid, we'll see what happens. But we're 100% focused on attrition and recruiting and 100% focus on ensuring that our employee value proposition and employee brand is world-class."

Obviously, we have a rich heritage in application development and application maintenance, but that gives us a tremendous opportunity then to move much more forward, leveraging the strong skill sets and the talent that we acquired with Softvision back in 2018. In fact, we've done 2 digital engineering acquisitions in the last probably 4 months, Tin Roof in the United States as well as Magenic and that most recently as well in this week that we closed. And you'll see us continue to complement those across the globe. We already have a very strong footprint across North America, and you'll see us continue to embellish, Western Europe with that skill set as well. Of course, we think we're entering a new phase of digital, and this brings with it different dynamics. Clients aren't thinking of digital necessarily anymore simply as the classic tech stack at the bottom where they think about applications or infrastructure or data our vision is ultimately that clients will recognize that power of digital is not in those silos investments, but more across business processes and operating models. And that ultimately involves selling value, delivering value. It involves intelligence in consumer-grade applications from a CX point of view with security grade features ultimately driven by intelligence that's fueled by massive data modern architecture sitting on cloud platforms. And our digital engineering play truly bitter interactive and experienced capabilities makes us one of the only companies in the world that can scale from the bottom of the tech stack right up to the top. There are certain pure-play digital companies that play in certain arenas. There are certain IPPs that play more at the bottom of the stack. But we're one of, I think, the 2 companies in the world can truly scale top to bottom in that regard. And core to this belief as well, by the way, is the notion that processes will ultimately become more agile, data-driven and automated with a huge focus on CX. We've got some great examples already, by the way, in the portfolio, both vertically as well as horizontally. ATG is a company we acquired in 2018. It's a leader in advisory, implementation and managed services in quote to cash. And that's one example or Lev another sales force platform partner that we acquired in 2020 helps business is simplify and modernize marketing campaigns, leveraging Salesforce marketing Cloud and that really helps them provide data insight and personalization across their customer journey. This, in my mind, is where digital is going. It's not about silo tech stacks. I personally have collapsed our organization to really get at the intersection point of cloud and digital. This is happening when certain other companies are actually doubling down in cloud silos, but I actually think the true value is that intersection point. And I feel we can truly get after new customers, but we're also dislodging certain companies from accounts that they've lung held. Some of these companies are private companies, some are public, but we feel we got one of the biggest digital engineering companies in the world, and you'll see us continue to double that in that regard."

Good afternoon, everybody. Today, I'd like to address 3 topics with you, namely, a brief summary of the fourth quarter, our continuing progress executing our strategy and our confidence about the future. Let me start with Q4. Fourth qu",2004,"Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everybody. Today, I'd like to address 3 topics with you, namely, a brief summary of the fourth quarter, our continuing progress executing our strategy and our confidence about the future. Let me start with Q4. 
Fourth quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, a decline of 3% year-over-year in constant currency. This included a negative 120 basis point impact from the exit of content moderation services and a negative 250 basis points impact related to the anticipated exit from a large Financial Services engagement. This relates to a complex ambitious project that was scoped in late 2018. Over time, both parties realized that the transformation aspect of the project as initially conceived was unlikely to achieve our shared expectations. I'm confident that it is in everyone's interest to manage to an exit. Jan will provide more details on the financial implications of this exit in his remarks. However, I want to underscore that I'm confident in both our client portfolio and our deal review and solutioning processes, many aspects of which we've overhauled in the last year. Excluding the impact from the anticipated exits from this engagement, we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations and/or guidance. Gross margins increased, cash flow was strong, and we continue to invest significantly to fuel our growth priorities.
We maintained our momentum in the quarter with full year 2020 bookings growth in the mid-teens. With over 1 year of data, assumption tweaks and refinements behind us, our analytics have been improved on point of bookings, bookings growth, including renewals and new business, and bookings to revenue. We entered 2021 with growing confidence in our strategic, operational and commercial progress and a strengthening demand environment. In fact, we're on track to bring in more new hires in Q1 than ever before as we ramp our hiring capacity to accommodate our growth plans for 2021 and beyond.
That said, the market for skilled digital talent is intensely competitive, creating demand supply imbalances for certain skills. This, coupled with other factors, including our more rigorous approach to merit-based promotions and salary adjustments, has led to meaningful sequential increases in voluntary attrition. We will continue to closely monitor and action this, including reviewing remuneration, underscoring our employee value proposition and reinforcing the career path opportunities created by our growing momentum. From an industry point of view, we believe Financial Services will see a gradual recovery in 2021, returning to growth over the course of the year, notwithstanding the anticipated exit of the engagement referenced earlier.
During 2020, we took a series of actions in financial services, including refreshing more than 1/4 of our commercial teams, adding more commercial coverage and strengthening our partnership ecosystem and industry solutions. We closed the year with a healthy book-to-bill ratio in both insurance and banking. With these actions and our enhanced portfolio at the intersection of cloud and digital, we are now better positioned to help Financial Services clients with their transformation and innovation agendas.
Healthcare growth slowed modestly in Q4 as we lapped the Zenith Technologies' acquisition in life sciences. However, the fundamentals of our payer healthcare business has been improving in recent quarters. We anticipate further growth acceleration in the first half of 2021 driven by a reinvigorated U.S. healthcare business, including our strategic products portfolio and a strong outlook in life sciences. 
Products and resources continues to be impacted by COVID-19-related to weakness in travel and hospitality and retail and consumer goods. Meanwhile, we see continued momentum in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Communications, media and technology continues to grow double digits year-over-year when adjusted for the effects of the exit of the nonstrategic content services business. Jan will provide more insights on the quarter in his prepared remarks.
Macro trends are largely unchanged from those I discussed in our third quarter call. Clients are making investment decisions. They know they must be agile, innovative, software-driven enterprises. We see continued focus on customer and employee experience initiatives, customer 360, cloud acceleration, packaged applications, platform capabilities and automation. Hyper-personalization and the need for intelligent decision-making are fueling significant demand in analytics, AI and ML. Clients are embracing new ways of working, including distributed agile, following their successful COVID-induced experience in 2020. Our strategy to focus on industry-specific and horizontal digital workflows is resonating with clients. The next phase of digital is about transforming processes to become agile, data-driven and automated and always with an eye on customer experience. This moves digital beyond technology and into the heart of business operating models and processes.
Finally, we continue to see clients determine their strategic partners. Cognizant stands the benefit from this trend, given our high levels of customer satisfaction or enhanced portfolio and our growing reputation in digital. I'm particularly pleased by our growing client momentum. We see meaningful opportunity for cross-selling in our existing accounts, given our refreshed client-facing teams, stronger portfolio and enhanced account planning. A recent example is a Fortune 500 resources company that sought to digitally transform its workplace experience for employees while eliminating the operational inefficiencies caused by an over-reliance on multiple in-country outsourcers and contractors. Cognizant's WorkNEXT digital workplace solutions suite matched the client's requirement for transformation through self-service and automation. This led to a 45% reduction in operating costs and higher levels of customer satisfaction, given 70% plus first coal resolution. While we see a huge opportunity to cross-sell in our existing accounts and are naturally focused on that, we're also focused on extending our market coverage by leveraging the commercial investments made in 2020.
In the past year, we broke into more than 40 new Global 2000 accounts, providing meaningful cross-sell opportunities for ore delivery and commercial teams. One such client is a leading credit ratings agency that aims to transform into an agile DevOps engineering-led operating model whilst consolidating its vendors and eliminating legacy systems and technologies. We led with digital engineering to build innovative solutions using modern cloud-native and digital technologies by full stack product teams. We are applying a lean, agile approach to drive a product development mindset and the adoption of an agile software development framework.
Moving now to strategy. To realize our revenue growth, we are now several quarters into executing a strategy focused on 4 priorities: repositioning the Cognizant brand, globalizing Cognizant, accelerating digital and increasing our client relevance. There's a quick update on each priority starting with our brand.
In the coming months, we will launch a breakthrough global brand campaign that will increase the stature of our brands. With a focus on scaling Cognizant's brand globally, we will execute a series of experiential marketing initiatives and sponsorships. For example, we recently announced that we're the title partner of Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One team. Aston Martin, an iconic brand, is returning to the Formula One grade after more than 60 years away from the sport. This is much more than a sponsorship. It's a broader strategic partnership aligned with our automotive industry focus and one that's at the intersection of cloud and digital. The Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One team will be heavily focused trackside, applying 5G, IoT and data analytics to support critical decision-making. For Aston Martin Lagonda, the road car company, will help execute their digital transformation agenda, focusing on outcomes like hyper-personalized experiences for their customers and building a direct-to-consumer value proposition. We'll also partner with Aston Martin to evolve its facilities into smart factories, leveraging 5G and IoT to achieve optimal performance and output. Given the race circuit across 22 countries and the global following of Formula One in Europe, Middle East and Asia, this sponsorship also aligns with our second priority, that of globalizing our company. 
We see a huge opportunity internationally, having hired a diverse group of senior country managing directors in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, the Nordics, Australia, New Zealand and Japan and a new President of our international business, we are in a stronger position than ever to drive towards this goal. These senior leaders bring both client networks and talent followership. They will also lead the business transformation we are undergoing at a local level as we pivot to helping clients realize their digital ambitions. I'm extremely excited about our ability to drive exponential growth in our international business once this team settles in. We are committed to invest behind this ambition, both organically and inorganically. 
In January, we agreed to acquire Servian, an Australia-based enterprise transformation consultancy that specializes in data analytics, AI, digital services, experience design and cloud. Servian expands our integrated end-to-end digital transformation capabilities in both Australia and New Zealand. 
This brings me to our third strategic priority, accelerating digital. Over the last 18 months, we've sharpened our ability to support clients as they transform into software-driven enterprises. Since January 2020, we've announced approximately $1.6 billion in acquisitions, all focused on our strategic priorities of digital engineering, data and AI, cloud and IoT, which together enable clients to compete as modern digital businesses. Earlier this week, we closed the acquisition of Magenic, a 25-year-old custom software development services company, which will broaden our global software product engineering network, adding hundreds of engineers in the U.S. and the Philippines. Magenic is our second digital engineering acquisition in recent months, making us one of the world's largest digital engineering firms. We also closed the acquisition of Linium this week, which broadens our enterprise service management capabilities and complements our ServiceNow practice.  
I'm pleased with the growing intimacy we share with our key partners, including the leading hyperscale and SaaS companies. Long-established relationships with Oracle and SAP have been complemented with growing commitments to next-generation companies like Workday, Salesforce, Snowflake and ServiceNow. In fact, we just committed to deploy Workday internally as our HCM partner.
In digital business operations, we are committed to infusing intelligent automation across our operations to deliver end-to-end, adaptable and responsive processes. Our deep and long-standing global partnerships with leading companies, such as UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Indico and Appian, enables us to enhance the automation spectrum from robotic to cognitive process. Our fourth strategic priority is about increasing our relevance to clients. To support this, in 2020, we've been investing in our industry and sub-industry knowledge, strengthening our partnership ecosystem and refreshing our client-facing teams to ensure deeper industry expertise and technology consulting skills. We aim to be even more proactive with our clients, leading with a point of view on technology strategy, architecture and agile digital workflows. We aim to build upon our excellent reputation in build operate and further strengthen our growing reputation in transformation and innovation. This is a multiyear journey, but one that our clients are happy to see us embrace as they look for alternative strategic partners.
In closing, we are now almost 2 years into a project to ensure Cognizant returns to its rightful place as an industry bellwether. We accomplished a great deal in 2020 despite being faced with the complexities of COVID and a ransomware attack. This progress scorecard includes: rallying the company behind a clear purpose and vision; improving employee engagement levels to multiyear highs; refreshing our leadership team and talent; executing against our refined corporate strategy, including adjusting our portfolio via targeted mergers and acquisitions and the exit of nonstrategic businesses; improving our backlog; win rates and bookings trajectory; completing our restructuring program; investing in strategic ESG and D&I initiatives; and accelerating investments in our future growth.
A new reinvigorated Cognizant is emerging, having successfully completed a good deal of our transformation work. I'm pleased with the progress we've made and our ability to start demonstrating this in 2021. There is, of course, more work to do, but we are on track executing well, united as a leadership team and doing what it takes to become a preeminent technology services partner to the Global 2000 C-suite.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal year outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you."

I'm delighted to be with you on my second earnings call and to be reporting another good quarter, excluding the onetime impact I'll discuss more later. The business performed well, modestly exceeding our expectations earlier in the quarter, driven by solid performance across the board, excluding Financial Services and the industries most directly impacted by COVID, notably retail, consumer goods and travel and hospitality. 
For the full year, revenue was $16.7 billion representing a decline of 0.8% compared to 2019 and a decline of 0.7% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year, this includes a negative 110 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services, a negative 70 basis point impact of the anticipated exit from a large engagement in our Financial Services segment and a positive approximately 210 basis points of contribution from our acquired businesses.
For the full year, digital grew over 13% and represented approximately 42% of total revenue, an increase of 5 points as a percentage of total revenue from 2019. Our Q4 revenue was $4.2 billion, representing a decline of 2.3% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year period, this includes a negative 250 basis points impact of the anticipated exit from a large engagement in our Financial Services segment, a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services and a positive 270 basis points of contribution from our acquisitions.
Before moving on, I will provide some additional details relating to the anticipated exit from the previously mentioned large engagement. In discussions, the parties agreed that a clean separation would be to our mutual benefit. As a result of those discussions, in the fourth quarter, we made an offer that includes, among other terms, a proposed payment and the forgiveness of certain receivables. As a result of this offer, we recorded a $140 million charge in the fourth quarter, which included a reduction to Q4 revenue of $107 million, and additional expenses of $33 million, which impacted SG&A primarily related to the impairment of long-lived assets. The charge exclusively impacts our Financial Services segment.  We are in active discussions and hope to have a finalized agreement in the near future.
Now moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services declined 11.4% and including a negative 730 basis points impact from the anticipated contract exit. Excluding this impact, banking and insurance both declined mid-single digits. In banking, growth in regional and retail banking in North America was more than offset by weakness in cards and payments clients. Insurance also performed below our expectations driven primarily by weakness in North America. Healthcare grew 3.3%, which included similar performance in both in the U.S. payer business and life sciences. Life sciences revenue was strong among our pharmaceutical clients, further enhanced by the expansion of our portfolio of services as a result of our acquisitions of Zenith Technologies. Growth was partially offset by the continued weakness in medical device clients, which have been impacted by reduced elective procedures volumes. Our Healthcare payer business had the best performance in 7 quarters, with strength in software license sales from the addition of several new logos.  
Products and resources declined 2.4% as low double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities was offset by double-digit declines in the travel and hospitality industry and a high single-digit decline in retail and consumer goods. While still challenged on a year-over-year basis, we have witnessed some stabilization in the last 2 quarters, particularly within retail and consumer goods, which grew modestly on a sequential basis. 
Communications, Media and Technology grew 3.4%, which included a negative 790 basis points impact from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. Outside of this impact, we remain very pleased with the business momentum within technology. Communications and media growth accelerated sequentially and grew low double-digit growth year-over-year, helped in part by several of our acquisitions.
Now moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP operating margin was 11.1% and adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 12.3%. Both our GAAP and adjusted operating margin included a negative 300 basis points impact related to the anticipated contract exit, which includes an approximately 160 basis points impact to gross margin. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.59 and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, which both included a negative $0.25 per share impact from the anticipated contract exit. 
Our adjusted tax rate was 32.9% in the quarter, reflecting the change -- the charge related to the anticipated contract exit, which generated losses that are not tax deductible.
Adjusted operating margin declined approximately 470 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the charge related to the anticipated contract exit, high incentive compensation, annual merit increases and investments in organic and inorganic revenue growth. Savings from our Fit for Growth program, lower T&E and favorable movement in the rupee partially offset this pressure.  
During the quarter, we completed our Fit for Growth program, achieving $530 million in gross annualized savings through continued cost discipline, which has allowed us to accelerate our growth investments. The majority of savings achieved under this program benefits our gross margin, while the accelerated pace of investments is primarily being captured in SG&A. These investments include an accelerated pace of acquisitions, which we believe are key to our business transformation, additional sales hiring, repositioning the Cognizant brand and hiring more senior talent in international markets to drive growth. We manage the business at the operating margin level and, therefore, believe it is a better metric to judge the profitability of the business.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or $2 billion net of debt. As a reminder, at the end of October, we fully repaid our outstanding revolving credit facility of $1.7 billion. Cash flow in Q4 was again strong with free cash flow of $809 million. This brought our full year free cash flow to $2.9 billion. DSO ended the year at 70 days, representing a year-over-year improvement of 3 days. 
In '21, we expect to see our free cash flow decline from 2020 levels as a result of several benefits we experienced this year, which will not repeat in 2021. These include government-offered deferrals of certain tax payments and a lower cash payment related to our 2019 annual incentive compensation, which was paid in Q1 2020. Our outlook for '21 assumes free cash flow conversion will return to more normalized levels around 100% of net income as we focus on building upon the DSO improvements achieved this year. We opportunistically utilized our strong free cash flow in 2020 and continued to achieve capital deployment strategy utilizing over 110% of annual free cash flow. In 2020, we spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions, representing approximately 40% of our full year free cash flow. We returned approximately 70% of our free cash flow through $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $480 million in dividends.
As I mentioned last quarter, we have reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on India earnings. This decision allows us to more efficiently utilize 100% of free cash flow globally, giving us greater flexibility in our ongoing capital allocation program. Over the next several years, we plan to deploy 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. We intend to allocate 50% of free cash flow towards M&A in areas aligned with our strategic priorities. The remaining 50% will be allocated to dividends and share repurchases, targeting a consistent dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% and repurchases to offset dilution annually. While these are a set of guiding principles, we will continue to be opportunistic in our allocation of capital as well as leverage our strong balance sheet. In support of this strategy, during the fourth quarter, the Board approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, and today, we are announcing a 9% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. The second consecutive year of increase since initiated the dividend in 2017.
Turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $4.34 billion to $4.38 billion, representing 2.8% to 3.8% growth or 1% to 2% in constant currency based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable 180 basis points impact. This outlook assumes an improving yet still cautious start to the year with continued macro uncertainty. We expect stabilization in Financial Services and continued pressure across retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality and communications and media. Q1 also still includes an approximately 85 basis points of headwind from the exit of certain content services.
For the full year, we expect revenue of $17.6 billion to $18.1 billion, representing 5.5% to 8.5% growth or 4% to 7% in constant currency, based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable 150 basis points impact. This outlook includes approximately 300 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue and assumes improving revenue momentum from Q1 levels. Our full year outlook assumes an approximately 30 basis point headwind from the exit of content services. 
To put the full year guidance in better perspective, there are several factors impacting the quarterly guidance to highlight. First, keep in mind, our Q2 2020 actuals included a combined impact of COVID and the ransomware attack, which will lead to easier year-over-year comparison Q2 2021 and growth levels above our full year outlook. Second, the charge recognized in Q4 related to the anticipated exit from the customer engagement will create challenging year-over-year compares through Q3 and then an easy compare in Q4. However, this does not impact full year revenue comparisons.
Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. We expect margins to be at the low end of that range and to operate within the range each quarterly period for the full year. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $3.90 to $4.02. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $20 million to $30 million versus $119 million in 2020 as a result of the $1.2 billion cash repatriation in the fourth quarter, which moved cash from India to other jurisdictions with lower yields. Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 530 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies.
With that, we will open the call for questions."

I'd say we're in the middle, and I think we still have a few years' work ahead of us, but we've made huge progress, and I'm very proud of the team and grateful for everything that they've helped us to do. If you go back 2 years ago, we talked about a transformation office that started with our strategic direction and refinements, which naturally led to refinements of our company portfolio, both exiting nonstrategic elements such as content moderation as well as strengthening our digital capabilities with an intensive targeted set of M&A transactions. We're now much more in the strategic execution mode, and there are 4 elements to that. Core to this is globalizing and repositioning the brand. You've seen some recent announcements. We'll have more to go through in the coming weeks and months. That will actually help us with our second goal, that of globalizing Cognizant, which involves really getting after underpenetrated markets internationally, which today still represent approximately 1/4 of our revenue, as well as giving clients around the world greater assurance that we have a robust and resilient delivery network. 
The third goal will be around accelerating digital, and we made good progress there, and we will continue to invest behind this strategic goal. And I should point out that clients are very pleased that we are actually showing up with a broader portfolio, giving them optionality and alternatives. And then the fourth point that you'll see us continue to invest in as part of our transformation is increasing our relevance to clients. That has involved us changing out some of our commercial teams, refreshing them, bringing in people with much deeper industry knowledge and indeed sub-industry knowledge and making sure we have client-facing teams who can interface across the entire C-suite of Global 2000 companies. So we've accomplished a great deal some would say against the odds, particularly given COVID and ransomware in the last year. But the team are energized, we're in this together, and we're all committed to do something incredible in the coming years. But that's why, to be very honest, we've also left room in our financial plan in the coming years to continue to invest behind the transformation because we're not done yet."

So look, I think, first of all, it's fair to say, I believe we are more competitive than we have been, I believe we're more client-facing than we have been in recent years, and that starts with a tone from the top, but we've also added significant coverage in the course of the last year. In some regards, that's positive, but it should be more positive on a go-forward basis as well because these people that we brought into the company will ultimately become more productive as time goes on. And some of the goodness from that, which will ramp over time, will also be complemented by the fact we've had some disruption this year because we've been upgrading our client-facing teams because we wanted to have a set of client-facing teams who are better capable of conversing across the entire C-suite. So I think we're stronger, we're more energized, we're more client-centric. Frankly, we also have a stronger portfolio. We have been aggressive in our M&A stance in the past year. We got a lot of momentum behind the assets we've acquired, and that puts us in a position where we can show up well beyond the CIO, CTO organization and now engage much more broadly at the C-suite. 
Similarly, I think it is fair to say that the -- there is growing optimism in the market. If I think about client behavior, clients are certainly making investment decisions. It's somewhat of an uncertain background because of where we are with vaccine rollout spread to world. But clients are being decisive. And indecision is the enemy of CEOs of services companies. So I'm happy to see them making decisions. What are they putting their money behind? Ultimately, growth acceleration, efficiency, agility, scalability, business continuity, of course. This leads to investment decisions, if you will, around Customer 360, customer experience, cloud acceleration, automation, hyper-personalization, of course, which brings me with the core and data modernization, AI analytics and machine learning. So this is all happening in a period where we're working in a different manner, and clients have gotten used to working via distributed agile, which I think will fuel different ways of working going forward. 
I believe it's also giving rise to questions around who strategic partners are, which is why we're really committed to continuing to invest behind the industry thought leadership, industry solutions, partnerships, technology consulting and vendor consolidation is real, and I'm delighted to say Cognizant can truly play across build, operate and indeed into transformation innovation with our extended brand. So I feel very good about our position. The market is getting stronger. If anything, right now, what we have is a disconnect between demand supply economics, and I'm worried about skill shortages across the industry."

And that is built into as well as our continued investment of building out our organic growth capabilities, our investments into marketing, et cetera. So the guidance includes the substantive continuation of our strategic initiatives into '21. That was very important for Brian and me as we devised our budget process that we continue committed to executing that strategy, which is a multiyear strategy. Future acquisitions, as I indicated, we're planning to continue on our M&A strategy. I illustrated our capital allocation outlook and plan. So if we were spend another $1 billion on acquisitions, that would be incremental margin pressure that is now built -- could be incremental margin pressure that's not built into our guidance as always, will be incremental.

First of all, yes, we feel good about our guidance for 2021. It sees us accelerate revenue, show margin expansion, whilst ultimately investing materially into the future. But I always want to be crystal clear on these calls that our goal is to drive shareholder value-creation by positioning Cognizant for medium- and long-term success and sustained earnings growth, and I think the best way for us to get about doing that is to get after the revenue opportunities. Look, we're in the middle of a -- what we're calling a multiyear project to reposition the company. I'm genuinely pleased with how the team has come together. We're united, we're ambitious, we're eager to prove our potential. In 2020, I ask the team to pull together to operationalize the transformation agenda. That included strategic, organizational, cultural and indeed financial elements, and some of it was uncomfortable for certain segments of the employee base. But we executed an aggressive M&A strategy to complement our portfolio. We executed a restructuring program. The savings of which allowed us to start reinvesting in the business, including hiring those commercial resources we referenced earlier. And with bookings now up in the mid-teens, the P&L can start to work again. And that was the secret sauce of Cognizant over the years. It was always a growth company fueling investments in our clients with delivery excellence, which afforded us to continue to drive that on a sustainable basis. 
That's the direction we're taking the company forwards. We've got so much more work to do, but I think so much more optimism about the future. And I definitely feel a lot better about our position because a lot of the heavy lifting of the initial portion of the transformation is behind us. We'll continue to invest in delivery excellence, commercial coverage, our talent, our systems and tools, which were not, in my mind, fit-for-purpose for a Fortune 200 company. That's why we announced today our intent to go forward with Workday and HCM. You know we're investing heavily between IT and security remediation and modernization. We'll continue to invest in our portfolio and in our brand, and we're feeling pretty comfortable in terms of where we are."

So first of all, with regards to the delivery organization of where we stand on that. Look, we have a demand supply imbalance, if you will. The market has snapped back aggressively as evidenced in our strong bookings momentum. I would say that the competition for digital talent is extremely competitive. All major digital domain skills are in high demand across cloud, digital engineering, data, AI, ML. We are, therefore, very much focused on recruitment and attrition. For those of you who track media, you'll see us be much more aggressive in terms of social platforms for hiring. We're doing a lot of work with our employee base around making sure they see the potential of the company, making sure they understand the growth ambitions of the company, their career opportunities. And so we look forward to trying to optimize that as best we can. But you guys know as much as we do that in a high demand environment, where you have an imbalance, it can lead to certain outcomes. Now we've got to understand what that means in terms of pricing environment as well to be very, very clear. 
With regards to utilization, there's a few things happening simultaneously from my perspective. First of all, clients are embracing new ways of working, including distributed agile, and that has been somewhat forced upon them in 2020. But actually, I think it's worked well. And now many clients are looking at real estate consolidation policies and understanding that we can work for them nearshore, onshore or, indeed, offshore. The higher the offshore mix can actually help margin rate, but it's not necessarily helpful to margin dollars or indeed revenue dollars. So we're seeing a trend certainly towards offshore leverage, which is pushing the short-term offshore utilization higher as we consume the bench. But I don't know that that's likely to be sustained over the longer term because we plan to increase our hiring, rebuild our benches, and though we are, as I said earlier, in a high demand environment at this moment in time. 
We're also doing some tactical things internally. We've recently moved our India-based workforce onto a 9-hour Workday, which is in line, I should add, with industry practice, which will result in a reduction of utilization in India in theory in the next quarter or so by 1 to 2 points. But we'll continue to look at utilization and track it and understand how these dynamics play in."

These projects are monitored constantly, actions and frankly, senior management right up to me get involved in client discussions as needed. I will say we're on top of this. I've reviewed our entire portfolio over the last few years. I know where we stand. We have enhanced rigor in our dealer review and solutioning processes. Many of those aspects, by the way, have been changed in the past year.

We were quite intentional in the last year that as we're globalizing the company, so too that we want to localize the company to a certain extent. So that means, as an example, we've recently changed our Head of Japan. We've hired a Japanese local, previously was the Head of Microsoft Japan, prior experience in Oracle, HP, IBM Japan. So somebody with followership amongst clients, somebody would followership with talent and a roster of C-suite networks in the country. That's important to me, but we also need the people who can fit in with Cognizant culture, are extremely energetic and really want to do something incredible in the years ahead. 
I've got to say it's been an absolute pleasure. We've been able to attract incredible talent to Cognizant across upgrades we've made in the U.K., Ireland, in the Nordics, in Germany, in Australia, New Zealand, in Japan and indeed as the new Head of Global Growth Markets, Ursula, who joined us in the month of December as well. And I'm very optimistic that they will ramp rapidly because they're a class A-type personalities, very senior, quick studies. We've helped them already with multiyear business plans to see how we can drive exponential growth in these geographies. Of course, I want to give them time to settle in, but they know that they've been hired with great expectations. And of course, they're charged not just with delivering commercially and from a delivery point of view locally and spending for the principles of the company, but also we are pivoting, transforming the company, the classic, very heavy leverage of application outsourcing, labor arbitrage, India model is being complemented, of course, with much more local selling, solutioning and delivery as we're driving across the entire C-suite to sell projects. So I'm very optimistic and very excited about the potential we have overseas. And I think it's an area that we haven't adequately mined internationally, and it's an area that, frankly, should enable us to drive nice growth. 
The broader talent question ultimately goes back to the market dynamics, which are stronger. If you look at the industry analysts these days, many of them are thinking about growth rate in the 3% to 6% for the entire industry going forward. Digital skills are particularly in demand, and that's something I think the entire industry is facing into. We can control what we will. So we are 100% focused as a management team around recruitment and around attrition and making sure we can fulfill against our bookings momentum. In the same way, and I'm proud to say we've promoted tens of thousands of associates recently and rewarded the majority of our employees with a merit-based salary increase and indeed, this year, we accrued and we will pay bonuses at higher levels than last year, notwithstanding COVID-19 and a ransomware attack. So we have a more rigorous approach to talent. You will see that process continue. We will probably be faced with still sequential pressure in involuntary attrition simply because we're going through end-of-year cycles. And after bonuses are paid, we'll see what happens. But we're 100% focused on attrition and recruiting and 100% focused on ensuring that our employee value proposition and employee brand is world-class."

Obviously, we have a rich heritage in application development and application maintenance, but that gives us a tremendous opportunity then to move much more forward, leveraging the strong skill sets and the talent that we acquired with Softvision back in 2018. In fact, we've done 2 digital engineering acquisitions in the last probably 4 months, Tin Roof in the United States as well as Magenic now most recently as well in this week that we closed. And you'll see us continue to complement those across the globe. We already have a very strong footprint across North America, and you'll see us continue to embellish Western Europe with that skill set as well. Of course, we think we're entering a new phase of digital, and this brings with it different dynamics. Clients aren't thinking of digital necessarily anymore simply as the classic tech stack at the bottom where they think about applications or infrastructure or data. 
Our vision is ultimately that clients will recognize that the power of digital is not in those silos investments, but more across business processes and operating models. And that ultimately involves selling value, delivering value. It involves intelligence in consumer-grade applications from a CX point of view with security-grade features ultimately driven by intelligence that's fueled by massive data, modern architecture sitting on cloud platforms. And our digital engineering play truly with our interactive and experienced capabilities makes us one of the only companies in the world that can scale from the bottom of the tech stack right up to the top. There are certain pure-play digital companies that play in certain arenas. There are certain IPPs that play more at the bottom of the stack. But we're one of, I think, the 2 companies in the world which can truly scale top to bottom in that regard. And core to this belief as well, by the way, is the notion that processes will ultimately become more agile, data-driven and automated with a huge focus on CX. We've got some great examples already, by the way, in the portfolio, both vertically as well as horizontally. 
ATG is a company we acquired in 2018. It's a leader in advisory, implementation and managed services in quote to cash. And that's one example are Lev, another sales force platinum partner that we acquired in 2020, helps businesses simplify and modernize marketing campaigns, leveraging Salesforce marketing cloud and that really helps them provide data insight and personalization across their customer journey. This, in my mind, is where digital is going. It's not about silo tech stacks. I personally have collapsed our organization to really get at the intersection point of cloud and digital. This is happening when certain other companies are actually doubling down in cloud silos, but I actually think the true value is at the intersection point. And I feel we can truly get after new customers, but we're also dislodging certain companies from accounts that they've long held. Some of these companies are private companies, some are public, but we feel we got one of the biggest digital engineering companies in the world, and you'll see us continue to double that in that regard."

Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to start today's call by addressing the humanitarian crisis in India. As many of you know, India is the heart of Cognizant, and home to more than 200,000 of our associates. I would like to express",1851,"Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to start today's call by addressing the humanitarian crisis in India. As many of you know, India is the heart of Cognizant, and home to more than 200,000 of our associates. I would like to express my support and solidarity for our Indian associates wherever they are in the world, and my sympathy for any who have suffered a loss during the pandemic.
In addition to the ongoing support of our associates, which includes home care and hospitalization assistance, vaccination cost reimbursement for our associates and their families, and making vaccine availability easier for those with disabilities, Cognizant is making a multimillion dollar investment to assist India through the crisis. This is focused on covering operational expenses at hospitals throughout India that are caring for COVID-19 patients; funding the efforts of UNICEF in India to deploy oxygen-generation plants, COVID diagnostic testing and medical supplies; and partnering with one of India's leading hospital chains to set up vaccination centers in locations across the country, including some of Cognizant's owned facilities.
The impact of the pandemic on industry attrition rates, absenteeism and client delivery remains somewhat uncertain. We monitor our situation daily, and we'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates while serving our clients who have been particularly supportive in recent weeks.
As the COVID situation differs throughout the world, our return-to-office strategy remains country-driven. Currently, almost all of our associates are working from home and business travel remains on an exception-only basis.
Let's turn now to the first quarter. First quarter revenue was $4.4 billion, representing growth of 2.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Although we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations, revenue upside was limited by elevated attrition reflecting the intensely competitive market for digital talent that we spoke about in our last earnings call. This put some pressure on salaries as rows were filled by lateral hires or contingent workforce. And in some cases, commercial opportunities were forgone due to an inability to source talent.
To address retention challenges, we've been executing a multipart plan that includes stepping up our internal engagement efforts and increasing investments in our people through training and job rotations to provide opportunities for career growth; shifting to a quarterly promotion cycle for billable associates; and implementing further salary increases and promotions for high-demand skills and critical positions; and ramping our hiring capacity by adding hundreds of recruiters, and making 28,000-plus offers to new graduates in India, a new record.
Daily resignations increased through the first quarter, peaking in March. On a positive note, resignations slowed in April and continued to slow in May. However, given 2-months' notice periods in India, we anticipate further sequential increases in attrition in Q2 and before a gradual recovery in the second half.
Notwithstanding industry attrition challenges, we remain confident in Cognizant's standing as a magnet for skilled talent and a great place to build a career. In recent quarters, we've seen a meaningful increase in our brand perception in the talent market in India. For example, our compass acceptance rates amongst India's top engineering colleges has risen to more than 80% this year, up almost 10 percentage points since 2019. In addition, LinkedIn just ranked Cognizant a top company in both the U.S. and India based on traits like the ability to advance, skills growth and gender diversity, all of which are consistent with enabling professionals to grow their careers. In India, LinkedIn ranks us #2 among 25 leading companies. This honor follows Forbes magazine recently naming Cognizant to its list for World's Best Employers and Best Employers for Diversity.
Moving on, I'm pleased with the health of key leading performance indicators. For example, digital revenue growth accelerated to 15% year-over-year. Digital now represents 44% of our revenue mix. Bookings growth of 5%, which was strong, considering outstanding December bookings and a tough prior year compare. Year-to-date bookings growth has since been boosted by excellent bookings in April. I'm confident that our sustained book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1.1x revenue provides us with the opportunity to further accelerate revenue growth. 
Finally, our qualified pipeline and win rates are strong and give us reason to be bullish.
Turning now to our industry sectors. Financial services declines moderated. Leading performance indicators, including digital mix and qualified pipeline have both improved in both insurance and banking. Our turnaround efforts are ongoing, and we expect Financial Services to continue to recover over the course of the year.
I'm pleased with the growing momentum in our Healthcare business. We had a strong quarter with growth across our payer and life sciences businesses and improving trends within our provider business. Over the past 18 months, we've refreshed our product strategy and better aligned our investments with market priorities. We recalibrated our product road maps to focus our core platforms and cloud enablement, customer experiences, digital workflows and automation. This intensified pivot to digital has resonated well with both existing clients and prospects, enabling us to achieve double-digit growth in our software product business.
Products and Resources continues to be affected by the pandemic. Declines in retail and consumer goods and in travel and hospitality were offset by continued double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities.
Communications, Media and Technology posted solid growth when normalized for the exit of elements of content moderation. Jan will provide more details on the quarter in his prepared remarks.
Let's turn now to the macro environment. Our client conversations suggest a robust and resilient IT services demand picture for 2021 and beyond. This is fueled by business model innovation, customer experience investments, technology modernization, risk mitigation and efficiency initiatives, all driven by hyperscale road map and commercial investments.
Creating better experiences is at the center of the digital economy. That's what clients are most interested in, how to orchestrate technology, data and design to make their employee and customer experiences more productive, intuitive, relevant and valuable. A good example is the work we've been doing with Papa John's International, one of the largest pizza delivery chains in the United States. We helped Papa John's transform its order operations into a centralized model that enables hyper-personalized offers for customers. We did so through an end-to-end intelligent cloud-based omni-channel solution powered by advanced analytics in 750 of its stores initially before being expanded to 1,500 stores given early success. This solution resulted in a revenue uplift of more than 15% per order, significant productivity improvements and halving the time between order placement and delivery. It's also improved the experience of Papa John's employees by lowering their stress from multitasking while freeing up staff to focus on serving guests.
The shift from traditional to a software-centric business requires clients to transform their business processes and their IT architectures in parallel. This starts with engineering a new digital stack, enabled by software and consumer-grade apps that sit on intelligence, drawn from sophisticated data sets, all of which need to be instrumented and run on cloud platforms. Within this new stack, we see particularly strong opportunities to help clients in modernizing their applications, data and infrastructure. And as you can imagine, this is driving increasing demand for our digital engineering and cloud solutions portfolio.
Our overriding aim is to help clients become modern businesses. That way, they can innovate faster, become more agile and above all, stay relevant to their customers. In that vein, we're collaborating with Inchcape, a U.K.-based automotive, distribution and retail leader to digitally transform and simplify their global finance and accounting infrastructure and services. We're applying machine learning, data analytics, RPA and advanced business process services to drive efficiencies and enable Inchcape to make faster and smarter business decisions.
Moving now on to strategy. We remain focused on executing the strategy with 4 related priorities: building a stronger global brand, further globalizing Cognizant, accelerating digital and increasing our client relevance. I've covered these priorities in prior calls, so I'll just offer a few broad observations about our execution.
We strengthened our portfolio and sharpened its focus on faster-growing markets and geographic segments. All of our offerings are aligned to the market and name that providing the capabilities clients want most, like accelerating cloud migration, enabling omnichannel commerce, unlocking value from data using AI and ML, creating modern mobility experiences and more. As cloud computing has changed the way IT is delivered across infrastructure applications and platforms, we've continued to strengthen our relationships with the world's leading hyperscale and SaaS companies.
With our dedicated business groups from Microsoft, AWS and Google Cloud platform, we can help clients run their core applications and create more agile workflows in the cloud. We're also maintaining our M&A pace to further expand our capabilities in our key digital focus areas of software engineering, data and AI, cloud and IoT.
In Q1, we acquired Servian, an Australian enterprise transformation consultancy, specializing in data analytics, AI, digital services, experience design and cloud. We also acquired Linium, a cloud transformation consultancy group specializing in the ServiceNow platform and solutions. And Magenic Technologies, a custom software development services company that expands our global software product engineering network.
During the quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire ESG Mobility, a digital automotive engineering, R&D provider for connected autonomous and electric vehicles, issue mobility complements our existing connected mobility offerings and our automotive industry presence.
Before closing, I want to spend a moment on ESG, environmental, social and governance. The public health, economic and societal damage wrought by COVID-19 have caused most businesses to reflect deeply on what they owe their stakeholders. In keeping with our purpose, we tried to be a modern corporation that is responsive to the many larger contexts in which we operate, among them, societal, environmental, economic and technological. And that's why the principle of sustainability is so important to us. It speaks to our interdependence with local communities and global ecosystems.
During Q1, we announced a 5-year $250 million global philanthropic investments to advance economic mobility, educational opportunity, diversity and inclusion and health and well-being in communities as they emerge from the pandemic. We also recognize how much we must evolve to become a sustainable business. To do so, we will embed ESG into our thinking, decisions and actions. This is a multiyear endeavor, and one of increasing importance to our clients, associates and indeed you, our investors. To mark our progress along this journey, we're planning a series of announcements that will include the publication of Cognizant's 2020 ESG report later in the second quarter.
In closing, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We are bullish in the industry and our prospects within it. We're working diligently through a multiyear plan to reposition Cognizant to achieve its full growth potential and reestablish our company as an industry leader. As we do so, We are committed to make the necessary investments that will set us up for sustained momentum. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you."

Our Q1 revenue was $4.4 billion, representing growth of 4.2% year-over-year or 2.4% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year period, this includes approximately 300 basis points of growth from our acquisitions and a 90 basis points of negative impact from the exit of certain content services. 
Digital revenue in Q1 grew approximately 15% and represented 44% of total revenue versus 39% in the prior year period. We were pleased with this growth acceleration compared to Q4, particularly in light of a competitive hiring environment for digital talent.
Now moving on to segment results where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services declined 1.7%, reflecting more moderate declines in both banking and insurance, in line with our expectations. We are seeing early signs that the investments and repositioning of both businesses are resonating with our clients. This includes Financial Services bookings growth outpacing total company bookings growth in Q1 and a solid pipeline growth. We continue to expect a pace recovery for this segment over the next several quarters and anticipate that we will see positive momentum throughout the year.
Healthcare growth was 7% and accelerated from last quarter, driven by strong performance in both our health care payer and life sciences businesses. Following strong performance in last quarter, in Q1, our Healthcare business had its best year-over-year growth quarter since 2018, benefiting from increased demand for our integrated payer software solutions and improving fundamentals in our provider business. Life sciences revenue continued to benefit from strong demand for our digital services among both pharmaceutical and medical device companies.
Products and Resources increased 2.4%, driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. This growth was partially offset by mid-single-digit declines in retail consumer goods and double-digit declines in travel and hospitality. We have seen some early signs of stabilization within these sectors, most impacted by the pandemic, but it remains a fluid demand environment.
Communications, Media and Technology grew 3.1%, including a benefit from recent acquisitions, but was partially offset by a negative 600 basis point impact from our exit of certain portions of our content services business. Outside of this impact, we are very pleased with the growth of our core portfolio of the technology business and expect continued solid growth for the remainder of the year. Segment growth was also partially offset by the demand softness attributable to the pandemic. 
Now moving on to margins. In Q1, our GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 15.2% as there were no adjustments for unusual items to report. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved approximately 10 basis points, reflecting lower travel and entertainment expenses, savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and lower immigration costs. These benefits were mostly offset by investments impacting our SG&A, including the margin-dilutive impact from our recent acquisitions, investments to accelerate organic growth and corporate investments, including enhancements to our cybersecurity environment.
Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 24.1%. And our adjusted tax rate was 23.7%, aided by a discrete benefit of a tax settlement in the quarter. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.95 and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.97.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or $1.5 billion net of debt. Free cash flow in the first quarter, our seasonally softest quarter, was $93 million and included an approximately $50 million negative impact from unique items in the quarter, including the payment of a portion of our 2020 COVID tax deferrals. Q1 also includes the payment of our annual cash incentive which was higher this year compared to the 2020 payment. DSO of 70 days was flat sequentially compared to the 74 days in the prior year period.
As a reminder, in 2021, we expect free cash flow will be lower compared to 2020 as a result of several benefits from 2020 negatively impacting '21, including government offered deferrals of certain tax payments, which impacted Q1 and will also impact cash flow later this year, and the higher cash incentive payout this quarter versus Q1 2020 I just mentioned. Our outlook for 2021 is unchanged and assumes free cash flow conversion will be around 100% of net income as we focus on building upon the DSO improvements achieved last year.
During the quarter, we continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy, repurchasing 3.1 million shares for $234 million at a weighted average price of approximately $76 per share. At the end of March, we had approximately $2.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We also spent cash of approximately $300 million on acquisitions and $128 million for a regular quarterly dividend.
Turning to guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $4.42 billion to $4.46 billion, representing 10.5% to 11.5% growth or 8% to 9% in constant currency based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable approximately 250 basis points impact and inorganic contribution of approximately 400 basis points. This outlook assumes some stabilization in financial services and continued pressures across retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality and communication and media. Keep in mind that Q2 2020 included a combined impact of COVID and the ransomware attack, which is leading to easier year-over-year compares for all segments in Q2 2021 and growth levels above our full year outlook.
For the full year, we now expect revenue of $17.8 billion to $18.1 billion, representing 7% to 9% growth or 5.5% to 7.5% in constant currency versus our prior guidance of 5.5% to 8.5% growth or 4% to 7% in constant currency, reflecting the improving macro environment and strong demand for our offerings. Our outlook assumes an unchanged expectation that currency will have a favorable approximately 150 basis points impact and includes approximately 300 basis points of contribution from inorganic revenue.
Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin in the range of 15.2% to 15.7% versus 15.2% to 16.3% previously, primarily reflecting increased investment in our people and recruiting for digital skills. This includes rapidly accelerating our recruiting capacity, implementing quarterly role-based promotions and leveraging our contractor ecosystem. We're also using it as an opportunity to enhance our employee value proposition and keep Cognizant as a top destination for talent globally.
This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which is unchanged at $3.90 to $4.02. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $20 million to $30 million, which is unchanged from our prior guidance and reflects the $2.1 billion cash repatriation in Q4 2020. Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 530 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%, both unchanged from our prior outlook. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies.
With that, we will open the call for questions."

So let me just touch upon this. First of all, I think it's really important for us to acknowledge it is a humanitarian crisis, and we've been prioritizing the health and safety of our associates and of course, their dependents, and hoping that they stay safe as they work essentially from home at this moment in time. And as I said in my script, we're doing a series of things to help in terms of medical expense support, free vaccinations, covering expenses in hospitals, working with UNICEF, et cetera.
To the question around in terms of how I think about the impact on the business, I think about the humanitarian side as being relevant, but candidly, the business side of the hot market is, in some regard, more meaningful in the sense that most of our attrition and the resignations we talked about, were happening in prior months, which are leading indicators of Q2 attrition and the end of Q1 attrition. And all of that was happening in a period when the COVID situation in India was substantially less severe than it is at this moment in time. So we are working through, obviously, our business operations, working with our teams who are working remotely. It's a challenging environment, of course, and it's a stressful and emotional time for our associates and their families.
The impact, Bryan, on attrition rates and absenteeism and client delivery remains somewhat uncertain. We look at it on a daily basis. We have our crisis management teams involved. We've created a COVID delivery risk management process, which allows us to initiate remediation actions. We're required to review the status of our delivery portfolio, project by project where possible to shift work between offshore or nearshore and on-site teams.
But I will say clients have been incredibly supportive as we go through this. I've received a series of e-mails from clients who are wishing us the best of luck and certainly not putting a lot of pressure in the system at this moment in time. The financial impact of our actions is assumed in our guidance, and that is assumed off of what we know today, which is today's rates of absenteeism and today's resignations that we've seen. It is unclear whether attrition will actually slow because of this or whether attrition will go up or stay stable, but it will potentially go up because of absenteeism. But to date, our guidance includes what we know today to date, we feel as though our guidance is appropriate."

In that context, I'd like to ask if you can grade Cognizant's underlying progress, the progress that you've made over the last couple of years. And if there's a way to decipher between internal progress, market progress, financial progress, I'm assuming those dimensions may be progressing at different stages.

It's a comprehensive question in nature. But yes, I would echo the word an eventful first 2 years given the transformation agenda, the leadership changes required as part of that a global pandemic, a ransomware attack, of course, and now a war on talent that is happening in the midst of the humanitarian crisis in India. I would say, first of all, it's a team sport. This is about 300,000 associates pulling in one direction. I'm truly pleased with the executives I've got around me these days. We're all eager to show what we can do, and hopefully I believe, can become an iconic leadership team together in the years ahead. And I've also been supported by a terrific Board who've been 100% behind vision and our strategy of the company.
As I'm answering your question, I will start by saying, I inherited a great company and a company of great pedigree and a company with a growth DNA and the company with proud employees. But it is clear that the company had not been hitting its stride in recent years. So I asked our organization to pull together to help me operationalize a broad transformation agenda, which included strategy, structure, commercial transformation, delivery, optimization, cultural elements. I also asked the company to help me with a restructuring program that we weren't used to, but it would allow us to free up capacity to make investments in growth in our systems and in our people. And this is a growth company, and we needed to restart the engine. And of course, as part of that, you have to go through the corporate strategy. Who are we? Who do we want to be? That leads to portfolio adjustments, both exits such as content moderation as well as meaningful M&A aligned to the corporate strategy. And of course, within that vein, we've also doubled down on partnerships, including hyperscalers.
And all of this was just a means to an end to set out to build a pipeline, to accelerate bookings and ultimately, to get the company back to industry-leading growth because I think growth will ultimately make the P&L work again. So we're certainly in the middle of a lot of this. I will say I'm more confident now than ever that we can do this, and I believe we're on track and we've made great progress.
Internally, now to go to your framework. Look, we've got a clear purpose, vision, a set of values. We've got a clear strategy. We've got a more competitive portfolio that is aligned to our strategy. We've got a better talent philosophy, including DNI, which is critical in a knowledge-based business. We progressed on important things like sustainability, cybersecurity. I think we're getting our belief back and test them to that is the notion of employee engagement hit multiyear highs in 2020. Although we are fully aware that we've got more work to do on our employee value proposition and indeed, of course, on attrition.
Commercially -- and when I'm answering your question on markets, I'm not talking about Wall Street. I'm going to talk about commercial markets as in our clients. We've overhauled our commercial team. We've increased the sophistication of the team. I think we went back to our tuna box model, where we got tight alignment between commercial and delivery. We've refined our customer segmentation strategy, so we know who are the clients that we need to partner with deeply. We've implemented a more refined variable compensation program. We've refreshed our talent to ensure we can represent the entire portfolio and address client pain points beyond the CTO or CIO. And I'm excited as to how we're now being seen by clients, Rod, to be honest. We're no longer necessarily just being viewed in the build or operate space. We've got growing reputation and recognition in digital and cloud following our M&A strategy. And that is now showing up in sustained book-to-bill ratios in excess of 1.1, which I feel is critical to drive the revenue growth rate that I'm aspiring to drive, and our qualified pipeline and win rates are as healthy as they have ever been.
Now all of that leads ultimately to financial outcomes. And I don't think the true benefits of this are yet visible. We have seen the margin dilution of the investments, commercial hiring, IT security modernization, M&A, dilution, some brand investments we're making. Of course, we continue to review the trade-offs between revenue growth and margin expansion. But I will say we expect to see revenue benefits on the back of the bookings momentum. And margin should improve each year for the foreseeable future, albeit with a balanced approach to trade-offs between revenue growth and further investments to drive a sustained outperformance versus the competition. So in short, a lot of work, and I look forward to great years ahead."

So it's an industry problem. I think you've seen",647,"Look, it's a 2-edged sword. We've seen a V-shaped recovery as an industry, and Cognizant certainly has after a weak March, April last year, we snapped back immediately. And that leads with a skill shortage. So it's an industry problem. I think you've seen that in the earnings cycle to date. Of course, I caution people to compare attrition rates between various competitors. We include BPO, and our calculation is current quarter annualized, which is the worst of all world at this moment in time versus some peers exclude BPO and look at attrition on a rolling or in the last 12 months, which includes some lower levels of attrition because of COVID.
But Rod, I think about our attrition, which went up 200 basis points sequentially against 2 parameters. One is macro considerations. The market is extremely competitive at this moment in time. There are supply/demand imbalances across cloud, across digital engineering, across data. I sense that the work-from-home environment has giving people, let's say, less sense of community. And I also see, obviously, the build-out of captives, which tend to pressurize salaries. And then on top of that macro backdrop, I think we have some cognizant considerations as we continue to transform the company. We're driving towards a culture of meritocracy and a performance culture. We're evolving more towards a global or sometimes local workforce, which is in line with client expectations but also in line with regulatory policy around the world. And in some regards, we're late to some of those elements. And so we're dealing with some of the pain that others have dealt with previously.
I will say I'm 100% confident we're actively managing attrition as best we can. I'm pleased to say that attrition peaked in March, slowed in April and continues to slow in May, albeit early days in May. We've got a lot of work streams around employee engagements, training, job rotations. We've taken the decision to invest more in targeted salary increases and promotions and shifting to quarterly promotion cycles for billable associates. And we've added hundreds of recruiters in the last 4 months. And we're making a record number of 28,000 offers to new graduates in India, which is up from 17,000 hired in 2020. And I think in 2018, we may have actually not even hired any gen Z graduates into Cognizant. So we're doing the right thing to address attrition. And of course, in the meantime, we're working to manage the salary inflationary elements of this. As Jan pointed out, P&A expectations in the second half of the year are lower than previously anticipated. So that will temper some of the downsides. But in the same vein, these are investments that I think will help stem attrition, which will give us more productive hours in our employees. And in the same vein, of course, we've got other levers at our disposal to manage salary inflation, be that on offshore or nearshore mix, pyramid optimization, delivery industrialization, including automation, methodologies, templates and the like.
Procurement leverage for subcontractors. We've got a new Chief Procurement Officer coming on board soon. And of course, everything else we're doing as we evolve the company against the line of work that we actually sell and deliver as we shift from staff augmentation towards managed services and project-based delivery transformation that brings different considerations as well.
So we know what we need to do, and we're on it. And as I said, I think we'll see sequential increases in attrition based on the resignations in the last few months because there is a 2-month notice period in India. So we have a strong understanding as to what attrition will be in Q2. But that's been factored into our model and into our guidance. And in the meantime, we've been hiring at record pace given the extra recruiters we've put to work."

But we have turned to, obviously, external sources, both lateral hires and subcontractors and contingent labor as we've been working through the attrition situation internally, nor do we break out digital versus nondigital head count.
I mean, to be very clear, you can have somebody working in a test -- with testing capabilities, they can work on what could be viewed as legacy projects but in the same vein as part of an agile squad, they could be working on something around something as familiar as a frequent flyer website, which some of the work we do around experience and software product engineering. There, it's not viewed as legacy, it's certainly viewed as digital. So it's very hard to classify workforce between legacy and digital.
With regards to the opportunity costs, look, we're not quantifying that, but certainly, it's material that I've talked about. And when I review countries, there's hundreds of basis points of growth in some cases that we could have had. In other cases, less. But it's been a pain point for us throughout the quarter. We talked about attrition being a worry in our last quarter because we could see resignation rates, and we can see what's happening in the industry as people are doing their best to putting counter offers to stop resignation. And I'm glad we anticipated it, and we set appropriate guidance, and we're doing the same this time around."

So it is a holy grail. Of course, you've also got to think about the pyramid. I talked earlier about adding 28,000 offers for freshers into the bottom of the pyramid this year. The bill rates of those will be very different than bill rates of onshore delivery. So it's very difficult, in a succinct way, to decouple revenue growth from head count growth because there are so many factors at play. But rest assured that the industrialization of delivery, including automation, is top of mind for us."

So M&A, first of all, let's go back to the capital framework we've set forth in recent quarters. We plan to deploy approximately 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. I will say these are guiding principles",789,"Okay. So M&A, first of all, let's go back to the capital framework we've set forth in recent quarters. We plan to deploy approximately 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. I will say these are guiding principles, and we will continue to be opportunistic. Approximately 50% towards M&A, an area that's wholly aligned to our strategic priorities. And of course, about the remaining 50% towards dividends and share repurchases, targeting a consistent dividend payout ratio in the range of -- at about -- sorry, 25% on that and the rest for repurchases.
So M&A will continue to be a priority for us. And as I said earlier, we announced 3 acquisitions in the first quarter, and indeed signed an agreement to acquire ESG Mobility. It's not that M&A is something we wake up every morning until we have to do. It's just, it's an enabler for us to achieve our strategy.
Now our strategy is built around accelerating digital, which are higher growth categories, and our strategy is also built around globalizing the company, both from a global delivery network but also getting after exponential growth overseas. And digital as well as our overseas opportunity, I think, puts us in a position to have ambitions well in excess of the 3% to 4% organic growth rate, Keith, that you mentioned. However, I will refrain from getting into long-term financial statements here. But I would be very, very disappointed in the years ahead if we do not significantly exceed those growth rates.
And I would say we have been doing what was needed in the last year to start replenishing our backlog to consistently drive a book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.1. That puts us in a position that organically, coupled with the accretive nature of the acquisitions we've done, we should have continued upward pressure on revenue on a go-forward basis. And that being said, I will caution everybody we're in somewhat of an unpredictable world at this moment in time with the humanitarian crisis in India.
So that's how I think about our organic possibilities as well as the fact that we have an M&A lever that is exposing us to higher growth categories. And all of this, of course, is against the context where, from my perspective, we are substantially more operationally inclined and more sophisticated in terms of how we think about delivery and commercial levers going forward.
On Financial Services, look, it is critical. We turned around Financial Services. I'm proud with the progress we made in Healthcare, which is catching up on Financial Services as almost being our single biggest industry sector. Well Financial Services is 1/3 of our revenue. And in dollar terms, it modestly grew, but in constant currency terms, it declined 1.7%. And Keith, within that, we ultimately have 2 groups. We have a Banking and Financial Services business that is more than half of the business, and we have insurance which is kind of less than the half.
And it's the tale of 2 cities. In insurance, North America was weaker than the international business. But North American insurance is the vast majority of the insurance business, so that weakness hurt us in Banking and Financial Services. Actually, North America was modestly up, but our international business was down.
Within Banking and Financial Services, there are relatively consistent trends with what we talked about previously. Capital markets declined. Retail banking grew modestly, but it was offset by declines in commercial banks and cards and payments. And if I think about things differently, The global banks, as we call them, have continued to in-source and that business continues to decline for us, offset somewhat by good momentum we have with some of the regional banks.
Now all of this comes back to what are we doing about it. I would say we have a plan of attack. We have had healthy bookings throughout Financial Services, both banking and insurance in 2020. We've added extra commercial coverage. We've actually changed out and refreshed a significant amount of our commercial teams. We've been embracing digital, and we've had strong digital bookings in those areas in 2020. And we've been working more with our partners who are very interested in our strength in Healthcare and indeed Financial Services.
So as Jan pointed out, it is a business that is under repair, and we expect to see gradual recovery in 2021. We should see stronger growth in Q2, obviously, for easy compare reasons as well as COVID and the ransomware attack. But I'd like to think in the course of the year, we can get this thing shaped up to be in better shape than it is today."

And that's based on client conversations, and I speak with clients every day, as well as, obviously, we keep an eye on what industry analysts are saying.
I think talent shortages and attrition are a greater concern for the entire industry. But clients are making investments. They are decisive. And indecision is the enemy of people like myself. So clients being decisive is good. They are talking about more strategic partners. We are in the mix more than ever in that vendor consolidation, so I'm quite excited about that. And fundamentally, the things we see driving the pipeline, a lot around business model innovation, customer experience, technology modernization, risk mitigation and efficiency initiatives. And kind of be one of the reasons I was so adamant in doubling down with the hyperscalers 2 years ago is because these companies -- I don't think you should underestimate the sheer power and scale of hyperscale companies. They are investing massively by commercial teams, commercial terms, aligning with companies like Cognizant or Rand Industries, massively accelerating cloud migrations. And if you believe in platform economics, which opens up the possibilities of microservices and APIs, I think this is going to be the future. So we set up 2 business groups or business groups in the hyperscalers in the last few years, and I think we're reaping the benefits of that now."

I think we're executing against the plan and trying to spend in the framework of the capital that we strategically want to allocate towards M&A and we're executing that. The team has done really a fantastic job in aligning our deal sourcing across industries and across the globe.
So you see this, for example, we talked in the last quarter about a slight shift towards more geographic expansion, and we have 2 deals this, an Australian deal and, of course, very close to my heart, a German deal also part of the transactions that we could announce and some of them closed. So we're executing really In a classic manner. The team is very focused partnering with our markets and with our service lines on identifying the strategic areas of growth that we want to do and it's been very diligent and creative of identifying acquisition opportunities. It has really worked really well. And I think the natural spacing of these things will lead us to kind of execute against our allocated capital against it. Now it's what we have been lumpy in and out, but a consistent way to do so.
The focus in the company is clearly on integration because the synergies that these companies deliver are at the heart of the viability of our M&A strategy. And we are pleased with the ability to generate synergies. Our business plans are generally pretty close to the reality on the revenue synergies. And as we now have a larger portfolio of companies that we have acquired, we have increased our focus quite naturally on integration and efficiencies so that these companies can fit into the fabric of Cognizant and benefit from the scale that we can bring to the table.
You see we have still dilution some acquisitions, putting pressure on our margin. And so you'll see us continuing working on driving integration and reaping also some of the cost efficiencies that might be available to us in the future."

He did a tremendous job really decomposing down prior bookings and tracing them to follow the breadcrumbs into revenue. And so at this moment in time, we have much better visibility into that than we had based on last year.
I really feel good about our bookings momentum, to your point, really since the last -- if you think about it, throughout 2020, we had an exceptionally strong Q1. And then through the course of the year, we had strength with mid-teens for the course of the year. But really in 2019, it starts, you don't get bookings until you start building a pipeline. So we really put a lot of effort in the second half of 2020 into pipeline build. That started showing up in terms of bookings momentum in 2020 and then, of course, into 2021. We don't have the same easy compares now as we had last year, which is why I wanted to really contextualize Q1 bookings growth of 5%. I actually am delighted with that because our December was really outstanding. It was an excellent month for us. And April has been an excellent month, so the Q1 period has been sandwiched between that. And it's really important to me that people think about bookings on a rolling 4-quarter basis because something stepping from a Friday to a Monday or vice versa could take a deal from Q1 to Q2 or Q1 to Q4. So it's important to contextualize that.
So book-to-bill is the right way to also think about it. I think once you're north of 1.1x, it creates a backlog of opportunity to go execute against and hopefully accelerate revenue on from here. So we're confident of our -- in our numbers. And we're also confident we'll have a very strong Q2 bookings number on the back, not just of excellent April results, but also let's face it, the compare wasn't exactly stellar in May this time last year for many other reasons."

So I appreciate it because there's a lot of momentum, a movement in our margins that I think is important to put our eyes on. When you compare our margins overall operating margin, we're kind of roughly flat, slightly improved year-over-year. And on the gross margin side, you see the benefits of our Fit for Growth, and you can see also the benefits of the lower T&E that helped us to expand the growth margins. Utilization helped a little bit. And also, we had obviously a little bit help in the rupee. That all helped on the margin side.
But then we had on the SG&A side, you see an accelerated growth, but we are really laser-focused on directing that SG&A growth to our strategic initiatives that we think will yield -- we view them as investments, will yield accelerating revenue growth rates. And you pointed out the 2 biggest items. M&A is -- and its dilutive element in its initial years as well as our investments into sales and account management and growth in essence. Those are 2 offsetting factors that we have seen in the past quarters but also this quarter.
When we now outlook, you're pointing out we are basically down ticking our margin guidance a tiny bit. I think that is reflective of a balance that we're trying to strike here reflecting what we anticipate could be some increase in our compensation costs due to the measures in order to lower attrition, attract and retain our talent. And we're planning to offset that partially with some change in assumptions. I think the prices in India illustrates that maybe T&E is not coming back as fast as we have anticipated. And we're also carefully and surgically monitoring our future SG&A growth to tie it all so that we keep the overall margin equation together for the full year. But the second quarter will be kind of in line or similar to our first quarter margin expectation, in particular since we're anticipating the SG&A moderation to accelerate basically in the third and fourth quarter, but some of the compensation measures will be probably visible already in the second quarter."

Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to start today's call by addressing the humanitarian crisis in India. As many of you know, India is the heart of Cognizant, and home to more than 200,000 of our associates. I would like to express",1851,"Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to start today's call by addressing the humanitarian crisis in India. As many of you know, India is the heart of Cognizant, and home to more than 200,000 of our associates. I would like to express my support and solidarity for our Indian associates, wherever they are in the world, and my sympathy for any who have suffered a loss during the pandemic.
In addition to the ongoing support of our associates, which includes home care and hospitalization assistance, vaccination cost reimbursement for our associates and their families, and making vaccine availability easier for those with disabilities, Cognizant is making a multimillion dollar investment to assist India through the crisis. This is focused on covering operational expenses at hospitals throughout India that are caring for COVID-19 patients; funding the efforts of UNICEF in India to deploy oxygen-generation plants, COVID diagnostic testing and medical supplies; and partnering with one of India's leading hospital chains to set up vaccination centers in locations across the country, including some of Cognizant's owned facilities.
The impact of the pandemic on industry attrition rates, absenteeism and client delivery remains somewhat uncertain. We monitor our situation daily, and we'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates, while serving our clients who have been particularly supportive in recent weeks.
As the COVID situation differs throughout the world, our return-to-office strategy remains country-driven. Currently, almost all of our associates are working from home and business travel remains on an exception-only basis.
Let's turn now to the first quarter. First quarter revenue was $4.4 billion, representing growth of 2.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Although we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations, revenue upside was limited by elevated attrition, reflecting the intensely competitive market for digital talent that we spoke about in our last earnings call. This put some pressure on salaries as rows were filled by lateral hires or contingent workforce. And in some cases, commercial opportunities were forgone due to an inability to source talent.
To address retention challenges, we've been executing a multipart plan that includes stepping up our internal engagement efforts and increasing investments in our people through training and job rotations to provide opportunities for career growth; shifting to a quarterly promotion cycle for billable associates; and implementing further salary increases and promotions for high-demand skills and critical positions; and ramping our hiring capacity by adding hundreds of recruiters, and making 28,000-plus offers to new graduates in India, a new record.
Daily resignations increased through the first quarter, peaking in March. On a positive note, resignations slowed in April and continued to slow in May. However, given 2-months' notice periods in India, we anticipate further sequential increases in attrition in Q2 and before a gradual recovery in the second half.
Notwithstanding industry attrition challenges, we remain confident in Cognizant's standing as a magnet for skilled talent and a great place to build a career. In recent quarters, we've seen a meaningful increase in our brand perception in the talent market in India. For example, our compass acceptance rates amongst India's top engineering colleges has risen to more than 80% this year, up almost 10 percentage points since 2019. In addition, LinkedIn just ranked Cognizant a top company in both the U.S. and India based on traits like the ability to advance, skills growth and gender diversity, all of which are consistent with enabling professionals to grow their careers. In India, LinkedIn ranks us #2 among 25 leading companies. This honor follows Forbes Magazine recently naming Cognizant to its list for World's Best Employers and Best Employers for Diversity.
Moving on, I'm pleased with the health of key leading performance indicators. For example, digital revenue growth accelerated to 15% year-over-year. Digital now represents 44% of our revenue mix. Bookings growth of 5%, which was strong considering outstanding December bookings and a tough prior year compare. Year-to-date bookings growth has since been boosted by excellent bookings in April. I'm confident that our sustained book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1.1x revenue provides us with the opportunity to further accelerate revenue growth. 
Finally, our qualified pipeline and win rates are strong and give us reason to be bullish.
Turning now to our industry sectors. Financial services declines moderated. Leading performance indicators, including digital mix and qualified pipeline have both improved in both insurance and banking. Our turnaround efforts are ongoing, and we expect Financial Services to continue to recover over the course of the year.
I'm pleased with the growing momentum in our Healthcare business. We had a strong quarter with growth across our payer and life sciences businesses and improving trends within our provider business. Over the past 18 months, we've refreshed our product strategy and better aligned our investments with market priorities. We recalibrated our product road maps to focus our core platforms and cloud enablement, customer experiences, digital workflows and automation. This intensified pivot to digital has resonated well with both existing clients and prospects, enabling us to achieve double-digit growth in our software product business.
Products and Resources continues to be affected by the pandemic. Declines in retail and consumer goods and in travel and hospitality were offset by continued double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities.
Communications, Media and Technology posted solid growth when normalized for the exit of elements of content moderation. Jan will provide more details on the quarter in his prepared remarks.
Let's turn now to the macro environment. Our client conversations suggest a robust and resilient IT services demand picture for 2021 and beyond. This is fueled by business model innovation, customer experience investments, technology modernization, risk mitigation and efficiency initiatives, all driven by hyperscale road map and commercial investments.
Creating better experiences is at the center of the digital economy. That's what clients are most interested in, how to orchestrate technology, data and design to make their employee and customer experiences more productive, intuitive, relevant and valuable. A good example is the work we've been doing with Papa John's International, one of the largest pizza delivery chains in the United States. We helped Papa John's transform its order operations into a centralized model that enables hyper-personalized offers for customers. We did so through an end-to-end intelligent cloud-based omni-channel solution powered by advanced analytics in 750 of its stores initially before being expanded to 1,500 stores given early success. 
This solution resulted in a revenue uplift of more than 15% per order, significant productivity improvements and halving the time between order placement and delivery. It's also improved the experience of Papa John's employees by lowering their stress from multitasking while freeing up staff to focus on serving guests.
The shift from traditional to a software-centric business requires clients to transform their business processes and their IT architectures in parallel. This starts with engineering a new digital stack, enabled by software and consumer-grade apps that sit on intelligence, drawn from sophisticated data sets, all of which need to be instrumented and run on cloud platforms. Within this new stack, we see particularly strong opportunities to help clients in modernizing their applications, data and infrastructure. And as you can imagine, this is driving increasing demand for our digital engineering and cloud solutions portfolio.
Our overriding aim is to help clients become modern businesses. That way, they can innovate faster, become more agile and above all, stay relevant to their customers. In that vein, we're collaborating with Inchcape, a U.K.-based automotive, distribution and retail leader to digitally transform and simplify their global finance and accounting infrastructure and services. We're applying machine learning, data analytics, RPA and advanced business process services to drive efficiencies and enable Inchcape to make faster and smarter business decisions.
Moving now on to strategy. We remain focused on executing the strategy with 4 related priorities: building a stronger global brand, further globalizing Cognizant, accelerating digital and increasing our client relevance. I've covered these priorities in prior calls, so I'll just offer a few broad observations about our execution.
We strengthened our portfolio and sharpened its focus on faster-growing markets and geographic segments. All of our offerings are aligned to the market and name that providing the capabilities clients want most, like accelerating cloud migration, enabling omnichannel commerce, unlocking value from data using AI and ML, creating modern mobility experiences and more. As cloud computing has changed the way IT is delivered across infrastructure applications and platforms, we've continued to strengthen our relationships with the world's leading hyperscale and SaaS companies.
With our dedicated business groups from Microsoft, AWS and Google Cloud platform, we can help clients run their core applications and create more agile workflows in the cloud. We're also maintaining our M&A pace to further expand our capabilities in our key digital focus areas of software engineering, data and AI, cloud and IoT.
In Q1, we acquired Servian, an Australian enterprise transformation consultancy, specializing in data analytics, AI, digital services, experience design and cloud. We also acquired Linium, a cloud transformation consultancy group specializing in the ServiceNow platform and solutions; and Magenic Technologies, a custom software development services company that expands our global software product engineering network.
During the quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire ESG Mobility, a digital automotive engineering, R&D provider for connected autonomous and electric vehicles. ESG mobility complements our existing connected mobility offerings and our automotive industry presence.
Before closing, I want to spend a moment on ESG, environmental, social and governance. The public health, economic and societal damage wrought by COVID-19 have caused most businesses to reflect deeply on what they owe their stakeholders. In keeping with our purpose, we tried to be a modern corporation that is responsive to the many larger contexts in which we operate, among them, societal, environmental, economic and technological. And that's why the principle of sustainability is so important to us. It speaks to our interdependence with local communities and global ecosystems.
During Q1, we announced a 5-year $250 million global philanthropic investment to advance economic mobility, educational opportunity, diversity and inclusion and health and well-being in communities as they emerge from the pandemic. We also recognize how much we must evolve to become a sustainable business. To do so, we will embed ESG into our thinking, decisions and actions. This is a multiyear endeavor, and one of increasing importance to our clients, associates and indeed you, our investors. To mark our progress along this journey, we're planning a series of announcements that will include the publication of Cognizant's 2020 ESG report later in the second quarter.
In closing, we continue to successfully execute our strategy. We are bullish in the industry and our prospects within it. We're working diligently through a multiyear plan to reposition Cognizant to achieve its full growth potential and reestablish our company as an industry leader. As we do so, we are committed to make the necessary investments that will set us up for sustained momentum. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you."

Our Q1 revenue was $4.4 billion, representing growth of 4.2% year-over-year or 2.4% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year period, this includes approximately 300 basis points of growth from our acquisitions and a 90 basis points of negative impact from the exit of certain content services. 
Digital revenue in Q1 grew approximately 15% and represented 44% of total revenue versus 39% in the prior year period. We were pleased with this growth acceleration compared to Q4, particularly in light of a competitive hiring environment for digital talent.
Now moving on to segment results where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services declined 1.7%, reflecting more moderate declines in both banking and insurance, in line with our expectations. We are seeing early signs that the investments and repositioning of both businesses are resonating with our clients. This includes Financial Services bookings growth outpacing total company bookings growth in Q1 and a solid pipeline growth. We continue to expect a pace recovery for this segment over the next several quarters and anticipate that we will see positive momentum throughout the year.
Healthcare growth was 7% and accelerated from last quarter, driven by strong performance in both our health care payer and life sciences businesses. Following strong performance in last quarter, in Q1, our Healthcare business had its best year-over-year growth quarter since 2018, benefiting from increased demand for our integrated payer software solutions and improving fundamentals in our provider business. Life sciences revenue continued to benefit from strong demand for our digital services among both pharmaceutical and medical device companies.
Products and Resources increased 2.4%, driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. This growth was partially offset by mid-single-digit declines in retail consumer goods and double-digit declines in travel and hospitality. We have seen some early signs of stabilization within these sectors most impacted by the pandemic, but it remains a fluid demand environment.
Communications, Media and Technology grew 3.1%, including a benefit from recent acquisitions, but was partially offset by a negative 600 basis point impact from our exit of certain portions of our content services business. Outside of this impact, we are very pleased with the growth of our core portfolio of the technology business and expect continued solid growth for the remainder of the year. Segment growth was also partially offset by the demand softness attributable to the pandemic. 
Now moving on to margins. In Q1, our GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 15.2% as there were no adjustments for unusual items to report. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved approximately 10 basis points, reflecting lower travel and entertainment expenses, savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and lower immigration costs. These benefits were mostly offset by investments impacting our SG&A, including the margin-dilutive impact from our recent acquisitions, investments to accelerate organic growth and corporate investments, including enhancements to our cybersecurity environment.
Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 24.1%. And our adjusted tax rate was 23.7%, aided by a discrete benefit of a tax settlement in the quarter. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.95 and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.97.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or $1.5 billion net of debt. Free cash flow in the first quarter, our seasonally softest quarter, was $93 million and included an approximately $50 million negative impact from unique items in the quarter, including the payment of a portion of our 2020 COVID tax deferrals. Q1 also includes the payment of our annual cash incentive which was higher this year compared to the 2020 payment. DSO of 70 days was flat sequentially compared to the 74 days in the prior year period.
As a reminder, in 2021, we expect free cash flow will be lower compared to 2020 as a result of several benefits from 2020 negatively impacting '21, including government offered deferrals of certain tax payments, which impacted Q1 and will also impact cash flow later this year and the higher cash incentive payout this quarter versus Q1 2020 I just mentioned. Our outlook for 2021 is unchanged and assumes free cash flow conversion will be around 100% of net income as we focus on building upon the DSO improvements achieved last year.
During the quarter, we continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy, repurchasing 3.1 million shares for $234 million at a weighted average price of approximately $76 per share. At the end of March, we had approximately $2.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We also spent cash of approximately $300 million on acquisitions and $128 million for a regular quarterly dividend.
Turning to guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $4.42 billion to $4.46 billion, representing 10.5% to 11.5% growth or 8% to 9% in constant currency based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable approximately 250 basis points impact and inorganic contribution of approximately 400 basis points. This outlook assumes some stabilization in financial services and continued pressures across retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality and communication and media. Keep in mind that Q2 2020 included a combined impact of COVID and the ransomware attack, which is leading to easier year-over-year compares for all segments in Q2 2021 and growth levels above our full year outlook.
For the full year, we now expect revenue of $17.8 billion to $18.1 billion, representing 7% to 9% growth or 5.5% to 7.5% in constant currency versus our prior guidance of 5.5% to 8.5% growth or 4% to 7% in constant currency, reflecting the improving macro environment and strong demand for our offerings. Our outlook assumes an unchanged expectation that currency will have a favorable approximately 150 basis points impact and includes approximately 300 basis points of contribution from inorganic revenue.
Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin in the range of 15.2% to 15.7% versus 15.2% to 16.3% previously, primarily reflecting increased investment in our people and recruiting for digital skills. This includes rapidly accelerating our recruiting capacity, implementing quarterly role-based promotions and leveraging our contractor ecosystem. We're also using it as an opportunity to enhance our employee value proposition and keep Cognizant as a top destination for talent globally.
This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which is unchanged at $3.90 to $4.02. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $20 million to $30 million, which is unchanged from our prior guidance and reflects the $2.1 billion cash repatriation in Q4 2020. Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 530 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%, both unchanged from our prior outlook. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies.
With that, we will open the call for questions."

So let me just touch upon this. First of all, I think it's really important for us to acknowledge it is a humanitarian crisis, and we've been prioritizing the health and safety of our associates and, of course, their dependents and hoping that they stay safe as they work essentially from home at this moment in time. And as I said in my script, we're doing a series of things to help in terms of medical expense support, free vaccinations, covering expenses in hospitals, working with UNICEF, et cetera.
To the question around in terms of how I think about the impact on the business, I think about the humanitarian side as being relevant, but candidly, the business side of the hot market is, in some regard, more meaningful in the sense that most of our attrition and the resignations we talked about, were happening in prior months, which are leading indicators of Q2 attrition and the end of Q1 attrition. And all of that was happening in a period when the COVID situation in India was substantially less severe than it is at this moment in time. So we are working through, obviously, our business operations, working with our teams who are working remotely. It's a challenging environment, of course, and it's a stressful and emotional time for our associates and their families.
The impact, Bryan, on attrition rates and absenteeism and client delivery remains somewhat uncertain. We look at it on a daily basis. We have our crisis management teams involved. We've created a COVID delivery risk management process, which allows us to initiate remediation actions. We're required to review the status of our delivery portfolio, project by project, where possible, to shift work between offshore or nearshore and on-site teams.
But I will say clients have been incredibly supportive as we go through this. I've received a series of e-mails from clients who are wishing us the best of luck and certainly not putting a lot of pressure in the system at this moment in time. The financial impact of our actions is assumed in our guidance. And that is assumed off of what we know today, which is today's rates of absenteeism and today's resignations that we've seen. It is unclear whether attrition will actually slow because of this or whether attrition will go up or stay stable, but it will potentially go up because of absenteeism. But to date, our guidance includes what we know to date. To date, we feel as though our guidance is appropriate."

And I've also been supported by a terrific Board, who've been 100% behind our vision and our strategy of the company.
As I'm answering your question, I will start by saying I inherited a great company and a company of great pedigree and a company with a growth DNA and the company with proud employees. But it is clear that the company had not been hitting its stride in recent years. So I asked our organization to pull together to help me operationalize a broad transformation agenda, which included strategy, structure, commercial transformation, delivery, optimization, cultural elements. I also asked the company to help me with a restructuring program that we weren't used to, but it would allow us to free up capacity to make investments in growth in our systems and in our people. 
And this is a growth company, and we needed to restart the engine. And of course, as part of that, you have to go through the corporate strategy. Who are we? Who do we want to be? That leads to portfolio adjustments, both exits such as content moderation as well as meaningful M&A aligned to the corporate strategy. And of course, within that vein, we've also doubled down on partnerships, including hyperscalers.
And all of this was just a means to an end to set out to build a pipeline, to accelerate bookings and, ultimately, to get the company back to industry-leading growth because I think growth will ultimately make the P&L work again. So we're certainly in the middle of a lot of this. I will say I'm more confident now than ever that we can do this, and I believe we're on track and we've made great progress.
Internally, now to go to your framework, look, we've got a clear purpose, vision, a set of values. We've got a clear strategy. We've got a more competitive portfolio that is aligned to our strategy. We've got a better talent philosophy, including D&I, which is critical in a knowledge-based business. We progressed on important things like sustainability, cybersecurity. I think we're getting our belief back and test them to that as the notion of employee engagement hit multiyear highs in 2020. Although we are fully aware that we've got more work to do on our employee value proposition and indeed, of course, on attrition.
Commercially -- and when I'm answering your question on markets, I'm not talking about Wall Street. I'm going to talk about commercial markets as in our clients. We've overhauled our commercial team. We've increased the sophistication of the team. I think we went back to our tuna box model, where we got tight alignment between commercial and delivery. We've refined our customer segmentation strategy, so we know who are the clients that we need to partner with deeply. We've implemented a more refined variable compensation program. We've refreshed our talent to ensure we can represent the entire portfolio and address client pain points beyond the CTO or CIO. 
And I'm excited as to how we're now being seen by clients, Rod, to be honest. We're no longer necessarily just being viewed in the build or operate space. We've got growing reputation and recognition in digital and cloud following our M&A strategy. And that is now showing up in sustained book-to-bill ratios in excess of 1.1, which I feel is critical to drive the revenue growth rate that I'm aspiring to drive, and our qualified pipeline and win rates are as healthy as they have ever been.
Now all of that leads ultimately to financial outcomes. And I don't think the true benefits of this are yet visible. We have seen the margin dilution of the investments, commercial hiring, IT security modernization, M&A, dilution, some brand investments we're making. Of course, we continue to review the trade-offs between revenue growth and margin expansion. But I will say we expect to see revenue benefits on the back of the bookings momentum. And margin should improve each year for the foreseeable future, albeit with a balanced approach to trade-offs between revenue growth and further investments to drive a sustained outperformance versus the competition. So in short, a lot of work, and I look forward to great years ahead."

So it's an industry problem. I think you've seen",647,"Look, it's a 2-edged sword. We've seen a V-shaped recovery as an industry, and Cognizant certainly has after a weak March, April last year. We snapped back immediately. And that leads with a skill shortage. So it's an industry problem. I think you've seen that in the earnings cycle to date. Of course, I caution people to compare attrition rates between various competitors. We include BPO, and our calculation is current quarter annualized, which is the worst of all world at this moment in time versus some peers exclude BPO and look at attrition on a rolling or in the last 12 months, which includes some lower levels of attrition because of COVID.
But Rod, I think about our attrition, which went up 200 basis points sequentially against 2 parameters. One is macro considerations. The market is extremely competitive at this moment in time. There are supply/demand imbalances across cloud, across digital engineering, across data. I sense that the work-from-home environment has given people, let's say, less sense of community. And I also see, obviously, the build-out of captives, which tend to pressurize salaries. And then on top of that macro backdrop, I think we have some Cognizant considerations as we continue to transform the company. 
We're driving towards a culture of meritocracy and a performance culture. We're evolving more towards a global or sometimes local workforce, which is in line with client expectations but also in line with regulatory policy around the world. And in some regards, we're late to some of those elements. And so we're dealing with some of the pain that others have dealt with previously.
I will say I'm 100% confident we're actively managing attrition as best we can. I'm pleased to say that attrition peaked in March, slowed in April and continues to slow in May, albeit early days in May. We've got a lot of work streams around employee engagements, training, job rotations. We've taken the decision to invest more in targeted salary increases and promotions and shifting to quarterly promotion cycles for billable associates. And we've added hundreds of recruiters in the last 4 months. And we're making a record number of 28,000 offers to new graduates in India, which is up from 17,000 hired in 2020. And I think in 2018, we may have actually not even hired any gen Z graduates into Cognizant. 
So we're doing the right thing to address attrition. And of course, in the meantime, we're working to manage the salary inflationary elements of this. As Jan pointed out, P&A expectations in the second half of the year are lower than previously anticipated. So that will temper some of the downsides. But in the same vein, these are investments that I think will help stem attrition, which will give us more productive hours in our employees. And in the same vein, of course, we've got other levers at our disposal to manage salary inflation, be that on offshore or nearshore mix, pyramid optimization, delivery industrialization, including automation, methodologies, templates and the like.
Procurement leverage for subcontractors. We've got a new Chief Procurement Officer coming on board soon. And of course, everything else we're doing as we evolve the company against the line of work that we actually sell and deliver as we shift from staff augmentation towards managed services and project-based delivery transformation that brings different considerations as well.
So we know what we need to do, and we're on it. And as I said, I think we'll see sequential increases in attrition based on the resignations in the last few months because there is a 2-month notice period in India. So we have a strong understanding as to what attrition will be in Q2. But that's been factored into our model and into our guidance. And in the meantime, we've been hiring at record pace given the extra recruiters we've put to work."

It's not a number we disclose. But we have turned to, obviously, external sources, both lateral hires and subcontractors and contingent labor as we've been working through the attrition situation internally, nor do we break out digital versus nondigital head count.
I mean to be very clear, you can have somebody working in a test -- with testing capabilities, they can work on what could be viewed as legacy projects. But in the same vein, as part of an agile squad, they could be working on something around -- something as familiar as a frequent flyer website, which some of the work we do around experience and software product engineering there it's not viewed as legacy, it's certainly viewed as digital. So it's very hard to classify workforce between legacy and digital.
With regards to the opportunity costs, look, we're not quantifying that, but certainly, it's material that I've talked about. And when I review countries, there's hundreds of basis points of growth in some cases that we could have had. In other cases, it's less. But it's been a pain point for us throughout the quarter. We talked about attrition being a worry in our last quarter because we could see resignation rates, and we can see what's happening in the industry as people are doing their best to putting counter offers to stop resignation. And I'm glad we anticipated it, and we set appropriate guidance, and we're doing the same this time around."

So it is a holy grail. 
Of course, you've also got to think about the pyramid. I talked earlier about adding 28,000 offers for freshers into the bottom of the pyramid this year. The bill rates of those will be very different than bill rates of onshore delivery. So it's very difficult, in a succinct way, to decouple revenue growth from head count growth because there are so many factors at play. But rest assured that the industrialization of delivery, including automation, is top of mind for us."

So M&A, first of all, let's go back to the capital framework we've set forth in recent quarters. We plan to deploy approximately 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. I will say these are guiding principles",789,"Okay. So M&A, first of all, let's go back to the capital framework we've set forth in recent quarters. We plan to deploy approximately 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. I will say these are guiding principles, and we will continue to be opportunistic. Approximately 50% towards M&A, an area that's wholly aligned to our strategic priorities. And of course, about the remaining 50% towards dividends and share repurchases, targeting a consistent dividend payout ratio in the range of -- at about -- sorry, 25% on that and the rest for repurchases.
So M&A will continue to be a priority for us. And as I said earlier, we announced 3 acquisitions in the first quarter, and indeed signed an agreement to acquire ESG Mobility. It's not that M&A is something we wake up every morning until we have to do. It's just -- it's an enabler for us to achieve our strategy.
Now our strategy is built around accelerating digital, which are higher growth categories, and our strategy is also built around globalizing the company, both from a global delivery network but also getting after exponential growth overseas. And digital as well as our overseas opportunity, I think, puts us in a position to have ambitions well in excess of the 3% to 4% organic growth rate, Keith, that you mentioned. However, I will refrain from getting into long-term financial statements here. But I would be very, very disappointed in the years ahead if we do not significantly exceed those growth rates.
And I would say we have been doing what was needed in the last year to start replenishing our backlog to consistently drive a book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.1. That puts us in a position that organically, coupled with the accretive nature of the acquisitions we've done, we should have continued upward pressure on revenue on a go-forward basis. And that being said, I will caution everybody we're in somewhat of an unpredictable world at this moment in time with the humanitarian crisis in India.
So that's how I think about our organic possibilities as well as the fact that we have an M&A lever that is exposing us to higher growth categories. And all of this, of course, is against the context where, from my perspective, we are substantially more operationally inclined and more sophisticated in terms of how we think about delivery and commercial levers going forward.
On Financial Services, look, it is critical. We turned around Financial Services. I'm proud with the progress we made in Healthcare, which is catching up on Financial Services as almost being our single biggest industry sector. Well, Financial Services is 1/3 of our revenue. And in dollar terms, it modestly grew, but in constant currency terms, it declined 1.7%. And Keith, within that, we ultimately have 2 groups. We have a Banking and Financial Services business that is more than half of the business, and we have insurance which is kind of less than half.
And it's a tale of 2 cities. In insurance, North America was weaker than the international business. But North American insurance is the vast majority of the insurance business, so that weakness hurt us in Banking and Financial Services. Actually, North America was modestly up, but our international business was down.
Within Banking and Financial Services, there are relatively consistent trends with what we talked about previously. Capital markets declined. Retail banking grew modestly, but it was offset by declines in commercial banks and cards and payments. And if I think about things differently, the global banks, as we call them, have continued to in-source and that business continues to decline for us, offset somewhat by good momentum we have with some of the regional banks.
Now all of this comes back to what are we doing about it. I would say we have a plan of attack. We have had healthy bookings throughout Financial Services, both banking and insurance in 2020. We've added extra commercial coverage. We've actually changed out and refreshed a significant amount of our commercial teams. We've been embracing digital, and we've had strong digital bookings in those areas in 2020. And we've been working more with our partners who are very interested in our strength in Healthcare and indeed Financial Services.
So as Jan pointed out, it is a business that is under repair, and we expect to see gradual recovery in 2021. We should see stronger growth in Q2, obviously, for easy compare reasons as well as COVID and the ransomware attack. But I'd like to think in the course of the year, we can get this thing shaped up to be in better shape than it is today."

And pipeline, candidly, for Financial Services, is also healthy. So from my perspective, Keith, we don't have a demand issue in an industry -- I'm actually quite bullish on the industry for 2020 and indeed for 2021. And that's based on client conversations. And I speak with clients every day, as well as, obviously, we keep an eye on what industry analysts are saying.
I think talent shortages and attrition are a greater concern for the entire industry. But clients are making investments. They are decisive. And indecision is the enemy of people like myself. So clients being decisive is good. They are talking about more strategic partners. We are in the mix more than ever in that vendor consolidation, so I'm quite excited about that. And fundamentally, the things we see driving the pipeline, a lot around business model innovation, customer experience, technology modernization, risk mitigation and efficiency initiatives. 
And kind of the one of the reasons I was so adamant in doubling down with the hyperscalers 2 years ago is because these companies -- I don't think you should underestimate the sheer power and scale of hyperscale companies. They are investing massively, buying commercial teams, commercial terms, aligning with companies like Cognizant, [ around ] industries, massively accelerating cloud migrations. And if you believe in platform economics, which opens up the possibilities of microservices and APIs, I think this is going to be the future. So we set up 2 business groups or business groups in the hyperscalers in the last few years, and I think we're reaping the benefits of that now."

I think we're executing against the plan and trying to spend in the framework of the capital that we strategically want to allocate towards M&A and we're executing that. The team has done really a fantastic job in aligning our deal sourcing across industries and across the globe.
So you see this, for example, we talked in the last quarter about a slight shift towards more geographic expansion, and we have 2 deals this -- an Australian deal and, of course, very close to my heart, a German deal also part of the transactions that we could announce and some of them closed. So we're executing really in a classic manner. The team is very focused partnering with our markets and with our service lines on identifying the strategic areas of growth that we want to do and it's been very diligent and creative of identifying acquisition opportunities. It has really worked really well. And I think the natural spacing of these things will lead us to kind of execute against our allocated capital against it. Now it's what we have been lumpy in and out, but a consistent way to do so.
The focus in the company is clearly on integration because the synergies that these companies deliver are at the heart of the viability of our M&A strategy. And we are pleased with the ability to generate synergies. Our business plans are generally pretty close to the reality on the revenue synergies. And as we now have a larger portfolio of companies that we have acquired, we have increased our focus quite naturally on integration and efficiencies so that these companies can fit into the fabric of Cognizant and benefit from the scale that we can bring to the table.
You see we have still dilution, some acquisitions, putting pressure on our margin. And so you'll see us continuing working on driving integration and reaping also some of the cost efficiencies that might be available to us in the future."

I really feel good about our bookings momentum, to your point, really since the last -- if you think about it, throughout 2020, we had an exceptionally strong Q1. And then through the course of the year, we had strength with mid-teens for the course of the year. But really in 2019, it starts, you don't get bookings until you start building a pipeline. So we really put a lot of effort in the second half of 2020 into pipeline build. That started showing up in terms of bookings momentum in 2020 and then, of course, into 2021. We don't have the same easy compares now as we had last year, which is why I wanted to really contextualize Q1 bookings growth of 5%. 
I actually am delighted with that because our December was really outstanding. It was an excellent month for us. And April has been an excellent month, so the Q1 period has been sandwiched between that. And it's really important to me that people think about bookings on a rolling 4-quarter basis because something stepping from a Friday to a Monday or vice versa could take a deal from Q1 to Q2 or Q1 to Q4. So it's important to contextualize that.
So book-to-bill is the right way to also think about it. I think once you're north of 1.1x, it creates a backlog of opportunity to go execute against and hopefully accelerate revenue on from here. So we're confident of our -- in our numbers. And we're also confident we'll have a very strong Q2 bookings number on the back, not just of excellent April results but also, let's face it, the compare wasn't exactly stellar in May this time last year for many other reasons."

So I appreciate it because there's a lot of momentum, a movement in our margins that I think is important to put our eyes on. When you compare our margins overall operating margin, we're kind of roughly flat, slightly improved year-over-year. And on the gross margin side, you see the benefits of our Fit for Growth, and you can see also the benefits of the lower T&E that helped us to expand the growth margins. Utilization helped a little bit. And also, we had obviously a little bit help in the rupee. That all helped on the margin side.
But then we had on the SG&A side, you see an accelerated growth, but we are really laser-focused on directing that SG&A growth to our strategic initiatives that we think will yield -- we view them as investments, will yield accelerating revenue growth rates. And you pointed out the 2 biggest items. M&A is -- and its dilutive element in its initial years as well as our investments into sales and account management and growth in essence. Those are 2 offsetting factors that we have seen in the past quarters but also this quarter.
When we -- now in outlook, you're pointing out we are basically down ticking our margin guidance a tiny bit. I think that is reflective of a balance that we're trying to strike here reflecting what we anticipate could be some increase in our compensation costs due to the measures in order to lower attrition, attract and retain our talent. And we're planning to offset that partially with some change in assumptions. I think the prices in India illustrates that maybe T&E is not coming back as fast as we have anticipated. And we're also carefully and surgically monitoring our future SG&A growth to tie it all so that we keep the overall margin equation together for the full year. 
But the second quarter will be kind of in line or similar to our first quarter margin expectation, in particular since we're anticipating the SG&A moderation to accelerate basically in the third and fourth quarter, but some of the compensation measures will be probably visible already in the second quarter."

Good afternoon, everybody. Against a challenging labor market backdrop and the recent humanitarian crisis in India, we executed well in the second quarter, allowing us to deliver significant upside to our revenue guidance. Second quarter",2117,"Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. Against a challenging labor market backdrop and the recent humanitarian crisis in India, we executed well in the second quarter, allowing us to deliver significant upside to our revenue guidance. Second quarter revenue of $4.6 billion represented growth of 15% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency.  I'm grateful to our teams across the world for their own flagging dedication to consistently meeting our promises to clients. Thanks to the professionalism of all our associates with no major disruption to client service delivery from the second wave of the pandemic in India. 
We continue to execute against our previously announced Operation C3, which includes our vaccination drive across the 11 cities where Cognizant has operations in India. To date, we've administered or reimbursed over 160,000 vaccines to associates or their families and dependents. 
I'm pleased with the strength of key commercial metrics. Bookings growth accelerated to 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, and our book-to-bill ratio is now 1.2 on a trailing 12-month basis. Qualified pipeline is significantly up, and our win rates are also up year-to-date, positioning us well for continued bookings momentum. Digital revenue growth accelerated to 20% year-over-year in the quarter. 
Moving to industry segments. We posted strong double-digit year-over-year constant currency growth in Communications, Media and Technology, Products and Resources and Healthcare. We've achieved a double-digit CAGR over the past 4 years in Communications, Media and Technology and remain optimistic on our growth prospects. This industry is now home to some of our largest clients. 
Within Products and Resources, we continue to post excellent growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Meanwhile, both retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality posted their fourth successive quarter of sequential revenue increases and are now close to prepandemic revenue levels. 
Our Healthcare business had a strong quarter with double-digit year-over-year growth in both the life sciences and U.S. payer and provider businesses. I'm delighted with our sustained momentum in life sciences, which will allow us to cross the $2 billion annualized revenue threshold later this year. As we strengthen our relationship with existing biopharma and medical device companies, our strong client references and delivery excellence are positioning us well to expand into new logos. For example, we partnered with Viatris, the newly formed company resulting from the merger of Mylan and Upjohn, a legacy division of Pfizer, to support their integration readiness for day 1. We are now continuing our collaboration on post-merger integration services. 
We will continue to invest to support our clients' digital needs in the life sciences business. Last week, we agreed to acquire TQS Integration, a privately owned Ireland-based global industrial data and intelligence company that will enhance our smart manufacturing offerings and build upon our successful acquisition of Zenith Technologies from 2019. And earlier this month, we announced a strategic alliance with global technology leader Philips to develop end-to-end health solutions that will enable health care organizations to improve patient care and accelerate clinical trials. 
Over the past 2 years, we focused significant effort on reinvigorating the U.S. payer and provider businesses. These efforts have started to bear fruit. During the second quarter, we expanded our existing partnerships with large payer clients and added new logos in the provider market. The TriZetto product business is highly strategic to our Healthcare business. Following some weakness post the 2014 acquisition, we spent considerable energy soliciting client feedback and refreshing the product road map over the last 2 years. We are now seeing growing momentum in the business. Annual growth rates in the TriZetto product business doubled in 2020 over 2019, and are on track to double again in 2021, following double-digit revenue growth in the first half of the year. 
Turning now to Financial Services, which grew 5% year-over-year in constant currency. Both the banking and insurance businesses grew year-over-year and sequentially. In banking, which is most of the Financial Services business, we have sharpened our focus on the highest potential client relationships over the past 18 months. We've refreshed now about half of our client-facing teams, bringing in seasoned industry talent with an emphasis on executive engagement and selling and delivering business outcomes in collaboration with the financial services partner ecosystem. While we are making progress in our client engagement strategy, and have seen sustained momentum in regional banks, banking results continue to be hindered by ongoing revenue erosion in large global banks. As such, while we expect full year financial services revenues to grow modestly, the repositioning of the business continues. 
Before discussing the macro demand environment, I would like to acknowledge the progress we've made in our BPO business, which we call digital business operations. 2 years ago, we made the decision to exit certain nonstrategic elements of the content moderation business that had been a meaningful contributor to growth. This decision impacted the growth trajectory of DBO and required us to reposition the business. 2 years on, we've now successfully completed the exit of the content moderation business. And as of the third quarter, revenue compares will be like-for-like. 
I'm pleased with the revised strategic direction of digital business operations, which focuses on automation, analytics and consulting as well as platform-based and core business operations. [indiscernible] to be seen double-digit revenue growth in digital business operations, and we expect to sustain this growth in the coming years, driven by strong results in modern BPO segments like digital natives, and intelligent process automation and by our leadership position in BPaaS within the Healthcare segment. 
A recent example of our client momentum is John Hopkins HealthCare, who turned to us to transition their Medicaid and commercial lines of business from legacy platforms and operations to our leading BPaaS solution. We'll be providing a modern, scalable cloud-based platform to enable John Hopkins HealthCare to be a more robust, flexible organization that can deliver better, more affordable patient outcomes. 
Let's turn now to macro demand, which is particularly robust as clients modernize their legacy environments, embrace the cloud and invest in innovation. We continue to believe that the next phase of digital is about transforming processes to become agile, intelligent and automated and always with an eye on customer experience. Hyperpersonalization is fueling significant demand in analytics, AI and ML. 
Given strong demand on our bullish outlook in the industry, we are committed to meaningfully scaling our headcounts over the coming quarters. However, this macro demand backdrop has also created a demand-supply imbalance in key skills and has meaningfully increased industry attrition. As we noted in last quarter's remarks, we expected attrition to go up sequentially in Q2, and it did. Second quarter voluntary attrition reached 29% on an annualized basis or 18% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, our attrition metric captures the entire company including trainees and corporate across both IT services and BPO. Against this backdrop, we continue to take a series of actions to reduce attrition, including compensation adjustments, job rotations, reskilling and promotions and a host of associate engagement activities. Fortunately, we meaningfully increased our recruiting capacity over the last 6 months as we anticipated the spike in attrition, following the V-shaped demand recovery in the second half of 2020. 
Our human resources team have done a remarkable job helping us mitigate the impact of elevated attrition through comprehensive hiring, onboarding and skilling programs. In fact, we now expect to hire approximately 100,000 laterals in 2021 and to train close to 100,000 associates. In addition, we expect to onboard approximately 30,000 new graduates in 2021 and make 45,000 offers to new graduates in India for 2022 onboarding. 
Over recent years, we've been methodically shifting our revenue mix to digital, which now accounts for more than 44% of our revenue. Since 2019, we've invested more than $2 billion in mergers and acquisitions to accelerate our digital capabilities. While the impact of recent acquisitions has reduced Q2 company margins given diligence and integration costs and acquired company margin dilution, it has nonetheless been the right thing to do. These investments have changed the growth profile of Cognizant by shifting our businesses to higher growth categories and reducing our exposure to nondigital categories that have declined in recent years. 
Today, I wanted to spend a moment addressing some of our progress against our targeted digital battlegrounds, including IoT, digital engineering and cloud. Our IoT business has scaled rapidly and revenues are now expected to exceed $600 million in 2021, almost twice the size of what it was in 2019. Cognizant was recently ranked #1 in IoT services category in ISG's 2021 IoT Services Evaluation for both the U.S. and Europe. 
Our digital engineering business is now at a $1.2 billion annual run rate, growing 30%, making it one of the largest digital engineering businesses in the world. In June, Cognizant was named a leader in Everest Group's Peak Matrix for Software Product Engineering Services 2021 Report. 
We've also made tremendous headway in our cloud business. 7 of our acquisitions over the past 18 months have been cloud-related. As you may know, Gartner in its Magic Quadrant for public cloud infrastructure managed services providers, elevated Cognizant from a niche provider player in 2018 to challenger in 2019 and to leader in 2020. We now have 3 cloud-focused business groups: one for Microsoft, another for AWS and a third most recently for Google, each supported by specialized cloud experts and solution architects. 
For example, we've been recently engaged with Microsoft's industry clouds in areas like financial services, health care and retail. In the past 2 years, thanks to our ongoing market momentum, the acquisitions of New Signature, Contino and 10th Magnitude and the formation of our Microsoft business group, we have meaningfully changed a ranking to become one of Microsoft's leading global system integrator partners. Our commitment to the partnership and focus on technical intensity is demonstrated by more than 100% year-over-year growth in our Microsoft cloud certifications. 
Our success in expanding our portfolio has not only made us more competitive but has encouraged more clients to engage us to execute their transformation agendas. This positions us to take full advantage of our client base by enabling us to upsell and cross-sell in our existing accounts and enables us to get new logos by leading with digital. For example, Gilead Sciences selected us to lead a body of work related to IT business transformation as well as development of an enhanced security and compliance posture. We will utilize our deep life science industry knowledge augmented by recent acquisitions like Zenith Technologies and collaborative solutions, along with our proprietary legacy modernization framework, and robust automation capabilities to support this work. Our aim is to accelerate the company's technology transformation and further enhance its digital capabilities. 
In another example, given our advanced capabilities in digital automotive, engineering R&D and smart connected mobility, Qualcomm Technologies, one of the world's foremost semiconductor and connectivity solutions companies, turned to us to build a reliable cloud-agnostic connected vehicle management solution. The aim of this integrated platform is to connect vehicular onboard applications, manage car-to-cloud operations and work across nearly every OEM vehicle platform and its cloud infrastructure. 
Lastly, building exceptional digital experiences is of increasing importance to clients who sometimes struggle to connect the dots between the experience itself and the underlying business functions. With our extended portfolio, we're now able to orchestrate software, data, platforms and programs to transform high-value interactions into personalized experiences that drive business results. A great example of this is how we're now partnering with NBC to reimagine their customer experience, creating direct-to-consumer commerce strategies, driving attendance to their theme parks and supporting their marquee event to 2021 Summer Olympic Games. 
In closing, I've been in the CEO role now for more than 2 years, and I see a new Cognizant taking shape. Our solution portfolio is stronger than at any time in our history. This has changed the way clients and partners perceive us and helps us deliver differentiated business outcomes. We are bullish on the industry and our prospects within it. We are well positioned to capitalize on digital transformation market trends, which are accelerating, and we have an enormous opportunity in our international markets. But we are in one of the hottest job markets in many years, and expect elevated attrition to remain a factor across the industry in the coming quarters, our recruitment and selling programs as well as targeted actions to offset margin headwinds stemming from the industry's talent shortage, provide us confidence in our outlook for the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. 
With that, over to you, Jan."

Our Q2 revenue was $4.6 billion, representing growth of approximately 15% or 12% in constant currency. Revenue was $125 million above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued demand for digital, which grew 20% and represented 44% of total revenues. Year-over-year revenue growth also includes approximately 390 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions and benefited from an easier compare to Q2 2020, where our revenues were impacted in the early months of the pandemic and by the ransomware attack in April 2020. 
Moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 5%, in line with our expectations. We continue to make progress as we reposition this business and observed a strong improvement in the pipeline. We still expect the paced recovery through the remainder of the year. 
Healthcare revenue increased approximately 13%. Again, driven by strong performance in both our health care payer and life sciences businesses. Revenue growth within our Healthcare business was primarily organic, and we continue to see strong demand for our integrated payer software solutions and improving fundamentals in our provider business. As Brian mentioned, we remain very pleased with the growth in our life sciences business. 
Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 18%, driven by the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Segment growth included approximately 600 basis points from inorganic revenue. As Brian mentioned, we also experienced growth in retail consumer goods and travel and hospitality, driven in part by the lapping of the prepandemic conveyors. There are early signs of stabilization within these sectors most impacted by the pandemic, but we continue to monitor closely. 
Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 18%, of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by a negative 190 basis point impact from our exit of certain portions to our content services business. 
Overall, we are very pleased with the growth of our core portfolio. 
Now moving on to margins. In Q2, our GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 15.2%. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved approximately 110 basis points, primarily reflecting the savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and the impact from the pandemic and ransomware attack in Q2 2020. This year-over-year benefit was offset in part by SG&A investments, including those intended to drive and support organic revenue growth as well as the negative impact on margin on our recently completed acquisitions and costs related to the modernization of our IT core and security infrastructure. In addition, we anticipate continued cost pressure from our elevated attrition, which includes higher recruiting costs, lateral higher wages and subcontractor costs. 
Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26.5% and our adjusted tax rate was 25.4%, in line with our expectations. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.97 and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.99. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.9 billion or $1.2 billion net of debt. Free cash flow in Q2 was $466 million. This included a payment from the settlement with 2 of the 3 customers that were part of the proposed customer engagement exit we announced in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings. Excluding this onetime payment, free cash flow would have been approximately 100% of net income. The payments made this quarter were in line with our prior expectations and resulted in no impact to our earnings in Q2. Overall, we were pleased with the outcome of the settlement, which includes a continued commercial relationship with both customers. Negotiations with the third client are ongoing and constructive. 
DSO of 71 days increased by 1 day sequentially and has improved from 77 days in the prior year period. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $296 million at a weighted average price of approximately $74 per share. At the end of June, we had $2.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We also spent cash of approximately $350 million on acquisitions and $127 million for our regular quarterly dividend. 
Turning to guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.69 billion to $4.74 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10.6% to 11.6% or 10% to 11% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a favorable 60 basis points impact and inorganic contribution of approximately 320 basis points. 
For the full year, we now expect revenue of $18.4 billion to $18.5 billion, representing 10.2% to 11.2% growth or 9% to 10% in constant currency. This compares to our prior guidance of 7% to 9% growth as reported or 5.5% to 7.5% in constant currency. Our outlook assumes currency will have a favorable 120 basis point impact and includes approximately 320 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. Our outlook assumes continued momentum across Healthcare, CMT and Products and Resources, while we continue to expect a paced recovery in Financial Services over the next couple of quarters. 
Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15.4%, the midpoint of our prior guidance of 15.2% to 15.7%. As I mentioned earlier, elevated attrition is leading to increased costs in certain areas. We are also continuing to fund investments in our people, including compensation, quarterly promotions, retention and training. We expect these costs will weigh on our results for the next several quarters as management remains keenly focused on addressing our high attrition levels through a comprehensive set of initiatives. 
We continue to expect SG&A growth for the remainder of the year, driven in part by the impact from our M&A activity. However, we are slowing the pace of growth in some areas not directly related to our strategic initiatives to mitigate some of this cost pressure. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance which is $4 to $4.06 compared to $3.90 to $4.02 previously. 
Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million to $30 million compared to $20 million to $30 million previously. Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 528 million compared to 530 million previously and a tax rate of 25% to 26%, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. 
Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy and returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Before opening the call for questions, I wanted to let you know that we are planning to hold an investor briefing in the fall during which Brian and I will provide a review of our strategy and an update on our progress over the last 2 years. We will also provide our multiyear financial framework. Please keep an eye out and save the date in the coming weeks. 
With that, we will open the call for your questions."

I know that's something that you watch pretty closely. So what's your confidence level in being able to bring attrition down over the next couple of quarters?"

Thank you, Lisa, and somehow I anticipated questions around our margin guidance being of interest. It's a complex situation, Lisa, in that we have actually quite a few dynamics going on that impact the margin dynamic for the second half. And so you'r",351,"Yes. Thank you, Lisa, and somehow I anticipated questions around our margin guidance being of interest. It's a complex situation, Lisa, in that we have actually quite a few dynamics going on that impact the margin dynamic for the second half. And so you're rightly concluded that for the second half, we are expecting really, on average, margin development around 15.6% to meet our midpoint of our guidance. And as you're also aware, we have a little bit of a quarterly dynamic towards the year-end. So margins in the third quarter, we're thinking, are going to be slightly higher than towards the fourth quarter due to typical end-of-season dynamics, including the merit increase that will fully filter in the fourth quarter when we administer and implement the merit thing. So that's kind of all the general margin dynamic. 
What we have seen, I want to point out a few other elements of the margin dynamic. We have seen, in this quarter, a fairly healthy margin dynamic on the gross margin side, and we reported a shift in our digital revenue mix, which comes actually with higher gross margin than our traditional business, which is part of the strategic rationale of why we are, of course, engaging in the transformation of the business. And that margin effect was accelerated actually, we shifted share, but we also improved that relative margin in our second quarter. 
So we anticipate to continue to have some benefit from that mix shift also in the second half. And then, of course, we see pressure from the compensation measures coming into our P&L. And we're offsetting that by controlling the growth of certain SG&A components that have been growing kind of likely, I would say, to and bring that more to a controlled or flattish outcome towards the end of the year. And so it's a number of factors that we have to keenly execute in order to keep, of course, the overall structure of our P&L in place, but that's the principal dynamic that we are following. And I hand over the employee engagement question to Brian."

As you can imagine, voluntary attrition in the quarter was 29%. But on a trailing 12-month basis, which is more how the industry tends to look at it, it was 18%. And we've seen primarily the attrition in the more junior levels of the organization or mid-levels in India, but it's also a global phenomenon. It's really one of the hottest markets we've seen our team has seen over the last 10-plus years. So role dealing with it. As it happens in the last month, we had the results of our annual engagement survey. We're actually very pleased with our results. They're at or above, in many cases, industry benchmarks. I'm really pleased to see the delivery organization, engagement scores are actually above the company average, and they're very much as a total company in the same range as where we've been from 2016 and beyond. 
Last year, we actually had a particularly strong year as many companies did because of the pandemic when people were pleased when they had secure jobs or whatnot. So from 1 perspective, I feel very, very good about it. But in the same vein, of course, I don't feel very good about the attrition. And so that's top of mind, and it's got a lot of management focus. 
I'm pleased that we executed well in the quarter. We exceeded our revenue guidance despite elevated attrition, but my great hope is, over time, we can reduce attrition and yet continue to hire at the pace we have been hiring at, which is something we're very pleased with the throughput of our recruitment team has been terrific. So what are we doing to reduce attrition? And to continue to drive employee engagement is the next obvious question, well, look, annual merit-based increases have been announced here in the last few weeks, they're effective October 1. That's on top of a whole host of ad hoc measures we played through in the course of the last year. out-of-cycle increases promotion, retention dollars. We've announced a shift in the last few months to quarterly promotion cycles for billable resources. We've really fast-tracked job rotations and reskilling initiatives across the company. Then a host of things with Cognizant Academy, which is our training capability as well as higher education programs for select employees as well. And we've put an enormous effort behind our employee value proposition, celebrating delivery success, big wins, et cetera. So more work to be done, but I'm confident we're doing the right things. 
And as I said, while I'm pleased we executed through it this quarter, the reality is 15% revenue growth this quarter also gives the organization a little bit of energy that locate growth is coming back and with growth comes good things in terms of career path opportunities, rotations and promotions and whatnot. So I'm sure today's top line story will help broader employees feel better, and we'll keep doing all the other things we're doing."

And so as we start thinking about this, of course, it gets into how we engage our clients and how we think about the demand signal that will help us facilitate the right resources at the right time. Communication is important in a time like it, setting appropriate expectations regarding resource availability time lines. Entity prioritization, Ashwin, as you can imagine, getting the right resources on our most strategic accounts is very much top of mind and part of our execution rigor we do now on a day in, day out basis. 
Regrettably, we just -- despite growing 15% in the quarter, we're yet unable to meet the full expectations of our own potential and what is out there in the market. So we're working through that as best we can and doing our best, as I said, to minimize attrition, whilst at the same time to maximize employee engagement and to maximize onboarding. 
As I said in my remarks, we'll bring on about 100,000 lateral hires this year alone. We'll train about 100,000 people, and we'll onboard about 30,000 freshers and we make offers to 45,000 freshers. Regardless of our attrition rate, we will still go through with those numbers because there is enough market demand for us to get after that opportunity. And that's what we're quite excited about. I think the portfolio is more compelling than ever before, and we've made huge progress in the last year to get after that market opportunity. So we're feeling pretty good about that. But it's a hot market, and I think you've heard that through the earnings cycle. So we're all dealing with the same problem."

It's a very -- as you can imagine, a hot market out there, and so it's very difficult to call. I think we're doing the right things to mitigate that. But rest assured, these levels of attrition and slightly beyond our inner guidance. 
With regards to bookings, look, I feel really good about our bookings, to be very honest. It's important to look at bookings not just on a weekly or a quarterly basis, but really on a trailing 12-month basis. And now we have rounded that 1-year period, so we have a good book-to-bill ratio over the last 12 months of 1.2x, which I think is very, very healthy. We look at it in terms of geographic. We look at it in terms of business mix. We look at it in terms of new and expansion versus renewals. And it's pretty solid across the board. And the pipeline is solid across the board as well. 
So I feel good about the market opportunity. Candidly, I don't think demand is the problem for this industry. I think it's a great time to be in services. It's more of a supply constraint at this moment in time. 
With regard to the sales, our commercial teams we brought on board. Look, they're ramping. I don't think we have full productivity. At this stage, we've got a lot of exercises underway to make sure we get true gearing ratios. But in the same vein, I feel as though we've got a client-facing team now that is better able to walk the corridors and when we get back from COVID virtually for now and to cross-sell the entire portfolio. And if you think about our installed base, it's a huge asset for us and the opportunity is real. About 4 out of 10, or 40%, of our accounts, we only sell 1 of our practices into those, and we have 10-plus practices. So think about cross-sell as a huge opportunity for us. And of course, the M&A that we have conducted in the last 2 years, which is 100% aligned to our digital strategy enables that cross-sell more than ever before and indeed cross-sell is core to the business case of those acquisitions. So we're pretty excited about what we can do there, both in terms of our installed base, which, of course, is a big priority for us. But we also have opportunity through this extended portfolio to get after new logos. And the Qualcomm example I cited in my script is a good example of that, where we're leading with digital. And accordingly, we'll try and cross-sell the nondigital business as well."

It was 28% or less than 30% at the end of 2018 for the year. And it's been very much part and parcel of what we're setting out to achieve. It's 44% of our mix today. Candidly, a numerator denominator comes into play. We actually had very good success this quarter, driving growth as well in our nondigital business, which has declined in 2019 and 2020. So candidly, that has slowed the digital mix ramping further, this year growth of nondigital this quarter. 
But overall, the digital business will continue to grow. I'd like to think as we get to the latter part of this year, we'll be up closer to 50%, and it will start becoming a bigger portion of our overall business over time. That's important for us because: a, it helps us be exposed to higher growth categories; but b, it increases our intimacy with the broader C-suite in our installed base of accounts, and that enables us to sell beyond the CTO organization into the CMO into the line of service leader, et cetera. 
Of the accounts that we have added in the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, the vast majority of the bookings exactly in what we would term digital. So Rod, that mix shift to digital will continue, and I'm pretty optimistic that we'll continue to see a nice ramp there. That is not just good for revenue or client intimacy, it's actually also very good for our margin rate as a company as well. So we feel as though we're doing the right things. Our M&A strategy is 100% behind this and it puts us in a position to actually get after our installed base to cross-sell and upsell and actually get new logos and really become a challenger in the digital arena."

So it will feather through country-specific and market-oriented based on wage developments in those countries. 
On the M&A program, we just talked about, I think, at the end of last year, about a capital allocation framework for the company, which about dedicated 50% of our cash flow to M&A for a reminder about 25% used to offset the dilution of our equity compensation and 25% for dividends. And we use this framework not to precision, but as a really good framework for us to execute our strategy. So going forward, I'm anticipating to spend within the range of that capital allocation framework to support the execution of our strategy. 
We remain focused in that M&A program on our strategic objectives and focus on our digital battlegrounds. You have seen in some of the acquisitions in the beginning of this year, that we may have, and it's with few transactions, hard to describe the trend, but there is a keen focus on executing and using the strategy also to help the globalization of Cognizant. And so we have seen with Servian earlier in the year, an acquisition in the Australian marketplace. We acquired ESG Mobility in the fatherland, my home country, which I was very happy about, really a leading provider on the Internet of Things, IoT with keen leadership positions in the automotive sector. So there is more geographic diversion still needed for us. And so we'll adapt as we make progress on the positioning of our practices and our industry groups to the needs of the strategy.

And I anticipate, given how [indiscernible] the market, and my sense is we'll have a resilient services, demand picture for the foreseeable future, I anticipate elevated attrition across the industry."

With regards to our CMT industry vertical, it has not been a major driver of the business to date. We're very intrigued around autonomous driving. As Jan said, we acquired ESG Mobility in Germany. We've got a big emphasis on the automotive vertical and indeed on the CMT vertical, but 5G has not been a massive factor to date.

So it's broad-based. Digital engineering is something we prioritize. It's growing rapidly. As I said, it's one of our biggest growth potential units in the years ahead. Something that has scaled meaningfully in the last 2 years, and we're now one of the largest digital engineering companies in the world. We've complemented our capabilities with the acquisition of Softvision in 2018. And then in more recent years, Magenic and Tin Roof. I just feel very good about our potential there, but more broadly, there's just a lot of demand in this arena, and I just feel good about our potential because we're scaling, it's still a smaller portion of our mix. The more we scale, the higher company average CAGR. And as Jan has implied, it's good for our margin rate as well. So we're full speed ahead after the digital opportunity."

Good afternoon, everybody. Against a challenging labor market backdrop and the recent humanitarian crisis in India, we executed well in the second quarter, allowing us to deliver significant upside to our revenue guidance. Second quarter",2122,"Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. Against a challenging labor market backdrop and the recent humanitarian crisis in India, we executed well in the second quarter, allowing us to deliver significant upside to our revenue guidance. Second quarter revenue of $4.6 billion represented growth of 15% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency.  I'm grateful to our teams across the world for their own flagging dedication to consistently meeting our promises to clients. Thanks to the professionalism of all our associates with no major disruption to client service delivery from the second wave of the pandemic in India. 
We continue to execute against our previously announced Operation C3, which includes our vaccination drive across the 11 cities where Cognizant has operations in India. To date, we've administered or reimbursed over 160,000 vaccines to associates or their families and dependents. 
I'm pleased with the strength of key commercial metrics. Bookings growth accelerated to 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, and our book-to-bill ratio is now 1.2 on a trailing 12-month basis. Qualified pipeline is significantly up, and our win rates are also up year-to-date, positioning us well for continued bookings momentum. Digital revenue growth accelerated to 20% year-over-year in the quarter. 
Moving to industry segments. We posted strong double-digit year-over-year constant currency growth in Communications, Media and Technology, Products and Resources and Healthcare. We've achieved a double-digit CAGR over the past 4 years in Communications, Media and Technology and remain optimistic on our growth prospects. This industry is now home to some of our largest clients. 
Within Products and Resources, we continue to post excellent growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Meanwhile, both retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality posted their fourth successive quarter of sequential revenue increases, and are now close to prepandemic revenue levels. 
Our Healthcare business had a strong quarter with double-digit year-over-year growth in both the life sciences and U.S. payer and provider businesses. I'm delighted with our sustained momentum in life sciences, which will allow us to cross the $2 billion annualized revenue threshold later this year. As we strengthen our relationship with existing biopharma and medical device companies, our strong client references and delivery excellence are positioning us well to expand into new logos. For example, we partnered with Viatris, the newly formed company resulting from the merger of Mylan and Upjohn, a legacy division of Pfizer, to support their integration readiness for day 1. We are now continuing our collaboration on post-merger integration services. 
We will continue to invest to support our clients' digital needs in the life sciences business. Last week, we agreed to acquire TQS Integration, a privately owned Ireland-based global industrial data and intelligence company that will enhance our smart manufacturing offerings and build upon our successful acquisition of Zenith Technologies from 2019. And earlier this month, we announced a strategic alliance with global health technology leader Philips to develop end-to-end health solutions that will enable health care organizations to improve patient care and accelerate clinical trials. 
Over the past 2 years, we focused significant effort on reinvigorating the U.S. payer and provider businesses. These efforts have started to bear fruit. During the second quarter, we expanded our existing partnerships with large payer clients and added new logos in the provider market. The TriZetto product business is highly strategic to our Healthcare business. Following some weakness post the 2014 acquisition, we spent considerable energy soliciting client feedback and refreshing the product road map over the last 2 years. We are now seeing growing momentum in the business. Annual growth rates in the TriZetto product business doubled in 2020 over 2019, and are on track to double again in 2021, following double-digit revenue growth in the first half of the year. 
Turning now to Financial Services, which grew 5% year-over-year in constant currency. Both the banking and insurance businesses grew year-over-year and sequentially. In banking, which is most of the Financial Services business, we have sharpened our focus on the highest potential client relationships over the past 18 months. We've refreshed now about half of our client-facing teams, bringing in seasoned industry talent with an emphasis on executive engagement and selling and delivering business outcomes in collaboration with the financial services partner ecosystem. While we are making progress in our client engagement strategy, and have seen sustained momentum in regional banks, banking results continue to be hindered by ongoing revenue erosion in large global banks. As such, while we expect full year financial services revenues to grow modestly, the repositioning of the business continues. 
Before discussing the macro demand environment, I would like to acknowledge the progress we've made in our BPO business, which we call digital business operations. Two years ago, we made the decision to exit certain nonstrategic elements of the content moderation business that had been a meaningful contributor to growth. This decision impacted the growth trajectory of DBO and required us to reposition the business. Two years on, we've now successfully completed the exit of the content moderation business. And as of the third quarter, revenue compares will be like-for-like. 
I'm pleased with the revised strategic direction of digital business operations, which focuses on automation, analytics and consulting as well as platform-based and core business process operations. Year to date, we've seen double-digit revenue growth in digital business operations, and we expect to sustain this growth in the coming years, driven by strong results in modern BPO segments like digital natives and intelligent process automation and by our leadership position in BPaaS within the Healthcare segment. 
A recent example of our client momentum is Johns Hopkins HealthCare, who turned to us to transition their Medicaid and commercial lines of business from legacy platforms and operations to our leading BPaaS solution. We'll be providing a modern, scalable cloud-based platform to enable Johns Hopkins HealthCare to be a more robust, flexible organization that can deliver better, more affordable patient outcomes. 
Let's turn now to macro demand, which is particularly robust as clients modernize their legacy environments, embrace the cloud and invest in innovation. We continue to believe that the next phase of digital is about transforming processes to become agile, intelligent and automated and always with an eye on customer experience. Hyperpersonalization is fueling significant demand in analytics, AI and ML. 
Given strong demand on our bullish outlook in the industry, we are committed to meaningfully scaling our headcounts over the coming quarters. However, this macro demand backdrop has also created a demand-supply imbalance in key skills and has meaningfully increased industry attrition. As we noted in last quarter's remarks, we expected attrition to go up sequentially in Q2, and it did. Second quarter voluntary attrition reached 29% on an annualized basis or 18% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, our attrition metric captures the entire company including trainees and corporate across both IT services and BPO. Against this backdrop, we continue to take a series of actions to reduce attrition, including compensation adjustments, job rotations, reskilling and promotions and a host of associate engagement activities. Fortunately, we meaningfully increased our recruiting capacity over the last 6 months as we anticipated the spike in attrition, following the V-shaped demand recovery in the second half of 2020. 
Our human resources team have done a remarkable job helping us mitigate the impact of elevated attrition through comprehensive hiring, onboarding and skilling programs. In fact, we now expect to hire approximately 100,000 laterals in 2021 and to train close to 100,000 associates. In addition, we expect to onboard approximately 30,000 new graduates in 2021 and make 45,000 offers to new graduates in India for 2022 onboarding. 
Over recent years, we've been methodically shifting our revenue mix to digital, which now accounts for more than 44% of our revenue. Since 2019, we've invested more than $2 billion in mergers and acquisitions to accelerate our digital capabilities. While the impact of recent acquisitions has reduced Q2 company margins given diligence and integration costs and acquired company margin dilution, it has nonetheless been the right thing to do. These investments have changed the growth profile of Cognizant by shifting our businesses to higher growth categories and reducing our exposure to nondigital categories that have declined in recent years. 
Today, I wanted to spend a moment addressing some of our progress against our targeted digital battlegrounds, including IoT, digital engineering and cloud. Our IoT business has scaled rapidly and revenues are now expected to exceed $600 million in 2021, almost twice the size of what it was in 2019. Cognizant was recently ranked #1 in the managed IoT services category in ISG's 2021 IoT services evaluation for both the U.S. and Europe. 
Our digital engineering business is now at a $1.2 billion annual run rate, growing 30%, making it one of the largest digital engineering businesses in the world. In June, Cognizant was named a leader in Everest Group's PEAK Matrix for Software Product Engineering Services 2021 Report. 
We've also made tremendous headway in our cloud business. Seven of our acquisitions over the past 18 months have been cloud-related. As you may know, Gartner in its Magic Quadrant for public cloud infrastructure managed services providers, elevated Cognizant from a niche provider player in 2018 to challenger in 2019 and to leader in 2020. We now have 3 cloud-focused business groups: one for Microsoft, another for AWS, and a third most recently for Google, each supported by specialized cloud experts and solution architects. 
For example, we've been recently engaged with Microsoft's industry clouds in areas like financial services, health care and retail. In the past 2 years, thanks to our ongoing market momentum, the acquisitions of New Signature, Contino and 10th Magnitude and the formation of our Microsoft business group, we have meaningfully changed the ranking to become one of Microsoft's leading global system integrator partners. Our commitment to the partnership and focus on technical intensity is demonstrated by more than 100% year-over-year growth in our Microsoft cloud certifications. 
Our success in expanding our portfolio has not only made us more competitive, but has encouraged more clients to engage us to execute their transformation agendas. This positions us to take full advantage of our client base by enabling us to upsell and cross-sell in our existing accounts, and enables us to get new logos by leading with digital. For example, Gilead Sciences selected us to lead a body of work related to IT business transformation as well as development of an enhanced security and compliance posture. We will utilize our deep life science industry knowledge augmented by recent acquisitions like Zenith Technologies and collaborative solutions, along with our proprietary legacy modernization framework and robust automation capabilities to support this work. Our aim is to accelerate the company's technology transformation and further enhance its digital capabilities. 
In another example, given our advanced capabilities in digital automotive, engineering, R&D and smart connected mobility, Qualcomm Technologies, one of the world's foremost semiconductor and connectivity solutions companies, turned to us to build a reliable cloud-agnostic connected vehicle management solution. The aim of this integrated platform is to connect vehicular onboard applications, manage car-to-cloud operations and work across nearly every OEM vehicle platform and its cloud infrastructure. 
Lastly, building exceptional digital experiences is of increasing importance to clients who sometimes struggle to connect the dots between the experience itself and the underlying business functions. With our extended portfolio, we're now able to orchestrate software, data, platforms and programs to transform high-value interactions into personalized experiences that drive business results. A great example of this is how we're now partnering with NBC to reimagine their customer experience, creating direct-to-consumer commerce strategies, driving attendance to their theme parks and supporting their marquee event to 2021 Summer Olympic Games. 
In closing, I've been in the CEO role now for more than 2 years, and I see a new Cognizant taking shape. Our solution portfolio is stronger than at any time in our history. This has changed the way clients and partners perceive us and helps us deliver differentiated business outcomes. We are bullish on the industry and our prospects within it. We are well positioned to capitalize on digital transformation market trends, which are accelerating, and we have an enormous opportunity in our international markets. But we are in one of the hottest job markets in many years, and expect elevated attrition to remain a factor across the industry in the coming quarters. Our recruitment and skilling programs, as well as targeted actions to offset margin headwinds stemming from the industry's talent shortage, provide us confidence in our outlook for the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. With that, over to you, Jan."

Our Q2 revenue was $4.6 billion, representing growth of approximately 15% or 12% in constant currency.

Our Q2 revenue was $4.6 billion, representing growth of approximately 15% or 12% in constant currency. Revenue was $125 million above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued demand for digital, which grew 20% and represented 44% of total revenues. Year-over-year revenue growth also includes approximately 390 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions and benefited from an easier compare to Q2 2020, where our revenues were impacted in the early months of the pandemic and by the ransomware attack in April 2020. 
Moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 5%, in line with our expectations. We continue to make progress as we reposition this business and observed a strong improvement in the pipeline. We still expect the paced recovery through the remainder of the year. 
Healthcare revenue increased approximately 13%, again, driven by strong performance in both our health care payer and life sciences businesses. Revenue growth within our Healthcare business was primarily organic, and we continue to see strong demand for our integrated payer software solutions and improving fundamentals in our provider business. As Brian mentioned, we remain very pleased with the growth in our life sciences business. 
Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 18%, driven by the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Segment growth included approximately 600 basis points from inorganic revenue. As Brian mentioned, we also experienced growth in retail consumer goods and travel and hospitality, driven in part by the lapping of the prepandemic conveyors. There are early signs of stabilization within these sectors most impacted by the pandemic, but we continue to monitor closely. 
Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 18%, of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by a negative 190 basis points impact from our exit of certain portions to our content services business. Overall, we are very pleased with the growth of our core portfolio. 
Now moving on to margins. In Q2, our GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 15.2%. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved approximately 110 basis points, primarily reflecting the savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and the impact from the pandemic and ransomware attack in Q2 2020. This year-over-year benefit was offset in part by SG&A investments, including those intended to drive and support organic revenue growth as well as the negative impact on margin on our recently completed acquisitions and costs related to the modernization of our IT core and security infrastructure. In addition, we anticipate continued cost pressure from our elevated attrition, which includes higher recruiting costs, lateral higher wages and subcontractor costs. 
Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26.5% and our adjusted tax rate was 25.4%, in line with our expectations. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.97 and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.99. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.9 billion or $1.2 billion net of debt. Free cash flow in Q2 was $466 million. This included a payment from the settlement with 2 of the 3 customers that were part of the proposed customer engagement exit we announced in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings. Excluding this onetime payment, free cash flow would have been approximately 100% of net income. The payments made this quarter were in line with our prior expectations and resulted in no impact to our earnings in Q2. Overall, we were pleased with the outcome of the settlement, which includes a continued commercial relationship with both customers. Negotiations with the third client are ongoing and constructive. 
DSO of 71 days increased by 1 day sequentially and has improved from 77 days in the prior year period. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $296 million at a weighted average price of approximately $74 per share. At the end of June, we had $2.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We also spent cash of approximately $350 million on acquisitions and $127 million for our regular quarterly dividend. 
Turning to guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.69 billion to $4.74 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10.6% to 11.6% or 10% to 11% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a favorable 60 basis points impact and inorganic contribution of approximately 320 basis points. 
For the full year, we now expect revenue of $18.4 billion to $18.5 billion, representing 10.2% to 11.2% growth or 9% to 10% in constant currency. This compares to our prior guidance of 7% to 9% growth as reported or 5.5% to 7.5% in constant currency. Our outlook assumes currency will have a favorable 120 basis points impact and includes approximately 320 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. Our outlook assumes continued momentum across Healthcare, CMT, and Products and Resources, while we continue to expect a paced recovery in Financial Services over the next couple of quarters. 
Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15.4%, the midpoint of our prior guidance of 15.2% to 15.7%. As I mentioned earlier, elevated attrition is leading to increased costs in certain areas. We are also continuing to fund investments in our people, including compensation, quarterly promotions, retention and training. We expect these costs will weigh on our results for the next several quarters as management remains keenly focused on addressing our high attrition levels through a comprehensive set of initiatives. 
We continue to expect SG&A growth for the remainder of the year, driven in part by the impact from our M&A activity. However, we are slowing the pace of growth in some areas not directly related to our strategic initiatives to mitigate some of this cost pressure. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4 to $4.06 compared to $3.90 to $4.02 previously. 
Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million to $30 million compared to $20 million to $30 million previously. Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 528 million compared to 530 million previously and a tax rate of 25% to 26%, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. 
Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy and returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Before opening the call for questions, I wanted to let you know that we are planning to hold an investor briefing in the fall, during which Brian and I will provide a review of our strategy and an update on our progress over the last 2 years. We will also provide our multiyear financial framework. Please keep an eye out and save the date in the coming weeks. 
With that, we will open the call for your questions."

Like -- so for example, are you -- given the high demand environment, are you able to take price, et cetera? Just a little bit more color there.  
And then I'll just ask my second one, kind of related, it's just around employee health. I'm just wondering like how employee satisfaction is faring at Cognizant. I know that's something that you watch pretty closely. So what's your confidence level in being able to bring attrition down over the next couple of quarters?"

Thank you, Lisa, and somehow I anticipated questions around our margin guidance being of interest. It's a complex situation, Lisa, in that we have actually quite a few dynamics going on that impact the margin dynamic for the second half. And so you'r",351,"Yes. Thank you, Lisa, and somehow I anticipated questions around our margin guidance being of interest. It's a complex situation, Lisa, in that we have actually quite a few dynamics going on that impact the margin dynamic for the second half. And so you're rightly concluded that for the second half, we are expecting really, on average, margin development around 15.6% to meet our midpoint of our guidance. And as you're also aware, we have a little bit of a quarterly dynamic towards the year-end. So margins in the third quarter, we're thinking, are going to be slightly higher than towards the fourth quarter due to typical end-of-season dynamics, including the merit increase that will fully filter in the fourth quarter when we administer and implement the merit thing. So that's kind of all the general margin dynamic.  
What we have seen, I want to point out a few other elements of the margin dynamic. We have seen, in this quarter, a fairly healthy margin dynamic on the gross margin side, and we reported a shift in our digital revenue mix, which comes actually with higher gross margin than our traditional business, which is part of the strategic rationale of why we are, of course, engaging in the transformation of the business. And that margin effect was accelerated. Actually, we shifted share, but we also improved that relative margin in our second quarter.  
So we anticipate to continue to have some benefit from that mix shift also in the second half. And then, of course, we see pressure from the compensation measures coming into our P&L. And we're offsetting that by controlling the growth of certain SG&A components that have been growing kind of lively, I would say, too, and bring that more to a controlled or flattish outcome towards the end of the year. And so it's a number of factors that we have to keenly execute in order to keep, of course, the overall structure of our P&L in place, but that's the principal dynamic that we are following. And I hand over the employee engagement question to Brian."

As you can imagine, voluntary attrition in the quarter was 29%. But on a trailing 12-month basis, which is more how the industry tends to look at it, it was 18%. And we've seen primarily the attrition in the more junior levels of the organization or mid-levels in India, but it's also a global phenomenon. It's really one of the hottest markets we've seen or our team has seen over the last 10-plus years. So we're all dealing with it. As it happens in the last month, we had the results of our annual engagement survey. We're actually very pleased with our results. They're at or above, in many cases, industry benchmarks. I'm really pleased to see the delivery organization, engagement scores are actually above the company average, and they're very much as a total company in the same range as where we've been from 2016 and beyond.  
Last year, we actually had a particularly strong year, as many companies did, because of the pandemic when people were pleased when they had secure jobs or whatnot. So from one perspective, I feel very, very good about it. But in the same vein, of course, I don't feel very good about the attrition. And so that's top of mind, and it's got a lot of management focus.  
I'm pleased that we executed well in the quarter. We exceeded our revenue guidance despite elevated attrition, but my great hope is, over time, we can reduce attrition and yet continue to hire at the pace we have been hiring at, which is something we're very pleased with. The throughput of our recruitment team has been terrific. So what are we doing to reduce attrition and to continue to drive employee engagement is the next obvious question. 
Well, look, annual merit-based increases have been announced here in the last few weeks. They're effective October 1. That's on top of a whole host of ad hoc measures we played through in the course of the last year: out-of-cycle increases, promotion, retention dollars. We've announced a shift in the last few months to quarterly promotion cycles for billable resources. We've really fast-tracked job rotations and reskilling initiatives across the company, then a host of things with Cognizant Academy, which is our training capability, as well as higher education programs for select employees as well. And we've put an enormous effort behind our employee value proposition, celebrating delivery success, big wins, et cetera. So more work to be done, but I'm confident we're doing the right things.  
And as I said, while I'm pleased we executed through at this quarter, the reality is 15% revenue growth this quarter also gives the organization a little bit of energy that, look, growth is coming back and with growth comes good things in terms of career path opportunities, rotations and promotions and whatnot. So I'm sure today's top line story will help a lot of employees feel better, and we'll keep doing all the other things we're doing."

And so as we start thinking about this, of course, it gets into how we engage our clients and how we think about the demand signal that will help us facilitate the right resources at the right time. Communication is important in a time like this, setting appropriate expectations regarding resource availability time lines. Entity prioritization, Ashwin, as you can imagine, getting the right resources on our most strategic accounts is very much top of mind and part of our execution rigor we do now on a day in, day out basis.  
Regrettably, we just -- despite growing 15% in the quarter, we're yet unable to meet the full expectations of our own potential and what is out there in the market. So we're working through that as best we can and doing our best, as I said, to minimize attrition, whilst at the same time to maximize employee engagement and to maximize onboarding.  
As I said in my remarks, we'll bring on about 100,000 lateral hires this year alone. We'll train about 100,000 people, and we'll onboard about 30,000 freshers and we'll make offers to 45,000 freshers. Regardless of our attrition rate, we will still go through with those numbers because there is enough market demand for us to get after that opportunity. And that's what we're quite excited about. I think the portfolio is more compelling than ever before, and we've made huge progress in the last year to get after that market opportunity. So we're feeling pretty good about that. But it's a hot market, and I think you've heard that through the earnings cycle. So we're all dealing with the same problem."

It went through -- actually, at the end of last quarter, we thought we'd hit an apex and then it went up modestly, but it's -- we're expecting, and it's inherent in our guidance, elevated attritions to remain in the coming quarter, and we'll see what happens thereafter. It's a very -- as you can imagine, a hot market out there, and so it's very difficult to call. I think we're doing the right things to mitigate that. But rest assured, these levels of attrition and slightly beyond our inner guidance. 
With regards to bookings, look, I feel really good about our bookings, to be very honest. It's important to look at bookings not just on a weekly or a quarterly basis, but really on a trailing 12-month basis. And now we have rounded that 1-year period, so we have a good book-to-bill ratio over the last 12 months of 1.2x, which I think is very, very healthy. 
We look at it in terms of geographic. We look at it in terms of business mix. We look at it in terms of new and expansion versus renewals. And it's pretty solid across the board. And the pipeline is solid across the board as well. So I feel good about the market opportunity. Candidly, I don't think demand is the problem for this industry. I think it's a great time to be in services. It's more of a supply constraint at this moment in time. 
With regard to the sales, our commercial teams we brought on board. Look, they're ramping. I don't think we have full productivity. At this stage, we've got a lot of exercises underway to make sure we get true gearing ratios. But in the same vein, I feel as though we've got a client-facing team now that is better able to walk the corridors if and when we get back from COVID, virtually for now, and to cross-sell the entire portfolio. 
And if you think about our installed base, it's a huge asset for us and the opportunity is real. About 4 out of 10, or 40%, of our accounts, we only sell 1 of our practices into those, and we have 10-plus practices. So think about cross-sell as a huge opportunity for us. And of course, the M&A that we have conducted in the last 2 years, which is 100% aligned to our digital strategy, enables that cross-sell more than ever before. And indeed, cross-sell is core to the business case of those acquisitions. 
So we're pretty excited about what we can do there, both in terms of our installed base, which, of course, is a big priority for us. But we also have opportunity through this extended portfolio to get after new logos. And the Qualcomm example I cited in my script is a good example of that, where we're leading with digital. And accordingly, we'll try and cross-sell the nondigital business as well."

It was 28% or less than 30%, certainly at the end of 2018 for the year. And it's been very much part and parcel of what we're setting out to achieve. It's 44% of our mix today. 
Candidly, a numerator denominator comes into play. We actually had very good success this quarter, driving growth as well in our nondigital business, which has declined in 2019 and 2020. So candidly, that has slowed the digital mix ramping further, the share growth of nondigital this quarter. 
But overall, the digital business will continue to grow. I'd like to think as we get to the latter part of this year, we'll be up closer to 50%, and it will start becoming a bigger portion of our overall business over time. That's important for us because: a, it helps us be exposed to higher growth categories; but b, it increases our intimacy with the broader C-suite in our installed base of accounts, and that enables us to sell beyond the CTO organization into the CMO into the line of service leader, et cetera. 
Of the accounts that we have added in the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, the vast majority of the bookings exactly in what we would term digital. So Rod, that mix shift to digital will continue, and I'm pretty optimistic that we'll continue to see a nice ramp there. That is not just good for revenue or client intimacy, it's actually also very good for our margin rate as a company as well. So we feel as though we're doing the right things. Our M&A strategy is 100% behind this, and it puts us in a position to actually get after our installed base to cross-sell and upsell and actually get new logos and really become a challenger in the digital arena."

We are orienting our compensation, obviously, on market data and reflect -- our compensation moves really reflect an assessment about keeping Cognizant a competitive employer and recruiter in the marketplace. And we are very pleased actually with that. 
The ability to attract associates into the Cognizant family is great. We've been ranked in a variety of publications as really employer of choice, and particularly, in the critical market of India for us. So it will feather through country-specific and market-oriented based on wage developments in those countries. 
On the M&A program, we just talked about, I think, at the end of last year, about a capital allocation framework for the company, which about -- dedicates 50% of our cash flow to M&A for a reminder, about 25% used to offset the dilution of our equity compensation and 25% for dividends. And we use this framework not to position, but as a really good framework for us to execute our strategy. So going forward, I'm anticipating to spend within the range of that capital allocation framework to support the execution of our strategy. 
We remain focused in that M&A program on our strategic objectives and focus on our digital battlegrounds. You have seen in some of the acquisitions in the beginning of this year, that we may have, and it's with few transactions, hard to describe the trend, but there is a keen focus on executing and using the strategy also to help the globalization of Cognizant. 
And so you have seen with Servian earlier in the year, an acquisition in the Australian marketplace. We acquired ESG Mobility in the fatherland, my home country, which I was very happy about, really a leading provider on the Internet of Things, IoT, with keen leadership positions in the automotive sector. So there is more geographic diversion still needed for us. And so we'll adapt as we make progress on the positioning of our practices and our industry groups to the needs of the strategy.

Or is it just purely out of necessity, given what you said about demand and the timing of university hiring or maybe more work needs to be done on the training side to meet the type of work that needs to be done? I'm just trying to understand what's structural versus cyclical there."

One is addressing the attrition that we have and also getting after the market potential that we see. And so you go back to where is attrition greatest, it's at the mid-junior levels of the pyramid, particularly in India. But it's also in hot skills. And if you think about hot skills, think about hyperscalers, think about leading SaaS players, think about digital engineering, full stack engineers or across data, AI and ML. 
And so you find yourself in a situation where you've got a demand-supply imbalance, and that's an area as well where we're also going after lateral skills and trying to get them in as quickly as we can, whilst also trying to train and promote our internal employees as well. So it's a race for talent in a red hot market. And I anticipate, given how bullish I am in the market, and my sense is we'll have a resilient services, the main feature for the foreseeable future, I anticipate elevated attrition across the industry."

Look, the digital arena more holistically for us, it goes well beyond the 4 digital battlegrounds that I focused on when we joined, which were notably around cloud, around digital engineering, around applications and IoT and data and analytics, rather. 
The -- if you think about other areas that are not included in those so-called battlegrounds, things like digital experience continue to grow rapidly for us, and I'm very optimistic that, that becomes a core part of the sale, the whole user experience as you think about digital workflows. So it's broad-based. Digital engineering is something we prioritize. It's growing rapidly. As I said, it's one of our biggest growth potential units in the years ahead. Something that has scaled meaningfully in the last 2 years, and we're now one of the largest digital engineering companies in the world. 
We've complemented our capabilities with the acquisition of Softvision in 2018, and then in more recent years, Magenic and Tin Roof. I just feel very good about our potential there, but more broadly, there's just a lot of demand in this arena, and I just feel good about our potential because we're scaling, it's still a smaller portion of our mix. The more we scale, the higher company average CAGR. And as Jan has implied, it's good for our margin rate as well. So we're full speed ahead after the digital opportunity."

Good afternoon, everyone. We executed well in the third quarter, delivering revenue of $4.7 billion, up 11.8% year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Bookings growth, a key leading indicator, accelerated to 24% year-over-year growth",1386,"Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. We executed well in the third quarter, delivering revenue of $4.7 billion, up 11.8% year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Bookings growth, a key leading indicator, accelerated to 24% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x revenue on a trailing 12-month basis underscores our commercial momentum. 
I'm grateful to our teams around the world for their resourcefulness in meeting our client commitments despite a challenging labor market. We delivered solid sequential adjusted operating margin expansion in the third quarter as we offset the cost of increased hiring with cost discipline elsewhere. 
I'm also pleased with the progress against our key strategic initiatives. For example, third quarter digital revenue grew 18% year-over-year. Digital represents 44% of our overall revenue mix. We expect this percentage to grow in future periods, positioning Cognizant for both top line momentum and margin expansion. Moreover, the intimacy of our C-suite engagement increases as we serve clients in their digital transformations. 
Better-than-expected growth in our nondigital business impacted our digital mix progression, but is nonetheless a welcome outcome. During the third quarter, we saw continued strong top line momentum in our digital business operations practice, reflecting our differentiated offerings for digital natives, our BPaaS leadership position in health care, and our strength in intelligent process automation solutions. 
We recently announced Cognizant Neuro, a simpler and more effective way for clients to achieve the full potential of intelligent process automation and speed time to results. Everest Group, a leading industry analyst firm, recently recognized Cognizant Neuro as an exciting development to enable automation at scale.
Moving to industry segments. Financial Services' ongoing recovery continued with growth of 4.3% year-over-year in constant currency, in line with our expectations. We posted strong double-digit growth year-over-year in constant currency in Products and Resources and in Communications, Media and Technology. 
Within Products and Resources, we continue to deliver excellent growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities as well as across retail, consumer goods and travel and hospitality which have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. In Communications, Media and Technology, we continue to lead with our digital engineering capability to win transformation deals while leveraging our alliances to be a premier cloud transformation partner. 
In Healthcare, we had another solid quarter, achieving 9.8% constant currency growth. Momentum in life sciences continued. Demand across payers remain strong, and we're beginning to see an uptick in demand across providers as they look to digital technologies to help reduce operating costs and strengthen new channels for delivering care. 
Our products business saw continued double-digit growth in Q3. We're expanding our footprint in the health care market and adding new growth members on our platforms. We're also well underway with our digital transformation of our products, including the launch of our connected interoperability solutions to help clients provide secure, real-time data access and meet compliance deadlines. 
We're proud of the work we're doing in partnership with clients like Parkland Community Health Plan. Parkland was looking for better ways to meet the growing needs of its medically underserved populations in Texas and to better manage its health insurance claims, member transactions and network of physicians and hospitals. Our TriZetto QNX core administration platform delivered in a BPaaS model is enabling delivery of care management, claims processing, member services, provider services and quality on a single platform, thereby enhancing care coordination and member experiences. 
Our Healthcare business is a hugely strategic asset. I'm pleased with the progress we've made accelerating growth in health care. And I'm optimistic in our future prospects as health care companies modernize their business to address the need for enhanced client experiences, including virtual care solutions.
Let's turn now to strategy, including our digital ambitions. I remain bullish on both the macro demand environment and Cognizant's growing momentum in digital. Clients continue to accelerate their investment in digital operating models to improve their customer and employee experiences and modernize their operations through data, automation and cloud. While most companies have launched digital initiatives, few have made the shift to a fully digital operating model. 
Cognizant is now one of the few global firms that can serve clients across all stages of their digital transformation, from modernizing their technology foundation to implementing agile workflows. This is in part a result of investing approximately $3 billion in mergers and acquisitions over the past few years to broaden our portfolio while strengthening our relationships with hyperscalers and key partners. 
A good client example is Cabot Corporation, a global leader in specialty chemicals and performance materials, who recently engaged us to help transform their digital operating model. We'll be providing application development and maintenance as well as infrastructure and operation services and enabling Cabot to create an enhanced digital experience that drives value for its customers and employees. 
Scaling our international operations is another strategic priority. And during the third quarter, we grew bookings and revenue solidly in both Europe and Rest of World, with a highlight being 19% constant currency revenue growth in the United Kingdom. We remain optimistic on our international market prospects and aim to accelerate growth as we invest in our talent, brand, partnerships and operations. 
Global biopharma leader Sanofi has selected Cognizant as a strategic partner to deploy an omnichannel customer engagement model. This solution will enable their customer-facing teams to engage with health care professionals via new digital channels, provide them more personalized content and also suggest next best actions. Cognizant deployed a cloud-based CRM, integrated marketing automation and intelligence data platform to the first 18 markets in just 8 months. 
And for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the U.K. government's tax authority, we're providing broad technology expertise across its Pega technology stack and enabling Pega application development and operational support that will facilitate case management and customer service applications. 
Moving on now to the intensifying competition for talent across multiple industries. The demand/supply imbalance in our industry remains particularly acute. Third quarter voluntary attrition reached 33% on an annualized basis, or 24% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, when we measure attrition, we count the entire company, including trainees and corporates across IT services and BPO. 
Despite elevated attrition, we increased our net head count in Q3 by over 17,000 sequentially, which speaks to the tremendous work and effectiveness of our recruitment team. Given our focus in recent years on accelerating fresher hiring in India, we've made meaningful progress on addressing our pyramid. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make offers to 45,000 new graduates in India for onboarding in 2022. 
Retention and recruitment have our leadership's full attention. We are continuing our comprehensive program to support our associates' career growth and engagement through a range of initiatives that include committed annual increases and evolved approach to promotions; job boards so associates can easily explore open leadership roles company-wide; abundant new training and development programs, sustained communication with our commitment to belonging and inclusion across our company and to society more broadly; and the continuing pursuit of an ESG agenda, which shows a special [ meeting ] for our associates. 
To this point, earlier this year, we published our first ESG report and set out on a path to reduce our emissions and increase our energy efficiency. Last week, we announced Cognizant's commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We plan to achieve this net zero goal through ongoing investments in renewable energy, building on our initial success in India where 1/4 of our energy has come from renewable sources since 2020. We will also be investing in new energy-efficient technologies across our offices and data centers globally. In addition, we will extend our expertise in cloud, IoT and AI to help clients meet their sustainability goals.
In closing, while the industry faces an unprecedented competition for talent, during the third quarter, we attracted a record number of employees to Cognizant and stayed focused on delivering against our client commitments and our strategic repositioning. We are bullish on the industry and on our growing commercial momentum. 
Jan and I look forward to discussing Cognizant's future with you at our November 18 investor briefing. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you."

Our Q3 revenue was $4.7 billion, representing growth of approximately 12%, or 11% at constant currency. Revenue growth was led by digital, which grew 18% and represented 44% of total revenue for the quarter. 
As Brian mentioned earlier, our digital business operations practice area is also growing strongly. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 300 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions.
Moving on to segment results where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 4%, in line with our expectations. We continue to make steady progress as we reposition this business and have seen recent improvement in bookings and pipeline. We continue to expect modest growth for this segment for the full year. 
Healthcare revenue increased approximately 10%, again driven by strong performance in both our health care and life sciences businesses. Revenue growth within our Healthcare business was primarily organic, and demand for our integrated software solutions remains strong. We also remain very pleased with our life sciences business. which grew double digits organically year-over-year. 
Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 18%, driven by the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality also grew double digits year-over-year, with both sectors experiencing healthy demand for digital services as they recovery (sic) from the impact of the pandemic in 2020. Segment growth also included approximately 600 basis points from inorganic revenue. 
Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 19%, of which approximately 500 basis points of growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. Organic growth was led by our technology business, where our work with digital-native clients have continued to drive growth in our core portfolio. 
From a geographic perspective, North America grew approximately 10% year-over-year driven by demand from health care, life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and technology. Growth in North America also included the benefit of recently completed acquisitions across segments. 
Revenue outside of North America grew approximately 16% year-over-year in constant currency led by growth in the U.K. We're also experiencing strong growth in Germany and Australia driven in part our recently completed acquisitions of ESG Mobility and Servian, respectively. 
Now moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP operating margin was 15.4%, and adjusted operating margin was 15.8%. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact from the legal settlement which, if approved by the court, will resolve the previously disclosed 2016 securities transaction lawsuit. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin declined approximately 10 basis points. 
Continued elevated attrition resulted in higher subcontractor recruiting and other delivery costs. Additionally, our recently completed acquisitions negatively impacted our margin as we continue to invest in SG&A to drive and support organic revenue growth and modernize our core IT and securities infrastructure. These headwinds were partially offset by savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and 2021. 
Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 25.6%, and our adjusted tax rate was 26%, towards the high end of our full year guidance. Diluted GAAP EPS was $1.03, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.06.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion or net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow of -- in Q3 was $897 million, representing approximately 165% of net income and in line with our expectations. Year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion represents over 90% of net income. 
DSO of 72 days increased by 1 day sequentially and is flat with the prior year period. Management remains keenly focused on this metric as it is a key lever for free cash flow conversion in the future. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for $100 million under our share repurchase program and returned $127 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, in line with our previously disclosed capital allocation framework. 
During the quarter, we also spent cash of $57 million on acquisitions, bringing the year-to-date spend on acquisitions to over $700 million.
Turning to guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.79 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 14.5%, or 13.3% to 14.3% at constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a favorable 20 basis point impact, and inorganic contribution of approximately 310 basis points. As a reminder, Q4 2020 revenue was negatively impacted by the $107 million charge related to our proposed financial services contract exit, which is expected to benefit Q4 2021 year-over-year growth, compares by approximately 250 basis points. 
At the midpoint of our Q4 revenue outlook, we expect full year revenue of $18.5 billion, representing 11.1% growth, or 9.8% growth in constant currency. With that, we are guiding towards the high end of our prior full year guidance. Our outlook assumes currency will have a favorable 130 basis points impact and includes 330 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. Our guidance also assumes continued momentum across health care, CMT and Products and Resources and a modest growth in Financial Services for the full year.
Moving on to margins. Our full year adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged at approximately 15.4%. As I mentioned earlier, elevated attrition is leading to increased costs in certain areas, including recruiting and subcontractor costs in addition to higher wages for lateral hires. We also continue to invest significantly in our people through increased compensation, growing quarterly promotions for billable associates, and training. As a reminder, our annual merit increase for the majority of our associates is effective October 1. This will impact our Q4 margin and implies a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin from Q3. To partially offset these headwinds, we continue to moderate the pace of our nonstrategic SG&A spend. 
This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4.02 to $4.06 compared to the $4 to $4.06 previously. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of approximately $30 million compared to $25 million to $30 million previously. 
Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 528 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Both share count and tax rates are unchanged from our prior outlook. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year.
With that, we will open the call for your questions."

We knew going into the quarter it would remain elevated. We expect going into the fourth quarter, it will also remain elevated. However",354,"Tien-Tsin, it's Brian, and I'll pass it to Jan maybe directly after this.
So look first of all, attrition is elevated. We knew going into the quarter it would remain elevated. We expect going into the fourth quarter, it will also remain elevated. However, we do expect some modest declines in attrition rate, and that is healthy. We look naturally at resignations on a daily basis. So we think, as we've hopefully shown in the course of the year, we understand what's going on and what to expect from an attrition point of view. Clearly, while the headline number is high when you apply the rate of attrition to more industry standard definitions such as a trailing 12-month basis, but we think we're more in line with the industry in the low 20s. 
As I think about this, we've spent a tremendous amount of effort to try to address that, both hearts and minds as well as compensation. Hearts and minds has less of an impact on margin compensation though. So just when we think about hearts and minds, we're thinking about a sense of belongingness, celebrating success, career path discussions, training and development, and making sure that we have processes in place where people can actually get promoted more readily internally. And so we've made a series of adjustments to internal processes to facilitate that. 
We've also really embraced the bottom of the pyramid after a few slower years between 2017 and '19. Our what we call Gen C or fresher intake has increased meaningfully, and that is also helping our pyramid and our ability to have upward promotion capabilities this year. As we said in our prepared remarks, we'll have 25,000 offers. 
So I feel pretty good about what we're doing from an attrition point of view. The reality is however, we're in an industry that is facing unprecedented competition for talent. And we continue to see attrition in the same areas as we talked about previously, namely [ hot ] skills as well as the bottom of the pyramid. On pricing and on margin implications, I'll pass you to Jan."

Maybe I'll start with the gross margin in the third quarter, which was relatively consistent to prior year. And there are obviously a lot of ins and outs. And clearly, we observed the impact of increased compensation on to the thing (sic), but we had also positive effects. Like for example, a modest shift in our digital revenues is helping us overall acceleration of revenue growth has been a factor of helping our gross margin. And a lot of in and out in compare year-over-year because of the COVID situation. 
So we should expect in the fourth quarter, pressure on our gross margins because we're implementing our compensation increase for the vast majority of our associates and have implemented October 1. So you do see some pressure in the gross margin in the fourth quarter. And clearly, we're kind of working on all elements of curtailing that, but I think you will see net pressure. 
Pricing, I wanted to -- 2 comments before I pass it back to Brian. You know, of course, that the pricing takes some time to implement since clients have longer-term contracts. But when we -- when I observe in particular our digital business, I think I can say that our clients start to really see the value that Cognizant is delivering and understand the value that we can bring to So we're pleasantly satisfied. We're really happy with the situation that our core thesis about our strategy, the shift to digital, driving higher gross margin is holding and helping us over the medium term on the gross margin side. Back to you, Brian."

I think the implications of digital is, of course, important from a pricing point of view. But also the competitors against which we're going up enables us to be a very strong challenger brand. And so we have pricing, I would say, accretion as opposed to dilution. 
And then just one other important point, over the last few years, many people have asked me how I think about structured deals or capital takeouts. We've naturally heavily embraced digital, and our growth rate in digital has been twice that of the industry over the last 2 years. 
One of the benefits of digital is, of course, the smaller contract duration to get with it, given the nature of the work you're performing, which ensures we haven't actually been locked into multiyear pricing dimensions as part of a 5- or an 8-year contract. So that's actually, in a strange way, turned out to be quite favorable for us going forward. But all of this is heavy lifting, we have to get right in the quarters ahead, but we feel as though we're on the right track."

I agree, it does seem to be unprecedented attrition. But I'm wondering what slows it. You've talked about specific steps that Cognizant is taking, but it's clearly an industry problem. 
And the other side is does it require a slowdown in revenues across Cognizant and its competitors in order for attrition to come down? But I'm just wondering what are some of the industry forces that might help alleviate some of this pressure? 
And then Brian, I'll just go ahead and ask my second question since they're related. As you're facing such unprecedented attrition, how do you think about the trade-offs that you need to make related to growth versus margins as you look out over the next couple of quarters or even the next year?"
386024,1684738662,2414697,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Keith, so let me start with the second question, given it's fresh in mind. Look, we've already started making some of those trade-offs on growth versus margins. I think the reality is I'm delighted with our team.

Look, we've already started making some of those trade-offs on growth versus margins. I think the reality is I'm delighted with our team. And our recruitment engine was really executing extremely well in the last few quarters, and we'll continue to execute well going forward. And hence, we've had a net head count increase sequentially of 17,000 by the way, which excludes subcontractors, which also grew. 
But the reality is we don't have enough head count to fulfill our potential. And therefore, we've been faced with choice points: which clients to serve; which deals to chase, where we walk away; where we're willing to make pricing. Stances that may put a deal at risk, but it's the appropriate thing to do, given the demand/supply imbalance. So that is already underway. Keith. 
I will say in the same vein, we're really delighted with the commercial momentum we have bookings growth of 24% in the quarter, which brings year-to-date up to mid-teens. On the back of mid-teens bookings growth last year, tells me that we have actually really turned the corner in terms of commercial momentum. 
So those trade-offs are underway. I'd like nothing more to accelerate hiring from current levels, so that we can really fulfill against our true potential. But at this moment in time despite all the net adds, and they were at record levels in the quarter, we have enough attrition, as does the rest of the industry, to mitigate that. 
With regards to the first question around the industry forces that will alleviate attrition, look, it's a very difficult question to answer. The reality is I don't see an immediate line of sight to this. I foresee elevated attrition in the industry in the coming quarters. I think the only winner in times like this is the actual individual employees because companies like us don't win from this, clients don't win from this. And as such, hopefully, this will right itself over time. 
And hence, our focus, both much as a compensation work stream, but we stood up a war room from a retention point of view about 9 months ago at this stage. And we spent an extraordinary amount of time on the hearts and minds angle. And I personally now spend an hour per day with groups of 5 or 6 employees that are deep into the organization to make sure we're hearing them out, understanding what's in their mind, validating that they understand what we're up to. 
I will say I like the fact that we're back to double-digit growth more sustainably. Because that helps us get a little bit more swagger back in Cognizant, and obviously it demonstrates an ability for us to [ stand to ] to our clients, as much as our clients are employees, and talk about the fact that they will have career advancement opportunities and we will have gross margin opportunities to invest in their careers and training and development, et cetera. 
So time will tell what's going to happen over time, but we really -- we're doing what we can do. And core to that is also the, let's say, the reinvigoration of our fresher program, which had stalled. But I think at this stage, we're starting to get our pyramid back into the right shape after a few years of being off kilter."

Because we very often spend a lot of time on one of our other strategic postures, which is around accelerating our digital footprint, which is relevant not just on a total corporation level but also internationally. So g",523,"Yes, it's a great question, Rod. Because we very often spend a lot of time on one of our other strategic postures, which is around accelerating our digital footprint, which is relevant not just on a total corporation level but also internationally. 
So getting our international capabilities is something I'm 100% focused on. Today, it's just 26% of our revenue. And so if you think about our footprint internationally, our brand internationally and our operations, they're in need of scaling. And it's not just revenue scaling, but it's also our delivery capabilities overseas, both in terms of nearshore and onshore that will enable our shift to digital, but also I would say it's very core to our desire to build out a global delivery network where we can provide greater business continuity capabilities for our clients as well. 
We're executing well against those initiatives. We've hired, largely refreshed a lot of the international leadership team; very senior hires in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Japan, Nordic. The people we've targeted are well connected into the local industry. They understand the local market. 
And I would say the impact of that is now becoming more and more evident, not just in strong revenue growth in the third quarter but also in year-to-date this year across Australia, U.K., Germany in particular. But also as I think about the bookings momentum we have internationally, the year-to-date and Q3 bookings on our international businesses is well above the company average. 
Now those people are bringing followership, both from a client point of view as well as from an employee point of view, our ability to attract talent relevant there. But they also give me confidence that I'm investing M&A dollars behind senior leaders who will take post-merger integration activities seriously. And as you've seen in the last -- earlier part of this year, we acquired Servian in Australia and New Zealand and ESG Mobility in Germany. And so it goes back to having confidence in the team and having a team who take their responsibilities seriously and a team that's fundamentally connected into partnership ecosystem as well as the client network. 
Where we are different internationally, -- but Rod, I expect we will continue to double that in that arena too, is the notion of industry alignment. We're very strong from an industry perspective in North America. Healthcare is obviously a great example of that in the payer provider space. But as we scale into Europe and Asia, our largest country is the U.K  where we are aligned by industry. But actually, some of the country leaders that we've hired now are embracing more of an industry alignment in those countries as well. Perhaps not across all industries in every country, but there are major industries that we are aligning behind. And I think that is the way to go to get after these market opportunities internationally. 
So not just am I expecting, Rod, to maintain this level of growth, my hope is to accelerate our growth internationally in the years ahead. And we'll certainly talk more about that on November 18 at the investor summit."

So if I focus on digital, the nature of the work we do ends up positioning us against smaller contract durations. And from my perspective, I agree with the inference in your question. This is a resource-constrained environment. And putting valuable resources against digital is much more interesting for me than putting them against captive or structured deals, where you may have an apples-to-orange compare for 1 year or 2, but thereafter you're in a book of business that you have to work very hard to grow. 
I will say when I think about our bookings, our win rates and our pipeline, I have nothing but good thoughts. Bookings were balanced by industry, by geography. If I think about even within the digital work we are doing, we have actually seen a little more momentum in the 50 million plus category on a year-over-year basis, and I expect that to continue in the fourth quarter as well. That's different from $500 million or $1 billion deals, but these are very healthy digital-type deals for us. 
And all of this has led us to be in a position now, with bookings growth of 24% year-over-year in Q3 to have a book-to-bill ratio that is now solidly in the 1.2 range. So I feel good about that. 
I will say for the CEO, the enemy is when you have clients that are indecisive. That is not the case at this moment in time, pipeline velocity is strong. It's fast. That's why I feel very good about our position. I think the strategic choices we made a number of years ago were the right choices. We're executing against that. I think we'll bear the fruit of that labor in the coming years."

And the finance organization was really laser focused in supporting those 4 strategic priorities that Brian has been talking about. 
To give you examples, when you scale and expand your sales force and distribution capabilities, more effective measures on the effectiveness and results of that sales force are required. And I think you have seen this with improving disclosure in our bookings growth. So you just see the surface of the effort that's behind that to drive improved transparency, not only for us but also for the Street. 
Similar initiatives have been underway for supporting our pricing analytics capability relative to driving relevance to clients and ensuring that we deliver value to our clients, et cetera, throughout [indiscernible] to all expense, all initiatives, what we're doing.

And that's how I measure ourselves really in the end: can we fulfill the financial commitments that we made to our shareholders in terms of fulfilling our expectations? That has brought out, with a lot of work pretty well I think, particularly in the last half year here where we have faced really the changed industry with high attrition rates.

But then beyond that, we have some of the traditional partners we've had for years, some of which were stronger than others, the Oracles, the SAPs, [ ISVs ] of the world. But we certainly got a huge focus as well on what I would call next-generation leaders, companies like ServiceNow, companies like Salesforce, Workday. 
As a reminder, in the last 1.5 years, we acquired Collaborative Solutions to scale a Workday practice. We've also done 3 acquisitions in Salesforce. So we have meaningfully changed our position with Salesforce. I was in a recent [ cube here ] with the Salesforce leadership team, and they were seeing our phrases in terms of how our position in Salesforce has exponentially grown. And then we'll continue to do acquisitions in those areas as well that are aligned to our higher-growth categories. 
[indiscernible] has put up 3 business groups behind hyperscalers. So it's not lip service. It is true organizations. We take it very seriously. I actually see the hyperscalers now focusing more and more towards industry alignment. And Cognizant's historic strength, particularly in health care and financial services, is naturally of interest to those. 
Now there are individual cases where you have industry-specific plays. It could be Pega, Guidewire, Caminos, Duck Creek, et cetera. Naturally, they are relevant to individual industries within Cognizant, but on a more horizontal nature [ than ] the companies I've referenced. 
And then of course in our operations business, which I'm very proud of, which has done a fantastic job over the last 2 years as we've exited content moderation, and frankly got the business back to mid- to high teens growth, they have very strong partnerships across some of the IPA players, in particular Automation Anywhere, UiPath, Blue Prism, et cetera."

I want to be careful in giving you too much detail that it was going to be hard to interpret over time. But of the margin pressure that we have seen through the growth in the SG&A, approximately 50% or so is due to M&A activity. This could be upfront deal cost. This could be deal-related expenses and higher SG&A load that some of the M&A transactions carry within. So that has been a meaningful pressure for us, let's say, maybe in the range of 100, around 100 basis points or so. 
And then the rest of the pressure that we have seen is kind of split evenly between 3 major areas, I would say. Area #1 is our IT modernization. That's clearly starting to stabilize, and that has put pressure on it. We had investments into our HR and recruiting organization in order to scale our hiring activity. 
And thirdly, our investments into our sales force and marketing capabilities. Those will be kind of roughly in even buckets, I think, is a fair amount to say. And some of those are now starting to anniversary, that's kind of what we're starting to anticipate, and plateau. We do not want to reduce those expenses obviously, because they are important to us. But we have found, I think, levels that are allowing us to have a more moderated SG&A development going forward. 
You will see more detail around that, obviously, in our November meeting. But the third quarter is a little bit of an indication of what's happening basically. Because we had still growth in these strategic investment areas, but we have started to curtail growth in more traditional SG&A areas to offset that. And you can see that the curve has started to end a little bit. More work to be done, but it really developed, as I would have expected, in the third quarter."

One of the bigger ones from a weighted impact is actually our business operation, digital business operations business, which has been growing in the strong teens. Within that, we have elements that are -- we classify as digital and are in our digital mix, and there are elements that we don't classify as digital. We have tended to be quite disciplined. We changed the definition of digital over 2 years ago at this stage, and we've maintained that ever since. 
But there are other areas, including a nondigital element of our AI and analytics portfolio. Again, we're being disciplined. There are elements that we use digital, and elements that we view as more traditional. That's business intelligence, et cetera. And then on top of that, we have elements within some of our enterprise applications business and CIS business that have grown as well. 
Our goal, to be very honest, on a multiyear basis is to mitigate the risk of the clients in the nondigital business and then hopefully maintain some growth in the nondigital business. If we manage to do that, which requires us to be very disciplined from a pricing, from a renewal point of view, that will frankly complement what we expect to be very strong growth in digital. And therefore, it's good news for the entire corporation. 
But at this moment in time, that is something that I think you've seen in [ competitive earnings ] as well. If you extrapolate the digital growth they have versus the total company growth, particularly for those who suggest have a very -- a large portion of the revenue that is digital, you will be able to surely extrapolate that they are seeing declines in their legacy businesses."

So I'm wondering on the control around SG&A, and I know you've kind of addressed this. But I'm wondering, is there a point at which trying to control for those margins, et cetera, starts to cut into the proverbial muscle? And I think Jan, you mentioned a few areas where you've shown improvement. But are you all the way where you want to be in areas like recruiting, et cetera, so that you really can continue to march forward even if you're controlling, a little bit more judiciously, expenses?"

So we've seen momentum organically, and we see -- we want to continue with our capital allocation program as we have announced it. 
So the acceleration of revenue growth is front and center in our view. We have ample of opportunity. And as such, we have made decisions to, of course, support the opportunities that we promise to our clients with staffing. So HR will be funded as needed. And we're actually very proud about the amount of scaling that we achieved and the amount of change in policy of accelerating the hiring of pressures, optimizing our pyramid, scaling training programs. 
At our size, it's a really important and complicated effort that, that team executed well. And I will, of course, or the company will provide the funding for that. That is part of our growth engine. 
But there are other elements that need themselves more natural to scale, certain IT components, certain marketing components, certain finance and classic support functions in the SG&A do lend themselves for scaling. And we're going to continue to fund, obviously, our sales force. 
In the distribution area, I'm actually pretty pleased. We have a good combination of growth in resources, but also of improvement in productivity in those sales forces. And we're -- we have been busy at work to optimize our go-to-market strategies. And I think we have more opportunities in that space, but also we will be funding our organic growth appropriately to capture those opportunities. So I am not too religious here relative to what the exact percentage growth of SG&A is, but you get the philosophy kind of in my answer."

But to be a little bit more forthcoming, obviously, the decisions of the return to work are going to be affected by really a myriad of factors: our client needs, our associates' preferences, the health situation by country. And it is really dynamic. So we are evaluating this basically on a monthly basis. And at the current point, we are still, as our competitors are, largely in a virtual environment, which has worked actually pretty well for us. 
So we are planning to think about this as a strategic opportunity that meets the needs of all those stakeholders going forward. And I have to say that is it's a work in progress that we're really evaluating. And it will be a gradual decision to the new business model. It will be different than the historic business model."

Most of the senior changes are [indiscernible] I would view it to be very much in business as usual, these things, retirements, internal promotions performance orientation. But this is kind of classic Fortune 200 company land at this stage. And I've got to say I'm delighted with the leadership team we have around us these days. We've -- we're getting back into a growth trajectory after a few years where our backlog and our pipeline hasn't been -- and bookings haven't been as strong as they needed to be. And I think you see a united leadership team here orienting the company towards an evolved business model, both geographically as well as the offerings that we ultimately solution and deliver. 
So that's not a concern of mine anymore. And of course, there will always be press articles about the individuals. With a company with 320,000 employees, please don't get distracted by that. I'm not. 
With regards to digital, of course, it all depends on the portion of the portfolio you look at. Our digital growth is 18% within our portfolio. If I look at our digital engineering business, our growth rate is equivalent to the pure plays that are announcing their results. If I look at our IoT business, the digital growth is as fast as the pure plays out there. The same for our cloud business or digital experience business.
So as I said, we try to be extremely disciplined in the definition of digital. And in many ways, we've penalized ourselves. But as a broader company within the categories we look at, and I'll talk a little bit to this in the November Investor Summit, we have some gems in our portfolio that are growing at significant rates. And ultimately, that will continue to drive the growth rate of the company forward. 
A little bit, the mix shift these last few quarters that has been hanging around in the mid-40s. It's somewhat reflective of numerator/denominator where the nondigital business has actually had some better growth than anticipated."

We've been quite intentional and being restrictive in what is digital. Included in our digital business is our TriZetto platform business, which is growing at a very healthy double-digit pace these days. Significantly up from prior years, but it's not growing at the rate of maybe a digital engineering company pure play because it's not at all the same business or business model. So it's important to recognize that everybody's definition of digital and what is within that differs. 
I would say I'm very pleased with our momentum in digital. We can always do better. We strive to do better. But our exposure to digital exposes us to higher-growth categories as a corporation, ultimately higher-margin categories as a corporation. It puts us up against a different set of competitors where we have pricing dynamics that will be favorable for Cognizant's pricing. 
And ultimately, most importantly for me, it makes us much more relevant to clients, because we are becoming much more intimate with them as we become part of their transformation journey. And as I go around and speak to clients around the world when we articulate our strategy and what we're doing and start sharing some of the references we have, invariably clients are very open to proceeding with meeting to better understand what we have today, have optionality versus some of the incumbents. 
So I feel ultimately that we're in the right spaces. We will continue to double down. Of course, there are certain industries where digital is a higher portion of our mix than others. And there are certain geographies where I want to accelerate our digital capabilities. Not just back to Rod's question earlier, the international markets where our digital mix is lower than it needs to be, because historically we spent a lot more of our focus on structured deals in those geographies; but also the delivery capabilities, both nearshore and onshore, to fulfill any demand that we create in our commercial teams internationally. We need to further extend our capabilities there. And we're working on a number of things that hopefully we can announce in the foreseeable future, that we'll -- hope to give you confidence that we're doing to writing in that regard as well."

And ample opportunities to expand those things for the long run, but at least we're seeing in our numbers really the results of exactly what we wanted the strategy to be."

Or just across data, AI and ML technologies, I mean we're seeing significant attrition in those areas. 
It's just a hot labor market. It's extremely consistent, I think, in the commentary you've seen from our peers in the industry. And as I said earlier, we're working very hard to mitigate that. 
We do expect attrition to fall sequentially on a year-over-year basis from where it is in Q3, based on the net resignations we've seen and based on what we're seeing following the efforts we've had around hearts and minds and compensation. But at this moment in time, we're still anticipating elevated attrition in the coming years. 
And to the question that we received earlier, we're funding in our P&L what it takes to mitigate that, those compensation measures as well as our recruitment team, who've been doing an incredible job for us. And frankly, we expect to meaningfully scale our head count in the coming year.

Good afternoon, everyone. We executed well in the third quarter, delivering revenue of $4.7 billion, up 11.8% year-over-year or 11% in constant currency.

We executed well in the third quarter, delivering revenue of $4.7 billion, up 11.8% year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Bookings growth, a key leading indicator, accelerated to 24% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x revenue on a trailing 12-month basis underscores our commercial momentum. 
I'm grateful to our teams around the world for their resourcefulness in meeting our client commitments despite a challenging labor market. We delivered solid sequential adjusted operating margin expansion in the third quarter as we offset the cost of increased hiring with cost discipline elsewhere. 
I'm also pleased with the progress against our key strategic initiatives. For example, third quarter digital revenue grew 18% year-over-year. Digital represents 44% of our overall revenue mix. We expect this percentage to grow in future periods, positioning Cognizant for both top line momentum and margin expansion. Moreover, the intimacy of our C-suite engagement increases as we serve clients in their digital transformations. 
Better-than-expected growth in our nondigital business impacted our digital mix progression, but is nonetheless a welcome outcome. During the third quarter, we saw continued strong top line momentum in our digital business operations practice, reflecting our differentiated offerings for digital natives, our BPaaS leadership position in health care, and our strength in Intelligent Process Automation solutions. 
We recently announced Cognizant Neuro, a simpler and more effective way for clients to achieve the full potential of Intelligent Process Automation and speed time to results. Everest Group, a leading industry analyst firm, recently recognized Cognizant Neuro as an exciting development to enable automation at scale.
Moving to industry segments. Financial Services' ongoing recovery continued with growth of 4.3% year-over-year in constant currency, in line with our expectations. We posted strong double-digit growth year-over-year in constant currency in Products and Resources and in Communications, Media and Technology. 
Within Products and Resources, we continue to deliver excellent growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities as well as across retail, consumer goods and travel and hospitality, which have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. In Communications, Media and Technology, we continue to lead with our digital engineering capability to win transformation deals while leveraging our alliances to be a premier cloud transformation partner. 
In Healthcare, we had another solid quarter, achieving 9.8% constant currency growth. Momentum in life sciences continued. Demand across payers remain strong, and we're beginning to see an uptick in demand across providers as they look to digital technologies to help reduce operating costs and strengthen new channels for delivering care. 
Our Products business saw continued double-digit growth in Q3. We're expanding our footprint in the health care market and adding new growth members on our platforms. We're also well underway with our digital transformation of our products, including the launch of our connected interoperability solutions to help clients provide secure, real-time data access and meet compliance deadlines. 
We're proud of the work we're doing in partnership with clients like Parkland Community Health Plan. Parkland was looking for better ways to meet the growing needs of its medically underserved populations in Texas and to better manage its health insurance claims, member transactions and network of physicians and hospitals. Our TriZetto QNXT core administration platform, delivered in a BPaaS model, is enabling delivery of care management, claims processing, member services, provider services and quality on a single platform, thereby enhancing care coordination and member experiences. 
Our Healthcare business is a hugely strategic asset. I'm pleased with the progress we've made accelerating growth in health care. And I'm optimistic in our future prospects as health care companies modernize their business to address the need for enhanced client experiences, including virtual care solutions.
Let's turn now to strategy, including our digital ambitions. I remain bullish on both the macro demand environment and Cognizant's growing momentum in digital. Clients continue to accelerate their investment in digital operating models to improve their customer and employee experiences and modernize their operations through data, automation and cloud. While most companies have launched digital initiatives, few have made the shift to a fully digital operating model. 
Cognizant is now one of the few global firms that can serve clients across all stages of their digital transformation, from modernizing their technology foundation to implementing agile workflows. This is, in part, a result of investing approximately $3 billion in mergers and acquisitions over the past few years to broaden our portfolio while strengthening our relationships with hyperscalers and key partners. 
A good client example is Cabot Corporation, a global leader in specialty chemicals and performance materials, who recently engaged us to help transform their digital operating model. We'll be providing application development and maintenance as well as infrastructure and operation services, and enabling Cabot to create an enhanced digital experience that drives value for its customers and employees. 
Scaling our international operations is another strategic priority. And during the third quarter, we grew bookings and revenue solidly in both Europe and Rest of World, with a highlight being 19% constant currency revenue growth in the United Kingdom. We remain optimistic on our international market prospects and aim to accelerate growth as we invest in our talent, brand, partnerships and operations. 
Global biopharma leader Sanofi has selected Cognizant as a strategic partner to deploy an omnichannel customer engagement model. This solution will enable their customer-facing teams to engage with health care professionals via new digital channels, provide them more personalized content and also suggest next best actions. Cognizant deployed a cloud-based CRM, integrated marketing automation and intelligence data platform to the first 18 markets in just 8 months. And for Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs, the U.K. government's tax authority, we're providing broad technology expertise across its Pega technology stack and enabling Pega application development and operational support that will facilitate case management and customer service applications. 
Moving on now to the intensifying competition for talent across multiple industries. The demand/supply imbalance in our industry remains particularly acute. Third quarter voluntary attrition reached 33% on an annualized basis or 24% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, when we measure attrition, we count the entire company, including trainees and corporates across IT services and BPO. Despite elevated attrition, we increased our net headcount in Q3 by over 17,000 sequentially, which speaks to the tremendous work and effectiveness of our recruitment team. Given our focus in recent years on accelerating fresher hiring in India, we've made meaningful progress on addressing our pyramid. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make offers to 45,000 new graduates in India for onboarding in 2022. 
Retention and recruitment have our leadership's full attention. We are continuing our comprehensive program to support our associates' career growth and engagement through a range of initiatives that include committed annual increases and evolved approach to promotions; job boards so associates can easily explore open leadership roles company-wide; abundant new training and development programs, sustained communication with our commitment to belonging and inclusion across our company and to society more broadly; and the continuing pursuit of an ESG agenda, which shows special meaning for our associates. 
To this point, earlier this year, we published our first ESG report and set out on a path to reduce our emissions and increase our energy efficiency. Last week, we announced Cognizant's commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We plan to achieve this net zero goal through ongoing investments in renewable energy, building on our initial success in India where 1/4 of our energy has come from renewable sources since 2020. We will also be investing in new energy-efficient technologies across our offices and data centers globally. In addition, we will extend our expertise in cloud, IoT and AI to help clients meet their sustainability goals.
In closing, while the industry faces an unprecedented competition for talent, during the third quarter, we attracted a record number of employees to Cognizant and stayed focused on delivering against our client commitments and our strategic repositioning. We are bullish on the industry and on our growing commercial momentum. 
Jan and I look forward to discussing Cognizant's future with you at our November 18 investor briefing. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you."

Our Q3 revenue was $4.7 billion, representing growth of approximately 12%, or 11% at constant currency. Revenue growth was led by digital, which grew 18% and represented 44% of total revenue for the quarter. As Brian mentioned earlier, our digital business operations practice area is also growing strongly. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 300 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions.
Moving on to segment results where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 4%, in line with our expectations. We continue to make steady progress as we reposition this business and have seen recent improvement in bookings and pipeline. We continue to expect modest growth for this segment for the full year. 
Healthcare revenue increased approximately 10%, again driven by strong performance in both our health care and life sciences businesses. Revenue growth within our Healthcare business was primarily organic, and demand for our integrated software solutions remains strong. We also remain very pleased with our life sciences business, which grew double digits organically year-over-year. 
Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 18%, driven by the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality also grew double digits year-over-year, with both sectors experiencing healthy demand for digital services as they recovered from the impact of the pandemic in 2020. Segment growth also included approximately 600 basis points from inorganic revenue. 
Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 19%, of which approximately 500 basis points of growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. Organic growth was led by our technology business, where our work with digital-native clients have continued to drive growth in our core portfolio. 
From a geographic perspective, North America grew approximately 10% year-over-year, driven by demand from health care, life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and technology. Growth in North America also included the benefit of recently completed acquisitions across segments. 
Revenue outside of North America grew approximately 16% year-over-year in constant currency led by growth in the U.K. We're also experiencing strong growth in Germany and Australia, driven in part by our recently completed acquisitions of ESG Mobility and Servian, respectively. 
Now moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP operating margin was 15.4%, and adjusted operating margin was 15.8%. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact from the legal settlement which, if approved by the court, will resolve the previously disclosed 2016 securities class action lawsuit. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin declined approximately 10 basis points. 
Continued elevated attrition resulted in higher subcontractor recruiting and other delivery costs. Additionally, our recently completed acquisitions negatively impacted our margin as we continue to invest in SG&A to drive and support organic revenue growth and modernize our core IT and securities infrastructure. These headwinds were partially offset by savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and 2021. 
Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 25.6%, and our adjusted tax rate was 26%, towards the high end of our full year guidance. Diluted GAAP EPS was $1.03, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.06.
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion or net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow of -- in Q3 was $897 million, representing approximately 165% of net income and in line with our expectations. Year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion represents over 90% of net income. 
DSO of 72 days increased by 1 day sequentially and is flat with the prior year period. Management remains keenly focused on this metric as it is a key lever for free cash flow conversion in the future. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for $100 million under our share repurchase program and returned $127 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, in line with our previously disclosed capital allocation framework. During the quarter, we also spent cash of $57 million on acquisitions, bringing the year-to-date spend on acquisitions to over $700 million.
Turning to guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.79 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 14.5%, or 13.3% to 14.3% at constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a favorable 20 basis point impact, and inorganic contribution of approximately 310 basis points. As a reminder, Q4 2020 revenue was negatively impacted by the $107 million charge related to our proposed financial services contract exit, which is expected to benefit Q4 2021 year-over-year growth, compares by approximately 250 basis points. 
At the midpoint of our Q4 revenue outlook, we expect full year revenue of $18.5 billion, representing 11.1% growth, or 9.8% growth in constant currency. With that, we are guiding towards the high end of our prior full year guidance. Our outlook assumes currency will have a favorable 130 basis points impact and includes 330 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. Our guidance also assumes continued momentum across health care, CMT and Products and Resources and a modest growth in Financial Services for the full year.
Moving on to margins. Our full year adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged at approximately 15.4%. As I mentioned earlier, elevated attrition is leading to increased costs in certain areas, including recruiting and subcontractor costs in addition to higher wages for lateral hires. We also continue to invest significantly in our people through increased compensation, rolling quarterly promotions for billable associates, and training. As a reminder, our annual merit increase for the majority of our associates is effective October 1. This will impact our Q4 margin and implies a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin from Q3. To partially offset these headwinds, we continue to moderate the pace of our nonstrategic SG&A spend. 
This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4.02 to $4.06 compared to the $4 to $4.06 previously. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of approximately $30 million compared to $25 million to $30 million previously. 
Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 528 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Both share count and tax rates are unchanged from our prior outlook. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year.
With that, we will open the call for your questions."

So look, first of all, attrition is elevated. We knew going into the quarter it would remain elevated. We expect going into the fourth quarter, it will also remain elevated. However, we do expect some modest declines in attrition rate, and that is healthy. We look naturally at resignations on a daily basis. We think, as we've hopefully shown in the course of the year, we understand what's going on and what to expect from an attrition point of view. Clearly, while the headline number is high when you apply the rate of attrition to more industry standard definitions such as a trailing 12-month basis, but we think we're more in line with the industry in the low 20s. 
As I think about this, we've spent a tremendous amount of effort to try to address that, both hearts and minds as well as compensation. Hearts and minds has less of an impact on margin compensation, though. So just when we think about hearts and minds, we're thinking about a sense of belongingness, celebrating success, career path discussions, training and development, and making sure that we have processes in place where people can actually get promoted more readily internally. And so we've made a series of adjustments to internal processes to facilitate that. 
We've also really embraced the bottom of the pyramid after a few slower years between 2017 and '19. Our what we call Gen C or fresher intake has increased meaningfully, and that is also helping our pyramid and our ability to have upward promotion capabilities this year. As we said in our prepared remarks, we'll add 45,000 offers. 
So I feel pretty good about what we're doing from an attrition point of view. The reality is, however, we're in an industry that is facing unprecedented competition for talent. And we continue to see attrition in the same areas as we talked about previously, namely hot skills as well as the bottom of the pyramid. 
On pricing and on margin implications, I'll pass you to Jan."

Maybe I'll start with the gross margin in the third quarter, which was relatively consistent to prior year. And there are obviously a lot of ins and outs. And clearly, we observed the impact of increased compensation onto the thing, but we had also positive effects like, for example, a modest shift in our digital revenues is helping us. Overall, acceleration of revenue growth has been a factor of helping our gross margin. And a lot of in and out in compare year-over-year because of the COVID situation. 
So we should expect in the fourth quarter, pressure on our gross margins because we're implementing our compensation increase for the vast majority of our associates of have implemented October 1. So you do see some pressure in the gross margin in the fourth quarter. And clearly, we're kind of working on all elements of curtailing that, but I think you will see net pressure. 
Pricing, I wanted to do 2 comments before I pass it back to Brian. You know, of course, that the pricing takes some time to implement since clients have longer-term contracts. But when we -- when I observe in particular our digital business, I think I can say that our clients start to really see the value that Cognizant is delivering and understand the value that we can bring to. So we're pleasantly satisfied. We're really happy with the situation that our core thesis about our strategy, the shift to digital, driving higher gross margin is holding and helping us over the medium term on the gross margin side. 
Back to you, Brian."

I think the implications of digital is, of course, important from a pricing point of view, but also the competitors against which we're going up enables us to be a very strong challenger brand. And so we have pricing, I would say, accretion as opposed to dilution. 
And then just one other important point, over the last few years, many people have asked me how I think about structured deals or capital takeouts. We've naturally heavily embraced digital, and our growth rate in digital has been twice that of the industry over the last 2 years. 
One of the benefits of digital is, of course, the smaller contract duration to get with it, given the nature of the work you're performing, which ensures we haven't actually been locked into multiyear pricing dimensions as part of a 5- or an 8-year contract. So that's actually, in a strange way, turned out to be quite favorable for us going forward. But all of this is heavy lifting, we have to get right in the quarters ahead, but we feel as though we're on the right track."

I agree, it does seem to be unprecedented attrition. But I'm wondering what slows it. You've talked about specific steps that Cognizant is taking, but it's clearly an industry problem. 
And the other side is, does it require a slowdown in revenues across Cognizant and its competitors in order for attrition to come down? But I'm just wondering what are some of the industry forces that might help alleviate some of this pressure? 
And then Brian, I'll just go ahead and ask my second question since they're related. As you're facing such unprecedented attrition, how do you think about the trade-offs that you need to make related to growth versus margins as you look out over the next couple of quarters or even the next year?"
386024,1684738662,2414929,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Keith, so let me start with the second question, given it's fresh in mind.

Look, we've already started making some of those trade-offs on growth versus margins. I think the reality is I'm delighted with our team. And our recruitment engine was really executing extremely well in the last few quarters, and we'll continue to execute well going forward. And hence, we've had a net headcount increase sequentially of 17,000, by the way, which excludes subcontractors, which also grew. 
But the reality is we don't have enough headcount to fulfill our potential. And therefore, we've been faced with choice points: which clients to serve; which deals to chase, where we walk away; where we're willing to make pricing. Stances that may put a deal at risk, but it's the appropriate thing to do given the demand/supply imbalance. So that is already underway, Keith. 
I will say in the same vein, we're really delighted with the commercial momentum we have. Bookings growth of 24% in the quarter, which brings year-to-date up to mid-teens. On the back of mid-teens bookings growth last year, tells me that we have actually really turned the corner in terms of commercial momentum. 
So those trade-offs are underway. I'd like nothing more to accelerate hiring from current levels, so that we can really fulfill against our true potential. But at this moment in time despite all the net adds, and they were at record levels in the quarter, we have enough attrition, as does the rest of the industry, to mitigate that. 
With regards to the first question around the industry forces that will alleviate attrition, look, it's a very difficult question to answer. The reality is I don't see an immediate line of sight to this. I foresee elevated attrition in the industry in the coming quarters. I think the only winner in times like this is the actual individual employee because companies like us don't win from this, clients don't win from this. And as such, hopefully, this will right itself over time. 
And hence, our focus, both not just on a compensation work stream, but we stood up a war room from a retention point of view about 9 months ago at this stage. And we spent an extraordinary amount of time on the hearts and minds angle. And I personally now spend an hour per day with groups of 5 or 6 employees that are deep into the organization to make sure we're hearing them out, understanding what's in their mind, validating that they understand what we're up to. 
I will say I like the fact that we're back to double-digit growth more sustainably. Because that helps us get a little bit more swagger back in Cognizant, and obviously it demonstrates an ability for us to stand in front of our clients, as much as our clients are employees, and talk about the fact that they will have career advancement opportunities and we will have gross margin opportunities to invest in their careers and training and development, et cetera. 
So time will tell what's going to happen over time, but we really -- we're doing what we can do. And core to that is also the, let's say, the reinvigoration of our fresher program, which had stalled. But I think at this stage, we're starting to get our pyramid back into the right shape after a few years of being off kilter."

Because we very often spend a lot of time on one of our other strategic postures, which is around accelerating our digital footprint, which isn't relevant just on a total corporation level but also internationally. So ge",524,"Yes, it's a great question, Rod. Because we very often spend a lot of time on one of our other strategic postures, which is around accelerating our digital footprint, which isn't relevant just on a total corporation level but also internationally. 
So getting our international capabilities is something I'm 100% focused on. Today, it's just 26% of our revenue. And so if you think about our footprint internationally, our brand internationally and our operations, they're in need of scaling. And it's not just revenue scaling, but it's also our delivery capabilities overseas, both in terms of nearshore and onshore that will enable our shift to digital, but also I would say it's very core to our desire to build out a global delivery network where we can provide greater business continuity capabilities for our clients as well. 
We're executing well against those initiatives. We've hired, and largely refreshed a lot of the international leadership team, very senior hires in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Japan, the Nordics. The people we've targeted are well connected into the local industry. They understand the local market. 
And I would say the impact of that is now becoming more and more evident, not just in strong revenue growth in the third quarter but also in year-to-date this year across Australia, U.K., Germany in particular. But also as I think about the bookings momentum we have internationally, the year-to-date and Q3 bookings on our international businesses is well above the company average. 
Now those people are bringing followership, both from a client point of view as well as from an employee point of view. Our ability to attract talent is relevant there. But they also give me confidence that I'm investing M&A dollars behind senior leaders who will take post-merger integration activities seriously. And as you've seen in the last -- earlier part of this year, we acquired Servian in Australia and New Zealand and ESG Mobility in Germany. And so it goes back to having confidence in the team and having a team who take their responsibilities seriously and a team that's fundamentally connected into partnership ecosystem as well as the client network. 
Where we are different internationally, but Rod, I expect we will continue to double that in that arena too, is the notion of industry alignment. We're very strong from an industry perspective in North America. Healthcare is obviously a great example of that in the payer provider space. But as we scale into Europe and Asia, our largest country is the U.K. where we are aligned by industry. But actually, some of the country leaders that we've hired now are embracing more of an industry alignment in those countries as well. Perhaps not across all industries in every country, but there are major industries that we are aligning behind. And I think that is the way to go to get after these market opportunities internationally. 
So not just am I expecting, Rod, to maintain this level of growth. My hope is to accelerate our growth internationally in the years ahead. And we'll certainly talk more about that on November 18 at the investor summit."

So if I focus on digital, the nature of the work we do ends up positioning us against smaller contract durations. And from my perspective, I agree with the inference in your question. This is a resource-constrained environment. And putting valuable resources against digital is much more interesting for me than putting them against captive or structured deals, where you may have an apples-to-orange compare for 1 year or 2, but thereafter you're in a book of business that you have to work very hard to grow. 
I will say when I think about our bookings, our win rates and our pipelines, I have nothing but good thoughts. Bookings were balanced by industry, by geography. If I think about even within the digital work we are doing, we have actually seen a little more momentum in the $50 million-plus category on a year-over-year basis, and I expect that to continue in the fourth quarter as well. That's different from $500 million or $1 billion deals, but these are very healthy digital-type deals for us. 
And all of this has led us to be in a position now with bookings growth of 24% year-over-year in Q3 to have a book-to-bill ratio that is now solidly in the 1.2 range. So I feel good about that. 
I will say, as the CEO, the enemy is when you have clients that are indecisive. That is not the case at this moment in time. Pipeline velocity is strong. It's fast. That's why I feel very good about our position. I think the strategic choices we made a number of years ago were the right choices. We're executing against that. But I think we'll bear the fruit of that labor in the coming years."

To give you examples, when you scale and expand your sales force and distribution capabilities, more effective measures on the effectiveness and results of that sales force are required.

That has brought out, with a lot of work pretty well, I think, particularly in the last half year here where we have faced really the changed industry with high attrition rates.

And then we'll continue to do acquisitions in those areas as well that are aligned to our higher-growth categories. 
[ Voltas ] has set up 3 business groups behind hyperscalers. So it's not lip service. It is true organizations. We take it very seriously. I actually see the hyperscalers now focusing more and more towards industry alignment. And Cognizant's historic strength, particularly in health care and financial services, is naturally of interest to those. 
Now there are individual cases where you have industry-specific plays. It could be Pega, Guidewire, Temenos, Duck Creek, et cetera. Naturally, they are relevant to individual industries within Cognizant, but on a more horizontal nature, it's the companies I've referenced. 
And then of course in our operations business, which I'm very proud of, which has done a fantastic job over the last 2 years as we've exited content moderation, and frankly got the business back to mid- to high teens growth, they have very strong partnerships across some of the IPA players, in particular Automation Anywhere, UiPath, Blue Prism, et cetera."

I want to be careful in giving you too much detail that it was going to be hard to interpret over time. But of the margin pressure that we have seen through the growth in the SG&A, approximately 50% or so is due to M&A activity. This could be upfront deal cost. This could be deal-related expenses and higher SG&A load that some of the M&A transactions carry within. So that has been a meaningful pressure for us, let's say, maybe in the range of 100, around 100 basis points or so. 
And then the rest of the pressure that we have seen is kind of split evenly between 3 major areas, I would say. Area #1 is our IT modernization. That's clearly starting to stabilize, and that has put pressure on it. We had investments into our HR and recruiting organization in order to scale our hiring activity. 
And thirdly, our investments into our sales force and marketing capabilities. Those will be kind of roughly in even buckets, I think, is a fair amount to say. And some of those are now starting to anniversary, that's kind of what we're starting to anticipate, and plateau. We do not want to reduce those expenses obviously, because they are important to us. But we have found, I think, levels that are allowing us to have a more moderated SG&A development going forward. 
You will see more detail around that, obviously, in our November meeting. But the third quarter is a little bit of an indication of what's happening, basically. Because we had still growth in these strategic investment areas, but we have started to curtail growth in more traditional SG&A areas to offset that. And you can see that the curve has started to end a little bit. More work to be done, but it really developed, as I would have expected, in the third quarter."

One of the bigger ones from a weighted impact is actually our business operation -- digital business operations business, which has been growing in the strong teens. Within that, we have elements that are -- we classify as digital and are in our digital mix, and there are elements that we don't classify as digital. We have tended to be quite disciplined. We changed the definition of digital over 2 years ago at this stage, and we've maintained that ever since. 
But there are other areas, including a nondigital element of our AI and analytics portfolio. Again, we're being disciplined. There are elements that we use digital, and elements that we view as more traditional. That's business intelligence, et cetera. And then on top of that, we have elements within some of our enterprise applications business and CIS business that have grown as well. 
Our goal, to be very honest, on a multiyear basis, is to mitigate the risk of the clients in the nondigital business and then hopefully maintain some growth in the nondigital business. If we manage to do that, which requires us to be very disciplined from a pricing, from a renewal point of view, that will, frankly, complement what we expect to be very strong growth in digital. And therefore, it's good news for the entire corporation. 
But at this moment in time, that is something that I think you've seen in competitors' earnings as well. If you extrapolate the digital growth they have versus the total company growth, particularly for those who suggest have a very -- a large portion of their revenue that is digital, you will be able to surely extrapolate that they are seeing declines in their legacy businesses."

So we've seen momentum organically, and we see -- we want to continue with our capital allocation program as we have announced it. 
So the acceleration of revenue growth is front and center in our view. We have ample of opportunity. And as such, we have made decisions to, of course, support the opportunities that we promise to our clients with staffing. So HR will be funded as needed. And we're actually very proud about the amount of scaling that we achieved and the amount of change in policy of accelerating the hiring of freshers, optimizing our pyramid, scaling training programs. 
At our size, it's a really important and complicated effort that, that team executed well. And I will, of course, or the company will provide the funding for that. That is part of our growth engine. 
But there are other elements that need themselves more natural to scale, certain IT components, certain marketing components, certain finance and classic support functions in the SG&A do let themselves for scaling. And we're going to continue to fund, obviously, our sales force. 
In the distribution area, I'm actually pretty pleased. We have a good combination of growth in resources, but also of improvement in productivity in those sales forces. And we're -- we have been busy at work to optimize our go-to-market strategies. And I think we have more opportunities in that space, but also we will be funding our organic growth appropriately to capture those opportunities. So I am not too religious here relative to what the exact percentage growth of SG&A is, but you get the philosophy kind of in my answer."

And at the current point, we are still, as our competitors are, largely in a virtual environment, which has worked actually pretty well for us.

I would view it to be very much business as usual, these things, retirements, internal promotions performance orientation. But this is kind of classic Fortune 200 company land at this stage. And I've got to say I'm delighted with the leadership team we have around us these days. We've -- we're getting back into a growth trajectory after a few years where our backlog and our pipeline hasn't been -- and bookings haven't been as strong as they needed to be. And I think you see a united leadership team here orienting the company towards an evolved business model, both geographically as well as the offerings that we ultimately solution and deliver. 
So that's not a concern of mine anymore. And of course, there will always be press articles about the individuals. With a company with 320,000 employees, please don't get distracted by that. I'm not. 
With regards to digital, of course, it all depends on the portion of the portfolio you look at. Our digital growth is 18% within our portfolio. If I look at our digital engineering business, our growth rate is equivalent to the pure plays that are announcing their results. If I look at our IoT business, the digital growth is as fast as the pure plays out there. The same for our cloud business or digital experience business.
So as I said, we try to be extremely disciplined in the definition of digital. And in many ways, we've penalized ourselves. But as a broader company within the categories we look at, and I'll talk a little bit to this in the November Investor Summit, we have some gems in our portfolio that are growing at significant rates. And ultimately, that will continue to drive the growth rate of the company forward. 
A little bit, the mix shift these last few quarters that has been hanging around in the mid-40s, it's somewhat reflective of numerator/denominator where the nondigital business has actually had some better growth than anticipated."

We've been quite intentional and being restrictive in what is digital. Included in our digital business is our TriZetto platform business, which is growing at a very healthy double-digit pace these days. Significantly up from prior years, but it's not growing at the rate of maybe a digital engineering company pure play because it's not at all the same business or business model. So it's important to recognize that everybody's definition of digital and what is within that differs. 
I would say I'm very pleased with our momentum in digital. We can always do better. We strive to do better. But our exposure to digital exposes us to higher-growth categories as a corporation, ultimately higher-margin categories as a corporation. It puts us up against a different set of competitors where we have pricing dynamics that will be favorable for Cognizant's pricing. 
And ultimately, most importantly for me, it makes us much more relevant to clients, because we are becoming much more intimate with them as we become part of their transformation journey. And as I go around and speak to clients around the world when we articulate our strategy and what we're doing and start sharing some of the references we have, invariably clients are very open to proceeding with the next meeting to better understand what we have today, have optionality versus some of the incumbents. 
So I feel ultimately that we're in the right spaces. We will continue to double down. Of course, there are certain industries where digital is a higher portion of our mix than others. And there are certain geographies where I want to accelerate our digital capabilities. Not just -- back to Rod's question earlier, the international markets where our digital mix is lower than it needs to be, because historically we spent a lot more of our focus on structured deals in those geographies; but also the delivery capabilities, both nearshore and onshore, to fulfill any demand that we create in our commercial teams internationally. We need to further extend our capabilities there. And we're working on a number of things that hopefully we can announce in the foreseeable future that will hopefully give you confidence that we're doing to writing in that regard as well."

And those priority areas within digital actually also meaningful outgrowing -- meaningfully outgrowing our overall digital revenue growth. 
So I think for a company to establish that focus and then execute against those focus areas in a thoughtful way, it's a good sign. And there's ample opportunities to expand those things for the long run, but at least we're seeing in our numbers really the results of exactly what we wanted the strategy to be."

It's just a hot labor market. It's extremely consistent, I think, in the commentary you've seen from our peers in the industry. And as I said earlier, we're working very hard to mitigate that. 
We do expect attrition to fall sequentially on a year-over-year basis from where it is in Q3, based on the net resignations we've seen and based on what we're seeing following the efforts we've had around hearts and minds and compensation. But at this moment in time, we're still anticipating elevated attrition in the coming years. 
And to the question that we received earlier, we're funding in our P&L what it takes to mitigate that, those compensation measures as well as our recruitment team who've been doing an incredible job for us. And frankly, we expect to meaningfully scale our headcount in the coming year.
