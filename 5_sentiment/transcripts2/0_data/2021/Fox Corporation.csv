Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. Financially and operationally, we continued our impressive results and strong momentum in the quarter with EBITDA growing by 17%, driven by revenue growth",2042,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. 
Financially and operationally, we continued our impressive results and strong momentum in the quarter with EBITDA growing by 17%, driven by revenue growth of 8%. These financial results were led by exceptional gains in advertising revenues, which grew by 14%, spurred by record political cycle, in which we generated more than $420 million of net political revenue company-wide during calendar 2020. 
The overall advertising strength was propelled by our FOX Television stations, gains at FOX News Media and the dramatic growth of Tubi. Beyond advertising and because of the substantial pricing power of our brands, affiliate revenues grew by 6% despite a reserve taken for potential distribution credits. While we experienced a decline in subscriber volume, the trend improved for the third consecutive quarter. This quarter, we saw industry subscribers decline just above 5%, which is more than a 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced in Q1. The financial performance of FOX is illustrative of the strength of the core brands that anchor our company and of the contributions of new assets that lay the groundwork for continued growth and rapid evolution. 
As you know, the new cycle over the last year has been quite active, and it has led directly to gains across our local stations as well as all the networks and all the extensions of FOX News Media. For example, FOX's ability to provide the best in local news was on full display at FOX 5 Atlanta during the Georgia Senate runoffs. Not only did our colleagues of FOX 5 report on the national significance of the Georgia election, they also expanded news coverage in response to viewer demand, held a candidate debate and produced special runoff programming focused on the issues impacting Georgia voters. During the entire runoff period, FOX 5 was the #1 station in Atlanta for a 6.5-hour morning news block. Hard work that gets just awards. And so it's no surprise, we led the market in political revenues generated. 
This success was replicated across the FOX Television Stations footprint. Net political revenue approximated $190 million in the quarter, bringing our total for the stations in the first half of the fiscal year to approximately $260 million. An amount more than 3x greater than the last presidential cycle. The new cycle also continued to connect engaged audiences to the various FOX News Media platforms. Linear, digital, radio and streaming for news analysis and opinion. In fact, the FOX News channel finished the quarter with the highest average primetime ratings in the history of cable news. The FOX News channel closed the calendar year as the #1 television network in weekday primetime, continuously topping all broadcast networks and total viewers since the very early months of 2020. 
FOX News was #1 in election night coverage during primetime, beating all television networks and averaging 25% share of total viewers. While calendar of 2020 ratings were record breaking, we are now seeing the expected post election audience pullback that we anticipated on this call last quarter, and which is consistent with prior election cycles. We fully expect that the overall news audience will normalize and our share of ratings will dominate. In fact, this trend is already beginning as we have seen substantial share gains versus our competition since the inauguration. As in the past, we are confident that the strength and breadth of the FOX News Media businesses positions us for sustained long-term growth. 
I'm pleased to announce that FOX News Media's CEO, Suzanne Scott, has extended her term with the company. Under her leadership, FOX News has expanded its reach with consumers and has diversified significantly to become a multi-platform media brand. I've been fortunate to work closely with Suzanne over the last several years, and have seen in action her ability to seamlessly guide the newsroom, her stories break, her openness to new ideas and her ability to innovate new opportunities to grow our business. I am also happy with the programming changes that Suzanne is implementing, including Larry Kudlow's Show on FOX Business Network that will premiere next week. We all welcome Larry to FOX. 
Turning to other areas of the company. Our mix of assets our viewers clocked in even greater numbers to Fox Sports and Tubi post election. FOX Sports leadership and live events demonstrates why it proudly and correctly claims to own the fall. Even with an atypical fall sports schedule, it was crowded with out of season events that had been postponed earlier in the year and included unexpected and sudden cancellations. FOX clocked nearly 170 billion minutes of live sports viewing in the fall, more than 50% above the next competing network. Our 27th season of the NFL demonstrated that FOX continues to be the preeminent broadcaster of America's most popular sport, with nearly 45 million viewers tuning into FOX for the NFC Championship game. We eclipsed last year's NFC championship's audience that was broadcast during the later window. 
I want to congratulate the NFL for completing it's season last Sunday. I know many of you on this call worry about the risks associated to FOX if the NFL season fell short. It's a testament to the leadership of Commissioner Goodell and the professionalism of both the NFL and the incredible team at FOX Sports, that we were able to deliver and broadcast such a historic season. Proud is not my favorite word or a concept, but I am very proud of our team for this achievement. 
Elsewhere, the return of live sports boosted our sports wage and partnership, FOX Bet. After adding nearly 3 million players during the NFL season, FOX Bet super 6 now has a user base in excess of 4.3 million players, and continues to be the biggest free-to-play game of its kind in the country. We also continued our successful track record with nonsports Super 6 contest. For example, the Super 6 game covering the Georgia Senate runoff and the recently launched stock market challenge game and Weekly Queso, as promoted on FOX & Friends, enable us to fully engage nonsports fans who generally wouldn't interact with the wagering brand. 
A key differentiator for FOX Bet has been a cross promotional power of all of FOX's assets to ignite the FOX Bet brand. In a similar fashion, we have mobilized the entire FOX portfolio to support and supercharge Tubi, which we acquired less than a year ago. This strategic acquisition, which is already a core asset for Fox Corporation, clearly merits some focused commentary. Tubi is exciting growth engine for the company and a key strategic platform for, not only our digital expansion, but also our broader reimagining of FOX's broadcast model for the future. In fact, I believe Tubi is an investment and what we internally call the broadening of broadcast, meaning the FOX Network and Tubi combining seamlessly to create a modern network inspired business. With Tubi as part of our portfolio, FOX broadens from being the leader in broadcast network television into a leader in linear and streaming ecosystems. Both FOX and Tubi deliver distinct value to our viewers, partners and advertisers already. And we believe Tubi's technology and market approach, coupled with FOX's unique positioning as a focused network first business, make them even more impactful when operated and offered together. 
You know the broadcast network well and our marketplace differentiation, so I'll focus on the already meaningful momentum and results of Tubi and the significant sustainable growth that we envision ahead. Tubi has seen dramatic year-over-year increases across every key metric, and it continues to grow beyond even our best acquisition expectations. Over the first half of the year, we have seen yearly unique viewers more than triple, total view time grow by nearly 70% and revenue more than doubled. In fact, Tubi's revenue for this past quarter alone broadly approximated Tubi's revenue for the entire fiscal year before we acquired the company. While some streaming services focus attention on metrics like sign-ups or monthly active users, we think the most meaningful metric when measuring the performance of any AVOD service is total view time, or TVT, as it is viewership that has direct and proportional relationship to advertising inventory and revenue opportunities. It is this profile of Tubi that is driving digital advertising partners to engage with our audience. 
Looking ahead to our plans to continue to boost Tubi, let me give you a bit more color on our content, technology and synergy strategies. Tubi's vast content library by design caters to a broad audience. We continue to strategically add to its offerings with marquee titles from FOX and nearly other program -- every other programmer of note. The addition of The Masked Singer to Tubi provides a perfect example the power of these assets combined. The show was a sensation when it launched on FOX. When we added The Masked Singer to Tubi, it added reach for advertisers, delivered significant view time on the platform and broadened advertisers seeking to be associated with the young, diverse and complementary audience that Tubi adds to the FOX offering. 
Another important differentiator for Tubi is its technology. Tubi is constantly enhancing its ad technology to provide better data and results to digital advertisers. For example, Tubi recently introduced its advanced frequency management tool, which reduces ad repetition. In early study with a major insurance brand, this tool reduced over frequency to the same viewers by more than 360%. Simply stated, rather than continuing to show the same ad to the same viewers as is often the case across other AVOD platforms, Tubi's tool enabled this insurance company to advertise to nearly 100,000 more households within the same ad buy. These compelling results led the insurance brand to make a multimillion-dollar ad commitment to Tubi throughout 2021, and the brand is also a FOX Fox advertiser now as well. Expect more technology advancements and offerings in the months ahead. Tubi's tech stack in general will separate Tubi from lesser AVOD options for years to come. 
Tubi has also rapidly become a synergistic acquisition. We've had incredible success with advertisers who find their way to Tubi through existing relationships with other FOX brands. For instance, 50 advertisers who had not previously worked with Tubi chose to buy Tubi during the recent upfront season. By combining Tubi into our portfolio of advertisers, we reach brands that may have been unfamiliar with Tubi's unique and additive audience, nearly 50% of which doesn't have a pay TV subscription. We have a laser focus on growth and monetization at Tubi. As we continue to invest in Tubi, we believe it will become the AVOD platform of choice for viewers and digital advertisers alike, and become a larger piece of the broader Fox Corporation business. 
Translating this financially, we expect Tubi revenues to more than double in the current fiscal year to exceed $300 million. And as we look out a few years, we envision to be becoming $1 billion business and a core pillar of FOX. Tubi is a tremendous addition to our pre-existing portfolio of growing digital businesses, which we have built over time in a fiscally responsible manner. Over the first half of our fiscal year, our FOX News, Sports, Entertainment and Television Stations, digital businesses, have attracted more than 330 million average monthly users, over a 30% increase from the comparable period in the prior year. These users spent more than 160 billion minutes consuming our digital content during this time, an increase of more than 70% from the first half of fiscal 2020. 
Through these digital destinations, coupled with Tubi and Credible, we have generated well over $650 million of digital revenue through the first half of our fiscal year, with approximately 2/3 representing digital advertising revenues. These rapidly grown platforms, along with our must have linear television brands and market expanding partnerships, are exceeding expectations. As a united portfolio, they are even stronger with wide runways for the businesses to collaborate, retaining existing viewers, harnessing new audiences, engaging consumers in new ways and broadening the touch points users have with FOX. 
And now, Steve will take us through the details of the quarter."

Highlighting the strength and momentum across our businesses, the company delivered double-digit growth in advertising revenues, along with underlying double-digit growth in affiliate revenues in our fiscal second quarte",1314,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning. Highlighting the strength and momentum across our businesses, the company delivered double-digit growth in advertising revenues, along with underlying double-digit growth in affiliate revenues in our fiscal second quarter. 
Our total advertising revenues increased 14% with this strong growth led by the FOX Television Stations, the inclusion of Tubi and continued linear and digital strength at FOX News Media. As we previewed on our most recent earnings call, the growth at our Television Stations was driven by record political advertising revenues. When viewed across the entirety of our portfolio, we generated quarterly political advertising revenues of approximately $250 million, bringing our fiscal year-to-date to approximately $340 million. 
Total company affiliate revenues increased double digits on an underlying basis in the quarter. Once again, demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of leadership channels. During the quarter, we recorded an accrual for potential distribution credits due to canceled college football games. While this credit was fully offset in our programming costs, on a reported basis, our total company affiliate revenue growth was 6%. This strength in our 2 most significant revenue streams drove total reported company revenues to $4.09 billion, up 8% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020. 
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $305 million, up $44 million over the comparative period in fiscal '20 due to the top line increases in revenues, partially offset by contractual annual escalators for our key sports franchises. 
Net income attributable to stockholders of $224 million or $0.37 per share was lower than $300 million or $0.48 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was the result of higher gains recognized in other net in the prior year quarter, most notably from the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.16 per share was up $0.06 compared to last year's $0.10 per share, primarily reflecting the growth in EBITDA. 
Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter with cable networks EBITDA of $571 million, was up 3% on revenue growth of 1%. Cable advertising revenues increased 31% with the record audiences and digital engagement at FOX News Media leading this growth. Underlying cable affiliate revenues increased mid-single digits, this growth was underpinned by rate increases, including double-digit pricing gains at FOX News Media, along with the moderation in the rate of industry subscriber erosion, which is currently trending at a little over 5%. 
As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, there were a number of COVID-19-related cancellations of college football games. As a result, we have recorded an accrual for the potential credit of certain distribution fees. While this credit reduces our reported cable affiliate revenues, it is broadly offset by a corresponding reduction in rights costs. Cable other revenues decreased by 32%, primarily due to lower sports sublicensing revenues. Again, as a result of the cancellation of certain college football games due to COVID-19. These lower sublicensing revenues were also broadly offset by a corresponding reduction in rights costs. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased by $15 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted, partially offset by the shift of certain sports costs from our fiscal first quarter into our second quarter that we foreshadowed on our last call. 
The Television segment reported revenue growth of 13% with the EBITDA loss improving $29 million to $185 million. Continuing the consistently strong growth we have delivered since the establishment of Fox Corp., Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the quarter. This reflects double-digit increases for both our programming fees from nonowned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. 
The growth in Television advertising revenues was driven by the record political advertising I mentioned earlier, coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast-growing Tubi. These factors  were partially offset in the segment by lower sports advertising revenues, including the impact of COVID-related cancellations of certain college football games, along with the postponement of key scripted entertainment program. 
EBITDA at our Television segment increased $29 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted as well as higher programming rights amortization of FOX Sports, primarily due to the contractual annual rights increases for our major sports franchises, including the NFL, and incremental costs due to the consolidation of Tubi. Partially offsetting these increases was lower programming rights amortization at FOX Entertainment due to the postponement of key scripted entertainment programming as a result of COVID-19. 
Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment. In the quarter, we generated a free cash flow loss of $155 million, which is consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business. Reflecting our continued confidence in the business and our balanced approach to capital allocation, today, we announced a semiannual dividend of $0.23 per share and continue to be active with our stock repurchase program. So far, this fiscal year, we have deployed $450 million of capital to repurchase approximately 11.3 million Class A shares and 4.9 million Class B shares. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased just over $1 billion, representing approximately 5.4% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. 
Looking through to the second half of our fiscal year. It is worth reminding you of a few factors that will impact comparability with the prior year. Starting with Sport in the current March quarter, we will comp against last year's broadcast of Super Bowl 54 on FOX. However, we did enjoy the benefit of 1 additional week of the regular season as well as the rotating divisional playoff game this January. Our plans also anticipate a timely start to the NASCAR and Major League Baseball season. However, as we have demonstrated in the past, we will adapt to any potential COVID-driven disruptions across our sports calendar. 
Meanwhile, from an Entertainment perspective, due to COVID-19, the launch of our key scripted titles on the FOX Network has shifted from the first half into the second half of our fiscal year, with completion of our full season still dependent on minimal future disruptions to production schedules. 
In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year. And as a result, the normal working capital deficit exhibited in this year's first half reverses in the second half of the year. As we've foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a higher level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21 to support the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our local station facilities. 
With the majority of our full year advertising revenue already owned in the first half, a very light slate of affiliate renewals and a working capital tailwind that will build on our already ample liquidity, we approach the second half of this fiscal year from a position of financial strength. Assuming the continuation of a constructive macroeconomic environment, we intend to continue to deploy capital towards share repurchases and are targeting an additional $550 million in our fiscal second half to reach $1 billion in total buyback volume this fiscal year. 
To sum this all up, the results of our first 2 fiscal quarters demonstrate the strength of our underlying business. This operating momentum, combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity and moderate leverage, position us particularly well for the future. 
And with that, I will now turn the call back to Joe."

Can you talk a little bit about the strategy to maintain leadership at the network, particularly sort of post the last administration, post the inauguration?

You're right, a lot's being written about it, and there'll be a few more trees cut down. I think I'm writing about it in the days and weeks to come. Look, I think the fundamental -- let me answer -- there's 2 parts to your question. But let me answer -- I'll answer both parts, but let me answer the first part broadly and then specifically. 
So in the journalism business, the journalism trade. You -- what you do, you work out what your market is and you produce the best product you can possibly produce for that target market, right, for your readers or your listeners or your viewers. FOX News, the success of FOX News, throughout his entire history has been to provide the absolute best news and opinion for a market that we believe is firmly center right. And we don't pivot or change that and we haven't pivoted or changed that throughout the history of FOX News. So we'll continue to provide the best journalism, with the best host, with the best analysis, with the best opinion going forward as we have throughout past new cycles. And we believe where we're targeted to the center right, is exactly where we should be targeted. It's where we've been. We don't need to go further right. We don't believe America is further right. And we're obviously not going to pivot left. All of our significant competitors are to the far left. So we'll stick where we are and we think that's exactly right, and that's the best thing for the business and for our viewers. 
With that, we will see a return in our ratings dominance. As I said, we believe the center right is where America's politics are. And we expected, as we foreshadowed in the last call, our ratings to be tempered after this election cycle, and we were right. We're down about 13% in ratings. If I go back to the Trump-Clinton election, CNN was down about 10% -- 17%, sorry, and CNN -- MSNBC, 10%. So CNN, 17%; MSNB -- sorry. Yes, that's right. CNN, 17%; MSNBC, 10%. And so we're right in between in that metric. So this is a cycle that we've seen before. It's a cycle we expected. We look forward to the news normalizing, and we will go on from strength-to-strength. 
The second part of your question, though, about really driving the business, continue to drive the business harder and continue to generate cash. I think we look at it in 2 different ways. One is obviously the pricing power of our affiliate revenue, remains relatively untapped. We think we can continue to drive pricing for FOX News well ahead of any sort of volume declines in subscriber numbers. That's very clear to us looking forward. And I think the other part it is that the new businesses that we're driving out of FOX News Media. With FOX Nation, the FOX Business channel is growing. The FOX Digital, all of the FOX digital assets, foxnews.com. And Radio, FOX Radio. And now we announced this past quarter the launch -- the coming launch of FOX Weather. So when we look at FOX News Media, it really is a broader ecosystem of FOX News brands, that are all growing and will all further contribute to growing EBITDA and cash going forward."

So first of all, from an advertising point of view, our strongest category in the Station group is Entertainment, which is pacing up 10% year-on-year. Entertainment is really made up of 2 things. One is sort of streaming services and the second is sports betting. So absolutely the sort of wagering businesses, both locally and in the states where wagering is legal, but also in FanDuel and drafting is really helping drive local performance at the station group level. I don't have that sort of broken out as a -- not just even as a category, but as a subcategory and sports wagering for you, but it is in the very top growth tier for us. 
And then obviously, so we're enjoying the growth of sports betting and sports wagering on multiple fronts. One from an advertising fund at the local station level, but also obviously participating in it with FOX Bet and with our action -- our option in FanDuel. We are -- we're really incredibly excited about the opportunities for FOX Bet. The Super 6, we talked before on these calls. And in person, the Super 6 funnel at the top of a FOX Bet is working very efficiently. We set ourselves a goal during this NFL season to reach over $4 million active users. I want to say we set a goal -- we ended up with a goal of 4 million. We started with a lower goal. We were tracking so well to middle of the football season that we increased the goal to actually 4.4 million users, which we achieved at the very end of the season. And that funnel is then successfully driving people into FOX Bet wagering, where it's licensed and legal. And we just launched on Michigan, January 26, and it was a very successful launch for us in that state. 
The -- I think we've talked about before, but the FanDuel option for our 18.5% is a 10-year option beginning this summer, I think it's June or July. And that option is based on fair market value, which was set with the Flutter acquisition of the Fastball stake in FanDuel. So we continue to be proponents and fans of the dual-brand strategy with FOX Bet, alongside with FanDuel in these markets. And we are enjoying our partnership, our de-partnership and important partnership with Flutter. 
As to the NFL, this is a growing business. Absolutely, the NFL understands that this is a business that's important to us. And it's important to how we are able to monetize our rights deals with them. I don't want to go into the detail of the NFL negotiations that I'm -- we continue to be in. We've been in for a while. We hope to bring those to a conclusion in the near to medium term, but the NFL is very aware of the importance of sports wager. I'm sure to us and I am sure to them as well."

The details are, you talked about the usage, up 100% and advertising up 70%. So view time up 70%, revenue up more than 100%. So CPMs are obviously expanding. I'm just curious what the level of ad pricing is now relative to, say, broadcast primetime and where you see upside there? And you talked about Tubi being the leading AVOD platform in the future. And I'm just curious your view on competitive differentiation. I think a lot of content that ends up on these AVOD services is not exclusive. And so what do you think will attract Tubi -- people to Tubi versus other AVOD platforms that are out there? And then lastly, just the margin structure when you hit that $1 billion-plus of ad revenue for Tubi would be super interesting."

So let me start and Steve can jump in if I've forgotten any part of the question. So with Tubi, I'll answer your question, honestly, but I'm not sure when I look at competitors, SVOD services, whether you prefer us to say would be profitable early or we spend billions of dollars in investing in the business before we saw breakeven. Because certainly, our strategy is very different from our competitor strategy. We see the SVOD competitive set as the potential to lose very many billions of dollars. We see it as very crowded. We see that it's very hard to stand apart and differentiate ourselves within SVOD. And that's why we've really chosen to embrace AVOD as our direct-to-consumer strategy. And we think we can do this for really 2 reasons. Let me say, what we hope to achieve out of this, what we will achieve out of this is really twofold. One, and just to be very clear because I spent a lot of words in my preamble to this call talking about Tubi. But if the headline wasn't clear, it is that we expect to win in AVOD. We expect to win in AVOD and be the leading AVOD player in this country. And secondly, we expect to be able to do it by reinvesting our profits, but not by losing billions of dollars in programming costs or other costs in the time it takes to breakeven. Because of those 2 things, we will drive Tubi very aggressively. We will hit $1 billion in the medium-term or near-term in revenue, and the business will ultimately become a very profitable one for us. 
The other elements of the question, I think, on sort of our broadcast CPMs versus digital CPMs. Our digital CPMs are lower than broadcast. They're in sort of the high teens. Obviously, some of the tech stack allows us to drive that further. And Steve, did I miss any other part?"

But I think the way you should think about it is in the near term, if you look back over the last 6 months, Tubi has actually been P&L neutral for us from a bottom line perspective. We would expect that to change over the course of the second half as we continue to invest in the growth. And then over time, as we take our foot off the gas in terms of investing in growth, you see some pretty good conversion of revenue into bottom line margin as this business gets to scale. So -- and when you look at that revenue development in the near term, Lachlan is absolutely right in terms of where CPMs are. But where we see a lot of headroom, where we've gotten a lot of growth from in the initial phase has just been fill rate. And so and there's still plenty of headroom to take that further north."

So first of all, we see NBC sports, the announcement of it shutting down as probably a net positive FOX Sports 1. There's a less competition, I suppose, although we never saw them as our as our main competition. This year, FOX Sports 1 beat both ESPN 2 and NBCSN for an entire year for the first time ever. So we feel very well positioned. Obviously, with COVID and with some sports being less available, opinion programming, which is obviously very reliable and you don't have the high rights costs accounted for 35% of the FOX Sports 1 schedule and over 20% of viewing, which I think is an important statistic. It shows that you can be compelling and you can win with a mix of both live sports, but also with the sports analysis and opinion that FOX Sports 1 has. 
Clearly, having a breadth of sports platforms will ultimately help FOX Bet and our partnership also with FanDuel. I'd also include that, obviously, it's the local stations and the amount of time and effort the local stations in their news and in their sports broadcasting also contribute to promoting FOX Bet and engaging also with our partners at FanDuel. 
The last part there in terms about sort of sports rights. I think the thing that FOX has always had as part of its DNA is really a focus on the major sports rights as well. So it's obviously Major League Baseball, the NFL, WWE. And so our focus on our bouquet of sports is really the big sports that are going to move the needle, and not so much in smaller -- so great sports, but smaller sports for other platforms."

And in the -- in this last quarter, we're talking about, obviously, the impact of political, as we've discussed, Alexia, has just been tremendous. I'd be tempted to say we'll never see a political season so big, but I don't think that's true. I think when you have a senate and a house so finely balanced, I think we're going to see these records broken in 2 years and 4 years for sure. So the spending was pretty staggering. Obviously, we had the additional bonus of source with the Atlanta Station and the Georgia runoff, which I think contributed to -- I'm not sure if it's just a runoff, but the Atlanta Station alone contributed about $60 million of political revenue in itself. So in the past quarter, obviously, the story, the headline is all political. 
I think in the current quarter, obviously, we have difficult comps because of the Super Bowl and us having had the Super Bowl last year, which, by the way, rated -- almost 102 million viewers. It was a terrific Super Bowl and a great achievement. That, obviously, if you take that comp out, so we strip out the Super Bowl revenue, we're pacing in the negative single -- mid-single digits, maybe even a little bit better than that. So mid-single-digit is down 5%, 6% is where we would expect to end up in local advertising for the quarter. That's a tremendous improvement if we look through COVID from a year ago, right? Every quarter, every month, we've seen advertisers come back. And that we are stripping out football and stripping out political and everything else, we're about back to where we'd expect to be year-on-year. 
Of course, looking forward, the comps become much better because we will have been -- we'll be comparing to the first quarter that was COVID impacted versus now being in a more normalized advertising environment. From a categories point of view, I think I mentioned in response to Jessica's question, Entertainment leads the categories. Home, professional services, all strong. I should just mention on the flip side, that automotive, which is obviously a very large category for us, is still down, but this is primarily driven, excuse the pun, by domestic manufacturers. In fact, foreign auto spending is roughly flat.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. 
Financially and operationally, we continued our impressive results and strong momentum in the quarter, with EBITDA growing by 17%, driven by revenue growth of 8%. These financial results were led by exceptional gains in advertising revenues, which grew by 14%, spurred by record political cycle, in which we generated more than $420 million of net political revenue company-wide during calendar 2020. 
The overall advertising strength was propelled by our FOX Television Stations, gains at FOX News Media and the dramatic growth of Tubi. Beyond advertising, and because of the substantial pricing power of our brands, affiliate revenues grew by 6% despite a reserve taken for potential distribution credits. While we experienced a decline in subscriber volume, the trend improved for the third consecutive quarter. 
This quarter, we saw industry subscribers declined just above 5%, which is more than a 50 basis point improvement from what we experienced in Q1. The financial performance of FOX is illustrative of the strength of the core brands that anchor our company and of the contributions of new assets that lay the groundwork for continued growth and rapid evolution. 
As you know, the news cycle over the last year has been quite active, and it has led directly to gains across our local stations as well as all the networks and all the extensions of FOX News Media. For example, FOX's ability to provide the best in local news was on full display at FOX 5 Atlanta during the Georgia Senate runoffs. 
Not only did our colleagues of FOX 5 report on the national significance of the Georgia election, they also expanded news coverage in response to viewer demand, held a candidate debate and produced special runoff programming focused on the issues impacting Georgia voters. During the entire runoff period, FOX 5 was the #1 station in Atlanta for a 6.5-hour morning news block. Hard work that begets just awards. And so it's no surprise, we led the market in political revenues generated. 
This success was replicated across the FOX Television Stations footprint. Net political revenue approximated $190 million in the quarter, bringing our total for the stations in the first half of the fiscal year to approximately $260 million, an amount more than 3x greater than the last presidential cycle. 
The news cycle also continue to connect engaged audiences to the various FOX News Media platforms: linear, digital, radio and streaming for news, analysis and opinion. In fact, the FOX News Channel finished the quarter with the highest average prime time ratings in the history of cable news. The FOX News Channel closed the calendar year as the #1 television network in weekday prime time, continuously topping all broadcast networks and total viewers since the very early months of 2020. FOX News was #1 in election night coverage during prime time, beating all television networks and averaging 25% share of total viewers. 
While calendar of 2020 ratings were record breaking, we are now seeing the expected post-election audience pullback that we anticipated on this call last quarter, and which is consistent with prior election cycles. We fully expect that the overall news audience will normalize and our share of ratings will dominate. In fact, this trend is already beginning as we have seen substantial share gains versus our competition since the inauguration. As in the past -- sorry, as in the past, we are confident that the strength and breadth of the FOX News Media businesses positions us for sustained long-term growth. 
I'm pleased to announce that FOX News Media's CEO, Suzanne Scott, has extended her term with the company. Under her leadership, FOX News has expanded its reach with consumers and has diversified significantly to become a multi-platform media brand. I've been fortunate to work closely with Suzanne over the last several years, and have seen in action her ability to seamlessly guide the newsroom, her stories break, her openness to new ideas and her ability to innovate new opportunities to grow our business. I am also happy with the programming changes that Suzanne is implementing, including Larry Kudlow's Show on FOX Business Network that will premiere next week. We all welcome Larry to FOX. 
Turning to other areas of the company, our mix of assets. Our viewers flocked in even greater numbers to FOX Sports and Tubi post-election. FOX Sports' leadership and live events demonstrates why it proudly and correctly claims to own the fall. Even with an atypical fall sports schedule, it was crowded with out-of-season events that had been postponed earlier in the year and included unexpected and sudden cancellations. FOX clocked nearly 170 billion minutes of live sports viewing in the fall, more than 50% above the next competing network. 
Our 27th season of the NFL demonstrated that FOX continues to be the pre-eminent broadcaster of America's most popular sport, with nearly 45 million viewers tuning in to FOX for the NFC Championship game. We eclipsed last year's NFC championship's audience that was broadcast during the later window. 
I want to congratulate the NFL for completing it's season last Sunday. I know many of you on this call worried about the risks associated to FOX if the NFL season fell short. It's a testament to the leadership of Commissioner Goodell and the professionalism of both the NFL and the incredible team at FOX Sports that we were able to deliver and broadcast such a historic season. Crowd is not my favorite word or a concept, but I am very proud of our team for this achievement. 
Elsewhere, the return of live sports boosted our sports wage and partnership, FOX Bet. After adding nearly 3 million players during the NFL season, FOX Bet Super 6 now has a user base in excess of 4.3 million players and continues to be the biggest free-to-play game of its kind in the country. 
We also continued our successful track record with nonsports Super 6 contests. For example, the Super 6 game covering the Georgia Senate runoff and the recently launched stock market challenge game and weekly Quiz Show, as promoted on FOX & Friends, enable us to fully engage nonsports fans who generally wouldn't interact with a wagering brand. A key differentiator for FOX Bet has been across promotional power of all of FOX's assets to ignite the FOX Bet brand. 
In a similar fashion, we have mobilized the entire FOX portfolio to support and supercharge Tubi, which we acquired less than a year ago. This strategic acquisition, which is already a core asset for Fox Corporation, clearly merits some focused commentary. Tubi is an exciting growth engine for the company and a key strategic platform for not only our digital expansion, but also our broader reimagining of FOX's broadcast model for the future. 
In fact, I believe Tubi is an investment in what we internally call the broadening of broadcast, meaning the FOX Network and Tubi combining seamlessly to create a modern network-inspired business. With Tubi as part of our portfolio, FOX broadens from being the leader in broadcast network television into a leader in linear and streaming ecosystems. Both FOX and Tubi deliver distinct value to our viewers, partners and advertisers already. And we believe Tubi's technology and market approach, coupled with FOX's unique positioning as a focused network-first business, make them even more impactful when operated and offered together. 
You know the broadcast network well and our marketplace differentiation, so I'll focus on the already meaningful momentum and results of Tubi and the significant sustainable growth that we envision ahead. Tubi has seen dramatic year-over-year increases across every key metric, and it continues to grow beyond even our best acquisition expectations. 
Over the first half of the year, we have seen yearly unique viewers more than triple, total view time grow by nearly 70% and revenue more than double. In fact, Tubi's revenue for this past quarter alone broadly approximated Tubi's revenue for the entire fiscal year before we acquired the company. 
While some streaming services focus attention on metrics like sign-ups or monthly active users, we think the most meaningful metric when measuring the performance of any AVOD service is Total View Time, or TVT, as it is viewership that has direct and proportional relationship to advertising inventory and revenue opportunities. It is this profile of Tubi that is driving digital advertising partners to engage with our audience. 
Looking ahead to our plans to continue to boost Tubi, let me give you a bit more color on our content, technology and synergy strategies. Tubi's vast content library, by design, caters to a broad audience. We continue to strategically add to its offerings with marquee titles from FOX and nearly other program -- every other programmer of note. 
The addition of The Masked Singer to Tubi provides a perfect example of the power of these assets combined. The show was a sensation when it launched on FOX. When we added The Masked Singer to Tubi, it added reach for advertisers, delivered significant view time on the platform and broadened advertisers seeking to be associated with the young, diverse and complementary audience that Tubi adds to the FOX offering. 
Another important differentiator for Tubi is its technology. Tubi is constantly enhancing its ad technology to provide better data and results to digital advertisers. For example, Tubi recently introduced its Advanced Frequency Management tool, which reduces ad repetition. 
An early study with a major insurance brand, this tool reduced overfrequency to the same viewers by more than 360%. Simply stated, rather than continuing to show the same ad to the same viewers as is often the case across other AVOD platforms, Tubi's tool enabled this insurance company to advertise to nearly 100,000 more households within the same ad buy. 
These compelling results led the insurance brand to make a multimillion-dollar ad commitment to Tubi throughout 2021. And the brand is also a FOX advertiser now as well. Expect more technology advancements and offerings in the months ahead. Tubi's tech stack, in general, will separate Tubi from lesser AVOD options for years to come. 
Tubi has also rapidly become a synergistic acquisition. We've had incredible success with advertisers who find their way to Tubi through existing relationships with other FOX brands. For instance, 50 advertisers who had not previously worked with Tubi chose to buy Tubi during the recent upfront season. By combining Tubi into our portfolio of advertisers, we reach brands that may have been unfamiliar with Tubi's unique and additive audience, nearly 50% of which doesn't have a pay-TV subscription. We have a laser focus on growth and monetization at Tubi. 
As we continue to invest in Tubi, we believe it will become the AVOD platform of choice for viewers and digital advertisers alike, and become a larger piece of the broader Fox Corporation business. Translating this financially, we expect Tubi revenues to more than double in the current fiscal year to exceed $300 million. And as we look out a few years, we envision Tubi becoming a $1 billion business and a core pillar of FOX. Tubi is a tremendous addition to our pre-existing portfolio of growing digital businesses, which we have built over time in a fiscally responsible manner. 
Over the first half of our fiscal year, our FOX News, Sports, Entertainment and Television Stations, digital businesses, have attracted more than 330 million average monthly users, over a 30% increase from the comparable period in the prior year. These users spent more than 160 billion minutes consuming our digital content during this time, an increase of more than 70% from the first half of fiscal 2020. 
Through these digital destinations, coupled with Tubi and Credible, we have generated well over $650 million of digital revenue through the first half of our fiscal year, with approximately 2/3 representing digital advertising revenues. These rapidly growing platforms, along with our must-have linear television brands and market-expanding partnerships, are exceeding expectations. As a united portfolio, they are even stronger with wide runways for the businesses to collaborate, retaining existing viewers, harnessing new audiences, engaging consumers in new ways and broadening the touch points users have with FOX. 
And now Steve will take us through the details of the quarter."

Highlighting the strength and momentum across our businesses, the company delivered double-digit growth in advertising revenues, along with underlying double-digit growth in affiliate revenues in our fiscal second quarte",1315,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning. Highlighting the strength and momentum across our businesses, the company delivered double-digit growth in advertising revenues, along with underlying double-digit growth in affiliate revenues in our fiscal second quarter. Our total advertising revenues increased 14%, with this strong growth led by the FOX Television Stations, the inclusion of Tubi and continued linear and digital strength at FOX News Media. 
As we previewed on our most recent earnings call, the growth at our Television Stations was driven by record political advertising revenues. When viewed across the entirety of our portfolio, we generated quarterly political advertising revenues of approximately $250 million, bringing our fiscal year-to-date to approximately $340 million. Total company affiliate revenues increased double digits on an underlying basis in the quarter, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and our focused portfolio of leadership channels. 
During the quarter, we recorded an accrual for potential distribution credits due to canceled college football games. While this credit was fully offset in our programming costs, on a reported basis, our total company affiliate revenue growth was 6%. This strength in our 2 most significant revenue streams drove total reported company revenues to $4.09 billion, up 8% over the comparative period in fiscal 2020. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $305 million, up $44 million over the comparative period in fiscal '20 due to the top line increases in revenues, partially offset by contractual annual escalators for our key sports franchises. 
Net income attributable to stockholders of $224 million or $0.37 per share was lower than the $300 million or $0.48 per share in the prior year quarter. This decrease was the result of higher gains recognized in other net in the prior year quarter, most notably from the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.16 per share was up $0.06 compared to last year's $0.10 per share, primarily reflecting the growth in EBITDA. 
Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, with Cable Network's EBITDA of $571 million, was up 3% on revenue growth of 1%. Cable advertising revenues increased 31%, with the record audiences and digital engagement at FOX News Media leading this growth. Underlying cable affiliate revenues increased mid-single digits. This growth was underpinned by rate increases, including double-digit pricing gains at FOX News Media, along with the moderation in the rate of industry subscriber erosion, which is currently trending at a little over 5%. 
As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, there were a number of COVID-19-related cancellations of college football games. As a result, we have recorded an accrual for the potential credit of certain distribution fees. While this credit reduces our reported cable affiliate revenues, it is broadly offset by a corresponding reduction in rights costs. Cable other revenues decreased by 32%, primarily due to lower sports sublicensing revenues, again, as a result of the cancellation of certain college football games due to COVID-19. These lower sublicensing revenues were also broadly offset by a corresponding reduction in rights costs. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment increased by $15 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted, partially offset by the shift of certain sports costs from our fiscal first quarter into our second quarter that we foreshadowed on our last call. 
The Television segment reported revenue growth of 13%, with the EBITDA loss improving $29 million to $185 million. Continuing the consistently strong growth we have delivered since the establishment of Fox Corp., Television affiliate revenues increased 23% in the quarter. This reflects double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. 
The growth in Television advertising revenues was driven by the record political advertising I mentioned earlier, coupled with the addition of revenues from the fast-growing Tubi. These factors were partially offset in the segment by lower sports advertising revenues, including the impact of COVID-related cancellations of certain college football games, along with the postponement of key scripted entertainment program. 
EBITDA at our Television segment increased $29 million over the prior year period. This reflects the revenue growth that I just noted as well as higher programming rights amortization of FOX Sports, primarily due to the contractual annual rights increases for our major sports franchises, including the NFL, and incremental costs due to the consolidation of Tubi. Partially offsetting these increases was lower programming rights amortization at FOX Entertainment due to the postponement of key scripted entertainment programming as a result of COVID-19. 
Turning now to free cash flow, which we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash invested in property, plant and equipment. In the quarter, we generated a free cash flow loss of $155 million, which is consistent with the seasonality of working capital in our business. Reflecting our continued confidence in the business and our balanced approach to capital allocation, today, we announced a semiannual dividend of $0.23 per share and continue to be active with our stock repurchase program. 
So far, this fiscal year, we have deployed $450 million of capital to repurchase approximately 11.3 million Class A shares and 4.9 million Class B shares. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased just over $1 billion, representing approximately 5.4% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash and $7.9 billion in debt. 
Looking through to the second half of our fiscal year. It is worth reminding you of a few factors that will impact comparability with the prior year. Starting with Sport in the current March quarter, we will comp against last year's broadcast of Super Bowl LIV on FOX. However, we did enjoy the benefit of 1 additional week of the regular season as well as the rotating divisional playoff game this January. 
Our plans also anticipate a timely start to the NASCAR and Major League Baseball season. However, as we have demonstrated in the past, we will adapt to any potential COVID-driven disruptions across our sports calendar. Meanwhile, from an Entertainment perspective, due to COVID-19, the launch of our key scripted titles on the FOX Network has shifted from the first half into the second half of our fiscal year, with completion of our full season still dependent on minimal future disruptions to production schedules. 
In terms of cash flow, we continue to anticipate relatively low working capital usage over the course of the full fiscal year. And as a result, the normal working capital deficit exhibited in this year's first half reverses in the second half of the year. As we've foreshadowed in the past, we continue to expect a higher level of capital expenditure in fiscal '21 to support the final phases of the build-out of our technical broadcast facility in Arizona and the upgrade of some of our local station facilities. 
With the majority of our full year advertising revenue already earned in the first half, a very light slate of affiliate renewals and a working capital tailwind that will build on our already ample liquidity, we approach the second half of this fiscal year from a position of financial strength. Assuming the continuation of a constructive macroeconomic environment, we intend to continue to deploy capital towards share repurchases and are targeting an additional $550 million in our fiscal second half to reach $1 billion in total buyback volume this fiscal year. 
To sum this all up, the results of our first 2 fiscal quarters demonstrate the strength of our underlying business. This operating momentum, combined with the benefits of strong free cash flow and liquidity and moderate leverage, position us particularly well for the future. 
And with that, I will now turn the call back to Joe."

Obviously, there's been a lot written about the network and the business in the press of late, and you guys just put up with a really strong first half of the year. Can you talk a little bit about the strategy to maintain leadership at the network, particularly sort of post the last administration, post the inauguration? And cord cutting is obviously out of everybody's control. 
But if you think about a mid-single-digit headwind on volume for that business, do you think you can grow cash flows over time? I asked because, at least when I look at the stock, it seems like the FOX News outlook is not being reflected in the stock price. So I'm curious if you think that business can grow even with the sort of industry headwinds that we're all aware about?"

You're right, a lot's been written about it, and there'll be a few more trees cut down. I think I'm writing about it in the days and weeks to come. Look, I think the fundamental -- look, me answer -- there's 2 parts to your question. But let me answer -- I'll answer both parts, but let me answer the first part broadly and then specifically. 
So look, in the journalism business, the journalism trade, you -- what you do, you work out what your market is, and you produce the best product you can possibly produce for that target market, right, for your readers or your listeners or your viewers. FOX News -- the success of FOX News throughout its entire history has been to provide the absolute best news and opinion for a market that we believe is firmly center-right. And we don't pivot or change that, and we haven't pivoted or changed that throughout the history of FOX News. 
So we'll continue to provide the best journalism with the best host, with the best analysis, with the best opinion going forward as we have throughout past news cycles. And we believe, where we're targeted to the center-right, is exactly where we should be targeted. It's where we've been. We don't need to go further right. We don't believe America is further right. And we're obviously not going to pivot left. All of our significant competitors are to the far left. So we'll stick where we are, and we think that's exactly right, and that's the best thing for the business and for our viewers. 
With that, we will see a return in our ratings dominance. As I said, we believe the center-right is where America's politics are. And we expected, as we foreshadowed in the last call, our ratings to be tempered after this election cycle, and we were right. We're down about 13% in ratings. If I go back to the Trump-Clinton election, CNN was down about 10% -- 17%, sorry, and CNN -- MSNBC, 10%. So CNN, 17%; MSNB -- sorry. Yes, that's right. CNN, 17%; MSNBC, 10%. And so we're right in between in that metric. So this is a cycle that we've seen before. It's a cycle we expected. We look forward to the news normalizing, and we will go on from strength-to-strength. 
The second part of your question, though, about really driving the business, continue to drive the business harder and continue to generate cash, I think we look at it in 2 different ways. One is obviously the pricing power of our affiliate revenue remains relatively untapped. We think we can continue to drive pricing for FOX News well ahead of any sort of volume declines in subscriber numbers. That's very clear to us looking forward. 
And I think the other part it is that the new businesses that we're driving out of FOX News Media. With FOX Nation, the FOX Business Channel is growing; the FOX digital, all of the FOX digital assets, FoxNews.com; and radio, FOX Radio. And now we announced this past quarter the launch -- the coming launch of FOX Weather. So when we look at FOX News Media, it really is a broader ecosystem of FOX News brands that are all growing and will all further contribute to growing EBITDA and cash going forward."

Nice to hear your voice as well. So first of all, from an advertising point of view, our strongest category in the station group is entertainment, which is pacing up 10% year-on-year.

So first of all, from an advertising point of view, our strongest category in the station group is entertainment, which is pacing up 10% year-on-year. Entertainment is really made up of 2 things. One is sort of streaming services and the second is sports betting. So absolutely the sort of wagering businesses, both locally and in the states where wagering is legal, but also in FanDuel and DraftKings is really helping drive local performance at the station group level. 
I don't have that sort of broken out as a -- not just even as a category, but as a subcategory in sports wagering for you, but it is in the very top growth tier for us. And then, obviously, so we're enjoying the growth of sports bettings and sports wagering on multiple fronts. One from an advertising fund at the local station level, but also obviously participating in it with FOX Bet and with our action -- our option in FanDuel. 
We are -- we're really incredibly excited about the opportunities for FOX Bet. The Super 6, we talked before on these calls and in person. The Super 6 funnel at the top of a FOX Bet is working very efficiently. We set ourselves a goal during this NFL season to reach over 4 million active users. Or I should say, to set a goal -- we ended up with a goal of 4 million. 
We started with a lower goal. We were tracking so well to middle of the football season that we increase the goal to actually 4.4 million users, which we achieved at the very end of the season. And that funnel is then successfully driving people into FOX Bet wagering, where it's licensed and legal. And we just launched on Michigan, January 26, and it was a very successful launch for us in that state. 
The -- I think we've talked about before, but the FanDuel option for our 18.5% is a 10-year option beginning this summer, I think it's June or July. And that option is based on fair market value, which was set with the Flutter acquisition of the Fastball stake in FanDuel. So we continue to be proponents and fans of the dual-brand strategy with FOX Bet, alongside with FanDuel in these markets. And we are enjoying our partnership, our deep partnership, an important of partnership with Flutter. 
As to the NFL, this is a growing business. Absolutely, the NFL understands that this is a business that's important to us. And it's important to how we are able to monetize our rights deals with them. I don't want to go into the detail of the NFL negotiations that I'm -- we continue to be in. We've been in for a while. We hope to bring those to a conclusion in the near to medium term. But the NFL is very aware of the importance of sports wager. I'm sure to us, and I am sure to others as well. 
Thank you for the question, Jessica."

The details are -- you've talked about the usage up 100% and advertising up 70%. So a view time up, 70% revenue up more than 100%, so CPMs are obviously expanding. I'm just curious what the level of ad pricing is now relative to, say, broadcast prime time, and where you see upside there? 
And you talked about Tubi being the leading AVOD platform in the future. And I'm just curious your view on competitive differentiation. I think a lot of content that ends up on these AVOD services is not exclusive. And so what do you think will attract Tubi -- people to Tubi versus other AVOD platforms that are out there?

So let me start, and Steve can jump in if I've forgotten any part of the question. So with Tubi, I'll answer your question honestly. But I'm not sure when I look at competitors' SVOD services, whether you prefer us to say would be profitable early, or we spend billions of dollars in investing in the business before we saw breakeven. 
Because certainly, our strategy is very different from our competitors' strategy. We see the SVOD competitive set as the potential to lose very many billions of dollars. We see it as very crowded. We see that it's very hard to stand apart and differentiate ourselves within SVOD. 
And that's why we've really chosen to embrace AVOD as our direct-to-consumer strategy. And we think we can do this for really 2 reasons. Well, let me say, what we hope to achieve out of this, what we will achieve out of this is really twofold. One, and just to be very clear because I spent a lot of words in my preamble to this call, talking about Tubi. But if the headline wasn't clear, it is that we expect to win in AVOD. We expect to win in AVOD and be the leading AVOD player in this country. 
And secondly, we expect to be able to do it by reinvesting our profits, but not by losing billions of dollars in programming costs or other costs in the time it takes to breakeven. Because of those 2 things, we will drive Tubi very aggressively. We will hit $1 billion in the medium-term or near-term in revenue, and the business will ultimately become a very profitable one for us. 
The other elements of the question, I think, on sort of our broadcast CPMs versus digital CPMs. Our digital CPMs are lower than broadcast. They're in sort of the high teens. Obviously, some of the tech stack allows us to drive that further. And Steve, did I miss any other part?"

But I think the way you should think about it is, in the near term, if you look back over the last 6 months, Tubi has actually been P&L neutral for us from a bottom line perspective. We would expect that to change over the course of the second half as we continue to invest in the growth. 
And then over time, as we take our foot off the gas in terms of investing in growth, you see some pretty good conversion of revenue into bottom line margin as this business gets to scale. So -- and when you look at that revenue development in the near term, Lachlan is absolutely right in terms of where CPMs are. But where we see a lot of headroom, where we've gotten a lot of growth from in the initial phase has just been fill rate. And so -- and there's still plenty of headroom to take that further north."

So first of all, we see NBC Sports, the announcement of it shutting down as probably a net positive for FOX Sports 1. There's a less competition, I suppose, although we never saw them as our main competition. This year, FOX Sports 1 beat both ESPN 2 and NBCSN for an entire year for the first time ever. So we feel very well positioned. 
Obviously, with COVID and with some sports being less available, opinion programming, which is obviously very reliable and you don't have the high rights costs, accounted for 35% of the FOX Sports 1 schedule and over 20% of viewing, which I think is an important statistic. It shows that you can be compelling, and you can win with a mix of both live sports, but also with the sports analysis and opinion that FOX Sports 1 has. 
Clearly, having a breadth of sports platforms will ultimately help FOX Bet and our partnership also with FanDuel. I'd also include in that, obviously, is the local stations and the amount of time and effort the local stations in their news and in their sports broadcasting also contribute to promoting FOX Bet and engaging also with our partners at FanDuel. 
The last part there in terms about sort of sports rights. I think the thing that FOX has always had as part of its DNA is really a focus on the major sports rights as well. So it's obviously Major League Baseball, the NFL, WWE. And so our focus on our bouquet of sports is really the big sports that are going to move the needle, and not so much in smaller -- still great sports, but smaller sports for other platforms."

And in the -- in this last quarter, we're talking about, obviously, the impact of political, as we've discussed, Alexia, has just been tremendous.

And in the -- in this last quarter, we're talking about, obviously, the impact of political, as we've discussed, Alexia, has just been tremendous. I'd be tempted to say we'll never see a political season so big, but I don't think that's true. I think when you have a senate and a house so finely balanced, I think we're going to see these records broken in 2 years and 4 years, for sure. 
So the spending was pretty staggering. Obviously, we had the additional bonus of sorts with the Atlanta station and the Georgia runoff, which I think contributed to -- I'm not sure if it's just a runoff, but the Atlanta station alone contributed about $60 million of political revenue in itself. So in the past quarter, obviously, the story, the headline is all political. 
I think in the current quarter, obviously, we have difficult comps because of the Super Bowl, and us having had the Super Bowl last year, which, by the way, rated -- almost 102 million viewers. It was a terrific Super Bowl and a great achievement. That, obviously, if you take that comp out, so we strip out the Super Bowl revenue, we're pacing in the negative single -- mid-single digits, maybe even a little bit better than that. So mid-single-digit is down 5%, 6% is where we would expect to end up in local advertising for the quarter. 
That's a tremendous improvement if we look through COVID from a year ago, right? Every quarter, every month, we've seen advertisers come back. And that we are stripping out football and stripping out political and everything else, we're about back to where we'd expect to be year-on-year. 
Of course, looking forward, the comps become much better because we will have been -- we'll be comparing to the first quarter that was COVID impacted versus now being in a more normalized advertising environment. From a categories point of view, I think I mentioned in response to Jessica's question, entertainment leads the categories. The home, professional services, all strong. I should just mention, on the flip side, that automotive, which is obviously a very large category for us, is still down, but this is primarily driven, excuse the pun, by domestic manufacturers. In fact, foreign auto spending is roughly flat.

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. 
Once again, we have delivered a quarter of exceptional financial results, underscoring our ability to execute on our operating plan, while making great progress on our longer-term growth initiatives. Financially, we generated approximately $900 million of EBITDA, nearly as much as we did in the prior year quarter when we had the benefit of a record-breaking Super Bowl on Fox. This past quarter, our total company affiliate revenues increased by double digits, once again highlighting that our set of essential brands, coupled with a focused strategy yields consistent industry-leading results. Our advertising performance was equally notable. Despite the tough Super Bowl comparisons in the prior year, as we continue to see robust advertiser demand for not only our national and local linear assets, but for tube and our broader digital portfolio as well. Steve will give further details on these and other financial highlights. In a moment. Over recent quarters, market commentary has indicated a focus on ratings trends at FOX News and on the outcome of renewal negotiations with the NFL. Our achievements in these areas are entirely consistent with the positive expectations that we have long been communicating to you. 
Our clear leadership in news, coupled with the long-term renewal of the NFL, and provides a strong foundation to grow our company for years to come. Let me address each one of them individually. We have for the last several quarters, been exceptionally forthcoming and utterly transparent about our expected outlook for FOX News ratings throughout the election cycle. Last November, immediately prior to the presidential election, we shared our belief that post election, the appetite for news would moderate and that a proportion of the record audiences that we were seeing would migrate back to the comfort of sports and entertainment content. At that time, what we did not anticipate was the short but heightened new cycle that immediately followed the election and that clearly benefited our competition. 
Last quarter, we experienced a post-election audience pullback that we anticipated. We also shared our confidence that the overall news audience would normalize back to pre-election levels. Through maintaining our dedication to providing America's Best news, analysis and opinion, we had no doubt that the FOX News channel would regain its cable news ratings lead. I'm pleased to report that what we have shared with you over the last 2 earnings calls is precisely what has transpired. Since the second                 trial, FOX News regained its leadership position and maintained that leading spot ever since, averaging a 40% share of total day and prime time cable news audiences. Over this time, FOX News audience levels have held relatively firm when compared to our competition. That have seen their audiences drop significantly. With MSNBC losing approximately 1/3 of its audience and CNN losing over half -- over half of its audience. In fact, the FOX News channel finished this last quarter as the most watched cable network in primetime and finished March as the most watched cable news network overall. 
Calendar year-to-date, the FOX News channel is, again, the top-rated cable news network, an achievement that reflects a return to the leadership position that we expect not just to maintain, but to grow. Fortifying this success of the long thought out programming changes that we started implementing following the election and that have continued over the past several months. In April, the Fox News channel debuted the late night program Gut Felt! The exclamation Mark is a propose as since its launch, the show has averaged over 1.5 million viewers per night, representing a 25% increase in the 11:00 p.m. to midnight comp period versus the month prior. To put this into context, Gut Felt is drawing an audience that is roughly the same size as                 live and larger than the tonight show. Despite Fox News reaching fewer households than the broadcast networks. Our success at Fox News media over the past quarter is not limited to our cable networks. Fox Nation, the direct-to-consumer offering from Fox News media also had an impressive quarter with the highest number of customer acquisitions since launch, and this momentum, which is carried over into the current quarter. Since mid-February, Fox Nation has seen a 40% increase in subscriber growth. The key drivers of this growth are the streaming of live events and the premier of exclusive flagship content, including the streaming of                 in February and the launch of Tucker Carlson content, including a new video podcast series entitled Tucker Carlson Today and long-form documentaries entitled Tucker Carlson Originals. 
Given the success that we have seen with this content, you should anticipate us to continue to invest in new programming for Fox Nation in the quarters ahead to further increase engagement with our current subscribers and to attract new customers. Turning to the other important business development I mentioned. We are immensely pleased with our renewal agreement with the NFL. Fox will continue as the home of the Sunday NFC package, the most valuable rights package in the NFL portfolio for the next 13 seasons. A just one reference point of its value to Fox. The Sunday NFC package has been the most watched NFL package for the past 15 years. Our NFC coverage is an important foundation for the Fox network and strategic aligns with our local stations, where we own and operate the Fox affiliate in 14 of the 16 NFC markets. Maintaining the Sunday NFC package is a significant programming milestone for our own stations and their local business partners and for a national affiliate base as well. In addition to our NFC package, we also added new and exclusive holiday games and secured rights to broadcast 4 of the next 12 super Bowls. Fiscally, we are very comfortable with the scale of the new rights package, coupled with our decision not to renew the Thursday night package. While we could not discuss this while we were in negotiations, our intent was always to release Thursday night and focus our future NFL investment solely on Sunday afternoon. Not only will we exit Thursday night, but we also took the opportunity to do so 1 year in advance of the expiration of our existing deal with Amazon, assuming their rights to the '22 and '23 season -- or '22, '23 season. Importantly, our NFL renewal also broadens and enhances our package of digital rights, providing us with the necessary flexibility and optionality to maximize all linear and digital opportunities in the future. Regardless of the way our businesses may change, our rights package provides us the ability to continue to evolve our business model. For example, we'll be increasing our digital programming right away by using our expanded digital rights to launch an NFO branded VOD channel on Tubi this coming season. Another important element of the new NFL deal relates to Fox Bet. Fox extended its rights to continue supporting America's leading free-to-play wagering game, Fox Bet Super 6. Additionally, Fox Bet has been designated and authorized Sportsbook operator by the NFL. And we hope to share more details on the launch of NFL related integrations in the quarters ahead. The opportunity presented by uniting a leading media brand with prominent betting assets and influencers is tremendous. We continue to see substantial growth and revenue upside in this market and are investing to further expand and enhance our presence. Today, I'm pleased to announce an agreement to acquire Play Travis' leading sports news and opinion platform OutKick. OutKick is a natural complement to several of our brands and will deepen our investment in the sports wagering ecosystem. As a leader in sports opinion and pop culture content, OutKick provides clear overlap with their businesses and areas of expertise. Importantly, OutKick also creates content about sports wagering and currently has an exclusive marketing arrangement with FanDuel that has proven remarkably successful. I want to welcome Clay and the OutKick team to Fox. 
Speaking of successful sports wagering businesses, we highly value our various partnerships with the Flutter group. Currently, we are both looking to clarify our ongoing arrangements through our pending arbitration. While the arbitration process is ongoing, we do not expect to make any further comment about it. 
Turning to a couple of other areas. The harmonious mix of leading sports and entertainment on the Fox network continues to prove a winning combination. Season to date, Fox is the #1 broadcast network for all prime time programming. Fox Entertainment programming, such as top unscripted shows like the Mass Singer and I can see voice and leading dramas like 911 and 911 Lone Star are delivering big audiences. We are deep in our program development process and are enthusiastic about the new shows coming to the network this Fall. As we anticipate a return to a normalized Fall schedule, we are actively involved in our early upfront process, and we are engaged with the leading agencies and brands about our respective plans. 
Brands are eagerly anticipating the pent-up consumer demand following COVID, and Fox offers the best place to invest in multi platform, multi genre advertising commitments. Because of this, the very healthy current scatter market and the overall improving economic outlook, I am optimistic that there will be substantial demand across all of our platforms during the upfront, as we look to deliver solutions for advertisers. 
To that end, we are deeply integrating Tubi into this year's upfront discussions. The unmatched reach of broadcast network television and the substantial digital audience of Tubi presents a unique opportunity for our advertising partners. Our decision to acquire Tubi was present and we are focused on its growth plan over the near term. In the short period, we have owned it, it is already exceeding all of our expectations. And we continue to find innovative ways to expand its product offering and propel its growth. 
In terms of operating performance, in the month of March, Tubi's reach increased over 30% as measured by viewers, and now reaches 40 million monthly active users. But as we have shared before, we are intently focused on engagement, as measured by total view time or TVT, because that is what we monetize. To that end, Tubi generated over 275-million hours of total view time streamed in March, a monthly record for the platform. To be also set a record for total view time in the third quarter with nearly 800-million hours streamed, up more than 50% year-over-year. And this is on top of the exponential growth the platform experienced in 2020, where Tubi streamed more than 2.5 billion hours of content. We also shared additional demographic info for Tubi as part of its impressive new front presentation earlier this week. The median age of the platform's viewers is 37 years. That's 20 years younger than linear TV. Nearly 40% of Tubi's audience identifies as multicultural, and over 2/3 of its audience does not watch other ad-supported streaming services. Tubi truly broadens the reach of network television and allows our advertising partners to access a substantial incremental digital audience. And an audience that is not readily consuming other AVOD services as well. The increase in viewers, total viewtime and the unmatched advertising opportunity has translated into significant year-over-year revenue gains. Tubi's quarterly revenue increased over 150% compared to the same period last year. The power of Fox's promotional sales and content synergies are accelerating Tubi's business. Putting it on a path to be $1 billion revenue business in the coming years. On the content side, Tubi has now expanded its library to over 30,000 titles, comprising of movies and series from all major Hollywood studios. 
Additionally, we are continuing to make more FOX programs available on the platform. Tubi features key Fox titles, including the Mass Singer, I can see your voice and Lego Masters, among others. And while Tubi continues to expand this library, it will also soon be home through its own original content. This Fall, Tubi will introduce approximately 150 hours of original content, including movies and documentaries produced by Fox alternative entertainment and animated films produced by Bento Box. Contrary to the strategy of the major SVOD services, Tubi's goal is to turbocharge certain genres of content that already make Tubi successful. And thereby allow us to super serve certain segments of Tubi's audience. 
Again, all to continue to drive engagement and therefore, monetization to new heights. And the good news is, given Tubi's best-in-class tech stack, we will be able to measure the ROI on the original content investment as we go. Another important differentiator of Tubi's content is live local news. Tubi recently closed deals with Scripps and Cox to bring an additional 20 local new stations to the platform later this year. These added stations extend news on Tubi's reach to 24 of the Top 25 markets. Underpinning the news on Tubi, offering our live local news feeds from 18 owned and operated Fox television stations. In total, News on Tubi will carry nearly 100 local station feeds in 2021, covering 58 DMAs and offering the most robust local news offering of any free streaming service. Another digital achievement across the company is the growth we are seeing at Fox television stations. Digital ad sales at our core stations were up nearly 40% compared to the third quarter last year. Our multiyear strategic investment to further build our digital capabilities and enhance our digital product and advertising teams at the stations are yielding great results. 
Across the entire company, we surpassed $1 billion in digital revenues for the third quarter year-to-date. Our owned and operated stations are also benefiting from the ongoing lifting of covid restrictions. The financial services category and the entertainment category, which includes gaming, are performing particularly well. We are optimistic that this trajectory will continue as restaurants, retail and other businesses continue to reopen in the large metro areas where our stations are located. 
Even despite Covid related disruptions, our fiscal year-to-date has been characterized by an operating and financial performance that has exceeded even our own high standards and our initial expectations. Our core businesses provide a stable foundation for the opportunities that will propel our future growth. We are optimistic about the current fourth quarter and look forward to milestones in fiscal 2022 that include the return of our full sports and entertainment lineups, the beginning of the midterm election season, investments in the growth of Tubi and Fox Nation, the launch of Fox weather and the integration of Outkick. We continue to capitalize on the ongoing momentum of our core brands as well as capturing the added growth from the initiatives I've discussed today. And now with that, Steve will take us through the details of this impressive quarter."

Having delivered another strong quarter, we are encouraged by the robust underlying trends that underpin our distribution and advertising revenues, and our strategic investments are exceeding expectations, highlighted",1098,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Having delivered another strong quarter, we are encouraged by the robust underlying trends that underpin our distribution and advertising revenues, and our strategic investments are exceeding expectations, highlighted by the trajectory of Tubi. Before reviewing our financial performance for the quarter, it is worth noting at the outset that our third quarter results are comparing against our broadcast of Super Bowl   54   in the prior corresponding quarter. Which accounted for approximately $500 million of net advertising revenue and approximately $100 million of EBITDA across the company last year. Where appropriate, I will share both our reported results and the underlying performance when excluding the impact of Super Bowl 54. 
Now turning to our results for the current quarter. Our leadership brands and focused portfolio of assets delivered double-digit growth in total company affiliate revenues and mid single-digit growth in underlying total company advertising revenues. Excluding the benefit of the Super Bowl in the prior year quarter and the consolidation of Tubi in the current year quarter. Total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, with 18% growth at the television segment and healthy 6% growth at the cable segment. Meanwhile, the rate of subscriber declines continued to moderate in the quarter, with trailing 12-month industry sub losses running at approximately 4.5%. Our reported advertising revenues declined 24% in the quarter due to the absence of the prior year broadcast of Super Bowl 54 and a slower news cycle. Despite the headwinds from comparability, our brands continue to deliver robust CPM growth across the portfolio, led by the Fox Network and Fox News. Encouragingly, our core local television stations ex Super Bowl political and the impact of the NASCAR transaction returned to growth across the base market in the quarter. Meanwhile, advertising revenue growth at Tubi continues to exceed expectations. 
Today, we anticipate reaching revenue of $350 million for the current fiscal year, which is up from the $300 million forecast we shared with you on our last earnings call. Putting it all together, reported total company revenues of $3.22 billion were down 7% over the comparative period in fiscal '20. Excluding the impact of Super Bowl and the acquisition of Tubi, underlying total company revenues increased mid-single digits. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $899 million, down 2% over the comparative period in fiscal '20. Excluding last year's Super Bowl contribution, quarterly adjusted EBITDA grew low double digits, led by continued growth at the cable network segment. Net income attributable to stockholders of $567 million or $0.96 per share was notably higher than the $  78   million or $0.13 per share in the prior year quarter. This was primarily the result of movements recognized in other net, including the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.88 was up slightly from last year's $0.93, primarily reflecting the comparative items that I've just mentioned. Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Our cable network reported a 7% increase in EBITDA on essentially stable revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 6%, once again, led by double-digit pricing gains at FOX News and continued moderation in the rate of industry subscriber erosion. Cable advertising revenues decreased 7%, as continued strength in linear pricing and digital commercialization at Fox news media was more than offset by the elevated linear audience levels of the prior year. Cable other revenues fell 24%, and primarily due to the lower sports sublicensing revenues and the absence of paper view boxing events in the current year, both due to COVID as well as the disposition of our sports marketing businesses. EBITDA at our cable segment increased by $58 million over the prior year and benefited from lower costs at Fox sports, including the absence of the prior year's Super Bowl Week studio shows and production cost efficiencies. Our television segment reported a 12% decline in revenues and an $89 million decline in EBITDA, both of which principally reflects the absence of the prior year contribution from the broadcast of Super Bowl 54. 
Television affiliate revenues increased   18  % in the quarter. This robust growth reflects double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non owned station affiliates, and for our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations and reaffirms we are on track to achieve the television affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day. Television advertising revenues declined by 28%, primarily due to the absence of the prior year Super Bowl, partially offset by the benefit this quarter from the timing of our NFL week 17 double header and the rotating NFL divisional playoff game. Meanwhile, on the back of the increase in total view time Lachlan mentioned earlier, Tubi set another advertising record this time for the March quarter, which seasonally is its slowest quarter. Other revenues at television increased 21%, led by higher co-production revenues at Fox Entertainment and higher content revenues at Bento Box. 
Turning now to cash flow. In the quarter, we generated strong free cash flow of $1.54 billion, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming and the result of our sports rates payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. Year-to-date, we have deployed $825 million of capital to repurchase approximately 19 million Class-A shares and nearly 8 million Class-B shares and are on track to complete the $1 billion of share repurchases this fiscal year that we announced on our last call. Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion we have now cumulative fleet repurchased over $1.42 billion, representing approximately 7% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. The from a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.77 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt. As we look to the final quarter of our fiscal year, we expect continued progress in affiliate revenue growth and for our advertising revenues to strongly outpace prior year, driven in large part by the strong rebound in local advertising sales as well as the acquisition of Tubi. While this top line growth in the quarter will be more than offset by our investments in the Tubi and Fox News media digital platforms as well as higher programming costs due to the return of normal sports and entertainment schedules we expect to deliver full year revenues and EBITDA comfortably ahead of fiscal 2020 despite the challenges of cohort and the comparison to a super bowl year. And with that, I'll now hand the call back to Joe."

If you have a view on that yet to be interested. And then as you go-to-market in the upfront and think about even the $350 million guidance you've given, how do we think about how incremental that is? In other words, I guess there's an argument that maybe some of that money is just coming out of Fox broadcast with out of one pocket and to the other.

So first of all, on Tubi, the programming strategy at Tubi, is entirely as we've discussed. And this is a critical difference between Tubi and certainly the other subscription video on-demand services and the hybrid advertising into subscription video on-demand services that we see our competitors operating. And the Tubi is entirely focused on total viewing time. And the reason we're entirely focused on total viewing time is because that translates directly into revenue. So the more we can grow total viewing time, and this is as opposed to purely users or in SVOD service subscribers, the more we can grow total viewing time, we can translate that very directly into increased advertising revenues. And so when we look at our program strategy, we're not interested in spending billions of dollars as the others are on sort of driving subscriber bases with very expensive programming. What we're interested in doing is very efficiently scaling our programming to drive our total viewing time. And we can do this because of the technology, we can really target specific genres and specific cohorts of our viewers to drive their total view on time and hence drive revenue. So it directly correlates. So we've had a record total viewing time in the last months. And completely correlates with having -- driving record revenue. So that's a business model, and that fits into the sort of the efficiency of our programming strategy. Do the second question in terms of were we moving money from one pocket to the other? Absolutely not. I don't know -- while I'm sure you did have the opportunity to watch the Tubi presentation at the new front just a few days ago. The -- what Tubi allows for us and frankly, for any advertiser that's also advertising and broadcast, it allows them to increase their reach dramatically. The advertisers are trying to reach new viewers and viewers that don't traditionally watch broadcast, they're younger, they're more diverse. They really need to go to Tubi to reach those audiences. They can't reach them anywhere else. So what that allows us to do is really expand both the amount of the partnership, the scale of partnership with our current advertisers, but also find new advertisers that we haven't enjoyed our relationship with before."

So you could -- if I forget any, please remind me, it's good to hear your voice. So first, on Tubi, and I think it was the further investment in Tubi, we're really focused on being very efficient, being very disciplined around an investment in Tubi, while at the same time, not losing sight of the immense opportunity that the Tubi is. I think we've designed our programming strategy and our marketing strategy around that. So a lot of the investment you will see will be a combination of continuing to sign the revenue and what would have been sort of profitability of Tubi back into growing the business. And adding some modest for capital in addition to that. So it's not a tremendous sized investment when it comes to sort of the scale of Fox. But we think it's appropriate given the opportunity that Tubi presents us. On Thursday Night football, I think you asked what the effect on retransmission would be. The logic behind being able to release there's no football, not to follow it in the new deal and indeed to release it a year early, is that we don't think it gives us incremental retransmission revenue above what we already get for the premium NFL package in the country, which is Sunday afternoon NFC package. So due to that, we can really save the cost of the thursday night football package and invest further in Sunday, retaining all of our potential retransmission revenue through Sunday football. On sports betting, there's a couple of questions, but I think the impact of sports betting on the ecosystem, sports betting in every market where there is licensed operators. They are spending heavily, which is a terrific benefit to our station, our station groups. We think this will continue. It's a very competitive market. And this won't ameliorate anytime soon. All the more reason why we consider further investment in it, outkick is a great example as sort of a leading operator in both sports news and critically in sports opinion. You haven't seen outkick or listen to any of its podcasts or radio shows or being to its website, you should. It's really a unique and special voice. And I think the 1 that aligns with the Fox audience incredibly well. So we're very excited to bring that team to be part of ours."

Broadly, it almost seems like a pivot in the business model where you guys were the loss leaders in football in the mid-90s and one slice of football and investing in other areas. Is that how we should think about the investment priorities going forward, which is potentially new areas become bigger priorities for investment and legacy television broadly becomes a cash source to pivot your business model. And then broadly, when you think about the broadcast business, football is, of course, important. But what role does it have in the broader ecosystem? I mean it is structurally in decline with respect to pay TV subscribers? And the kind of role it used to play in the past with respect to reach is very different versus what it plays today. So if you could just expand on the portfolio on the legacy television side and what the strategic priorities are across your portfolio?"

Look, I think our so-called legacy television businesses are all very healthy. And we expect it to grow them significantly. But when you look at them from a point of view in terms of how we grow and how we -- I think you use the word pivot our business model going forward, you have to look at what they can offer with broader opportunities to monetize their existing content, right? And their existing genre of content. So if you look in the sports business, the sports business is really what's driving our wagering business, right, on our bedding business. You're going to see us be really one of the major players, certainly from a media point of view in the sports waging business in America going forward. We're going to continue to exploit that marketplace and to grow in that marketplace. And that's really driven off the -- our engagement with our audiences through our sports broadcasting business. We wouldn't have nearly the opportunity, I believe, in wagering stand-alone without coupling it with the FOX sports and overall brand and Fox audience. And this can be seen here very clearly through our success with Fox Bet Super 6. Fox Bet Super 6, in the last year, we grew very aggressively through marketing it across all of our platforms, Fox Sports, Fox Entertainment, FOX News, and we drove to over 5 million users. There's no other free-to-play game like that at that scale in the United States. And what that allows us to do with Fox Bet Super 6 obviously is in the markets where we're licensed, drive that traffic or drive that sort of the widest part of that funnel. In sports wagering and also the Poker and casino businesses where they're licensed. So there's a tremendous opportunity there, but it's really because of our strength in our traditional sports broadcasting business. The same thing, by the way, is true at Fox News. We branded the Fox News business is Fox News media, I think a couple of years ago. And that's really because you can't look at Fox News anymore as just a linear cable channel. The opportunities at Fox News to grow revenue beyond the impressive growth within cable is really through its powerful website, it's podcasting, Fox Nation, new channels like Fox Weather, where we're seeing tremendous opportunities to expand its reach and the power of its brands."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our third quarter results.  
Once again, we have delivered a quarter of exceptional financial results, underscoring our ability to execute on our operating plan, while making great progress on our longer-term growth initiatives. Financially, we generated approximately $900 million of EBITDA, nearly as much as we did in the prior year quarter when we had the benefit of a record-breaking Super Bowl on Fox. 
This past quarter, our total company affiliate revenues increased by double digits, once again highlighting that our set of essential brands, coupled with a focused strategy yields consistent industry-leading results. Our advertising performance was equally notable. Despite the tough Super Bowl comparisons in the prior year, as we continue to see robust advertiser demand for not only our national and local linear assets, but for Tubi and our broader digital portfolio as well. Steve will give further details on these and other financial highlights. In a moment. 
Over recent quarters, market commentary has indicated a focus on ratings trends at FOX News and on the outcome of renewal negotiations with the NFL. Our achievements in these areas are entirely consistent with the positive expectations that we have long been communicating to you. Our clear leadership in news, coupled with the long-term renewal of the NFL, provides a strong foundation to grow our company for years to come. Let me address each one of them individually. 
We have for the last several quarters, been exceptionally forthcoming and utterly transparent about our expected outlook for FOX News ratings throughout the election cycle. Last November, immediately prior to the presidential election, we shared our belief that post election, the appetite for news would moderate and that a proportion of the record audiences that we were seeing would migrate back to the comfort of sports and entertainment content. At that time, what we did not anticipate was the short, but heightened new cycle that immediately followed the election and that clearly benefited our competition.
Last quarter, we experienced a post-election audience pullback that we anticipated. We also shared our confidence that the overall news audience would normalize back to pre-election levels. Through maintaining our dedication to providing America's best news, analysis and opinion, we had no doubt that the FOX News channel would regain its cable news ratings lead. I'm pleased to report that what we have shared with you over the last 2 earnings calls is precisely what has transpired. Since the second impeachment filed, FOX News regained its leadership position and maintained that leading spot ever since, averaging a 40% share of total day and primetime cable news audiences. 
Over this time, FOX News audience levels have held relatively firm when compared to our competition. That have seen their audiences drop significantly. With MSNBC losing approximately 1/3 of its audience and CNN losing over half, over half of its audience. In fact, the FOX News channel finished this last quarter as the most watched Cable Network in primetime and finished March as the most watched cable news network overall.  
Calendar year-to-date, the FOX News channel is, again, the top-rated cable news network, an achievement that reflects a return to the leadership position that we expect not just to maintain but to grow. 
Fortifying this success are the long thought out programming changes that we started implementing following the election and that have continued over the past several months. In April, the Fox News channel debuted the late-night program Gutfeld! The exclamation mark is a propose as since its launch, the show has averaged over 1.5 million viewers per night, representing a 25% increase in the 11:00 p.m. to midnight time period versus the month prior. To put this into context, Gutfeld! is drawing an audience that is roughly the same size as Jimmy Kimmel Live! and larger than The Tonight Show. Despite Fox News reaching fewer households than the broadcast networks. 
Our success at Fox News Media over the past quarter is not limited to our cable networks. Fox Nation, the direct-to-consumer offering from Fox News Media also had an impressive quarter with the highest number of customer acquisitions since launch. And this momentum, which is carried over into the current quarter. Since mid-February, Fox Nation has seen a 40% increase in subscriber growth. The key drivers of this growth are the streaming of live events and the premier of exclusive flagship content, including the streaming of CPAC in February and the launch of Tucker Carlson content, including a new video podcast series entitled Tucker Carlson Today and long-form documentaries entitled Tucker Carlson Originals. 
Given the success that we have seen with this content, you should anticipate us to continue to invest in new programming for Fox Nation in the quarters ahead to further increase engagement with our current subscribers and to attract new customers. Turning to the other important business development I mentioned. We are immensely pleased with our renewal agreement with the NFL. Fox will continue as the home of the Sunday NFC package, the most valuable rights package in the NFL portfolio for the next 13 seasons. 
I just wan to reference point of its value to Fox. The Sunday NFC package has been the most watched NFL package for the past 15 years. Our NFC coverage is an important foundation for the Fox Network and strategic aligns with our local stations, where we own and operate the Fox affiliate in 14 of the 16 NFC markets. Maintaining the Sunday NFC package is a significant programming milestone for our own stations and their local business partners and for a national affiliate base as well. 
In addition to our NFC package, we also added new and exclusive holiday games and secured rights to broadcast 4 of the next 12 Super Bowls. Fiscally, we are very comfortable with the scale of the new rights package, coupled with our decision not to renew the Thursday night package. While we could not discuss this while we were in negotiations, our intent was always to release Thursday night and focus our future NFL investment solely on Sunday afternoon. Not only will we exit Thursday night, but we also took the opportunity to do so 1 year in advance of the expiration of our existing deal with Amazon, assuming their rights to the '22 and '23 season -- or 22/23 season. Importantly, our NFL renewal also broadens and enhances our package of digital rights, providing us with the necessary flexibility and optionality to maximize all linear and digital opportunities in the future. Regardless of the way our businesses may change, our rights package provides us the ability to continue to evolve our business model. 
For example, we'll be increasing our digital programming right away by using our expanded digital rights to launch an NFL branded VOD channel on Tubi this coming season. Another important element of the new NFL deal relates to Fox Bet. Fox extended its rights to continue supporting America's leading free-to-play wagering game, Fox Bet Super 6. Additionally, FOX Bet has been designated and authorized Sportsbook operator by the NFL. And we hope to share more details on the launch of NFL related integrations in the quarters ahead. The opportunity presented by uniting a leading media brand with prominent betting assets and influencers is tremendous. We continue to see substantial growth and revenue upside in this market and are investing to further expand and enhance our presence. 
Today, I'm pleased to announce an agreement to acquire Clay Travis' leading sports news and opinion platform OutKick. OutKick is a natural complement to several of our brands and will deepen our investment in the sports wagering ecosystem. As a leader in sports opinion and pop culture content, OutKick provides clear overlap with our businesses and areas of expertise. Importantly, OutKick also creates content about sports wagering and currently has an exclusive marketing arrangement with FanDuel that has proven remarkably successful. I want to welcome Clay and the OutKick team to Fox. 
Speaking of successful sports wagering businesses, we highly value our various partnerships with the Flutter group. Currently, we are both looking to clarify our ongoing arrangements through our pending arbitration. While the arbitration process is ongoing, we do not expect to make any further comment about it.  
Turning to a couple of other areas. The harmonious mix of leading sports and entertainment on the Fox Network continues to prove a winning combination. Season to date, Fox is the #1 broadcast network for all primetime programming. Fox Entertainment programming, such as top unscripted shows like The Masked Singer and I Can See Your Voice and leading dramas like 9-1-1 and 9-1-1: Lone Star are delivering big audiences. We are deep in our program development process and are enthusiastic about the new shows coming to the network this Fall. 
As we anticipate a return to a normalized Fall schedule, we are actively involved in our early upfront process, and we are engaged with the leading agencies and brands about our respective plans. Brands are eagerly anticipating the pent-up consumer demand following COVID, and Fox offers the best place to invest in multi-platform, multi-genre advertising commitments. Because of this, the very healthy current scatter market and the overall improving economic outlook, I am optimistic that there will be substantial demand across all of our platforms during the upfront, as we look to deliver solutions for advertisers.  
To that end, we are deeply integrating Tubi into this year's upfront discussions. The unmatched reach of broadcast network television and the substantial digital audience of Tubi presents a unique opportunity for our advertising partners. Our decision to acquire Tubi was present and we are focused on its growth plan over the near term. In the short period, we have owned it, it is already exceeding all of our expectations. And we continue to find innovative ways to expand its product offering and propel its growth.  
In terms of operating performance, in the month of March, Tubi's reach increased over 30% as measured by viewers, and now reaches 40 million monthly active users. But as we have shared before, we are intently focused on engagement, as measured by total view time or TVT, because that is what we monetize. To that end, Tubi generated over 275-million hours of total view time streamed in March, a monthly record for the platform. Tubi also set a record for total view time in the third quarter with nearly 800-million hours streamed, up more than 50% year-over-year. 
And this is on top of the exponential growth the platform experienced in 2020, where Tubi streamed more than 2.5 billion hours of content. We also shared additional demographic info for Tubi as part of its impressive new front presentation earlier this week. The median age of the platform's viewers is 37 years. That's 20 years younger than linear TV. Nearly 40% of Tubi's audience identifies as multicultural, and over 2/3 of its audience does not watch other ad-supported streaming services. Tubi truly broadens the reach of network television and allows our advertising partners to access -- to asset -- to access a substantial incremental digital audience. 
And an audience that is not readily consuming other AVOD services as well. The increase in viewers, total view time and the unmatched advertising opportunity has translated into significant year-over-year revenue gains. Tubi's quarterly revenue increased over 150% compared to the same period last year. The power of Fox's promotional sales and content synergies are accelerating Tubi's business. Putting it on a path to be $1 billion revenue business in the coming years. On the content side, Tubi has now expanded its library to over 30,000 titles, comprising of movies and series from all major Hollywood studios.  
Additionally, we are continuing to make more FOX programs available on the platform. Tubi features key Fox titles, including The Mass Singer, I Can See Your Voice and LEGO Masters, among others. And while Tubi continues to expand this library, it will also soon be home through its own original content. This Fall, Tubi will introduce approximately 150 hours of original content, including movies and documentaries produced by Fox or alternative entertainment and animated films produced by Bento Box. Contrary to the strategy of the major SVOD services, Tubi's goal is to turbocharge certain genres of content that already make Tubi successful. And thereby allow us to super serve certain segments of Tubi's audience.
Again, all to continue to drive engagement and therefore, monetization to new heights. And the good news is, given Tubi's best-in-class tech stack, we will be able to measure the ROI on the original content investment as we go. Another important differentiator of Tubi's content is live local news. Tubi recently closed deals with Scripps and Cox to bring an additional 20 local new stations to the platform later this year. These added stations extend news on Tubi's reach to 24 of the top 25 markets. Underpinning the news on Tubi, offering our live local news feeds from 18 owned and operated Fox Television Stations. 
In total, News on Tubi will carry nearly 100 local station feeds in 2021, covering 58 DMAs and offering the most robust local news offering of any free streaming service. Another digital achievement across the company is the growth we are seeing at Fox Television Stations. Digital ad sales at our core stations were up nearly 40% compared to the third quarter last year. Our multiyear strategic investment to further build our digital capabilities and enhance our digital product and advertising teams at the stations are yielding great results.  
Across the entire company, we surpassed $1 billion in digital revenues for the third quarter year-to-date. Our owned and operated stations are also benefiting from the ongoing lifting of COVID restrictions. The financial services category and the entertainment category, which includes gaming, are performing particularly well. We are optimistic that this trajectory will continue as restaurants, retail and other businesses continue to reopen in the large metro areas where our stations are located.  
Even despite COVID related disruptions, our fiscal year-to-date has been characterized by an operating and financial performance that has exceeded even our own high standards and our initial expectations. Our core businesses provide a stable foundation for the opportunities that will propel our future growth. We are optimistic about the current fourth quarter and look forward to milestones in fiscal 2022 that include the return of our full sports and entertainment lineups, the beginning of the midterm election season, investments in the growth of Tubi and Fox Nation, the launch of Fox Weather and the integration of OutKick.

Having delivered another strong quarter, we are encouraged by the robust underlying trends that underpin our distribution and advertising revenues, and our strategic investments are exceeding expectations, highlighted",1096,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Having delivered another strong quarter, we are encouraged by the robust underlying trends that underpin our distribution and advertising revenues, and our strategic investments are exceeding expectations, highlighted by the trajectory of Tubi. Before reviewing our financial performance for the quarter, it is worth noting at the outset that our third quarter results are comparing against our broadcast of Super Bowl LIV in the prior corresponding quarter. Which accounted for approximately $500 million of net advertising revenue and approximately $100 million of EBITDA across the company last year. Where appropriate, I will share both our reported results and the underlying performance when excluding the impact of Super Bowl LIV. 
Now turning to our results for the current quarter. Our leadership brands and focused portfolio of assets delivered double-digit growth in total company affiliate revenues and mid-single digit growth in underlying total company advertising revenues. Excluding the benefit of the Super Bowl in the prior year quarter and the consolidation of Tubi in the current year quarter. Total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, with 18% growth at the Television segment and healthy 6% growth at the cable segment. Meanwhile, the rate of subscriber declines continued to moderate in the quarter, with trailing 12-month industry sub losses running at approximately 4.5%. Our reported advertising revenues declined 24% in the quarter due to the absence of the prior year broadcast of Super Bowl LIV and a slower news cycle. Despite the headwinds from comparability, our brands continue to deliver robust CPM growth across the portfolio, led by the Fox Network and Fox News. Encouragingly, our core local television stations ex Super Bowl, political and the impact of the Nexstar transaction returned to growth across the base market in the quarter. Meanwhile, advertising revenue growth at Tubi continues to exceed expectations.  
Today, we anticipate reaching revenue of $350 million for the current fiscal year, which is up from the $300 million forecast we shared with you on our last earnings call. Putting it all together, reported total company revenues of $3.22 billion were down 7% over the comparative period in fiscal '20. Excluding the impact of Super Bowl and the acquisition of Tubi, underlying total company revenues increased mid-single digits. 
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $899 million, down 2% over the comparative period in fiscal '20. Excluding last year's Super Bowl contribution, quarterly adjusted EBITDA grew low double digits, led by continued growth at the cable network segment. Net income attributable to stockholders of $567 million or $0.96 per share was notably higher than the 8 -- $78 million or $0.13 per share in the prior year quarter. This was primarily the result of movements recognized in other net, including the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.88 was up slightly from last year's $0.93, primarily reflecting the comparative items that I've just mentioned. 
Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter. Our cable network reported a 7% increase in EBITDA on essentially stable revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 6%, once again, led by double-digit pricing gains at FOX News and continued moderation in the rate of industry subscriber erosion. Cable advertising revenues decreased 7%, as continued strength in linear pricing and digital commercialization at Fox News Media was more than offset by the elevated linear audience levels of the prior year. Cable other revenues fell 24%, and primarily due to this lower sports sublicensing revenues and the absence of paper view boxing events in the current year, both due to COVID as well as the disposition of our sports marketing businesses. 
EBITDA at our cable segment increased by $58 million over the prior year and benefited from lower costs at Fox Sports, including the absence of the prior year's Super Bowl Week studio shows and production cost efficiencies. Our Television segment reported a 12% decline in revenues and an $89 million decline in EBITDA, both of which principally reflects the absence of the prior year contribution from the broadcast of Super Bowl LIV.  
Television affiliate revenues increased 18% in the quarter. This robust growth reflects double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates, and for our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. And reaffirms we are on track to achieve the Television affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day. Television advertising revenues declined by 28%, primarily due to the absence of the prior year Super Bowl, partially offset by the benefit this quarter from the timing of our NFL week 17 doubleheader and the rotating NFL divisional playoff game. 
Meanwhile, on the back of the increase in total view time Lachlan mentioned earlier, Tubi set another advertising record this time for the March quarter, which seasonally is its slowest quarter. Other revenues at Television increased 21%, led by higher co-production revenues at Fox Entertainment and higher content revenues at Bento Box.  
Turning now to cash flow. In the quarter, we generated strong free cash flow of $1.54 billion, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming and the result of our sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. Year-to-date, we have deployed $825 million of capital to repurchase approximately 19 million Class A shares and nearly 8 million Class-B shares. And are on track to complete the $1 billion of share repurchases this fiscal year that we announced on our last call. 
Against our buyback authorization of $2 billion we have now cumulative fleet repurchased over $1.42 billion, representing approximately 7% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.77 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt. As we look to the final quarter of our fiscal year, we expect continued progress in affiliate revenue growth and for our advertising revenues to strongly outpace prior year, driven in large part by the strong rebound in local advertising sales as well as the acquisition of Tubi. 
While this top line growth in the quarter will be more than offset by our investments in the Tubi and Fox News Media digital platforms as well as higher programming costs due to the return of normal sports and entertainment schedules. We expect to deliver full year revenues and EBITDA comfortably ahead of fiscal 2020 despite the challenges of COVID and the comparison to a super bowl year. 
And with that, I'll now hand the call back to Joe."

So having the -- securing the NFC package, at an appropriate price for us was our absolute focus.

On the programming side, Lachlan, how are you thinking about programming Tubi as it relates to content that Fox owns and produces sort of the way you've run the broadcast network over the years. Versus just trying to build a big audience that you can monetize through advertising and using third-party content. If you have a view on that yet to be interested. And then as you go-to-market in the upfront and think about even the $350 million guidance you've given, how do we think about how incremental that is? In other words, I guess there's an argument that maybe some of that money is just coming out of Fox Broadcast with out of one pocket and into the other. Can you just talk a little bit about your conviction in driving incremental revenue into the company from Tubi over the course of the next year or so?"

So first of all, on Tubi, the programming strategy at Tubi, is entirely as we've discussed. And this is a critical difference between Tubi and some of the other subscription video on-demand services and the hybrid advertising into subscription video on-demand services that we see our competitors operating. And the Tubi is entirely focused on total viewing time. And the reason we're entirely focused on total viewing time is because that translates directly into revenue. 
So the more we can grow total viewing time, and this is as opposed to purely users or in SVOD service subscribers, the more we can grow total viewing time, we can translate that very directly into increased advertising revenues. And so when we look at our program strategy, we're not interested in spending billions of dollars as the others are on sort of driving subscriber bases with very expensive programming. What we're interested in doing is very efficiently scaling our programming to drive our total viewing time. 
And we can do this because of the technology, we can really target specific genres and specific cohorts of our viewers to drive their total view on time and hence drive revenue. So it's -- it directly correlates. So we've had a record total viewing time in the last months. And a total -- completely correlates with having -- driving record revenue. So that's a business model, and that fits into the sort of the efficiency of our programming strategy. To the second question in terms of were we moving money from one pocket to the other? Absolutely not. I don't know -- while I'm sure you did have the opportunity to watch the Tubi presentation at the new front just a few days ago. 
The -- what Tubi allows for us and frankly, for any advertiser that's also advertising in broadcast, it allows them to increase their reach dramatically. The advertisers are trying to reach new viewers and viewers that don't traditionally watch broadcast, they're younger, they're more diverse. They really need to go to Tubi to reach those audiences if they can't reach them anywhere else. So what that allows us to do is really expand both the amount of the partnership, the scale of partnership with our current advertisers, but also find new advertisers that we haven't enjoyed our relationship with before."

If you could say on Tubi, like what the incremental investment will be in the coming year. And on Thursday Night football, will that affect your retrans, do you think, over the next couple of years?

So I'll -- you could -- if I forget any, please remind me, it's good to hear your voice. So first, on Tubi, and I think it was the further investment in Tubi, we're really focused on being very efficient, being very disciplined around an investment in Tubi, while at the same time, not losing sight of the immense opportunity that the Tubi is. I think we've designed our programming strategy and our marketing strategy around that. So a lot of the investment you will see will be a combination of continuing to assign the revenue and what would have been sort of profitability of Tubi back into growing the business. 
And adding some modest for capital in addition to that. So it's not a tremendous sized investment when it comes to sort of the scale of Fox. But we think it's appropriate given the opportunity that Tubi presents us. On Thursday Night football, I think you asked what the effect on retransmission would be. The logic behind being able to release Thursday Night Football, not to follow it in the new deal and indeed to release it a year early, is that we don't think it gives us incremental retransmission revenue above what we already get for the premium NFL package in the country, which is Sunday afternoon NFC package. 
So due to that, we can really save the cost of the Thursday Night Football package and invest further in Sunday, retaining all of our potential retransmission revenue through Sunday football. On sports betting, there's a couple of questions, but I think the impact of sports betting and -- on the ecosystem. Sports betting in every market where there is licensed operators. They are spending heavily, which is a terrific benefit to our station, our station groups. We think this will continue. It's a very competitive market. And this won't ameliorate anytime soon. 
All the more reason why we consider further investment in it. OutKick is a great example, as sort of a leading operator in both sports news and critically in sports opinion. You haven't seen OutKick or listen to any of its podcasts or radio shows or being to its website, you should. It's really a unique and special voice. And I think the 1 that aligns with the Fox audience incredibly well. So we're very excited to bring that team to be part of ours."

So Lachlan, I guess, if you just step back and look at some of the strategic decisions you guys have made recently, which is walking away from Thursday Night Football and investing in Tubi and sports betting. Broadly, it almost seems like a pivot in the business model where you guys were the loss leaders in football in the mid-90s and one slice of football and investing in other areas. 
Is that how we should think about the investment priorities going forward, which is potentially in new areas become bigger priorities for investment and legacy television broadly becomes a cash source to pivot your business model. 
And then broadly, when you think about the broadcast business, football is, of course, important. But what role does it have in the broader ecosystem? I mean it is structurally in decline with respect to pay-TV subscribers. And the kind of role it used to play in the past with respect to reach is very different versus what it plays today. So if you could just expand on the portfolio on the legacy television side and what the strategic priorities are across your portfolio?"

Look, I think our so-called legacy television businesses are all very healthy. And we expect it to grow them significantly. But when you look at them from a point of view in terms of how we grow and how we -- I think you use the word pivot our business model going forward. You have to look at what they can offer with broader opportunities to monetize their existing content, right? And their existing genre of content. 
So if you look in the sports business, the sports business is really what's driving our wagering business, right, on our bedding business. You're going to see us be really want to be the major players, certainly from a media point of view in the sports waging business in America going forward. We're going to continue to exploit that marketplace and to grow in that marketplace. And that's really driven off the -- our engagement with our audiences through our sports broadcasting business. We wouldn't have nearly the opportunity, I believe, in wagering stand-alone without coupling it with the FOX Sports and overall Fox brand and Fox audience. 
And this can be seen here very clearly through our success with Fox Bet Super 6. Fox Bet Super 6, in the last year, we grew very aggressively through marketing it across all of our platforms, Fox Sports, Fox Entertainment, FOX News, and we drove to over 5 million users. There's no other free-to-play game like that at that scale in the United States. And what that allows us to do with Fox Bet Super 6 obviously is in the markets where we're licensed, drive that traffic or drive that sort of the widest part of that funnel into sports wagering and also the poker and casino businesses where they're licensed. 
So there's a tremendous opportunity there, but it's really because of our strength in our traditional sports broadcasting business. The same thing, by the way, is true at Fox News. We branded the Fox News business as Fox News Media, I think a couple of years ago. And that's really because you can't look at Fox News anymore as just a linear cable channel. 
The opportunities at Fox News to grow revenue beyond the impressive growth within cable is really through its powerful website, it's podcasting, Fox Nation, new channels like Fox Weather, where we're seeing tremendous opportunities to expand its reach and the power of its brands."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results. At the outset, I want to emphasize the exceptional financial and operational results that we have delivered over the last year despite the challenges posed operating through the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus brought significant impact to our production, through our processes and to our people. However, we stayed resolute and focused and demonstrated that even in the most unexpected and challenging of times are focused on a handful of powerful, highly engaging brands produces exceptional results. 
Over the past fiscal year, we have reinforced the competitive advantages of our core brands, enhanced our digital capabilities, solidified our growth potential, returned $1.25 billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, and otherwise, prudently allocated our capital. We have a strongly differentiated position in the market, which continues to benefit us to no end. But our greatest strength is our people, who have really stood up this year and performed extremely well under such difficult circumstances. I know myself, my father, the Board and the management team appreciate all their hard work and all their achievements this year. 
In fiscal 2021, we generated revenue and profit, which exceeded even our own bullish expectations. Our affiliate revenue increased 9% year-over-year, which is net of the distribution credits that we recognized last fall due to COVID. Our advertising revenue was up 2%, which is tremendous when you recall that we broadcasted Super Bowl in the prior fiscal year, during which we generated around $500 million of net advertising revenue. Importantly, the fiscal fourth quarter saw these trends accelerate as quarterly revenues increased 20%, led once again by double-digit affiliate revenue growth and advertising revenue growth of 38%. This growth was underpinned by the ability of our core businesses to consistently deliver audiences at scale and capture the upward momentum of a rallying advertising market. 
We finished the fiscal year with historically strong upfront sales and are currently also enjoying sustained scattered demand with pricing at significant premiums. We finished the fiscal year strong, and we feel we are in a very good place or we are in a very good place with great momentum starting the new fiscal year. 
FOX News Media continued its ratings leadership and its platform -- multi-platform growth in the fourth quarter. The Fox News Channel was the most watched network in prime time across all of basic cable for the sixth consecutive year and notched its 78 straight quarter as the leading cable news channel in total viewers, while the year-over-year ratings comparisons are difficult due to last year's heightened news cycle, the FOX News channel has retained more of its audience than and MSNBC since the presidential election. In fact, since the election, FOX News has solidified its leadership position in cable news, having reasserted its preelection market share. For total day audiences, FOX News increased its market share by 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, while CNN and MSNBC lost 9% and 3%, respectively, over that same period. 
From a prime time perspective, we once again find ourselves in a familiar position, as we routinely see our ratings exceeding those of our peers combined. We are also pleased with the performance of FOX News Media's digital assets. Fox News remains the most engaged news brand across social media channels, extending this run to nearly 7 consecutive years. This is a critical pathway to reaching, engaging and growing the broadest possible audiences with the Fox News brand. 
On the last call, I told you that Fox Nation, the direct-to-consumer offering from Fox News Media, had recorded its strongest quarter for customer acquisitions since launch. And this quarter, thanks to new and expanded content offerings, Fox Nation once again notched its best ever quarter for customer acquisitions. Later this year, we will expand our FOX News Media portfolio further with the launch of FOX Weather. FOX Weather is just one example of how we plan to grow the FOX News brand across multiple verticals. And the power of our brands and the growth potential of their digital extensions was also on display at the FOX Network, with another round of ratings wins on broadcast and record-breaking results at Tubi. Fox is the home to the best entertainment programs in television, which, together with Sport help propel the FOX Network to its second consecutive broadcast season as the top network in prime time among the key demo, adults 18 to 49. 
This fall, we have strongly performing returning hits and a slate of promising new shows. In particular, we are looking forward to the addition of 2 new dramas to our full lineup. These are The Big Leap and Our Kind of People. Fox has always thrived with shows featuring music and dance and The Big Leap, like Lee and so many others before it, lives right in that sweet spot. The Big Leap is an optimistic dramedy about second chances and chasing dreams. We think these themes are spot on coming out of the pandemic. 
Our Kind of People is inspired by Lawrence Otis Graham's book of the same name. It is executive produced by Empire Creator Lee Daniels and Starz Karen Gist. It's an absorbing story that takes place in the aspirational world of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard. 
And I'm very pleased today to announce a new partnership with Gordon Ramsay, Studio Ramsey Global, which will acquire Gordon's current television business and will develop, produce and distribute new culinary and lifestyle programming across all FOX platforms, including Tubi. 
Now let's take a moment to talk about Tubi. At the end of the fiscal year, Tubi surpassed 3 billion hours streamed, up more than 50% over the prior year. During the recent June quarter, total view time surpassed 900 million hours, up more than 40% over the prior year quarter. We spoke about it together last quarter, but I cannot emphasize enough the importance of total view time, or TVT, as the critical metric for ad-supported streaming. It is the best measure of burgeoning engagement on Tubi and correlates directly to the monetization of the platform. And there is no shortage of great content to keep audiences watching. Tubi leads the industry with the largest library of content with more than 35,000 movies and TV series available, and that library continues to expand with Tubi's first original movies, targeting genres that are informed by Tubi's machine learning capabilities and supported by tight production budgets in just weeks, these titles have exceeded our financial and strategic objectives. 
Throughout the fall, we will modestly ramp the launch of Tubi originals, a number of which will be produced in-house by Fox Alternative Entertainment and our animation studio, Bento Box. But let me be crystal clear about [indiscernible]. Tubi's original programming strategy is very different from the strategies of an SVOD streamer. We have no interest or plans to invest in high-cost programming to drive subscriber acquisition, as we are not in the subscriber business. We are focused on delivering programming that drives total viewing time and hence monetization in very short order. The return on our programming investment is measured in weeks, not years, and should be viewed through a completely different lens than investments in the SVOD universe. We are in a very different space. It's a space focused on advertisers, and advertisers are increasingly seeking out Tubi as a leading platform to reach a younger audience that is both largely unduplicated from our traditional FOX audience and not regularly streaming other AVOD services. 
In the recent quarter, Tubi featured adds to more than half of the ad age top 200 brands. With the reach and brand recognition of FOX behind it, Tubi nearly double the number of brands buying its inventory in the upfront and more than tripled its upfront dollar commitments over the prior year. 
Despite the COVID-related headwinds, earlier in the fiscal year, FOX Television Stations recorded core advertising revenue that was on pace with the prior year. When excluding the Super Bowl comp last year and the record political revenue in the current year. As just one example, the adoption of legalized gambling is driving increased advertising spend, particularly in Philadelphia and Detroit. We anticipate additional markets, including Arizona and Wisconsin, to launch legalized sports betting in fiscal '22. The FOX Television stations are particularly well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, given the strength of our stations in these markets. 
Fox Sports also had a noteworthy year, expanding its ratings dominance in live sport while also extending and enhancing our long-term rights agreement with the NFL. We will remain not only the leader in football ratings but also the home of the premier NFC rights package through the 2033 season, thanks to our new multi-platform rights deal with our partners at the NFL, which includes the designation of FOX Bet as an authorized sports book operator of the league. 
We expect the company-wide momentum of fiscal '21 to carry into our current fiscal year. Macroeconomic trends bode well for a strong advertising market and brands are increasingly turning to our linear and digital assets to reach the largest collection of loyal and engaged viewers. The return of normal sports and entertainment schedules, coupled with the ongoing leadership of FOX News Media, will enable us to capitalize on the robust ad market. In addition to delivering strong underlying operating and financial results in fiscal '22, we are focused on expanding our digital businesses. We are reinvesting a portion of the profits and free cash flow from our core businesses into the high growth and high opportunity digital assets that we know to be essential elements of our future. 
This past quarter also saw the completion of a wide range of transformational technology investments that provide us with a range of modern, state-of-the-art platforms that will power the growth of our businesses for years to come. These new capabilities include a new distribution and streaming operation in Arizona, due to brand-new data and advertising platforms that will underpin an evolving and advanced set of commercial offerings for clients across all of our products and services. These investments, now complete, position us strongly to seize on the growth opportunities that lie ahead. We continue to deploy capital in a responsible manner to sport Tubi, the Fox News Media digital properties, including FOX Nation and the launch of FOX Weather as well as our other emerging digital businesses. We believe these investments, relatively modest compared to those being made by our peers in subscription streaming areas, will yield long-term significant returns and position us well to continue to adapt and take advantage of the evolving media landscape. 
Now Steve will take us through the details of the fiscal year and the fourth quarter."

Looking back at our recently completed fiscal year, FOX delivered total revenues of $12.9 billion, up 5% versus the prior year.

Looking back at our recently completed fiscal year, FOX delivered total revenues of $12.9 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. This is despite the impact of COVID-19 and the cyclical comparison with revenues generated from last year's broadcast of Super Bowl 54. Notwithstanding these 2 headwinds, full year advertising revenue still increased 2%, propelled by a record political cycle, the significant contribution of Tubi and robust mid-teens growth at the cable segment led by FOX News Media. Our best-in-class affiliate revenue growth was particularly noteworthy. Total company affiliate revenues increased 9% on a reported basis and 10% on an underlying basis after adjusting for potential distribution credits at the cable segment due to COVID. This underlying double-digit company-wide growth was led by 20% growth at the television segment. Momentum across our digital businesses continues to be strong, with digital revenues growing over 40% to reach almost $1.4 billion for the full fiscal year. Taken together, this impressive revenue achievement once again underlines our differentiated strategy, centered on our leadership brands and focused portfolio of assets built around live event programming, including news and sports. 
From a bottom line perspective, the company delivered full year adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year and a record in the company's short history. Full year net income attributable to stockholders was $2.2 billion or $3.61 per share, while adjusted EPS was $2.88 per share, up 16% versus $2.48 last year. 
Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter. Total company revenues increased 20% to $2.9 billion, driven by our fourth consecutive quarter of underlying double-digit total company affiliate revenue growth and strong pricing gains across the national and local ad markets. Total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, with 16% growth of the television segment and healthy 6% growth at the cable segment. The rate of subscriber declines was stable in the quarter, with trailing 12-month industry sub-losses now running below 4.5%. 
Total company advertising revenues increased 38%, with over 50% growth at the Television segment as the local market continued to rebound from COVID, Tubi delivered another record quarter and the FOX network benefited from a healthy linear and digital marketplace. Total company other revenues increased 30%, primarily due to the timing of sports sublicensing revenues as a result of COVID, higher production volume at Bento Box and continued momentum at Fox Nation. 
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $717 million, down 3% over the comparative period in fiscal '20, primarily due to higher programming and production costs as we return to a more normalized programming schedule as compared to the COVID-related delays and cancellations experienced in prior quarters. Additionally, we also increased our investment in our high-growth digital initiatives at FOX News Media and Tubi. 
Net income attributable to stockholders of $253 million or $0.43 per share was notably higher than the $122 million or $0.20 per share in the prior year quarter. This increase reflects the absence of impairment and restructuring charges booked in the prior year quarter, net of the impact of mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments recognized in other net. Excluding these impacts and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.65 per share was up 5% over last year's $0.62 per share. 
Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where Cable Networks reported a 10% increase in revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 6%, once again led by double-digit pricing gains at Fox News. Cable advertising revenues increased 17%, driven by continued strength in digital monetization of Fox News Media and the return of live events and studio show programming at Fox Sports which were both impacted by COVID in the prior year. Cable other revenues increased by $25 million, primarily due to the timing of sports sublicensing revenues as a result of COVID and continued subscription momentum at Fox Nation. 
EBITDA at our Cable segment was flat against the prior year as the revenue increases were offset by higher programming and production costs at FOX Sports, following the COVID-related postponements and cancellations in the prior year. We also increased our investment in key digital initiatives at FOX News Media, including FOX Nation and the pending launch of FOX Weather. 
Turning now to the Television segment, which reported a 30% increase in quarterly revenues. Television affiliate revenues increased 16%, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and for our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. This once again reaffirms that we are on track to achieve the Television-affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day. 
Television advertising revenues increased by over 50%, as we benefited from a meaningful rebound in the base market of the local Fox television stations achieved strong pricing gains at FOX Entertainment and saw the return of Major League Baseball at Fox Sports this spring. Meanwhile, Tubi continues to exceed expectations, comfortably surpassing $100 million in revenue for the quarter, typically its seasonally slowest quarter. This brings Tubi's full year revenue to almost $400 million, up nearly 170% versus their full prior year. Other revenues at Television increased 18% in the quarter, led by higher production volume of Bento Box and higher coproduction revenues at Fox Entertainment. EBITDA at our Television segment was down $21 million versus prior year, as gains at our local stations were more than offset by our investment in Tubi and higher costs at the FOX Network, primarily due to scheduled changes caused by COVID. Switching now to cash flow. 
During the year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx of $2.2 billion. As we foreshadowed on our last earnings call, we deployed $1 billion of capital in fiscal '21 to repurchase over 22 million Class A shares and over 9 million Class B shares. Against our initial buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased over $1.6 billion, representing 8% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. And as a reminder, our Board recently approved an additional $2 billion to our buyback authorization, meaning that we have over $2.3 billion of our combined authorization remaining. Underlying our continued commitment to shareholder returns, today, we announced an increase in our semiannual dividend to $0.24 per share. Over the course of the fiscal year, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which, when including the payment of the dividend we declared today, will take the total cumulative amount of capital returned to shareholders to approximately $2.5 billion since the spinoff of Fox Corporation in March of 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.9 billion in cash and approximately $8 billion in debt. 
Finally, let me take a few moments to provide some markers for our fiscal '22. We are anticipating robust top line growth across our businesses over the course of next fiscal year. This is predicated on disruption-free programming schedules and comes despite the comparison with the record net political revenues of over $350 million we saw in fiscal '21. As Lachlan referenced, we expect the underlying company-wide advertising momentum was sold in fiscal '21 -- to carry into fiscal '22. With approximately 5% of our total company affiliate revenues due for renewal, we expect a moderation in the growth of distribution revenues in fiscal '22, as we comp against a major renewal in the prior year and prepare for the start of our next renewal cycle in fiscal '23. 
Using the strength of our core businesses as a platform, we will use fiscal '22 to invest in the expansion and acceleration of our digital assets. Here, we anticipate investing in the range of $200 million to $300 million of net EBITDA with a particular focus on Tubi, Fox Nation and the launch of FoxWeather. This is an appropriately sized investment for these high-growth assets that will be a key part of our future. Looking further out to fiscal '23, the confluence of premier sporting events, including the Super Bowl and the World Cup, in combination with the midterm election cycle will make for a unique opportunity across our leadership brands and platforms. These cyclical items, coupled with the start of our next major distribution renewal cycle, the early exit from our Thursday Night Football deal and continued growth of our digital initiatives are poised to provide a strong financial tailwind for our business. 
Coming back to today, we enter fiscal '22 from a position of operating and financial strength. This strength is reflected in our balance sheet where we'll use existing cash balances to pay down the $750 million debt maturity that will come due in January. Beyond this, we will continue to take a balanced approach to allocating capital between direct investment in our businesses, strategic M&A and capital returns to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

So I like the characterization of a follow-up and then a question because that's 2 questions, but that's fine. It's good to hear voice. So first of all, in terms of the investment in the digital assets, our digital assets are growing very impressively. I think this year, if you look at the fiscal year, we ended up at a $1.4 billion of digital revenue, which was up 44% year-on-year. So obviously, we like these assets and we're going to continue to invest in them to continue to grow them. But I think we're doing so pretty prudently, sort of, balancing the opportunity with the cost that we're putting against them. 
Do we need to get bigger? We're always looking at how to grow both organically and inorganically. We don't feel any pressing strategic need to get bigger. We don't have any kind of holes in our portfolio, particularly when you look at our kind of strengths in live news and live sports, and now in entertainment, the strength in Tubi, and it's really pleasing to see how quickly Tubi is growing. So we don't see a strategic need to grow defensively. We're not -- if you look at the consolidation that's been happening around the industry, a lot of that is around subscription video streaming, and that's not the desire to, sort of, acquire larger entertainment libraries and production capabilities. And that's not that sort of scale and then not a space that we're -- we need to be in right now. 
So we feel pretty confident where we are, but we are pretty comfortable where we are, but we do continue to look at opportunities as they come up. 
In terms of the upfront pricing, and I think you asked go into some detail around it, so -- and current scatter pricing. Look, this was an absolutely historic upfront season for us, but I'm sure for some of our our peers as well as the ad market rebounded from the depths and the lows of the COVID-affected year last year. So the comparisons are kind because of where we were a year ago. But having said that, all of our categories are up very strongly with the exception of 2, which are auto and telecom. And there are specific reasons around those categories. I know we've spoken on prior quarterly earnings calls about the auto supply issues they are having. But if you look at retail, this is -- I'm talking -- sorry, Jessica, this is for our local business at the moment, so the TV stations. 
Our retail is up like 10%. Entertainment, which includes that really growing and exploding are wagering category is up 300% year-on-year media, up 43%; pharmaceutical up 25%; even travel, which is a much smaller category for us, locally up 76%. So a lot of growth across the majority of categories, again, with the exceptions of auto and telco. If you exclude political advertising, our sales are pacing up about 8% locally. So we feel really good there. And obviously, the momentum is carrying the momentum into the new year. 
From a national point of view, I said the upfronts were very strong. Pricing was all up over the 20% mark and pushing into the mid-20s. And since the upfront, our scatter pricing is again up that much again and more. The NFL is selling very well. Major League Baseball, it's interesting as an aside, and this, I think this bodes well for the rest of the season and post season. We have a field of Dreams game our next week, and that's set a record for a regular season baseball game. So a lot of positive momentum across all of our categories, not the least of which is Fox News, which has shown very strong sales, with expanded demographics, and obviously, the digital platform as well. So we feel very good about the ad market, and we think it's going to continue for some time."

So -- let me start with the -- how do we get this in the right order, but sort of how we look at the ROI on the content and then we can get into the margins and maybe Steve can take the financial aspect of that question. So when we look at Tubi content, maybe you can remember from an AVOD perspective, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks and I mentioned last quarter, the -- it's all around total viewing time and how much -- and the advertising impressions that we can generate through increasing and expanding the engagement as measured through total viewing time. And it was really pleasing that I think in the fiscal year, we did 3 billion hours of total viewing time, which was up 50% year-on-year. 
So the way to grow, obviously, total viewing time is we can grow viewers and multiply that by the amount of content and the length of the time they're spending -- they're watching that content. And we look at the content and basically I'd say, 5 different categories. There's your third-party content, and that's where we have a 34,000, 35,000 hours of library, which is growing. I said it's a third-party content. That's a mixture of a revenue share and sort of -- and licensed content. 
There's an increasing amount of Fox-owned content, an IP, that we're able to put on to Tubi, which is really pleasing to see, and I think helps drive the Tubi awareness and the brand. There's a news category, which is really starting to take shape and increase engagement. There's a sports category, which we'll be launching sports channels soon, including the NFL channel and some other sports. 
And then finally, there's Tubi Originals. And Tobi Originals has only just begun to launch, but we are seeing the return in a very short order. These movies are very price-effective, and we're able, through Tubi technology, to really target them very specifically to very well-defined genres that we know if we promote them correctly on the Tubi platform, they will drive a consistent expected amount of viewing, which we can then monetize very efficiently. So the model from the investment into the original programming is really derived specifically by the exact amount of revenue that we can derive out of that original program. 
So it's -- unlike SVOD, where you're creating original programming to pull subscribers in often once they're in the platform, they don't watch that program and they watch their library programming. We're not interested in the subscriber acquisition. We're purely interested in the time they spend on the platform and the amount of content they are consuming. Steve, do you want to talk to the margins?"

So Robert, just in terms of margin, listen, the biggest single cost of the business is obviously programming. And even with our steps towards original programming, the library is going to be heavily concentrated towards revenue share titles, both movies and series on that front. And so therefore, it kind of governs a lot of your margin because that revenue share comes straight off of revenue and then you've got customer acquisition or your acquisition costs as well as technology. 
Now you sort of called out the $1 billion target that we have, which is an interim target that we have for the business. We're still in a kind of -- it's almost like a market establishment phase for this business, and so you shouldn't expect this business to be a margin contributor to us anytime soon. We're going to continue to invest in it, as we've called out on the call today. And that investment will go towards sort of 3 core pillars, being content, user acquisition/marketing as well as technology. If you look at sort of the Tubi in the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, it was virtually a push for us financially. So we can almost dial up and dial down that margin as we see fit. But certainly, our bias at the moment is to lean into investing in that business, which will mean there will be a drag on margin for the next year or 2 to come."

So when you speak to those growth areas, does that suggest investment in the linear cable and network businesses exports will be fairly modest going forward? 
And then separately, it sounds a lot of AVOD services out there went out aggressively in the upfront and some have a pretty big tailwind than CPMs. And so can you talk about how you think tubes priced relative to other services? And to what extent there's a gap and at a practical level, how quickly can you close it?"

So in terms of the investment going forward, the -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the big investment in terms of our partially in terms of our linear business, from a technology point of view, has been this Arizona play out and data center, technology center, which is now completed. And that brings us into, I think, the best-in-class kind of infrastructure for all of our product. Obviously, that's built today to be multi-platform. So it's an investment both in the linear business, but also as importantly, in the digital business as the digital business continues to grow. 
The $200 million to $300 million that Steve has called out in terms of the investments of this year, further investment in our digital assets is really split between, as I think Steve mentioned, FOX Nation, which is a subscription service but continues to grow engagement. It has really tremendously low churn and remains kind of a fantastic conversion rate from trial users to paid users of well over 80%. FoxNews.com, we'll continue to push into new verticals of content. They're planning and exploring content around sort of real estate, around cooking, around sort of some engaging games and crosswords and things as we drive the Fox News brand into sort of more lifestyle categories. And Tubi, I think we've addressed. 
So those are the key areas of of the investment this year, not the linear businesses. In AVOD -- Tubi in terms of how we price the upfront, I think the important thing for us, and I can't talk to our competitors, I wouldn't know. But the Tubi revenue in our upfront is entirely incremental, right? And that's really important. We are careful to not move revenue from one pocket to another and say that, ""Look at all the revenue we we've been able to attach or push in Tubi."" The Tubi revenue is entirely incremental to what we otherwise sold on our linear assets, and that's a really pleasing thing to see. Because the way Tubi is structured with our programmatic advertising, in fact, we got a very high rate for our programmatic advertising on Tubi. And so we were careful actually to constrain somewhat into what we sold into the upfront for Tubi because we feel towards -- as the year progresses, we'll do extremely well through our programmatic advertising and the CPMs we get through programmatic. So when we hit the triple revenue mark in the upfront for Tubi, we decided that was enough, we would stop there, and we would leave plenty of impressions for programmatic, which I think is the right strategy for us."

Maybe you could just give us sort of the pitch to advertisers who have a number of AVOD or fast options, including buying, I think, Tubi of the inventory through people like Roku and VIZIO and stuff. What is it that you offer an advertiser that's better or differentiated from Pluto or Hulu or even buying AVOD inventory through one of the platforms that have an ability to aggregate an even larger audience and maybe more specific data?

So we're very pleased with that. 
For Tubi, in terms of advertisers, the Tubi is a very -- it's not about -- you don't sell these advertisers around sort of the mass scale. And so I understand your point about some of the AVOD aggregators. But with Tubi, we have an audience that's younger, that's more diverse, that can be very targeted. We have very sophisticated advertising tools to ensure that advertisers, and frankly, the people they are trying to reach are not inundated with digital advertising over frequently, right? So we have these frequency tools that make sure that the advertising on Tubi is appropriate and that the viewer is getting a mix of a bad served to them. 
So there's a dynamic technology behind Tubi, which is very unique and very valuable to our clients. We're also not duplicated. So we have very low duplication, not only with the FOX Network but also Tubi viewers are unlikely, a very small percentage of them, are watching any other AVOD service. They are, and to a large part, exclusive to Tubi. So it really is a unique offering, an offering that our clients are seeing the value. And really, the proof is in the pudding. If you look at tripling the revenue in the upfront, and I think it was sort of doubling the number of top brands on the platform, I think the proof is in the pudding that this -- the Tubi story and the Tubi sales story is really resonating with the top advertising brands and clients in the United States."

So we're confident in a very strong NFL year. 
By the way, I didn't mention this, and it's not NFL, but on the sports side, the All-Star game from Major League Baseball had a -- was a terrific revenue result for us nationally. But interestingly, locally in Atlanta, we generated a really extraordinary amount of political revenue on that local station for the All-Star game, which was obviously driven by the controversy around Major League Baseball, moving the game from Atlanta to Denver. And that political advertising was all focused on the midterm elections next year. And so when we look at that, the lessons I think we're taking from that is that the next political season, the midterm season, is going to be another record political season next year, it's not this year, next year. But we're going to see staggering amounts of political dollars flowing into these local stations. And we can see that from simply just the one example of the for the All-Star game. 
CNNs, I think, Plus it's called. Look, we think it's at -- someone copies you, it's the best form of flattery. We think Fox Nation continues to grow. We think we're doing all the right things with Fox Nation. I talked about it before, but a tremendous growth in the quarter, driven of a -- clever acquisition and clever high-quality programming. So we don't see CNN launching into that space as anything other than affirming of our strategy and what we're doing, really driving the engagement and the tremendously high engagement from FOX News into a paid for subscription service. 
When we look at our competitors, we are heartened by the ratings trends. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are now regularly beating both the combined ratings in prime time of, and many times in an all day of CNN and MSNBC combined. If you take just last night, as one example, ratings just dropped 0.5 hour-or-so ago while we were on the call. 
In prime time, Fox News did 2.4 million people in P2+, CNN under 750,000 and MSNBC under $1.2 million. So you've got 2.4 million versus $1.9 million, $2 million. So we're regular we beat them combined plus with a margin of 20% or so. So very strong ratings trends, very strong engagement with our audience. And that really goes to our whole digital strategy, how do we take that audience and take that engagement and expand it across multiple platforms. Thank you for the question."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results. At the outset, I want to emphasize the exceptional financial and operational results that we have delivered over the last year despite the challenges posed operating through the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus brought significant impact to our productions, through our processes and to our people. However, we stayed resolute and focused and demonstrated that even in the most unexpected and challenging of times, our focus on a handful of powerful, highly engaging brands produces exceptional results.
Over the past fiscal year, we have reinforced the competitive advantages of our core brands, enhanced our digital capabilities, solidified our growth potential, returned $1.25 billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, and otherwise, prudently allocated our capital. 
We have a strongly differentiated position in the market, which continues to benefit us to no end. But our greatest strength is our people, who have really stood up this year and performed extremely well under such difficult circumstances. I know myself, my father, the Board and the management team appreciate all their hard work and all their achievements this year.
In fiscal 2021, we generated revenue and profit, which exceeded even our own bullish expectations. Our affiliate revenue increased 9% year-over-year, which is net of the distribution credits that we recognized last fall due to COVID. Our advertising revenue was up 2%, which is tremendous when you recall that we broadcasted Super Bowl in the prior fiscal year, during which we generated around $500 million of net advertising revenue. 
Importantly, the fiscal fourth quarter saw these trends accelerate as quarterly revenues increased 20%, led once again by double-digit affiliate revenue growth and advertising revenue growth of 38%. This growth was underpinned by the ability of our core businesses to consistently deliver audiences at scale and capture the upward momentum of a rallying advertising market.
We finished the fiscal year with historically strong upfront sales and are currently also enjoying sustained scattered demand with pricing at significant premiums. We finished the fiscal year strong, and we feel we are in a very good place or we are in a very good place with great momentum starting the new fiscal year.
FOX News Media continued its ratings leadership and its platform -- multi-platform growth in the fourth quarter. The FOX News channel was the most watched network in prime time across all of basic cable for the sixth consecutive year and notched its 78 straight quarter as the leading cable news channel in total viewers. While the year-over-year ratings comparisons are difficult due to last year's heightened news cycle, the FOX News channel has retained more of its audience than CNN and MSNBC since the presidential election. 
In fact, since the election, FOX News has solidified its leadership position in cable news, having reasserted its preelection market share. For total day audiences, FOX News increased its market share by 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, while CNN and MSNBC lost 9% and 3%, respectively, over that same period. From a prime time perspective, we once again find ourselves in a familiar position as we routinely see our ratings exceeding those of our peers combined. 
We are also pleased with the performance of FOX News Media's digital assets. FOX News remain the most engaged news brand across social media channels, extending this run to nearly 7 consecutive years. This is a critical pathway to reaching, engaging and growing the broadest possible audiences with the FOX News brand.  
On the last call, I told you that FOX Nation, the direct-to-consumer offering from FOX News Media, had recorded its strongest quarter for customer acquisitions since launch. In this quarter, thanks to new and expanded content offerings, FOX Nation once again notched its best ever quarter for customer acquisitions. Later this year, we will expand our FOX News Media portfolio further with the launch of FOX Weather. FOX Weather is just one example of how we plan to grow the FOX News brand across multiple verticals. And the power of our brands and the growth potential of their digital extensions was also on display at the FOX Network, with another round of ratings wins on broadcast and record-breaking results at Tubi. 
Fox is the home to the best entertainment programs in television, which, together with Sport, help propel the FOX Network to its second consecutive broadcast season as the top network in prime time among the key demo, adults 18 to 49. This fall, we have strongly performing returning hits and a slate of promising new shows. In particular, we are looking forward to the addition of 2 new dramas to our fall lineup. These are The Big Leap and Our Kind of People. 
Fox has always thrived with shows featuring music and dance and The Big Leap, like Lee and so many others before it, lives right in that sweet spot. The Big Leap is an optimistic dramedy about second chances and chasing dreams. We think these themes are spot on coming out of the pandemic. 
Our Kind of People is inspired by Lawrence Otis Graham's book of the same name. It is executive produced by Empire creator Lee Daniels and stars Karen Gist. It's an absorbing story that takes place in the aspirational world of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard.
And I'm very pleased today to announce a new partnership with Gordon Ramsay, Studio Ramsay Global, which will acquire Gordon's current television business and will develop, produce and distribute new culinary and lifestyle programming across all FOX platforms, including Tubi.
Now let's take a moment to talk about Tubi. At the end of the fiscal year, Tubi surpassed 3 billion hours streamed, up more than 50% over the prior year. During the recent June quarter, total view time surpassed 900 million hours, up more than 40% over the prior year quarter. We spoke about it together last quarter, but I cannot emphasize enough the importance of total view time, or TVT, as the critical metric for ad-supported streaming. It is the best measure of burgeoning engagement on Tubi and correlates directly to the monetization of the platform. And there is no shortage of great content to keep audiences watching.
Tubi leads the industry with the largest library of content with more than 35,000 movies and TV series available, and that library continues to expand with Tubi's first original movies, targeting genres that are informed by Tubi's machine learning capabilities and supported by tight production budgets. In just weeks, these titles have exceeded our financial and strategic objectives.
Throughout the fall, we will modestly ramp the launch of Tubi originals, a number of which will be produced in-house by Fox Alternative Entertainment and our animation studio, Bento Box. But let me be crystal clear about one thing. Tubi's original programming strategy is very different from the strategies of an SVOD streamer. We have no interest or plans to invest in high-cost programming to drive subscriber acquisition as we are not in the subscriber business. We are focused on delivering programming that drives total viewing time and hence monetization in very short order. 
The return on our programming investment is measured in weeks, not years, and should be viewed through a completely different lens than investments in the SVOD universe. We are in a very different space. It's a space focused on advertisers, and advertisers are increasingly seeking out Tubi as a leading platform to reach a younger audience that is both largely unduplicated from our traditional FOX audience and not regularly streaming other AVOD services. 
In the recent quarter, Tubi featured adds more than half of the Ad Age top 200 brands. With the reach and brand recognition of FOX behind it, Tubi nearly doubled the number of brands buying its inventory in the upfront and more than tripled its upfront dollar commitments over the prior year.
Despite the COVID-related headwinds, earlier in the fiscal year, FOX Television Stations recorded core advertising revenue that was on pace with the prior year, when excluding the Super Bowl comp last year and the record political revenue in the current year. As just one example, the adoption of legalized gambling is driving increased advertising spend, particularly in Philadelphia and Detroit. We anticipate additional markets, including Arizona and Wisconsin, to launch legalized sports betting in fiscal '22. The FOX Television Stations are particularly well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, given the strength of our stations in these markets. 
FOX Sports also had a noteworthy year, expanding its ratings dominance in live sport while also extending and enhancing our long-term rights agreement with the NFL. We will remain not only the leader in football ratings but also the home of the premier NFC rights package through the 2033 season, thanks to our new multi-platform rights deal with our partners at the NFL, which includes the designation of FOX Bet as an authorized sports book operator of the league.
We expect the company-wide momentum of fiscal '21 to carry into our current fiscal year. Macroeconomic trends bode well for a strong advertising market and brands are increasingly turning to our linear and digital assets to reach the largest collection of loyal and engaged viewers. The return of normal sports and entertainment schedules, coupled with the ongoing leadership of FOX News Media, will enable us to capitalize on the robust ad market. 
In addition to delivering strong underlying operating and financial results in fiscal '22, we are focused on expanding our digital businesses. We are reinvesting a portion of the profits and free cash flow from our core businesses into the high growth and high opportunity digital assets that we know to be essential elements of our future.
This past quarter also saw the completion of a wide range of transformational technology investments that provide us with a range of modern, state-of-the-art platforms that will power the growth of our businesses for years to come. These new capabilities include a new distribution and streaming operation in Arizona, due to brand-new data and advertising platforms that will underpin an evolving and advanced set of commercial offerings for clients across all of our products and services. These investments, now complete, position us strongly to seize on the growth opportunities that lie ahead. We continue to deploy capital in a responsible manner to support Tubi, the FOX News Media digital properties, including FOX Nation and the launch of FOX Weather as well as our other emerging digital businesses. We believe these investments, relatively modest compared to those being made by our peers in subscription streaming areas, will yield long-term significant returns and position us well to continue to adapt and take advantage of the evolving media landscape.
Now Steve will take us through the details of the fiscal year and the fourth quarter."

Looking back at our recently completed fiscal year, FOX delivered total revenues of $12.9 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. This is despite the impact of COVID-19 and the cyclical comparison with revenues generated",1500,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Looking back at our recently completed fiscal year, FOX delivered total revenues of $12.9 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. This is despite the impact of COVID-19 and the cyclical comparison with revenues generated from last year's broadcast of Super Bowl 54. Notwithstanding these 2 headwinds, full year advertising revenue still increased 2%, propelled by a record political cycle, the significant contribution of Tubi and robust mid-teens growth at the cable segment led by FOX News Media. 
Our best-in-class affiliate revenue growth was particularly noteworthy. Total company affiliate revenues increased 9% on a reported basis and 10% on an underlying basis after adjusting for potential distribution credits at the cable segment due to COVID. This underlying double-digit company-wide growth was led by 20% growth at the television segment. Momentum across our digital businesses continues to be strong, with digital revenues growing over 40% to reach almost $1.4 billion for the full fiscal year. Taken together, this impressive revenue achievement once again underlines our differentiated strategy, centered on our leadership brands and focused portfolio of assets built around live event programming, including news and sports.
From a bottom line perspective, the company delivered full year adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year and a record in the company's short history. Full year net income attributable to stockholders was $2.2 billion or $3.61 per share, while adjusted EPS was $2.88 per share, up 16% versus $2.48 last year. 
Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter. Total company revenues increased 20% to $2.9 billion, driven by our fourth consecutive quarter of underlying double-digit total company affiliate revenue growth and strong pricing gains across the national and local ad markets. Total company affiliate revenues increased 10%, with 16% growth at the television segment and healthy 6% growth at the cable segment. The rate of subscriber declines was stable in the quarter, with trailing 12-month industry sub-losses now running below 4.5%. 
Total company advertising revenues increased 38%, with over 50% growth at the Television segment as the local market continued to rebound from COVID, Tubi delivered another record quarter and the FOX network benefited from a healthy linear and digital marketplace. Total company other revenues increased 30%, primarily due to the timing of sports sublicensing revenues as a result of COVID, higher production volume at Bento Box and continued momentum at FOX Nation. 
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $717 million, down 3% over the comparative period in fiscal '20, primarily due to higher programming and production costs as we return to a more normalized programming schedule as compared to the COVID-related delays and cancellations experienced in prior quarters. Additionally, we also increased our investment in our high-growth digital initiatives at FOX News Media and Tubi.
Net income attributable to stockholders of $253 million or $0.43 per share was notably higher than the $122 million or $0.20 per share in the prior year quarter. This increase reflects the absence of impairment and restructuring charges booked in the prior year quarter, net of the impact of mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments recognized in other net. Excluding these impacts and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.65 per share was up 5% over last year's $0.62 per share. 
Turning to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, where cable networks reported a 10% increase in revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 6%, once again led by double-digit pricing gains at FOX News. Cable advertising revenues increased 17%, driven by continued strength in digital monetization at FOX News Media and the return of live events and studio show programming at FOX Sports which were both impacted by COVID in the prior year. Cable other revenues increased by $25 million, primarily due to the timing of sports sublicensing revenues as a result of COVID and continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation. 
EBITDA at our cable segment was flat against the prior year as the revenue increases were offset by higher programming and production costs at FOX Sports, following the COVID-related postponements and cancellations in the prior year. We also increased our investment in key digital initiatives at FOX News Media, including FOX Nation and the pending launch of FOX Weather.
Turning now to the Television segment, which reported a 30% increase in quarterly revenues. Television affiliate revenues increased 16%, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and for our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. This once again reaffirms that we are on track to achieve the Television-affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day.
Television advertising revenues increased by over 50% as we benefited from a meaningful rebound in the base market of the local FOX television stations, achieved strong pricing gains at FOX Entertainment and saw the return of Major League Baseball at FOX Sports this spring. Meanwhile, Tubi continues to exceed expectations, comfortably surpassing $100 million in revenue for the quarter, typically its seasonally slowest quarter. This brings Tubi's full year revenue to almost $400 million, up nearly 170% versus their full prior year. Other revenues at Television increased 18% in the quarter, led by higher production volume at Bento Box and higher coproduction revenues at Fox Entertainment. 
EBITDA at our Television segment was down $21 million versus prior year as gains at our local stations were more than offset by our investment in Tubi and higher costs at the FOX Network, primarily due to scheduled changes caused by COVID. 
Switching now to cash flow. During the year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, of $2.2 billion. As we foreshadowed on our last earnings call, we deployed $1 billion of capital in fiscal '21 to repurchase over 22 million Class A shares and over 9 million Class B shares. Against our initial buyback authorization of $2 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased over $1.6 billion, representing 8% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. 
And as a reminder, our Board recently approved an additional $2 billion to our buyback authorization, meaning that we have over $2.3 billion of our combined authorization remaining. Underlying our continued commitment to shareholder returns, today, we announced an increase in our semiannual dividend to $0.24 per share. Over the course of the fiscal year, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which, when including the payment of the dividend we declared today, will take the total cumulative amount of capital returned to shareholders to approximately $2.5 billion since the spinoff of Fox Corporation in March of 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.9 billion in cash and approximately $8 billion in debt. 
Finally, let me take a few moments to provide some markers for our fiscal '22. We are anticipating robust top line growth across our businesses over the course of next fiscal year. This is predicated on disruption-free programming schedules and comes despite the comparison with the record net political revenues of over $350 million we saw in fiscal '21. As Lachlan referenced, we expect the underlying company-wide advertising momentum we saw in fiscal '21 to carry into fiscal '22. With approximately 5% of our total company affiliate revenues due for renewal, we expect a moderation in the growth of distribution revenues in fiscal '22, as we comp against a major renewal in the prior year and prepare for the start of our next renewal cycle in fiscal '23. 
Using the strength of our core businesses as a platform, we will use fiscal '22 to invest in the expansion and acceleration of our digital assets. Here, we anticipate investing in the range of $200 million to $300 million of net EBITDA with a particular focus on Tubi, FOX Nation and the launch of FOX Weather. This is an appropriately sized investment for these high-growth assets that will be a key part of our future. 
Looking further out to fiscal '23, the confluence of premier sporting events, including the Super Bowl and the World Cup, in combination with the midterm election cycle, will make for a unique opportunity across our leadership brands and platforms. These cyclical items, coupled with the start of our next major distribution renewal cycle, the early exit from our Thursday Night Football deal and continued growth of our digital initiatives are poised to provide a strong financial tailwind for our business. 
Coming back to today, we enter fiscal '22 from a position of operating and financial strength. This strength is reflected in our balance sheet where we'll use existing cash balances to pay down the $750 million debt maturity that will come due in January. Beyond this, we will continue to take a balanced approach to allocating capital between direct investment in our businesses, strategic M&A and capital returns to shareholders.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

But even with all of that, you still have an incredibly strong balance sheet. So do you feel like you need to get bigger? 
And then my question is, you've had a great really, fantastic upfront as, I guess, the whole industry has had. Can you give us color on pricing and sell-out pretty much across all of the assets, not just the network but the cable assets as well as Tubi?"
546623668,1674743108,2363463,"Fox Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jessica.

So I like the characterization of a follow-up and then a question because that's 2 questions, but that's fine. So first of all, in terms of the investment in the digital assets, our digital assets are growing very impressively. I think this year, if you look at the fiscal year, we ended up at a $1.4 billion of digital revenue, which was up 44% year-on-year. So obviously, we like these assets and we're going to continue to invest in them to continue to grow them. But I think we're doing so pretty prudently, sort of, balancing the opportunity with the cost that we're putting against them. 
Do we need to get bigger? We're always looking at how to grow both organically and inorganically. We don't feel any pressing strategic need to get bigger. We don't have any kind of holes in our portfolio, particularly when you look at our kind of strengths in live news and live sports, and now in entertainment, the strength in Tubi, and it's really pleasing to see how quickly Tubi is growing. 
So we don't see a strategic need to grow defensively. We're not -- if you look at the consolidation that's been happening around the industry, a lot of that is around subscription video streaming, and that's not -- and the desire to, sort of, acquire larger entertainment libraries and production capabilities and that's not that sort of scale and then not a space that we're -- we need to be in right now. So we feel pretty confident where we are, but we are pretty comfortable where we are, but we do continue to look at opportunities as they come up. 
In terms of the upfront pricing, and I think you asked go into some detail around it, so -- and current scatter pricing. Look, this was an absolutely historic upfront season for us, but I'm sure for some of our  peers as well as the ad market rebounded from the depths and the lows of the COVID-affected year last year. 
So the comparisons are kind because of where we were a year ago. But having said that, all of our categories are up very strongly with the exception of 2, which are auto and telecom. And there are specific reasons around those categories. I know we've spoken on prior quarterly earnings calls about the auto supply issues they are having. 
But if you look at retail, this is -- I'm talking -- sorry, Jessica, this is for our local business at the moment, so the TV stations. Our retail is up like 10%. Entertainment, which includes that really growing and exploding are wagering category is up 300% year-on-year; media, up 43%; pharmaceutical up 25%; even travel, which is a much smaller category for us, locally up 76%. So a lot of growth across the majority of categories, again, with the exceptions of auto and telco. If you exclude political advertising, our sales are pacing up about 8% locally. So we feel really good there. And obviously, the momentum is -- carrying the momentum into the new year. 
From a national point of view, I said the upfronts were very strong. Pricing was all up over the 20% mark and pushing into the mid-20s. And since the upfront, our scatter pricing is again up that much again and more. The NFL is selling very well. Major League Baseball, it's interesting as an aside, and this, I think this bodes well for the rest of the season and post season. We have a Field of Dreams game our next week, and that's set a record for a regular season baseball game. 
So a lot of positive momentum across all of our categories, not the least of which is FOX News, which has shown very strong sales, with expanded demographics, and obviously, the digital platform as well. So we feel very good about the ad market, and we think it's going to continue for some time."

So -- let me start with the -- how do I we get this in the right order? But sort of how we look at the ROI on the content and then we can get into the margins and maybe Steve can take the financial aspect of that question. So when we look at Tubi content, maybe you can remember from an AVOD perspective, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks and as I mentioned last quarter, the -- it's all around total viewing time and how much -- and the advertising impressions that we can generate through increasing and expanding the engagement as measured through total viewing time. And it was really pleasing that I think in the fiscal year, we did 3 billion hours of total viewing time, which was up 50% year-on-year.
So the way to grow, obviously, total viewing time is we can grow viewers and multiply that by the amount of content and the length of the time they're spending -- they're watching that content. And we look at the content and basically I'd say, 5 different categories. There's your third-party content, and that's where we have a 34,000, 35,000 hours of library, which is growing. I said it's a third-party content. That's a mixture of a revenue share and sort of -- and licensed content. 
There's an increasing amount of Fox-owned content, an IP, that we're able to put on to Tubi, which is really pleasing to see, and I think helps drive the Tubi awareness and the brand. There's a news category, which is really starting to take shape and increase engagement. There's a sports category, which we'll be launching sports channels soon, including the NFL channel and some other sports. 
And then finally, there's Tubi Originals. And Tobi Originals has only just begun to launch, but we are seeing the return in a very short order. These movies are very price effective, and we're able through Tubi technology to really target them very specifically to very well-defined genres that we know if we promote them correctly on the Tubi platform, they will drive a consistent expected amount of viewing, which we can then monetize very efficiently. So the model from the investment into the original programming is really derived specifically by the exact amount of revenue that we can derive out of that original program. 
So it's -- unlike SVOD, where you're creating original programming to pull subscribers in, often once they're in the platform, they don't watch that program and they watch other library programming. We're not interested in the subscriber acquisition. We're purely interested in the time they spend on the platform and the amount of content they are consuming. 
Steve, do you want to talk to the margins?"
546623668,1674743108,2363463,"Fox Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Yes.

So Robert, just in terms of margin, listen, the biggest single cost of the business is obviously programming. And even with our steps towards original programming, the library is going to be heavily concentrated towards revenue share titles, both movies and series on that front. And so therefore, it kind of governs a lot of your margin because that revenue share comes straight off of revenue and then you've got customer acquisition or viewer acquisition costs as well as technology. 
Now you sort of called out the $1 billion target that we have, which is an interim target that we have for the business. We're still in a kind of -- it's almost like a market establishment phase for this business, and so you shouldn't expect this business to be a margin contributor to us anytime soon. We're going to continue to invest in it, as we've called out on the call today. And that investment will go towards sort of 3 core pillars, being content, user acquisition/marketing as well as technology.
If you look at sort of the Tubi in the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, it was virtually a push for us financially. So we can almost dial up and dial down that margin as we see fit. But we -- certainly, our bias at the moment is to lean into investing in that business, which will mean there will be a drag on margin for the next year or 2 to come."

And then separately, it sounds a lot of AVOD services out there went out aggressively in the upfront and some have a pretty big tailwind than CPMs. And so can you talk about how you think Tubi is priced relative to other services? And to what extent there's a gap? And at a practical level, how quickly can you close it?"

So in terms of the investment going forward, the -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the big investment in terms of our -- partially in terms of our linear business, from a technology point of view, has been this Arizona play out and data center, technology center, which is now completed. And that brings us into, I think, the best-in-class kind of infrastructure for all of our product. Obviously, that's built today to be multi-platform. So it's an investment both in the linear business, but also as importantly, in the digital business as the digital business continues to grow. 
The $200 million to $300 million that Steve has called out in terms of the investments of this year, further investment in our digital assets, is really split between, as I think Steve mentioned, FOX Nation, which is a subscription service but continues to grow engagement. It has really tremendously low churn and remains kind of a fantastic conversion rate from trial users to paid users of well over 80%. 
FoxNews.com, we'll continue to push into new verticals of content. They're planning and exploring content around sort of real estate, around cooking, around sort of some engaging games and crosswords and things as we drive the Fox News brand into sort of more lifestyle categories. And Tubi, I think we've addressed. So those are the key areas of  the investment this year, not the linear businesses. 
In AVOD -- Tubi in terms of how we price the upfront, I think the important thing for us, and I can't talk to our competitors, I wouldn't know. But the Tubi revenue in our upfront is entirely incremental, right? And that's really important. We are careful to not move revenue from one pocket to another and say that, ""Look at all the revenue we we've been able to attach or push in Tubi."" 
The Tubi revenue is entirely incremental to what we otherwise sold on our linear assets, and that's a really pleasing thing to see. Because the way Tubi is structured with our programmatic advertising, in fact, we got a very high rate for our programmatic advertising on Tubi. And so we were careful actually to constrain somewhat into what we sold into the upfront for Tubi because we feel towards -- as the year progresses, we'll do extremely well through our programmatic advertising and the CPMs we get through programmatic. So when we hit the triple revenue mark in the upfront for Tubi, we decided that was enough, we would stop there, and we would leave plenty of impressions for programmatic, which I think is the right strategy for us."

So we're very pleased with that. 
For Tubi, in terms of advertisers, the Tubi is a very -- it's not about -- you don't sell these advertisers around sort of the mass scale. And so I understand your point about some of the AVOD aggregators. But with Tubi, we have an audience that's younger, that's more diverse, that can be very targeted. We have very sophisticated advertising tools to ensure that advertisers, and frankly, the people they are trying to reach are not inundated with digital advertising over frequently, right? So we have these frequency tools that make sure that the advertising on Tubi is appropriate and that the viewer is getting a mix of a bad served to them. 
So there's a dynamic technology behind Tubi, which is very unique and very valuable to our clients. We're also not duplicated. So we have very low duplication, not only with the FOX Network but also Tubi viewers are unlikely, a very small percentage of them, are watching any other AVOD service. They are, and to a large part, exclusive to Tubi. So it really is a unique offering, an offering that our clients are seeing the value. 
And really, the proof is in the pudding. If you look at tripling the revenue in the upfront, and I think it was sort of doubling the number of top brands on the platform, I think the proof is in the pudding that this -- the Tubi story and the Tubi sales story is really resonating with the top advertising brands and clients in the United States."

Lachlan, the clarification is on NFL advertising presales. How does that compare to the entertainment upfront? Are you seeing similar pricing? Or is there any difference there?

And then on -- look, on NFL, our presales NFL is selling very well. CPMs are strong positive, and we couldn't be more pleased with the sales there.

We think for a lot of our issues in the marketplace, we think scatter pricing as well is going to remain a robust pricing through the end of the year just because of the availability of spots across the kind of television universe. So we're confident in a very strong NFL year. 
By the way, I didn't mention this, and it's not NFL, but on the sports side, the All-Star game from Major League Baseball had a -- was a terrific revenue result for us nationally. But interestingly, locally in Atlanta, we generated a really extraordinary amount of political revenue on that local station for the All-Star game, which was obviously driven by the controversy around Major League Baseball, moving the game from Atlanta to Denver. And that political advertising was all focused on the midterm elections next year. And so when we look at that, the lessons I think we're taking from that is that the next political season, the midterm season, is going to be another record political season next year, it's not this year, next year. But we're going to see staggering amounts of political dollars flowing into these local stations. And we can see that from simply just the one example of the Atlanta station in the -- for the All-Star game. 
CNN+, I think it's called. Look, we think it's a -- someone copies you, it's the best form of flattery. We think FOX Nation continues to grow. We think we're doing all the right things with FOX Nation. I talked about it before, but a tremendous growth in the quarter, driven of a clever acquisition and clever high-quality programming. So we don't see CNN launching into that space as anything other than affirming of our strategy and what we're doing, really driving the engagement and the tremendously high engagement from FOX News into a paid for subscription service. 
When we look at our competitors, we are heartened by the ratings trends. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are now regularly beating both the combined ratings in prime time of, and many times in an all day of CNN and MSNBC combined. If you take just last night, as one example, ratings just dropped 0.5 hour-or-so ago while we were on the call. 
In prime time, FOX News did 2.4 million people in P2+, CNN under 750,000 and MSNBC under 1.2 million. So you've got 2.4 million versus 1.9 million -- 2 million. So we're regular we beat them combined plus with a margin of 20% or so. So very strong ratings trends, very strong engagement with our audience. And that really goes to our whole digital strategy, how do we take that audience and take that engagement and expand it across multiple platforms. Thank you for the question."

Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results.We've started off the 2022 fiscal year strongly, supported by industry-leading affiliate revenue growth and the healthiest ad market we have seen in some t",2215,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results.
We've started off the 2022 fiscal year strongly, supported by industry-leading affiliate revenue growth and the healthiest ad market we have seen in some time. This momentum is clearly seen across our operating businesses, which includes the return to a full slate of live events at FOX Sports, the expansion of ratings leadership at FOX News, and continued exceptional growth from Tubi. Audiences are migrating to live news, sports and streaming, underscoring the operational and financial pillars that have defined our short history at Fox Corporation.
This quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our businesses, where we delivered 12% growth in top line revenues, led by a 17% increase in advertising and near double-digit growth in affiliate revenues.
On the advertising front, Fox is uniquely benefiting from a healthy national ad market, where brands are increasingly seeking out engaged, real-time audiences at scale that only live news and sports platforms deliver. This strong market is also benefiting Tubi and our FOX News digital assets, which provide targeted audiences to advertisers across many platforms. And despite comparisons to a heavy political ad cycle last year, our local markets are also performing well.
On the affiliate revenue side, we again have best-in-class growth, reflective of the power that our core brands hold in the pay TV universe. Our commitment to keeping our highest-profile content, like the NFL, exclusive to our distribution partners gives us confidence that the healthy annual price escalators we've commanded for our brands over the past renewal cycles will carry over into the next. While Steve will walk you through our financial performance in more detail shortly, I'll now turn to the operating highlights across our businesses.
You've heard it from me before, and all of our advertisers know well that Fox owns the fall through our football and baseball coverage at FOX Sports. And this fall is once again proof of that fact. NFL viewership is up across the industry. College football is back in full force, and we have just concluded a highly competitive Major League Baseball postseason. And throughout it all, FOX Sports has been expanding its live coverage to deliver viewers more of the content that they want.
The NFL is off to a great start, seeing solid growth in overall viewership through the first 8 weeks of the season. Excluding a rather complicated week 1 comparison, FOX' NFL viewership is up 8% over last year. And our schedule only gets better from here.
College football has also seen solid growth. By all measures, it's off to its best start in recent memory. Season to date, average viewership of our college football games on FOX is up nearly 20% over 2019, the most appropriate comparison given the postponements and cancellations that characterized last year's COVID-impacted schedule. FOX' marquee, Big Neon Window, is averaging more than 5 million viewers, while our Saturday morning pre-game show, Big Noon Kickoff, is also seeing viewership up nearly 20% over 2019 levels.
Moving from the football field to the baseball diamond. Major League Baseball has been a bright spot this year. The inaugural Field of Dreams games again this summer was a great success, clocking nearly 6 million viewers and delivering the most watched regular season baseball game in 16 years. It drew viewers en masse, notably women and teens, and from a business standpoint was the highest revenue-generating regular season game of all time. This game was something that only the FOX Sports team could envision and produce, deftly tapping into the nation's desire for an uplifting event underpinned by nostalgia and optimism. We all look forward to returning to Iowa in August 22 for next season's Field of Dreams game.
The momentum from the Major League Baseball regular season has translated into the post season in what has been a superb world series for FOX. In fact, the World Series is the only content this season outside of the NFL to average over 11 million viewers and will easily outrate the NBA finals to rank as the #2 championship events in professional sports this year.
And today, we are happy to announce the expansion of our international soccer portfolio with a landmark rights agreement for the UEFA European Championship. We will have access to more than 1,500 matches, highlighted by the 2024 and 2028 Euros, along with the UEFA Nations League, World Cup and Euro Qualifiers and International Friendlies. And this is on top of our existing international soccer portfolio, which, as you know, already boasts the FIFA Men's and Women's World Cup.
Importantly, we have also acquired sports betting rights alongside our coverage of these UEFA competitions, including integration opportunities with FOX Bet and FOX Bet Super 6, which are already benefiting from our existing sports rights portfolio. At the end of the quarter, the user base for FOX Bet Super 6 exceeded 5 million players, making it the biggest free-to-play sports betting game in the country.
Beyond our direct investments and options in the wagering area, our national networks and local stations are benefiting from the legalization of gambling across the country. Take the FOX Television Stations as an example. Sports betting is only legalized in 6 of our 18 FOX markets. And yet, we have already written approximately 20% more sports betting revenue at this early point of the fiscal year than we did across all of fiscal '21 combined. This implies that this new category will end the year as one of the largest in local advertising.
Staying with local advertising. The overall market trends for us are quite positive with travel, entertainment and pharmaceutical categories proving particularly robust. While we continue to observe some softness in automotive, this is being more than offset by growth in other areas, including sports betting. Excluding political spending, our core local advertising was up again this quarter.
At FOX News Media, linear and digital segments are performing very well. The FOX News Channel has further solidified its leadership position in cable news, reaching market share levels that are now at multiyear highs. In both total day and prime time, the FOX News channel accounted for over 50% of cable news viewership during the first quarter, more than CNN and MSNBC combined. This momentum has accelerated into the current quarter, with FOX News Channel accounting for 55% of total day and prime time cable news viewership in the month of October. And I should just say here as an aside, last night, saw a viewership share of the FOX News channel of 65% of all of cable news of year-end, 65%.
The first quarter also marked the seventh straight quarter that the FOX News channel was #1 in all of basic cable for prime time, and this ratings leadership continues even into the late night hours. Got Held regularly outpaces nearly all late-night programs on cable and broadcast television, even besting the CBS Late Show with Stephen Colbert on select nights.
At FOX Nation, the complementary streaming service to FOX News, our total subscriber count was up nearly 25% compared to last quarter and up over 130% compared to the same quarter last year. Not only are new subscribers seeking out FOX Nation, they are also staying with the platform longer. The first quarter was FOX Nation's highest quarter for engagement and the best quarter for subscriber retention.
The momentum at FOX Nation has continued into the current quarter with the addition of the iconic series, Cops. This show, which was a staple of the FOX Network for so many years, launched on October 1 and and has quickly become one of the most popular titles on the platform.
And we recently launched another digital product under the FOX News Media umbrella, FOX Weather. The FOX Weather app and its 24/7 free, ad-supported streaming service debuted last week as the most downloaded free app in the App Store ahead of TikTok, YouTube and other social media platforms. Since launch, the FOX Weather app has been downloaded over 1 million times. In just its first week of existence, users generated over 28 million page views and spent over 42 million minutes engaging with the product.
Using the strength of our national and local news operations, we are excited about the prospects for FOX Weather and our ability to be a leading player in this space, delivering compelling live content to viewers and serving as a desirable platform for advertisers to reach our valuable audiences. The FOX Weather streaming service is currently available for free on all FOX News Media digital properties as well as on FOX NOW. The distribution and availability of FOX Weather will expand in the near term, with a launch later this month on Tubi, followed by YouTube TV and the major streaming platforms, making Fox Weather ubiquitously available well before the end of our fiscal year.
Our digital strategy is focused and sets Fox apart from its media peers. Our strategy is deliberately less capital-intensive than what others in the industry are currently pursuing. Our approach to investment is to develop businesses that are extensions of rather than replacements for our existing lines of business, thereby creating revenue streams that are truly incremental to Fox.
Tubi is a prime example of our unique approach to streaming compared to others in the media landscape. We program and monetize Tubi in distinct contrast to the SVOD approach of many other media companies. And we're more than pleased with the results. While others compete aggressively in the SVOD space, investing heavily in content and promotion, we identified the opportunity to be a leader in AVOD, a strategy, which aligns with our advertiser- and audience-focused approach company-wide.
As SVOD platforms faced the challenges of subscriber acquisition and retention and ever-increasing programming costs, Fox has carved out a differentiated and unique path. Tubi's measured investment in its content library and original programming is delivering solid returns.
In addition to serving viewers with a content library of more than 35,000 titles, which is more than 5x the size of Netflix' library, Tubi's unique original content strategy is already seeing early signs of success. Out of the first 4 original films that Tubi released this year, 2 of which have performed so well in the quarter that they have already generated advertising revenue well above their local production costs, meaning they are already generating a positive return on investment. Tubi's deep understanding of its audience is a key asset as Tubi original movies outperformed blockbuster movies available on the platform.
The growth at Tubi continues to exceed even our best expectations for the business when we acquired it. Tubi will generate significantly more revenue this fiscal year than our cost to purchase the platform in early 2020. In the first quarter of the fiscal year, Tubi more than doubled its revenues year-over-year. And total view time on the platform, TVT, Tubi's key metric, continues to climb with 30% growth compared to last year.
Fox's content and reach have supercharged Tubi's revenue and audience. News on Tubi, a collection of 70 news channels, is anchored by live news from the FOX Television Stations and has drawn viewers for increasingly long periods of time. Since launching last fall, news on Tubi viewership has grown over 130%. And Tubi continues to expand its linear offerings with the recent launch of Sports on Tubi, which further leverages FOX's content expertise with premium sports channels, including FOX Sports, the NFL Network and the MLB Network.
Also, FOX Entertainment recently acquired TMZ. The acquisition of TMZ fits perfectly with our focus on live programming and gives us an array of possibilities to rapidly expand our brand and platform that have long been one of the cornerstones of our local TV stations. FOX Entertainment is focusing on bringing the TMZ brand to all parts of the Fox portfolio, including further monetizing the TMZ brand across the FOX TV Stations, developing TMZ branded content for Tubi and amplifying TMZ' digital presence.
Finally, and this is just a lot of fun, we are very pleased with the early results of our investment in blockchain, Creative Labs. Through this investment, we own a share of the underpinning marketplace and wallet technologies that power these next-generation experiences. We recently launched The Masked Vers alongside the current season of The Masked Singer, in which fans of the show have downloaded over 120,000 NFT packs and created over 100,000 wallets on the platform. We look forward to the expansion of this business through our NFT partnership with the WWE. This further highlights the marketing power of the Fox broadcast network to drive new businesses and the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of all of us here at Fox.
Clearly, the fiscal year is off to an excellent start, and we are encouraged by the outlook for the rest of the year. Our strategy to focus on the broadcast of live event programming that audiences crave, like sports and news, which, coupled with the addition of Tubi, puts us in an enviable competitive position. This intentionally differentiated portfolio and approach will further propel our growth and drive exceptional value for shareholders.
Now Steve will take us through the financial details of the first quarter."

Our strong operational execution across our businesses has led to another quarter of impressive financial results. Let me walk you through our start to the fiscal year before providing some markers that will be helpful",1341,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Our strong operational execution across our businesses has led to another quarter of impressive financial results. Let me walk you through our start to the fiscal year before providing some markers that will be helpful as we think through the quarters ahead.
In the first quarter of fiscal '22, the company reported total revenues of $3.05 billion, up 12% over the first quarter of fiscal '21, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total company affiliate revenues increased 9%, with 14% growth at the Television segment and 5.5% growth at the cable segment. The rate of subscriber declines held steady in the quarter, with trailing 12-month industry sub losses again running at approximately 4.5%.
Total company's advertising revenues increased 17%, reflecting strength in the national and local marketplaces, the return of normalized programming schedules following the COVID-related postponements and cancellations last year and continued strong growth at Tubi. It is worth noting that this total company growth was achieved despite the comparison to the prior year quarter when we generated nearly $100 million in net political advertising revenues leading into the presidential election.
Total company other revenues increased 15% in the quarter, primarily due to the return of sports sublicensing revenues and pay-per-view boxing at the cable segment. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.06 billion, down 9% against the comparative period in fiscal '21, reflecting higher operating expenses associated with the return of normalized sports and entertainment programming, and as we signaled on our fiscal '21 year-end call, increased digital investment at FOX News Media and Tubi.
Net income attributable to stockholders of $701 million or $1.21 per share was down versus the $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share in the prior year quarter. This variance reflects the EBITDA movement I just described, along with the onetime gain recognized in other net in the prior year quarter. This was associated with the reimbursement of a cash tax prepayment from Disney in relation to its acquisition of 21st Century Fox. Excluding the impact of noncore items, adjusted EPS of $1.11 in the current year quarter was down modestly when compared to the $1.18 reported in the prior year quarter.
Turning to the performance of our operating segments in the quarter, where Cable Networks reported a 7% increase in revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 5.5%, once again led by double-digit pricing gains at FOX News. Cable advertising revenues increased 4%, supported by the return of a full slate of college football games at the national sports networks following the COVID-related disruptions that occurred last year as well as the addition of international soccer matches, including the Gold Cup. Cable advertising growth was also helped by double-digit digital revenue growth at FOX News Media, but partially offset by lower linear advertising revenues at the FOX News Channel due to the absence of the political cycle that we experienced in the prior year.
Cable other revenues increased by $26 million, primarily due to the return of sports sublicensing revenues and pay-per-view boxing following the COVID disruptions last year as well as continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation. EBITDA at our Cable segment was down $7 million versus the prior year period as this healthy revenue growth was offset by higher programming costs at the national sports networks, primarily due to the sports scheduling changes I just mentioned and the anticipated increase in digital investment at FOX News Media, including costs associated with last week's launch of FOX Weather.
Now turning to Television, where we reported a 17% increase in revenues in the quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 14%, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and for our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. This once again reaffirms we are well on track to achieve the Television affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day.
Television advertising revenues increased 22%, supported by a strong ad marketplace, normalized schedules on the FOX Network and sustained momentum at Tubi. At FOX Sport, we benefited from a full slate of college football, the return of the MLB All-Star Game and the inaugural broadcast of the Field of Dreams game, all of which were disrupted by COVID last year.
At FOX Entertainment, we resumed a more traditional full schedule, anchored by our primary scripted and unscripted hits as compared to a schedule last year that was hampered by COVID-related production delays, which compromised the quality of the programming slate.
At the FOX Television Stations, we continue to observe a meaningful rebound in the base market with our core ad revenues up high single digits, which partially offset the absence of historic political advertising revenues that we experienced last year.
Rounding out the Television segment, as Lachlan mentioned, Tubi more than doubled its revenues against the prior year. The fact that growth in monetization is outpacing the significant growth in total view time is testament to the revenue synergies delivered from bringing Tubi into the Fox portfolio.
Finally, EBITDA at our Television segment was down $98 million against the prior year period as this healthy revenue growth was offset by higher programming costs, primarily associated with the normalized sports and entertainment schedules at the FOX Network, and increased digital investment at Tubi.
Turning now to cash flow, where our free cash flow deficit of $24 million is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle, where the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year. So far this fiscal year, we have returned $440 million of capital to shareholders, comprising approximately $140 million in the form of our semiannual dividend payment and a further $300 million directed towards our ongoing share repurchase program.
Against our enhanced buyback authorization of $4 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased approximately $1.9 billion, representing over 9% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt.
As we look out over the remainder of our fiscal year, we'd like to remind you of a handful of markers. Firstly, our fiscal Q2 will comp against the heightened news cycle and record political revenues of nearly $250 million that we delivered across the company in the December quarter of last year, most of which was earned in our Television segment. On our last call, we discussed our plans to invest $200 million to $300 million on a net EBITDA basis into the expansion and acceleration of our digital assets. With a relatively modest amount deployed to date, the phasing of these investments will be skewed towards the final 3 quarters of the fiscal year.
From an affiliate revenue perspective, there are at least 2 things worth calling out. Firstly, you will recall that last year's college football season was shortened and included a number of game cancellations. As such, we will have the tailwind of comparing against an accrual for potential distribution credits booked at the national sports networks in the December quarter of last year. And secondly, as I mentioned on our last call, we have a light affiliate renewal cycle with only 5% of our total company distribution revenues up for renewal this year. As a result, we expect the growth in affiliate revenues to moderate over the course of this fiscal year before we see the progress from more meaningful rate increases from the 70% of total company affiliate revenues that comes you across our fiscal '23 and '24. And the start of our affiliate revenue cycle next year is just one piece of what should be an exceptional fiscal '23 for Fox.

And what we're currently focused on is obviously leveraging our sports brand and sports content through FOX Bet, first through FOX Bet Super 6. And then obviously, as we drop sports wagers down into the wagering sides at FOX Bet. So we continue to like that business. We continue to really drive that business and spend a lot of time promoting and marketing it and really building value through our, I think, pretty unique sports wagering assets. That's number one.
And number two, and I think this is important for us because obviously what drives the sports businesses is, first and foremost, live sports and live sports content. And so we've taken a very clear and -- very clear strategy, and we've been very open about and very vocal about it is that we believe the best place for our premium sports is on our broadcast networks. That drives the most value for us. It drives the most value for our affiliates and for the distributors that partner with us with retransmission fees. So by really keeping our content exclusive with our partners, we think we drive a tremendous amount of value, not just for us but for the whole ecosystem."

So let me start with news monetization, and I think you connected at sort of some of the political revenues that we've seen over this past past 12 months. And what we're continuing to see and we believe the midterm elections and contest next year bode to be truly staggering.
So news monetization, as you mentioned, the -- our share of audience is about 55% of cable news viewers is incredibly impressive. It's a lot of hard work to build that share and maintain it. One of the interesting things as a byproduct of that share is really the breadth of our audience as well. We have more independents watching FOX News than anyone else. And interestingly, we have just about an equal amount of Democrats watching FOX News as watch CNN, according to Nielsen.
So the breadth of the audience, the fact the audience is also demographically becoming broader is actually bringing in new advertisers and new categories of advertisers onto the new platform. So it's incredibly pleasing to see we're seeing scatter pricing for news well above upfronts, and the market is strong.
Obviously, local news is a big part of our our news business as well. We now produce over 1,100 hours of local news per week. Many of our stations are now in -- if there weren't battleground states before, there are now -- after last night, there are now battleground states. And we see a tremendous opportunity for them going forward and there's some -- as the next political cycle approaches.
As far as Nielsen goes, I think Nielsen is all -- we, like others, are I believe that the Nielsen data is imperfect. We'd like to see Nielsen invest further in their data-gathering capabilities. I think it affects lower-rated, more fragmented sections of the market more than us, more than -- particularly in sort of a mass scale of our news audiences and sports audiences.

But these are more than made up for new categories and growing categories that are coming into -- certainly under our platforms.
On the local side, clearly, our wagering is, I mentioned in my prepared comments, is booming across the local markets. Travel is also coming back and restaurants locally. So these categories are more than making up for the softness in a couple of categories that are seeing some supply chain issues.
From a national point of view, we continue to benefit from a very strong upfront, and scatter pricing is averaging around 20% up above upfront pricing. Entertainment is a little higher than 20%. News is a little lower than 20%. Sports is about 25%. So it's averaging about 20%. And nationally, there's some wagering money, not as much as local, but the crypto category, which is a brand-new category, particularly in sports, is booming as well as finance.
So -- and then on Tubi international, Tubi currently, other than domestically in the U.S., is in Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. And our focus has been driving the U.S. business, but we do see international as a big opportunity."

And as the operator of this business, I don't want to give any information that is market-sensitive or that they want to hold closer to their chest. But if you remember the structure of our joint venture, we have FOX Bet Super 6 with over 5 million users as the #1 national free-to-play game. That drops people into FOX Bet. It's critical to realize, though, that FOX Bet includes -- in the joint venture in FOX Bet includes PokerStars and iCasino.
And so over time, as we monetize sports wagering, we also have the benefit of monetizing PokerStars and iCasino in FOX Bet. And what that means as we go through to really sort of take full value and take a full grasp of the opportunity fully, we are beginning to explore the process of getting licensed wagering license in order to fully capture the value of these tremendous assets for all of our shareholders.
So that's the process that we're just beginning. It's a complicated process because it's -- go state by state in terms of where we would operate with our joint venture partner of these assets. And so it's probably a process that will take some time. Of course, we're also in our arbitration with Flutter under some of the elements of our options, our 50% option in the FOX Bet and our 18.6% option in FanDuel.

Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results.We've started off the 2022 fiscal year strongly, supported by industry-leading affiliate revenue growth and the healthiest ad market we have seen in some t",2208,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter results.
We've started off the 2022 fiscal year strongly, supported by industry-leading affiliate revenue growth and the healthiest ad market we have seen in some time. This momentum is clearly seen across our operating businesses, which includes the return to a full slate of live events at FOX Sports, the expansion of ratings leadership at FOX News, and continued exceptional growth from Tubi. Audiences are migrating to live news, sports and streaming, underscoring the operational and financial pillars that have defined our short history as Fox Corporation.
This quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our businesses, where we delivered 12% growth in top line revenues, led by a 17% increase in advertising and near double-digit growth in affiliate revenues.
On the advertising front, Fox is uniquely benefiting from a healthy national ad market, where brands are increasingly seeking out engaged, real-time audiences at scale that only live news and sports platforms deliver. This strong market is also benefiting Tubi and our FOX News digital assets, which provide targeted audiences to advertisers across many platforms. And despite comparisons to a heavy political ad cycle last year, our local markets are also performing well.
On the affiliate revenue side, we again have best-in-class growth, reflective of the power that our core brands hold in the pay TV universe. Our commitment to keeping our highest-profile content, like the NFL, exclusive to our distribution partners gives us confidence that the healthy annual price escalators we've commanded for our brands over the past renewal cycles will carry over into the next. While Steve will walk you through our financial performance in more detail shortly, I'll now turn to the operating highlights across our businesses.
You've heard it from me before, and all of our advertisers know well that Fox owns the fall through our football and baseball coverage at FOX Sports. And this fall is once again proof of that fact. NFL viewership is up across the industry. College football is back in full force, and we have just concluded a highly competitive Major League Baseball postseason. And throughout it all, FOX Sports has been expanding its live coverage to deliver viewers more of the content that they want.
The NFL is off to a great start, seeing solid growth in overall viewership through the first 8 weeks of the season. Excluding a rather complicated week 1 comparison, FOX's NFL viewership is up 8% over last year. And our schedule only gets better from here.
College football has also seen solid growth. By all measures, it's off to its best start in recent memory. Season-to-date, average viewership of our college football games on FOX is up nearly 20% over 2019, the most appropriate comparison given the postponements and cancellations that characterized last year's COVID-impacted schedule. FOX's marquee, Big Noon window, is averaging more than 5 million viewers, while our Saturday morning pre-game show, Big Noon Kickoff, is also seeing viewership up nearly 20% over 2019 levels.
Moving from the football field to the baseball diamond. Major League Baseball has been a bright spot this year. The inaugural Field of Dreams games again this summer was a great success, clocking nearly 6 million viewers and delivering the most watched regular season baseball game in 16 years. It drew viewers en masse, notably women and teens, and from a business standpoint was the highest revenue-generating regular season game of all time. This game was something that only the FOX Sports team could envision and produce, deftly tapping into the nation's desire for an uplifting event, underpinned by nostalgia and optimism. We all look forward to returning to Iowa in August 22 for next season's Field of Dreams game.
The momentum from the Major League Baseball regular season has translated into the post season in what has been a superb world series for FOX. In fact, the World Series is the only content this season outside of the NFL to average over 11 million viewers and will easily outrate the NBA finals to rank as the #2 championship events in professional sports this year.
And today, we are happy to announce the expansion of our international soccer portfolio with a landmark rights agreement for the UEFA European Championship. We will have access to more than 1,500 matches, highlighted by the 2024 and 2028 Euros, along with the UEFA Nations League, World Cup and Euro Qualifiers and International Friendlies. And this is on top of our existing international soccer portfolio, which, as you know, already boasts the FIFA Men's and Women's World Cups.
Importantly, we have also acquired sports betting rights alongside our coverage of these UEFA competitions, including integration opportunities with FOX Bet and FOX Bet Super 6, which are already benefiting from our existing sports rights portfolio. At the end of the quarter, the user base for FOX Bet Super 6 exceeded 5 million players, making it the biggest free-to-play sports betting game in the country.
Beyond our direct investments and options in the wagering area, our national networks and local stations are benefiting from the legalization of gambling across the country. Take the FOX Television Stations as an example. Sports betting is only legalized in 6 of our 18 FOX markets. And yet, we have already written approximately 20% more sports betting revenue at this early point of the fiscal year than we did across all of fiscal '21 combined. This implies that this new category will end the year as one of the largest in local advertising.
Staying with local advertising. The overall market trends for us are quite positive, with travel, entertainment and pharmaceutical categories proving particularly robust. While we continue to observe some softness in automotive, this is being more than offset by growth in other areas, including sports betting. Excluding political spending, our core local advertising was up again this quarter.
At FOX News Media, linear and digital segments are performing very well. The FOX News Channel has further solidified its leadership position in cable news, reaching market share levels that are now at multiyear highs. In both total day and prime time, the FOX News channel accounted for over 50% of cable news viewership during the first quarter, more than CNN and MSNBC combined. This momentum has accelerated into the current quarter, with FOX News Channel accounting for 55% of total day and prime time cable news viewership in the month of October. And I should just say here, as an aside, last night, saw a viewership share of the FOX News channel of 65% of all of cable news of year-end, 65%.
The first quarter also marked the seventh straight quarter that the FOX News channel was #1 in all of basic cable for prime time, and this ratings leadership continues even into the late night hours. Gutfeld! regularly outpaces nearly all late-night programs on cable and broadcast television, even besting the CBS Late Show with Stephen Colbert on select nights.
At FOX Nation, the complementary streaming service to FOX News, our total subscriber count was up nearly 25% compared to last quarter, and up over 130% compared to the same quarter last year. Not only are new subscribers seeking out FOX Nation, they are also staying with the platform longer. The first quarter was FOX Nation's highest quarter for engagement and the best quarter for subscriber retention.
The momentum at FOX Nation has continued into the current quarter with the addition of the iconic series, Cops. This show, which was a staple of the FOX Network for so many years, launched on October 1 and has quickly become one of the most popular titles on the platform.
And we recently launched another digital product under the FOX News Media umbrella, FOX Weather. The FOX Weather app and its 24/7 free, ad-supported streaming service debuted last week as the most downloaded free app in the App Store ahead of TikTok, YouTube and other social media platforms. Since launch, the FOX Weather app has been downloaded over 1 million times. In just its first week of existence, users generated over 28 million page views and spent over 42 million minutes engaging with the product.
Using the strength of our national and local news operations, we're excited about the prospects for FOX Weather and our ability to be a leading player in this space, delivering compelling live content to viewers and serving as a desirable platform for advertisers to reach our valuable audiences. The FOX Weather streaming service is currently available for free on all FOX News Media digital properties as well as on FOX NOW. The distribution and availability of FOX Weather will expand in the near term, with a launch later this month on Tubi, followed by YouTube TV and the major streaming platforms, making Fox Weather ubiquitously available well before the end of our fiscal year.
Our digital strategy is focused and sets Fox apart from its media peers. Our strategy is deliberately less capital-intensive than what others in the industry are currently pursuing. Our approach to investment is to develop businesses that are extensions of rather than replacements for our existing lines of business, thereby creating revenue streams that are truly incremental to Fox.
Tubi is a prime example of our unique approach to streaming compared to others in the media landscape. We program and monetize Tubi in distinct contrast to the SVOD approach of many other media companies. And we're more than pleased with the results. While others compete aggressively in the SVOD space, investing heavily in content and promotion, we identified the opportunity to be a leader in AVOD, a strategy, which aligns with our advertiser- and audience-focused approach company-wide.
As SVOD platforms face the challenges of subscriber acquisition and retention and ever-increasing programming costs, Fox has carved out a differentiated and unique path. Tubi's measured investment in its content library and original programming is delivering solid returns.
In addition to serving viewers with a content library of more than 35,000 titles, which is more than 5x the size of Netflix's library, Tubi's unique original content strategy is already seeing early signs of success. Out of the first 4 original films that Tubi released this year, 2 of which have performed so well in the quarter that they have already generated advertising revenue well above their local production costs, meaning they are already generating a positive return on investment. Tubi's deep understanding of its audience is a key asset as Tubi original movies outperformed blockbuster movies available on the platform.
The growth at Tubi continues to exceed even our best expectations for the business when we acquired it. Tubi will generate significantly more revenue this fiscal year than our cost to purchase the platform in early 2020. In the first quarter of the fiscal year, Tubi more than doubled its revenues year-over-year. And total view time on the platform, TVT, Tubi's key metric, continues to climb with 30% growth compared to last year.
Fox's content and reach have supercharged Tubi's revenue and audience. News on Tubi, a collection of 70 news channels, is anchored by live news from the FOX Television Stations and has drawn viewers for increasingly long periods of time. Since launching last fall, news on Tubi viewership has grown over 130%. And Tubi continues to expand its linear offerings with the recent launch of Sports on Tubi, which further leverages FOX's content expertise with premium sports channels, including FOX Sports, the NFL Network and the MLB Network.
Also, FOX Entertainment recently acquired TMZ. The acquisition of TMZ fits perfectly with our focus on live programming and gives us an array of possibilities to rapidly expand a brand and platform that have long been one of the cornerstones of our local TV stations. FOX Entertainment is focusing on bringing the TMZ brand to all parts of the Fox portfolio, including further monetizing the TMZ brand across the FOX TV Stations, developing TMZ-branded content for Tubi and amplifying TMZ's digital presence.
Finally, and this is just a lot of fun, we are very pleased with the early results of our investment in blockchain, Creative Labs. Through this investment, we own a share of the underpinning marketplace and wallet technologies that power these next-generation experiences. We recently launched the MaskVerse alongside the current season of The Masked Singer, in which fans of the show have downloaded over 120,000 NFT packs and created over 100,000 wallets on the platform. We look forward to the expansion of this business through our NFT partnership with the WWE. This further highlights the marketing power of the Fox broadcast network to drive new businesses and the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of all of us here at Fox.
Clearly, the fiscal year is off to an excellent start, and we are encouraged by the outlook for the rest of the year. Our strategy to focus on the broadcast of live event programming that audiences crave, like sports and news, which, coupled with the addition of Tubi, puts us in an enviable competitive position. This intentionally differentiated portfolio and approach will further propel our growth and drive exceptional value for shareholders.
Now Steve will take us through the financial details of the first quarter."
546623668,1685689148,2424043,"Fox Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Fox Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Our strong operational execution across our businesses has led to another quarter of impressive financial results. Let me walk you through our start to the fiscal year before providing some markers that will be helpful",1341,"Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon. Our strong operational execution across our businesses has led to another quarter of impressive financial results. Let me walk you through our start to the fiscal year before providing some markers that will be helpful as we think through the quarters ahead.
In the first quarter of fiscal '22, the company reported total revenues of $3.05 billion, up 12% over the first quarter of fiscal '21, reflecting revenue growth across all operating segments. Total company affiliate revenues increased 9%, with 14% growth at the Television segment and 5.5% growth at the cable segment. The rate of subscriber declines held steady in the quarter, with trailing 12-month industry sub losses again running at approximately 4.5%.
Total company's advertising revenues increased 17%, reflecting strength in the national and local marketplaces, the return of normalized programming schedules following the COVID-related postponements and cancellations last year, and continued strong growth at Tubi. It is worth noting that this total company growth was achieved despite the comparison to the prior year quarter when we generated nearly $100 million in net political advertising revenues leading into the presidential election.
Total company other revenues increased 15% in the quarter, primarily due to the return of sports sublicensing revenues and pay-per-view boxing at the cable segment. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.06 billion, down 9% against the comparative period in fiscal '21, reflecting higher operating expenses associated with the return of normalized sports and entertainment programming, and as we signaled on our fiscal '21 year-end call, increased digital investment at FOX News Media and Tubi.
Net income attributable to stockholders of $701 million or $1.21 per share was down versus the $1.11 billion or $1.83 per share in the prior year quarter. This variance reflects the EBITDA movement I just described, along with the onetime gain recognized in other net in the prior year quarter. This was associated with the reimbursement of a cash tax prepayment from Disney in relation to its acquisition of 21st Century Fox. Excluding the impact of noncore items, adjusted EPS of $1.11 in the current year quarter was down modestly when compared to the $1.18 reported in the prior year quarter.
Turning to the performance of our operating segments in the quarter, where Cable Networks reported a 7% increase in revenues. Cable affiliate revenues increased 5.5%, once again led by double-digit pricing gains at FOX News. Cable advertising revenues increased 4%, supported by the return of a full slate of college football games at the national sports networks following the COVID-related disruptions that occurred last year as well as the addition of international soccer matches, including the Gold Cup. Cable advertising growth was also helped by double-digit digital revenue growth at FOX News Media, but partially offset by lower linear advertising revenues at the FOX News Channel due to the absence of the political cycle that we experienced in the prior year.
Cable other revenues increased by $26 million, primarily due to the return of sports sublicensing revenues and pay-per-view boxing following the COVID disruptions last year as well as continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation. EBITDA at our Cable segment was down $7 million versus the prior year period as this healthy revenue growth was offset by higher programming costs at the national sports networks, primarily due to the sports scheduling changes I just mentioned and the anticipated increase in digital investment at FOX News Media, including costs associated with last week's launch of FOX Weather.
Now turning to Television, where we reported a 17% increase in revenues in the quarter. Television affiliate revenues increased 14%, reflecting double-digit increases for both our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates and for our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations. This once again reaffirms we are well on track to achieve the Television affiliate revenue growth we outlined at our Investor Day.
Television advertising revenues increased 22%, supported by a strong ad marketplace, normalized schedules on the FOX Network and sustained momentum at Tubi. At FOX Sport, we benefited from a full slate of college football, the return of the MLB All-Star Game, and the inaugural broadcast of the Field of Dreams game, all of which were disrupted by COVID last year.
At FOX Entertainment, we resumed a more traditional full schedule, anchored by our primary scripted and unscripted hits as compared to a schedule last year that was hampered by COVID-related production delays, which compromised the quality of the programming slate.
At the FOX Television Stations, we continue to observe a meaningful rebound in the base market with our core ad revenues up high single digits, which partially offset the absence of historic political advertising revenues that we experienced last year.
Rounding out the Television segment, as Lachlan mentioned, Tubi more than doubled its revenues against the prior year. The fact that growth in monetization is outpacing the significant growth in total view time is testament to the revenue synergies delivered from bringing Tubi into the Fox portfolio.
Finally, EBITDA at our Television segment was down $98 million against the prior year period as this healthy revenue growth was offset by higher programming costs, primarily associated with the normalized sports and entertainment schedules at the FOX Network, and increased digital investment at Tubi.
Turning now to cash flow, where our free cash flow deficit of $24 million is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle, where the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year. So far this fiscal year, we have returned $440 million of capital to shareholders, comprising approximately $140 million in the form of our semiannual dividend payment and a further $300 million directed towards our ongoing share repurchase program.
Against our enhanced buyback authorization of $4 billion, we have now cumulatively repurchased approximately $1.9 billion, representing over 9% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt.
As we look out over the remainder of our fiscal year, we'd like to remind you of a handful of markers. Firstly, our fiscal Q2 will comp against the heightened news cycle and record political revenues of nearly $250 million that we delivered across the company in the December quarter of last year, most of which was earned in our Television segment. On our last call, we discussed our plans to invest $200 million to $300 million on a net EBITDA basis into the expansion and acceleration of our digital assets. With a relatively modest amount deployed to date, the phasing of these investments will be skewed towards the final 3 quarters of the fiscal year.
From an affiliate revenue perspective, there are at least 2 things worth calling out. Firstly, you will recall that last year's college football season was shortened and included a number of game cancellations. As such, we will have the tailwind of comparing against an accrual for potential distribution credits booked at the national sports networks in the December quarter of last year. And secondly, as I mentioned on our last call, we have a light affiliate renewal cycle with only 5% of our total company distribution revenues up for renewal this year. As a result, we expect the growth in affiliate revenues to moderate over the course of this fiscal year before we see the progress from more meaningful rate increases from the 70% of total company affiliate revenues that come due across our fiscal '23 and '24. And the start of our affiliate revenue cycle next year is just one piece of what should be an exceptional fiscal '23 for Fox as we look ahead to Super Bowl LVII, the FIFA World Cup, the early exit of our Thursday Night Football deal and November's midterm elections.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

And what we're currently focused on is obviously leveraging our sports brand and sports content through FOX Bet. First through FOX Bet Super 6, and then obviously, as we drop sports wagers down into the wagering sides at FOX Bet. So we continue to like that business. We continue to really drive that business and spend a lot of time promoting and marketing it and really building value through our, I think, pretty unique sports wagering assets. That's number one.
And number two, and I think this is important for us because obviously what drives the sports businesses is, first and foremost, live sports and live sports content. And so we've taken a very clear and very -- clear strategy, and we've been very open about and very vocal about it, is that we believe the best place for our premium sports is on our broadcast networks. That drives the most value for us. It drives the most value for our affiliates and for the distributors that partner with us with retransmission fees. So by really keeping our content exclusive with our partners, we think we drive a tremendous amount of value, not just for us but for the whole ecosystem."

Does that affect your news, like how you monetize news?

So let me start with news monetization, and I think you connected sort of some of the political revenues that we've seen over these past 12 months. And what we're continuing to see and we believe the midterm elections and contest next year bode to be truly staggering.
So news monetization, as you mentioned, the -- our share of audience is, [ in and out ], 55% of cable news viewers, is incredibly impressive. It's a lot of hard work to build that share and maintain it. One of the interesting things as a byproduct of that share is really the breadth of our audience as well. We have more independents watching FOX News than anyone else. And interestingly, we have just about an equal amount of Democrats watching FOX News as watch CNN, according to Nielsen.
So the breadth of the audience, the fact the audience is also demographically becoming broader, is actually bringing in new advertisers and new categories of advertisers onto the news platform. So it's incredibly pleasing to see we're seeing scatter pricing for news well above upfronts, and the market is strong.
Obviously, local news is a big part of our news business as well. We now produce over 1,100 hours of local news per week. Many of our stations are now in -- if they weren't battleground states before, they're now -- after last night, there are now battleground states. And we see a tremendous opportunity for them going forward and there's some -- and as the next political cycle approaches.
As far as Nielsen goes, I think Nielsen is all -- we, like others, I believe that the Nielsen data is imperfect. We'd like to see Nielsen invest further in their data-gathering capabilities. I think it affects lower-rated, more fragmented sections of the market more than us, more than particularly in sort of a mass scale of our news audiences and sports audiences.
Lastly, on Tubi, I want to get to your third question, Jessica. I can't remember the specifics of the question. It was..."

But where -- and auto being the key one and the largest of those where there continues to be some softness. But these are more than made up for new categories and growing categories that are coming into -- certainly under our platforms.
On the local side, clearly, our wagering is, I mentioned in my prepared comments, is booming across the local markets. Travel is also coming back and restaurants locally. So these categories are more than making up for the softness in a couple of categories that are seeing some supply chain issues.
From a national point of view, we continue to benefit from a very strong upfront, and scatter pricing is averaging around 20% up above upfront pricing. Entertainment is a little higher than 20%. News is a little lower than 20%. Sports is at 25%. So it's averaging about 20%. And nationally, there's some wagering money, not as much as local, but the crypto category, which is a brand-new category, particularly in sports, is booming as well as finance.

I know you always highlight that it's growth in usage that really matters. But to measure the health, we still need to understand whether you're attracting new users of Tubi and what marketing and distribution levers are left to pull to continue to scale that business.
And then for John, we've talked in the past about visibility for core costs for the company. And we've had obviously these huge pandemic swings. But I'm curious if you exclude investment spending and unusuals like Super Bowl and Thursday Night Football exit, can you help us understand what the core OpEx growth looks like for your linear network businesses? Because I think we sort of all have views as to what advertising affiliate revenue on a core basis will look like going forward. And then lastly, for Steve, can you monetize these higher NFL ratings? Or was that all sold upfront?"

No, look, Tubi is growing both in users and in engagement and in TVT. One of the things that you do, you juggle or balance, probably better word than juggle, but that you balance is when you market and you -- for new users, right, you can, through digital acquisition tools, very quickly gain new users. And depending on how much you want to spend, you can toggle that up and down. But that's a losing strategy if those users are not engaged and spend only a short period of time on the platform and then you have to remarket to them, for instance.
And so far ahead and the team are very scientific and very experienced in just balancing the new users that they acquire versus the quality of those users and how engaged they are. And it is really why the total viewing time, which includes new viewers coming on to the platform, really remains the best metric because it includes all viewers as well as a measure of the engagement that they have."

But the -- probably at the heart of your question is the visibility we have over our cost profile, our cost envelope. And if you look at what we've done over the last year or 2, particularly securing NFL over the next 12 years, having baseball contract that goes well into the next decade, today's announcement about where we're going to be with UEFA, it just gives us great confidence about the rest of the year and the future for us because we've got such great visibility over the cost envelope. So it's not like we're expecting great surprises coming out of any one of the areas. We have the Stations, the News division, Sports and Entertainment. So again, it just brings confidence to us as to the outlook for the business."

And just -- and Doug, the obvious -- to state the obvious, obviously, within that sort of overall cost envelope, we've seen -- when you compare like-for-like schedules on the entertainment side, we'll look to moderate the cost there and make sure that, that business delivers ROI. But also in that same segment, we've got Tubi, which we're really leaning into from an investment and a cost basis. So you'll see that come through in the numbers, particularly over the -- we're pretty light in terms of the amount of money that we put against Tubi from a net investment perspective over this quarter, and you'll see that ramp with subscriber -- or user acquisition costs and marketing costs over the next couple of quarters.
From an NFL ratings perspective, we'll absolutely look to monetize it. We're still selling scatter there. As Lachlan mentioned, scatter has been incredibly robust for us, sports, with sort of 25% ahead of upfront or pricing premiums upfront. So we'll definitely look to monetize that over the course of the remainder of the season."

I was surprised that it took 5 or 6 questions to get to FOX Bet and Super 6. It's obviously a business that is very meaningful for us.
So first of all, I'm not sure how much data I can give on FOX Bet itself. I understand that Flutter reported to -- last night. And as the operator of this business, I don't want to give any information that is market-sensitive or that they want to hold closer to their chest. But if you remember the structure of our joint venture, we have FOX Bet Super 6 with over 5 million users as the #1 national free-to-play game. That drops people into FOX Bet. It's critical to realize, though, that FOX Bet includes -- and that the joint venture in FOX Bet includes PokerStars and iCasino.
And so over time, as we monetize sports wagering, we also have the benefit of monetizing PokerStars and iCasino in FOX Bet. And what that means as we go through to really sort of take full value and take a full grasp of the opportunity fully, we are beginning to explore the process of getting licensed, a wagering license in order to fully capture the value of these tremendous assets for all of our shareholders.
So that's the process that we're just beginning. It's a complicated process because it's -- go state by state in terms of where we would operate with our joint venture partner of these assets. And so it's probably a process that will take some time. Of course, we're also in our arbitration with Flutter under some of the elements of our options, our 50% option in the FOX Bet and our 18.6% option in FanDuel. And we expect that arbitration to be complete by June of next year. So that's probably as much as I can say on FOX Bet."
