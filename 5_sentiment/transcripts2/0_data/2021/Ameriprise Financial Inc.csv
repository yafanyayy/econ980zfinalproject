Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website at www.ir.ameriprise.com. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings release, our 2019 annual report to shareholders, and our 2019 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that, you see our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim."
4165019,701262080,2184382,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. As you saw in our release, Ameriprise delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year, considering the challenging operating environment. In the quarter, equity markets rallied o",1757,"Good morning, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. As you saw in our release, Ameriprise delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year, considering the challenging operating environment. In the quarter, equity markets rallied on positive vaccine news, the outcome of the U.S. election and the likelihood of further fiscal stimulus. The strength of our advice value proposition, investment expertise and solutions are translating to our business results. Client activity inflows in the quarter continue to be very strong. And we set new records, including ending the quarter with assets under management and administration of $1.1 trillion, an important milestone. Revenues in the quarter were quite good, up 3% to over $3 , driven by strong business fundamentals and positive equity markets, offsetting the interest rate headwinds. Earnings per share also increased nicely in the quarter, up 8%, and ROE remains very strong at 36%.  
During the quarter, we continue to make good investments in the business as well as continuing to execute against our reengineering goals, resulting in a 1% decline in G&A expenses. We're always looking to drive efficiency and invest strategically to extend our position. It's core to how we operate. We also returned more than $500 million to shareholders, which was 90% of our adjusted operating earnings and among the best in financial services. For the full-year, we returned close to $2 billion. Very clearly, our ability to consistently generate substantial free cash flow as well as to reinvest and return to shareholders are key differentiators for us.  
Let's turn to Advice & Wealth Management, where we delivered a very strong  and good organic growth. Beginning with our clients with delivering a differentiated level of advice, keeping clients focused on their goals, which was key in a volatile, disruptive year. Total client assets were up 14% to $732 billion, driven by excellent client flows and positive markets. As you know, we've built a leading investment advisory business, and it continues to grow nicely. In the quarter, wrap net inflows were close to $8 billion, up 82% over last year. This was another record for us and a great indication of our excellent client adviser engagement and focus on growth. Another highlight was transactional activity bouncing back and up 5% over last year. And client cash balances continue to grow and ended the quarter at $41.5 billion, up $2.1 billion from last quarter. Meanwhile, we're continuing to invest to make our offering even more compelling for clients and advisers. We continue to see very good engagement in our digital capabilities, allowing advisers and clients to interact and transact seamlessly, and the majority of clients now have their goals online and follow their progress. Our advisers are utilizing our tools and capabilities on our integrated technology platform. They are reporting that they're processing business more efficiently and spending more time with their clients and growing their practices. That's evident in increased financial planning and adviser productivity. Which was up 8% adjusting for interest rates. You've heard me share that 1 of the greatest benefits of being an Ameriprise adviser is our caring culture, including truly best-in-class support and strong field leadership. I recently spoke with all of our field leaders to kick off the year. They're energized about Ameriprise and are focused on continuing to drive productivity and growth. This high level of support is also reflected in our recruiting success. Our virtual recruiting program is extremely effective and continues to drive strong results with 82 experienced advisers joining us in the fourth quarter. We're recruiting top advisers from across the industry who recognize that Ameriprise offers  value proposition, technology and level of support that can help them deliver an exceptional adviser based client experience and take their practices to the next level of success. And we have a track record of helping advisers grow 2.5x faster than peers which is very compelling from a competitive perspective. So far, in 2021, this momentum continues, and the recruiting pipeline remains strong. It was also great to see that our client service teams were once again recognized by J.D. Power for the excellent experience they deliver. This certification recognizes best practices from the highest performing contact centers across all industries, not just financial services. Regarding the bank, total assets grew to $8 billion, with $7 billion of sweep deposits. We plan to move additional deposits to the bank this year. We also added pledged loans to the product portfolio in the quarter, and we're seeing a good response to date. It's an appealing product for high net worth clients seeking liquidity. Wrapping up AWM, margin was strong at 19.8% and was up 60 basis points sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, expenses continue to be well-managed with G&A up only 2%, and that includes investments in the bank.  
Next, retirement and protection solutions. This business is performing well and in line with our expectations. We're executing our plan to drive a mix shift in the business, focusing on higher returning products given the rate environment, which is further reducing our risk. Variable annuity sales increased nicely, up 20%, driven by the success of the structured product we introduced earlier in the year, more than offsetting reduced sales of living benefit products. Very importantly, this increased the percentage of VA sales without living benefits, which grew to 58% of total sales in the quarter. In protection, while sales were down 4% year-over-year, we've seen improvement quarter-to-quarter. Sales of our flagship VUL product doubled in the quarter, offsetting the reduced sales from IUL products. This product both better meets clients' needs in this rate environment while generating good returns for the firm. Clearly, as Ameriprise continues to grow overall, the Retirement and Protection Solutions segment will represent a smaller part of our business mix over time. With regard to fixed annuities, I know some of you are interested in our progress regarding a reinsurance transaction. We are actively looking to execute a transaction this year and are encouraged by the recent uptick in the 10 year rate. Turning to asset management. We continue to build on our progress and have a great story to share as an active manager. The team is serving clients well in driving profitable growth. We continue to have excellent client engagement and investment performance. The investments we're making, including in data and digital, are helping to drive organic growth at Columbia Threadneedle with strong results in North America. We're targeting advisers better and delivering a compelling experience. And importantly, we strengthened our relationship with our distribution partners across regions, including with the large broker-dealer firms and independents in the U.S. We're also investing in our operating platform. Including important work to reduce duplicate legacy systems.  
In the quarter, we completed the final phase of the installation of our global trading portfolio management system, which will help our investment teams and drive additional efficiency and scale globally. With a continuation of positive flows in positive markets, assets under management grew 11% to $547 billion. Our Asset Management business is making strong contributions to our overall earnings and free cash flow. And margin for the quarter was nearly 40%. Looking ahead, we expect to remain in the 35% to 39% range. However, if these market levels hold, we should come in at the higher end. Strong investment performance has been essential to our success, and our teams have been collaborating really well through this pandemic. We have steadily invested to build a strong global platform with a disciplined research focus. And our people are delivering exceptional performance across all categories: equities; fixed income; and multi-asset strategies. At year-end, Columbia Threadneedle had 108, 4 and 5 star funds which shows the breadth and strength of our product lineup. In equities, on a global basis, over 70% of our funds on an asset weighted basis were above medium while beating benchmarks over 1, 3 and 5-year periods. And that's across domestic and international strategies. With regard to fixed income, we also had great performance. More than 75% of our taxable funds on an asset weighted basis were above medium or beating benchmarks over the same time frames. So with this type of investment performance and the growth focus across the business, flows continue to be strong. Overall, excluding former parent outflows, we were net positive $8.3 billion for the quarter, an improvement of $4.1 billion from a year ago. In terms of total retail flows, excluding former parent, we were net positive by $7.7 billion, including reinvested dividends. These positive flows were driven by continued momentum in the U.S., where we were net inflows for 10 months of the year, and that included this location in march. For the quarter, U.S. retail had $7.1 billion of net inflows. In fact, 30 Columbia strategies were in net inflows and 10 had gross sales in excess of $1 billion in 2020. And that's across equities, fixed income and our multi-manager lineup. In EMEA retail, we were in net inflows of more than $600 million in the quarter with particular strength in Continental Europe. Which more than offset outflows in the U.K. We're optimistic that the resolution of Brexit and the gradual reopening of the U.K. economy will be positive in terms of investor sentiment. And in terms of global institutional, we continue to gain traction, have a significant opportunity and platform to grow. We have a compelling lineup of capabilities and excellent investment performance. We recently added to our Consultant Relations team and strengthened client service. In the quarter, we had net inflows ex forma parent of about $500 million, driven by continued strength in EMEA. The pipeline looks attractive across our regions. So when I look across asset management, I'm very pleased with the momentum over the last number of quarters and our ability to sustain it.  
Stepping back to Ameriprise overall, we're in a terrific position. We're delivering strong results and further reinforcing our record of navigating uncertain times. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and advisers and the resilience that they've shown during this pandemia. They've stayed focused on our clients while continuing to drive the strong results you're seeing. Nearly a month into 2021, I feel very good about the high level of client engagement and business activity that we're generating. From a capital perspective, we're continuing to deliver a differentiated level of return. Our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent, and we're generating strong free cash flow. With that, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail and then I'll take your questions."
4165019,701262080,2184382,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, with adjusted operating EPS up 8%  as strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds from low interest rates. Assets under management a",1006,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, with adjusted operating EPS up 8%  as strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds from low interest rates. Assets under management and administration reached a record $1.1 trillion including nearly $15 billion of inflows from RAP and asset management. We achieved our targeted reengineering for the year while investing for future growth in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. We continue to effectively manage our profile with continued mix shifts to lower risk higher margin, retirement and protection solution offerings and are actively exploring additional reinsurance opportunities. In 2020, we returned over $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders.  
Our strong balance sheet fundamentals, coupled with sustained underlying business growth are driving free cash flow generation across our business segments. This positions us well as we enter 2021. Let's turn to slide 6. Ameriprise adjusted operating net revenue grew 6% driven by strong underlying business trends and equity market appreciation. After excluding the benefit of $92 million of higher short-term interest rates in the prior period, general and administrative expenses are down 1%, even as we make investments for growth, including the bank. Expenses also include higher compensation associated with the impact of AMP share price appreciation in the quarter and strong business performance. We are able to achieve this result through disciplined reengineering initiatives. In total, we delivered strong underlying EPS growth, excluding interest rates of over 20% and very strong margins in the quarter.  
Turning to slide 7. As Jim mentioned, Advice & Wealth management delivered robust organic growth. We continue to benefit from sustained traction and experienced adviser recruiting, a personalized client experience, effectiveness of our digital tools and success in reaching more of our target market. As you can see in these core areas, we had strong growth in client assets, wrap flows and adviser productivity. This is a good foundation as we move forward. On Page 8, financial results and advice wealth management was strong, with underlying adjusted operating earnings up 19% to $352 million after the $92 million interest rate headwind. This was driven by strong wrap net inflows, improved transactional activity and higher market levels as well as continued expense management. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, which would have been 160 basis points improvement year-over-year, excluding change in interest rates. On a sequential basis, the margin improved 60 basis points.  
Turning to page 9. Asset management delivered very good financial performance and continued improved flow trends. The cumulative impact of outflows has been a significant headwind for us in the past. As flows improved this year, that has declined, and if inflows continue, this would provide a tailwind for us in 2021. In the quarter, we had inflows of $8.3 billion, excluding former parent related flows, which is a $4.1 billion improvement from a year ago. Investment performance, table stake for net inflows is excellent across a diverse product set. Adjusted operating revenues were $798 million. Revenue increased 7%, reflecting improved flow trends stable fee rate and market appreciation after normalizing for the timing of the performance fees. General and administrative expenses remain well managed, reflecting disciplined expense reengineering that funded investments for growth. Adjusted for the timing of performance fees and other compensation related expense, G&A increased 2%. Putting this together, pretax adjusted operating earnings grew % with a 39.5% margin. Overall, we are very encouraged by the continued progress the business is making that is resulting in both strong flows and financial performance.  
Let's turn to page 10. Retirement and protection solutions continue to perform in line with expectations in this market and rate environment. We are executing our strategy to shift our risk profile. In the quarter, 58% of sales were on products without living benefits, up 24% a year ago, driven by our new structured variable annuity product, along with the decline in sales of VA products with limping in benefits. In protection, sales were down 4% in total, with a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a significant decline in index Universal life, a product that is not as attractive in this rate environment. These mix shifts are expected to continue going forward. Financial results continue to be in line with expectations. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 1% to $180 million. Like the industry, we are seeing an uptick in claim counts related to COVID-19, but we've experienced a limited financial impact. Overall claims were more favorable than the prior year. This business is well managed. Net amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry, and our hedging has been extremely effective. 
Turning to Page 11. In total, the Corporate and Other segment had a $60 million loss in the quarter, which was a $39 million improvement from the prior year. Excluding the closed block, the loss in corporate segment improved 23% to $79 million. The prior-year period had elevated losses related to impairments in the affordable housing portfolio. The current year had approximately $24 million of incremental compensation expense related to the impacts of share price appreciation and company performance. In our closed blocks, long-term care had $21 million of earnings in the quarter due to a significant increase in terminations and lower new claims. Fixed annuities had a $2 million loss related to the low interest rate environment. We continue to evaluate opportunities to execute additional reinsurance transactions this year.  
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong. Including a position liquidity of $2.3 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital of $1.9 billion, 98% hedge effectiveness in the quarter and 97% for the full year as well as a defensively positioned investment portfolio. Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 36%. We returned $502 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback, totaling over $1.8 billion for the full year. Overall, this was an excellent result for the quarter. With that, we'll take your questions."

I think what you're seeing overall, and we've been talking about that, not just for like the fourth quarter, but over the course of the remaining part of the year after the pandemic. And so we had increased our reengineering goals in that regard, and we did achieve them. Our expenses are being managed very well. But I would also say we did also increase some investments we were making. We wanted to accelerate because of the great productivity we're having to even add a bit more in some of the technology and the capabilities that we wanted to bring to both the advisers and from a client perspective and our web activities. So our investment agenda last year was actually a bit higher in total dollars than in the year before. So that was embedded in our numbers. What I would say is the pickup you saw in a little bit of expenses were more from the stock price appreciation and what that does in some of our deferral programs on a mark-to-market. And that absorbed and some true-ups and some compensation based on the year and the strong fourth quarter. So I feel good about the expenses going into the new year. I think they will increase if the economy opens up a bit more as we bring travel and T&E and some other expenses back to some extent. And we continue our investment agenda. But I think we're going to manage expenses pretty well. And you can -- you know how we do that over time, but we'll continue to look at the business growth, the revenue growth and the market climate as we do that."

I think we have a wide range of products that are wider range that are being considered than in the past as well, and particularly in certain categories that are making sense, like I said, in income categories. So I think it's a combination of factors that we worked hard at over the last number of years that is starting to show some good results. We've made a lot of investments, both in the AWM business to continue to get flows and productivity. And the same thing in the asset management business. You know we continue -- we actually completed our whole trading and attribution platform in Columbia Threadneedle. The ability to share research globally has improved the ability to actually get more data and analytics informed to our investment people, our distribution people, to improve targeting to understand where there might be some good opportunities. I actually think that Europe showed a nice bounce back. Remember, we had to go through a lot of change there of establishing a whole European lineup of funds with Brexit, and it sort of took us out of the market a bit for a while. And now that we're -- we've got that lineup established, we saw really strong flows into Europe this last quarter. U.K. is still a little weak because of the Brexit and the economy being closed, but we still see some signs that if that can open with Brexit moving to another completion there that, that would also help. So I think it's a combination of factors, just as you said. I wouldn't point to 1, but that's what gives us a good feeling as we move forward."

Could you guys talk a little bit about the -- around sort of the incremental improvement in retail flows that we've seen for several quarters now? And by the way, it feels like that's continuing into the new year, which is great. But that incremental improvement, how much of that is coming from AWM versus third party distribution? I know that's been a big focus to kind of a bigger third-party distribution platforms. And as that occurs, how sort of does that mix shift, if it's meaningful at all, sort of impact the profitability for AMP as a whole? So in other words, like if you get much bigger in third-party distribution, does it impact sort the net profitability for from wide kind of flows that are coming through those channels?"

I mean, I could probably say that organic growth in client acquisition is up. Nicely, both for the overall client base, but in particular, also for what we would call the targeted clients that we want in the 5 to 5 category. That has been nice and strong and picked up nicely as we went through the quarters in the year. The flows from the current client base continues to be good and actually pick up further in the fourth quarter, as I said to you. The years that we're bringing in and the business and production they're bringing in continues along the trend line that we spoke to you about. Particularly as we continue to move more years into both the employee channel and the the independent channel. And that has picked up nicely and continue to add scale to us. So it's a combination of factors. We continue to get more efficient based on the technology we deploy that helps advisers concentrate more on their client engagement and can actually focus more on what they can do to deepen. Our advice formula is working really well. We have more than 50% of the majority of our clients now have goals online that they can track and progress with and see very visibly of what they're doing and executing their strategies. So all of those things, we feel really strengthen the underlying core of the base and so remember, with the client base we have, with the deepening we have with those clients, with the further engagement around advice and with our advisers now feeling a little more comfortable dealing with the pandemic that they can go out and get more new clients and add clients in this environment or as the environment improves, and open, I think, will be a positive for us. So I can't judge it against any particular. I know a number of our competitors have -- if I look at what the warehouses were reported, et cetera, I think we're standing pretty strong against that. 
If I look at competitors that have acquired and have added through acquisitions, of course, you're always going to see an increase because of what's put on from that end on a comparative basis. So I can't necessarily separate them. But I feel organically and from a core business, we're doing very well."

Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website at www.ir.ameriprise.com. 
Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance.

A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings release, our 2019 annual report to shareholders and our 2019 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.

As you saw in our release, Ameriprise delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year, considering the challenging operating environment. In the quarter, equity markets rallied",1756,"Good morning, and thanks for joining our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. As you saw in our release, Ameriprise delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year, considering the challenging operating environment. 
In the quarter, equity markets rallied on positive vaccine news, the outcome of the U.S. election and the likelihood of further fiscal stimulus. The strength of our advice value proposition, investment expertise and solutions are translating to our business results. 
Client activity inflows in the quarter continue to be very strong. And we set new records, including ending the quarter with assets under management and administration of $1.1 trillion, an important milestone. 
Revenues in the quarter were quite good, up 3% to over $3, driven by strong business fundamentals and positive equity markets, offsetting the interest rate headwinds. Earnings per share also increased nicely in the quarter, up 8%, and ROE remains very strong at 36%.
During the quarter, we continue to make good investments in the business as well as continuing to execute against our reengineering goals, resulting in a 1% decline in G&A expenses. We're always looking to drive efficiency and invest strategically to extend our position. It's core to how we operate. 
We also returned more than $500 million to shareholders, which was 90% of our adjusted operating earnings and among the best in financial services. 
For the full-year, we returned close to $2 billion. Very clearly, our ability to consistently generate substantial free cash flow as well as to reinvest and return to shareholders are key differentiators for us.
Let's turn to Advice & Wealth Management, where we delivered a very strong quarter and good organic growth. Beginning with our clients, with delivering a differentiated level of advice, keeping clients focused on their goals, which was key in a volatile, disruptive year. Total client assets were up 14% to $732 billion, driven by excellent client flows and positive markets. As you know, we've built a leading investment advisory business, and it continues to grow nicely. In the quarter, wrap net inflows were close to $8 billion, up 82% over last year. This was another record for us and a great indication of our excellent client, adviser engagement and focus on growth. 
Another highlight was transactional activity bouncing back and up 5% over last year. And client cash balances continue to grow and ended the quarter at $41.5 billion, up $2.1 billion from last quarter. Meanwhile, we're continuing to invest to make our offering even more compelling for clients and advisers. We continue to see very good engagement in our digital capabilities, allowing advisers and clients to interact and transact seamlessly, and the majority of clients now have their goals online and follow their progress. 
Our advisers are utilizing our tools and capabilities on our integrated technology platform. They are reporting that they're processing business more efficiently and spending more time with their clients and growing their practices. That's evident in increased financial planning and adviser productivity, which was up 8% adjusting for interest rates. 
You've heard me share that one of the greatest benefits of being an Ameriprise adviser is our caring culture, including truly best-in-class support and strong field leadership. I recently spoke with all of our field leaders to kick off the year. They're energized about Ameriprise and are focused on continuing to drive productivity and growth. 
This high level of support is also reflected in our recruiting success. Our virtual recruiting program is extremely effective and continues to drive strong results, with 82 experienced advisers joining us in the fourth quarter. We're recruiting top advisers from across the industry who recognize that Ameriprise offers the value proposition, technology and level of support that can help them deliver an exceptional adviser-based client experience and take their practices to the next level of success. 
And we have a track record of helping advisers grow 2.5x faster than peers which is very compelling from a competitive perspective. 
So far, in 2021, this momentum continues, and the recruiting pipeline remains strong. It was also great to see that our client service teams were once again recognized by J.D. Power for the excellent experience they deliver. This certification recognizes best practices from the highest performing contact centers across all industries, not just financial services. 
Regarding the bank, total assets grew to $8 billion, with $7 billion of sweep deposits. We plan to move additional deposits to the bank this year. We also added pledged loans to the product portfolio in the quarter, and we're seeing a good response to date. It's an appealing product for high-end net worth clients seeking liquidity. 
Wrapping up AWM, margin was strong at 19.8% and was up 60 basis points sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, expenses continue to be well managed with G&A, up only 2%, and that includes investments in the bank.
Next, Retirement & Protection Solutions. This business is performing well and in line with our expectations. We're executing our plan to drive a mix shift in the business, focusing on higher returning products given the rate environment, which is further reducing our risk. 
Variable annuity sales increased nicely, up 20%, driven by the success of the structured product we introduced earlier in the year, more than offsetting reduced sales of living benefit products. 
Very importantly, this increased the percentage of VA sales without living benefits, which grew to 58% of total sales in the quarter. 
In Protection, while sales were down 4% year-over-year, we've seen improvement quarter-to-quarter. Sales of our flagship VUL product doubled in the quarter, offsetting the reduced sales from IUL products. This product both better meets clients' needs in this rate environment, while generating good returns for the firm. 
Clearly, as Ameriprise continues to grow overall, the Retirement & Protection Solutions segment will represent a small part of our business mix over time. 
With regard to fixed annuities, I know some of you are interested in our progress regarding a reinsurance transaction. We are actively looking to execute a transaction this year and are encouraged by the recent uptick in the tenure rate. 
Turning to Asset Management. We continue to build on our progress and have a great story to share as an active manager. The team is serving clients well in driving profitable growth. We continue to have excellent client engagement and investment performance. The investments we're making, including in data and digital, are helping to drive organic growth at Columbia Threadneedle, with strong results in North America.
We're targeting advisers better and delivering a compelling experience. And importantly, we strengthened our relationship with our distribution partners across regions, including with the large broker-dealer firms and independents in the U.S. We're also investing in our operating platform, including important work to reduce duplicate legacy systems.
In the quarter, we completed the final phase of the installation of our global trading portfolio management system, which will help our investment teams and drive additional efficiency and scale globally. With a continuation of positive flows and positive markets, assets under management grew 11% to $547 billion. 
Our Asset Management business is making strong contributions to our overall earnings and free cash flow. And margin for the quarter was nearly 40%. Looking ahead, we expect to remain in the 35% to 39% range. However, if these market levels hold, we should come in at the higher end. 
Strong investment performance has been essential to our success, and our teams have been collaborating really well through this pandemic. We have steadily invested to build a strong global platform with a disciplined research focus. And our people are delivering exceptional performance across all categories: equities; fixed income; and multi-asset strategies. 
At year-end, Columbia Threadneedle had 108, 4 and 5 star funds which shows the breadth and strength of our product lineup. In equities, on a global basis, over 70% of our funds on an asset weighted basis were above medium, while beating benchmarks over 1, 3 and 5-year periods. And that's across domestic and international strategies. 
With regard to fixed income, we also had great performance. More than 75% of our taxable funds on an asset weighted basis were above medium or beating benchmarks over the same time frames. 
So with this type of investment performance and the growth focus across the business, flows continue to be strong. Overall, excluding former parent outflows, we were net positive $8.3 billion for the quarter, an improvement of $4.1 billion from a year ago. 
In terms of total retail flows, excluding former parent, we were net positive by $7.7 billion, including reinvested dividends. These positive flows were driven by continued momentum in the U.S., where we were net inflows for 10 months of the year, and that included this location in March.
For the quarter, U.S. retail had $7.1 billion of net inflows. In fact, 30 Columbia strategies were in net inflows and 10 had gross sales in excess of $1 billion in 2020. And that's across equities, fixed income and our multi-manager lineup. 
In EMEA retail, we were in net inflows of more than $600 million in the quarter with particular strength in Continental Europe. Which more than offset outflows in the U.K. We're optimistic that the resolution of Brexit and the gradual reopening of the U.K. economy will be positive in terms of investor sentiment. 
And in terms of global institutional, we continue to gain traction, have a significant opportunity and platform to grow. We have a compelling lineup of capabilities and excellent investment performance. We recently added to our consultant relations team and strengthened client service. 
In the quarter, we had net inflows ex-former parent of about $500 million, driven by continued strength in EMEA. The pipeline looks attractive across our regions. So when I look across asset management, I'm very pleased with the momentum over the last number of quarters and our ability to sustain it.
Stepping back to Ameriprise overall, we're in a terrific position. We're delivering strong results and further reinforcing our record of navigating uncertain times. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and advisers and the resilience that they've shown during this pandemic. 
They've stayed focused on our clients, while continuing to drive the strong results you're seeing. 
Nearly a month into 2021, I feel very good about the high level of client engagement and business activity that we're generating. From a capital perspective, we're continuing to deliver a differentiated level of return. Our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent, and we're generating strong free cash flow. 
With that, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail and then I'll take your questions."
4165019,701262080,2184518,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, with adjusted operating EPS, up 8%. As strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds from low interest rates. Assets under management",1004,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, with adjusted operating EPS, up 8%. As strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds from low interest rates. Assets under management and administration reached a record $1.1 trillion including nearly $15 billion of inflows from RAP and Asset Management. 
We achieved our targeted reengineering for the year while investing for future growth in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. We continue to effectively manage our profile with continued mix shifts to lower risk, higher margin, Retirement & Protection Solution offerings and are actively exploring additional reinsurance opportunities. In 2020, we returned over $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders.
Our strong balance sheet fundamentals, coupled with sustained underlying business growth are driving free cash flow generation across our business segments. This positions us well as we enter 2021. Let's turn to slide 6. Ameriprise adjusted operating net revenue grew 6%, driven by strong underlying business trends and equity market appreciation. After excluding the benefit of $92 million of higher short-term interest rates in the prior period, general and administrative expenses are down 1%, even as we make investments for growth, including the bank. Expenses also include higher compensation associated with the impact of AMP share price appreciation in the quarter and strong business performance. We are able to achieve this result through disciplined reengineering initiatives. In total, we delivered strong underlying EPS growth, excluding interest rates of over 20% and very strong margins in the quarter.
Turning to slide 7. As Jim mentioned, Advice & Wealth management delivered robust organic growth. We continue to benefit from sustained traction and experienced adviser recruiting, a personalized client experience, effectiveness of our digital tools and success in reaching more of our target market. As you can see in these core areas, we had strong growth in client assets, wrap flows and adviser productivity. This is a good foundation as we move forward. 
On Page 8, financial results and Advice Wealth Management was strong, with underlying adjusted operating earnings, up 19% to $352 million after the $92 million interest rate headwind. This was driven by strong wrap net inflows, improved transactional activity and higher market levels as well as continued expense management. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, which would have been 160 basis points improvement year-over-year, excluding change in interest rates. On a sequential basis, the margin improved 60 basis points.
Turning to page 9. Asset Management delivered very good financial performance and continued improved flow trends. The cumulative impact of outflows has been a significant headwind for us in the past. As flows improved this year, that has declined, and if inflows continue, this would provide a tailwind for us in 2021. 
In the quarter, we had inflows of $8.3 billion, excluding former parent-related flows, which is a $4.1 billion improvement from a year ago. Investment performance, table stake for net inflows is excellent across a diverse product set. Adjusted operating revenues were $798 million. Revenue increased 7%, reflecting improved flow trends, stable fee rate and market appreciation after normalizing for the timing of the performance fees. 
General and administrative expenses remain well managed, reflecting disciplined expense reengineering that funded investments for growth. Adjusted for the timing of performance fees and other compensation related expense, G&A increased 2%. Putting this together, pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 13% with a 39.5% margin. Overall, we are very encouraged by the continued progress the business is making that is resulting in both strong flows and financial performance.
Let's turn to page 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectation in this market and rate environment. We are executing our strategy to shift our risk profile. In the quarter, 58% of sales were on products without living benefits, up 24% a year ago, driven by our new structured variable annuity product, along with the decline in sales of VA products with limping benefits. 
In Protection, sales were down 4% in total, with a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a significant decline in index universal life, a product that is not as attractive in this rate environment. These mix shifts are expected to continue going forward. 
Financial results continue to be in line with expectations. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 1% to $180 million. Like the industry, we are seeing an uptick in claim counts related to COVID-19, but we've experienced a limited financial impact. Overall, claims were more favorable than the prior year. This business is well managed. Net amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry, and our hedging has been extremely effective.
Turning to Page 11. In total, the Corporate & Other segment had a $60 million loss in the quarter, which was a $39 million improvement from the prior year. Excluding the closed blocks, the loss in Corporate segment improved 23% to $79 million. The prior-year period had elevated losses related to impairments in the affordable housing portfolio. The current year had approximately $24 million of incremental compensation expense related to the impacts of share price appreciation and company performance. 
In our closed blocks, long-term care had $21 million of earnings in the quarter due to a significant increase in terminations and lower new claims. Fixed annuities had a $2 million loss related to the low interest rate environment. We continue to evaluate opportunities to execute additional reinsurance transactions this year.
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong. Including a liquidity position of $2.3 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital of $1.9 billion, 98% hedge effectiveness in the quarter and 97% for the full year as well as a defensively positioned investment portfolio. Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 36%. We returned $502 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback, totaling over $1.8 billion for the full year. Overall, this was an excellent result for the quarter. 
With that, we'll take your questions."

I think what you're seeing, overall, and we've been talking about that, not just for like the fourth quarter, but over the course of the remaining part of the year after the pandemic. And so we had increased our reengineering goals in that regard, and we did achieve them.
Our expenses are being managed very well. But I would also say, we did also increase some investments we were making. We wanted to accelerate because of the great productivity we're having to even add a bit more in some of the technology and the capabilities that we wanted to bring to both the advisers and from a client perspective in our web activities. 
So our investment agenda, last year, was actually a bit higher in total dollars than in the year before. So that was embedded in our numbers. 
What I would say is the pickup you saw and a little bit of expenses were more from the stock price appreciation and what that does in some of our deferral programs on a mark-to-market. And that absorbed and some true-ups and some compensation based on the year and the strong fourth quarter. 
So I feel good about the expenses going into the new year. I think they will increase if the economy opens up a bit more as we bring travel and T&E and some other expenses back to some extent. And we continue our investment agenda. But I think we're going to manage expenses pretty well. And you can -- you know how we do that over time, but we'll continue to look at the business growth, the revenue growth and the market climate as we do that."

We've seen a pickup, as you saw in our flows and fees, our financial planning is up. 
So I would say that we want to continue to see that trend line of the margin continue to accrete. We also think we sort of hit a low point on the interest side of that. And over time, as we deploy a bit more into the bank and get some spread there, that would be helpful as well. So I would probably want to see that margin continue to be targeted to get back into the 20-plus percent range."

But as you saw, that's been consistent. Third quarter, we brought in good, even the second quarter after the pandemic that picked up nicely and the first quarter was good.
So no, that continues as an ongoing trend line in the spot of numbers. But I would say that it was more of increased activity from our current client flows as well as new clients that our current advisers were bringing into the franchise. 
Now whether that continues that $8 billion being the base? I can't tell you that, right? I think we all saw a pickup in some level of activities in the fourth quarter in the industry, clients put some more money to work because maybe it's a bit more optimism of the opening. But I would say, underlying it, we feel good about the activity, the level. It wasn't like it went from $2 billion to $8 billion. It was $6 billion in the third quarter.

So across a larger range, we have very good performance. So I think investment performance is part of a given here of what's necessary. I think that the team has done a really great job of broadening the distribution, getting better relationships established more on the various platforms and the due diligence and et cetera. 
I think we have a wide range of products that are -- a wider range that are being considered than in the past as well, and particularly, in certain categories that are making sense, like I said, in income categories. 
So I think it's a combination of factors that we worked hard at, over the last number of years that is starting to show some good results. We've made a lot of investments, both in the AWM business to continue to get flows and productivity. And the same thing in the Asset Management business. 
You know we continue -- we actually completed our whole trading and attribution platform in Columbia Threadneedle. The ability to share research globally has improved the ability to actually get more data and analytics informed to our investment people, our distribution people, to improve targeting, to understand where there might be some good opportunities. 
I actually think that Europe showed a nice bounce back. Remember, we had to go through a lot of change there of establishing a whole European lineup of funds with Brexit, and it sort of took us out of the market a bit for a while. And now that we're -- we've got that lineup established, we saw really strong flows into Europe this last quarter. 
U.K. is still a little weak because of the Brexit and the economy being closed, but we still see some signs that if that can open, with Brexit moving to another completion there that, that would also help. 
So I think it's a combination of factors, just as you said. I wouldn't point to one, but that's what gives us a good feeling as we move forward."

So we see an opportunity to continue, as we said, both for the movement of some of our sweep activities further into the bank. As you saw over the course of last year, we moved the bank, up from roughly $4 billion to $8 billion. So we gradually started to shift more into the bank. 
We see that continuing in the 2021 here in the new year. We're also trying to add more on the product capability, like we picked up the pledged loan book. We launched the mortgage product. We'll start to look to add some deposit products, other deposit products towards the latter part of the year maybe into next year. 
So there are different things like that we're looking at. But we feel the opportunity that will continue to shift a bit more into the bank on a gradual quarterly basis as we move forward. 
Walter, do you want to add anything?"

I mean, I could probably say that organic growth in client acquisition is up, nicely, both for the overall client base, but in particular, also for what we would call the targeted clients that we want in the 525 category.
That has been nice and strong and picked up nicely as we went through the quarters in the year. The flows from the current client base continues to be good and actually picked up further in the fourth quarter, as I said to you. 
The years that we're bringing in and the business and production they're bringing in continues along the trend line that we spoke to you about. Particularly as we continue to move more years into both the employee channel and the the independent channel. And that has picked up nicely and continue to add scale to us. 
So it's a combination of factors. We continue to get more efficient based on this technology we deployed that helps advisers concentrate more on their client engagement and can actually focus more on what they can do to deepen. 
Our advice formula is working really well. We have more than 50% of the -- majority of our clients now have goals online that they can track and progress with and see very visibly of what they're doing and executing their strategies. 
So all of those things, we feel really strengthen the underlying core of the base. And so remember, with the client base we have, with the deepening we have with those clients, with the further engagement around Advice. And with our advisers now feeling a little more comfortable dealing with the pandemic that they can go out and get more new clients and add clients in this environment or as the environment improves and open, I think, will be a positive for us. 
So I can't judge it against any particular. I know a number of our competitors have -- if I look at what the warehouses reported, et cetera, I think we're standing pretty strong against that. 
If I look at competitors that have acquired and have added through to acquisitions, of course, you're always going to see an increase because of what's put on from that end on a comparative basis. So I can't necessarily separate them. But I feel, organically, and from a core business, we're doing very well."

As you saw in our release, Ameriprise delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year, considering the challenging operating environment. In the quarter, equity markets rallied",1756,"Good morning, and thanks for joining our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. As you saw in our release, Ameriprise delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year, considering the challenging operating environment. 
In the quarter, equity markets rallied on positive vaccine news, the outcome of the U.S. election and the likelihood of further fiscal stimulus. The strength of our advice value proposition, investment expertise and solutions are translating to our business results. 
Client activity inflows in the quarter continue to be very strong. And we set new records, including ending the quarter with assets under management and administration of $1.1 trillion, an important milestone. 
Revenues in the quarter were quite good, up 3% to over $3, driven by strong business fundamentals and positive equity markets, offsetting the interest rate headwinds. Earnings per share also increased nicely in the quarter, up 8%, and ROE remains very strong at 36%.
During the quarter, we continue to make good investments in the business as well as continuing to execute against our reengineering goals, resulting in a 1% decline in G&A expenses. We're always looking to drive efficiency and invest strategically to extend our position. It's core to how we operate. 
We also returned more than $500 million to shareholders, which was 90% of our adjusted operating earnings and among the best in financial services. 
For the full-year, we returned close to $2 billion. Very clearly, our ability to consistently generate substantial free cash flow as well as to reinvest and return to shareholders are key differentiators for us.
Let's turn to Advice & Wealth Management, where we delivered a very strong quarter and good organic growth. Beginning with our clients, with delivering a differentiated level of advice, keeping clients focused on their goals, which was key in a volatile, disruptive year. Total client assets were up 14% to $732 billion, driven by excellent client flows and positive markets. As you know, we've built a leading investment advisory business, and it continues to grow nicely. In the quarter, wrap net inflows were close to $8 billion, up 82% over last year. This was another record for us and a great indication of our excellent client, adviser engagement and focus on growth. 
Another highlight was transactional activity bouncing back and up 5% over last year. And client cash balances continue to grow and ended the quarter at $41.5 billion, up $2.1 billion from last quarter. Meanwhile, we're continuing to invest to make our offering even more compelling for clients and advisers. We continue to see very good engagement in our digital capabilities, allowing advisers and clients to interact and transact seamlessly, and the majority of clients now have their goals online and follow their progress. 
Our advisers are utilizing our tools and capabilities on our integrated technology platform. They are reporting that they're processing business more efficiently and spending more time with their clients and growing their practices. That's evident in increased financial planning and adviser productivity, which was up 8% adjusting for interest rates. 
You've heard me share that one of the greatest benefits of being an Ameriprise adviser is our caring culture, including truly best-in-class support and strong field leadership. I recently spoke with all of our field leaders to kick off the year. They're energized about Ameriprise and are focused on continuing to drive productivity and growth. 
This high level of support is also reflected in our recruiting success. Our virtual recruiting program is extremely effective and continues to drive strong results, with 82 experienced advisers joining us in the fourth quarter. We're recruiting top advisers from across the industry who recognize that Ameriprise offers the value proposition, technology and level of support that can help them deliver an exceptional adviser-based client experience and take their practices to the next level of success. 
And we have a track record of helping advisers grow 2.5x faster than peers which is very compelling from a competitive perspective. 
So far, in 2021, this momentum continues, and the recruiting pipeline remains strong. It was also great to see that our client service teams were once again recognized by J.D. Power for the excellent experience they deliver. This certification recognizes best practices from the highest performing contact centers across all industries, not just financial services. 
Regarding the bank, total assets grew to $8 billion, with $7 billion of sweep deposits. We plan to move additional deposits to the bank this year. We also added pledged loans to the product portfolio in the quarter, and we're seeing a good response to date. It's an appealing product for high-end net worth clients seeking liquidity. 
Wrapping up AWM, margin was strong at 19.8% and was up 60 basis points sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, expenses continue to be well managed with G&A, up only 2%, and that includes investments in the bank.
Next, Retirement & Protection Solutions. This business is performing well and in line with our expectations. We're executing our plan to drive a mix shift in the business, focusing on higher returning products given the rate environment, which is further reducing our risk. 
Variable annuity sales increased nicely, up 20%, driven by the success of the structured product we introduced earlier in the year, more than offsetting reduced sales of living benefit products. 
Very importantly, this increased the percentage of VA sales without living benefits, which grew to 58% of total sales in the quarter. 
In Protection, while sales were down 4% year-over-year, we've seen improvement quarter-to-quarter. Sales of our flagship VUL product doubled in the quarter, offsetting the reduced sales from IUL products. This product both better meets clients' needs in this rate environment, while generating good returns for the firm. 
Clearly, as Ameriprise continues to grow overall, the Retirement & Protection Solutions segment will represent a small part of our business mix over time. 
With regard to fixed annuities, I know some of you are interested in our progress regarding a reinsurance transaction. We are actively looking to execute a transaction this year and are encouraged by the recent uptick in the tenure rate. 
Turning to Asset Management. We continue to build on our progress and have a great story to share as an active manager. The team is serving clients well in driving profitable growth. We continue to have excellent client engagement and investment performance. The investments we're making, including in data and digital, are helping to drive organic growth at Columbia Threadneedle, with strong results in North America.
We're targeting advisers better and delivering a compelling experience. And importantly, we strengthened our relationship with our distribution partners across regions, including with the large broker-dealer firms and independents in the U.S. We're also investing in our operating platform, including important work to reduce duplicate legacy systems.
In the quarter, we completed the final phase of the installation of our global trading portfolio management system, which will help our investment teams and drive additional efficiency and scale globally. With a continuation of positive flows and positive markets, assets under management grew 11% to $547 billion. 
Our Asset Management business is making strong contributions to our overall earnings and free cash flow. And margin for the quarter was nearly 40%. Looking ahead, we expect to remain in the 35% to 39% range. However, if these market levels hold, we should come in at the higher end. 
Strong investment performance has been essential to our success, and our teams have been collaborating really well through this pandemic. We have steadily invested to build a strong global platform with a disciplined research focus. And our people are delivering exceptional performance across all categories: equities; fixed income; and multi-asset strategies. 
At year-end, Columbia Threadneedle had 108, 4 and 5 star funds which shows the breadth and strength of our product lineup. In equities, on a global basis, over 70% of our funds on an asset weighted basis were above medium, while beating benchmarks over 1, 3 and 5-year periods. And that's across domestic and international strategies. 
With regard to fixed income, we also had great performance. More than 75% of our taxable funds on an asset weighted basis were above medium or beating benchmarks over the same time frames. 
So with this type of investment performance and the growth focus across the business, flows continue to be strong. Overall, excluding former parent outflows, we were net positive $8.3 billion for the quarter, an improvement of $4.1 billion from a year ago. 
In terms of total retail flows, excluding former parent, we were net positive by $7.7 billion, including reinvested dividends. These positive flows were driven by continued momentum in the U.S., where we were net inflows for 10 months of the year, and that included this location in March.
For the quarter, U.S. retail had $7.1 billion of net inflows. In fact, 30 Columbia strategies were in net inflows and 10 had gross sales in excess of $1 billion in 2020. And that's across equities, fixed income and our multi-manager lineup. 
In EMEA retail, we were in net inflows of more than $600 million in the quarter with particular strength in Continental Europe. Which more than offset outflows in the U.K. We're optimistic that the resolution of Brexit and the gradual reopening of the U.K. economy will be positive in terms of investor sentiment. 
And in terms of global institutional, we continue to gain traction, have a significant opportunity and platform to grow. We have a compelling lineup of capabilities and excellent investment performance. We recently added to our consultant relations team and strengthened client service. 
In the quarter, we had net inflows ex-former parent of about $500 million, driven by continued strength in EMEA. The pipeline looks attractive across our regions. So when I look across asset management, I'm very pleased with the momentum over the last number of quarters and our ability to sustain it.
Stepping back to Ameriprise overall, we're in a terrific position. We're delivering strong results and further reinforcing our record of navigating uncertain times. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and advisers and the resilience that they've shown during this pandemic. 
They've stayed focused on our clients, while continuing to drive the strong results you're seeing. 
Nearly a month into 2021, I feel very good about the high level of client engagement and business activity that we're generating. From a capital perspective, we're continuing to deliver a differentiated level of return. Our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent, and we're generating strong free cash flow. 
With that, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail and then I'll take your questions."

Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, with adjusted operating EPS, up 8%. As strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds from low interest rates. Assets under management",1004,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, with adjusted operating EPS, up 8%. As strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds from low interest rates. Assets under management and administration reached a record $1.1 trillion including nearly $15 billion of inflows from RAP and Asset Management. 
We achieved our targeted reengineering for the year while investing for future growth in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. We continue to effectively manage our profile with continued mix shifts to lower risk, higher margin, Retirement & Protection Solution offerings and are actively exploring additional reinsurance opportunities. In 2020, we returned over $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders.
Our strong balance sheet fundamentals, coupled with sustained underlying business growth are driving free cash flow generation across our business segments. This positions us well as we enter 2021. Let's turn to slide 6. Ameriprise adjusted operating net revenue grew 6%, driven by strong underlying business trends and equity market appreciation. After excluding the benefit of $92 million of higher short-term interest rates in the prior period, general and administrative expenses are down 1%, even as we make investments for growth, including the bank. Expenses also include higher compensation associated with the impact of AMP share price appreciation in the quarter and strong business performance. We are able to achieve this result through disciplined reengineering initiatives. In total, we delivered strong underlying EPS growth, excluding interest rates of over 20% and very strong margins in the quarter.
Turning to slide 7. As Jim mentioned, Advice & Wealth management delivered robust organic growth. We continue to benefit from sustained traction and experienced adviser recruiting, a personalized client experience, effectiveness of our digital tools and success in reaching more of our target market. As you can see in these core areas, we had strong growth in client assets, wrap flows and adviser productivity. This is a good foundation as we move forward. 
On Page 8, financial results and Advice Wealth Management was strong, with underlying adjusted operating earnings, up 19% to $352 million after the $92 million interest rate headwind. This was driven by strong wrap net inflows, improved transactional activity and higher market levels as well as continued expense management. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, which would have been 160 basis points improvement year-over-year, excluding change in interest rates. On a sequential basis, the margin improved 60 basis points.
Turning to page 9. Asset Management delivered very good financial performance and continued improved flow trends. The cumulative impact of outflows has been a significant headwind for us in the past. As flows improved this year, that has declined, and if inflows continue, this would provide a tailwind for us in 2021. 
In the quarter, we had inflows of $8.3 billion, excluding former parent-related flows, which is a $4.1 billion improvement from a year ago. Investment performance, table stake for net inflows is excellent across a diverse product set. Adjusted operating revenues were $798 million. Revenue increased 7%, reflecting improved flow trends, stable fee rate and market appreciation after normalizing for the timing of the performance fees. 
General and administrative expenses remain well managed, reflecting disciplined expense reengineering that funded investments for growth. Adjusted for the timing of performance fees and other compensation related expense, G&A increased 2%. Putting this together, pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 13% with a 39.5% margin. Overall, we are very encouraged by the continued progress the business is making that is resulting in both strong flows and financial performance.
Let's turn to page 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectation in this market and rate environment. We are executing our strategy to shift our risk profile. In the quarter, 58% of sales were on products without living benefits, up 24% a year ago, driven by our new structured variable annuity product, along with the decline in sales of VA products with limping benefits. 
In Protection, sales were down 4% in total, with a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a significant decline in index universal life, a product that is not as attractive in this rate environment. These mix shifts are expected to continue going forward. 
Financial results continue to be in line with expectations. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 1% to $180 million. Like the industry, we are seeing an uptick in claim counts related to COVID-19, but we've experienced a limited financial impact. Overall, claims were more favorable than the prior year. This business is well managed. Net amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry, and our hedging has been extremely effective.
Turning to Page 11. In total, the Corporate & Other segment had a $60 million loss in the quarter, which was a $39 million improvement from the prior year. Excluding the closed blocks, the loss in Corporate segment improved 23% to $79 million. The prior-year period had elevated losses related to impairments in the affordable housing portfolio. The current year had approximately $24 million of incremental compensation expense related to the impacts of share price appreciation and company performance. 
In our closed blocks, long-term care had $21 million of earnings in the quarter due to a significant increase in terminations and lower new claims. Fixed annuities had a $2 million loss related to the low interest rate environment. We continue to evaluate opportunities to execute additional reinsurance transactions this year.
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong. Including a liquidity position of $2.3 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital of $1.9 billion, 98% hedge effectiveness in the quarter and 97% for the full year as well as a defensively positioned investment portfolio. Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 36%. We returned $502 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback, totaling over $1.8 billion for the full year. Overall, this was an excellent result for the quarter. 
With that, we'll take your questions."

We actually grew our client base. We -- our new client acquisition picked up even more. And we saw a good level of activity with our advisers. 
Now some of that could be people feeling a little better as the vaccine came about as well. And the idea that the economy and activities would continue to open up. But I would probably say we've seen a more consistent, strong flow coming in. So we feel good about the underlying growth factors.

I think what you're seeing, overall, and we've been talking about that, not just for like the fourth quarter, but over the course of the remaining part of the year after the pandemic. And so we had increased our reengineering goals in that regard, and we did achieve them.
Our expenses are being managed very well. But I would also say, we did also increase some investments we were making. We wanted to accelerate because of the great productivity we're having to even add a bit more in some of the technology and the capabilities that we wanted to bring to both the advisers and from a client perspective in our web activities. 
So our investment agenda, last year, was actually a bit higher in total dollars than in the year before. So that was embedded in our numbers. 
What I would say is the pickup you saw and a little bit of expenses were more from the stock price appreciation and what that does in some of our deferral programs on a mark-to-market. And that absorbed and some true-ups and some compensation based on the year and the strong fourth quarter. 
So I feel good about the expenses going into the new year. I think they will increase if the economy opens up a bit more as we bring travel and T&E and some other expenses back to some extent. And we continue our investment agenda. But I think we're going to manage expenses pretty well. And you can -- you know how we do that over time, but we'll continue to look at the business growth, the revenue growth and the market climate as we do that."

So no, that continues as an ongoing trend line in the spot of numbers. But I would say that it was more of increased activity from our current client flows as well as new clients that our current advisers were bringing into the franchise. 
Now whether that continues that $8 billion being the base? I can't tell you that, right? I think we all saw a pickup in some level of activities in the fourth quarter in the industry, clients put some more money to work because maybe it's a bit more optimism of the opening. But I would say, underlying it, we feel good about the activity, the level. It wasn't like it went from $2 billion to $8 billion. It was $6 billion in the third quarter. So -- but whether it's $8 billion or $7 billion or $6 billion, I can't tell you that exactly. I mean, there's always some level of seasonality, et cetera, as well. But I feel good about the underlying, and I feel good that there will be a good underlying trend there as we move into this year, if there's no major disruption. So that's what I would say."

So across a larger range, we have very good performance. So I think investment performance is part of a given here of what's necessary. I think that the team has done a really great job of broadening the distribution, getting better relationships established more on the various platforms and the due diligence and et cetera. 
I think we have a wide range of products that are -- a wider range that are being considered than in the past as well, and particularly, in certain categories that are making sense, like I said, in income categories. 
So I think it's a combination of factors that we worked hard at, over the last number of years that is starting to show some good results. We've made a lot of investments, both in the AWM business to continue to get flows and productivity. And the same thing in the Asset Management business. 
You know we continue -- we actually completed our whole trading and attribution platform in Columbia Threadneedle. The ability to share research globally has improved the ability to actually get more data and analytics informed to our investment people, our distribution people, to improve targeting, to understand where there might be some good opportunities. 
I actually think that Europe showed a nice bounce back. Remember, we had to go through a lot of change there of establishing a whole European lineup of funds with Brexit, and it sort of took us out of the market a bit for a while. And now that we're -- we've got that lineup established, we saw really strong flows into Europe this last quarter. 
U.K. is still a little weak because of the Brexit and the economy being closed, but we still see some signs that if that can open, with Brexit moving to another completion there that, that would also help. 
So I think it's a combination of factors, just as you said. I wouldn't point to one, but that's what gives us a good feeling as we move forward."

That has been nice and strong and picked up nicely as we went through the quarters in the year. The flows from the current client base continues to be good and actually picked up further in the fourth quarter, as I said to you. 
The years that we're bringing in and the business and production they're bringing in continues along the trend line that we spoke to you about. Particularly as we continue to move more years into both the employee channel and the independent channel. And that has picked up nicely and continue to add scale to us. 
So it's a combination of factors. We continue to get more efficient based on this technology we deployed that helps advisers concentrate more on their client engagement and can actually focus more on what they can do to deepen. 
Our advice formula is working really well. We have more than 50% of the -- majority of our clients now have goals online that they can track and progress with and see very visibly of what they're doing and executing their strategies. 
So all of those things, we feel really strengthen the underlying core of the base. And so remember, with the client base we have, with the deepening we have with those clients, with the further engagement around Advice. And with our advisers now feeling a little more comfortable dealing with the pandemic that they can go out and get more new clients and add clients in this environment or as the environment improves and open, I think, will be a positive for us. 
So I can't judge it against any particular. I know a number of our competitors have -- if I look at what the warehouses reported, et cetera, I think we're standing pretty strong against that. 
If I look at competitors that have acquired and have added through to acquisitions, of course, you're always going to see an increase because of what's put on from that end on a comparative basis. So I can't necessarily separate them. But I feel, organically, and from a core business, we're doing very well."

Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website at www.ir.ameriprise.com. 
Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance.
These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings release, our 2019 annual report to shareholders and our 2019 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.
On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that, you see our adjusted operating results which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.

As you saw in our release, Ameriprise delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year, considering the challenging operating environment. In the quarter, equity markets rallied",1756,"Good morning, and thanks for joining our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. As you saw in our release, Ameriprise delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year, considering the challenging operating environment. 
In the quarter, equity markets rallied on positive vaccine news, the outcome of the U.S. election and the likelihood of further fiscal stimulus. The strength of our advice value proposition, investment expertise and solutions are translating to our business results. 
Client activity inflows in the quarter continue to be very strong. And we set new records, including ending the quarter with assets under management and administration of $1.1 trillion, an important milestone. 
Revenues in the quarter were quite good, up 3% to over $3, driven by strong business fundamentals and positive equity markets, offsetting the interest rate headwinds. Earnings per share also increased nicely in the quarter, up 8%, and ROE remains very strong at 36%.
During the quarter, we continue to make good investments in the business as well as continuing to execute against our reengineering goals, resulting in a 1% decline in G&A expenses. We're always looking to drive efficiency and invest strategically to extend our position. It's core to how we operate. 
We also returned more than $500 million to shareholders, which was 90% of our adjusted operating earnings and among the best in financial services. 
For the full-year, we returned close to $2 billion. Very clearly, our ability to consistently generate substantial free cash flow as well as to reinvest and return to shareholders are key differentiators for us.
Let's turn to Advice & Wealth Management, where we delivered a very strong quarter and good organic growth. Beginning with our clients, with delivering a differentiated level of advice, keeping clients focused on their goals, which was key in a volatile, disruptive year. Total client assets were up 14% to $732 billion, driven by excellent client flows and positive markets. As you know, we've built a leading investment advisory business, and it continues to grow nicely. In the quarter, wrap net inflows were close to $8 billion, up 82% over last year. This was another record for us and a great indication of our excellent client, adviser engagement and focus on growth. 
Another highlight was transactional activity bouncing back and up 5% over last year. And client cash balances continue to grow and ended the quarter at $41.5 billion, up $2.1 billion from last quarter. Meanwhile, we're continuing to invest to make our offering even more compelling for clients and advisers. We continue to see very good engagement in our digital capabilities, allowing advisers and clients to interact and transact seamlessly, and the majority of clients now have their goals online and follow their progress. 
Our advisers are utilizing our tools and capabilities on our integrated technology platform. They are reporting that they're processing business more efficiently and spending more time with their clients and growing their practices. That's evident in increased financial planning and adviser productivity, which was up 8% adjusting for interest rates. 
You've heard me share that one of the greatest benefits of being an Ameriprise adviser is our caring culture, including truly best-in-class support and strong field leadership. I recently spoke with all of our field leaders to kick off the year. They're energized about Ameriprise and are focused on continuing to drive productivity and growth. 
This high level of support is also reflected in our recruiting success. Our virtual recruiting program is extremely effective and continues to drive strong results, with 82 experienced advisers joining us in the fourth quarter. We're recruiting top advisers from across the industry who recognize that Ameriprise offers the value proposition, technology and level of support that can help them deliver an exceptional adviser-based client experience and take their practices to the next level of success. 
And we have a track record of helping advisers grow 2.5x faster than peers which is very compelling from a competitive perspective. 
So far, in 2021, this momentum continues, and the recruiting pipeline remains strong. It was also great to see that our client service teams were once again recognized by J.D. Power for the excellent experience they deliver. This certification recognizes best practices from the highest performing contact centers across all industries, not just financial services. 
Regarding the bank, total assets grew to $8 billion, with $7 billion of sweep deposits. We plan to move additional deposits to the bank this year. We also added pledged loans to the product portfolio in the quarter, and we're seeing a good response to date. It's an appealing product for high-end net worth clients seeking liquidity. 
Wrapping up AWM, margin was strong at 19.8% and was up 60 basis points sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, expenses continue to be well managed with G&A, up only 2%, and that includes investments in the bank.
Next, Retirement & Protection Solutions. This business is performing well and in line with our expectations. We're executing our plan to drive a mix shift in the business, focusing on higher returning products given the rate environment, which is further reducing our risk. 
Variable annuity sales increased nicely, up 20%, driven by the success of the structured product we introduced earlier in the year, more than offsetting reduced sales of living benefit products. 
Very importantly, this increased the percentage of VA sales without living benefits, which grew to 58% of total sales in the quarter. 
In Protection, while sales were down 4% year-over-year, we've seen improvement quarter-to-quarter. Sales of our flagship VUL product doubled in the quarter, offsetting the reduced sales from IUL products. This product both better meets clients' needs in this rate environment, while generating good returns for the firm. 
Clearly, as Ameriprise continues to grow overall, the Retirement & Protection Solutions segment will represent a small part of our business mix over time. 
With regard to fixed annuities, I know some of you are interested in our progress regarding a reinsurance transaction. We are actively looking to execute a transaction this year and are encouraged by the recent uptick in the tenure rate. 
Turning to Asset Management. We continue to build on our progress and have a great story to share as an active manager. The team is serving clients well in driving profitable growth. We continue to have excellent client engagement and investment performance. The investments we're making, including in data and digital, are helping to drive organic growth at Columbia Threadneedle, with strong results in North America.
We're targeting advisers better and delivering a compelling experience. And importantly, we strengthened our relationship with our distribution partners across regions, including with the large broker-dealer firms and independents in the U.S. We're also investing in our operating platform, including important work to reduce duplicate legacy systems.
In the quarter, we completed the final phase of the installation of our global trading portfolio management system, which will help our investment teams and drive additional efficiency and scale globally. With a continuation of positive flows and positive markets, assets under management grew 11% to $547 billion. 
Our Asset Management business is making strong contributions to our overall earnings and free cash flow. And margin for the quarter was nearly 40%. Looking ahead, we expect to remain in the 35% to 39% range. However, if these market levels hold, we should come in at the higher end. 
Strong investment performance has been essential to our success, and our teams have been collaborating really well through this pandemic. We have steadily invested to build a strong global platform with a disciplined research focus. And our people are delivering exceptional performance across all categories: equities; fixed income; and multi-asset strategies. 
At year-end, Columbia Threadneedle had 108, 4 and 5 star funds which shows the breadth and strength of our product lineup. In equities, on a global basis, over 70% of our funds on an asset weighted basis were above medium, while beating benchmarks over 1, 3 and 5-year periods. And that's across domestic and international strategies. 
With regard to fixed income, we also had great performance. More than 75% of our taxable funds on an asset weighted basis were above medium or beating benchmarks over the same time frames. 
So with this type of investment performance and the growth focus across the business, flows continue to be strong. Overall, excluding former parent outflows, we were net positive $8.3 billion for the quarter, an improvement of $4.1 billion from a year ago. 
In terms of total retail flows, excluding former parent, we were net positive by $7.7 billion, including reinvested dividends. These positive flows were driven by continued momentum in the U.S., where we were net inflows for 10 months of the year, and that included this location in March.
For the quarter, U.S. retail had $7.1 billion of net inflows. In fact, 30 Columbia strategies were in net inflows and 10 had gross sales in excess of $1 billion in 2020. And that's across equities, fixed income and our multi-manager lineup. 
In EMEA retail, we were in net inflows of more than $600 million in the quarter with particular strength in Continental Europe. Which more than offset outflows in the U.K. We're optimistic that the resolution of Brexit and the gradual reopening of the U.K. economy will be positive in terms of investor sentiment. 
And in terms of global institutional, we continue to gain traction, have a significant opportunity and platform to grow. We have a compelling lineup of capabilities and excellent investment performance. We recently added to our consultant relations team and strengthened client service. 
In the quarter, we had net inflows ex-former parent of about $500 million, driven by continued strength in EMEA. The pipeline looks attractive across our regions. So when I look across asset management, I'm very pleased with the momentum over the last number of quarters and our ability to sustain it.
Stepping back to Ameriprise overall, we're in a terrific position. We're delivering strong results and further reinforcing our record of navigating uncertain times. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and advisers and the resilience that they've shown during this pandemic. 
They've stayed focused on our clients, while continuing to drive the strong results you're seeing. 
Nearly a month into 2021, I feel very good about the high level of client engagement and business activity that we're generating. From a capital perspective, we're continuing to deliver a differentiated level of return. Our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent, and we're generating strong free cash flow. 
With that, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail and then I'll take your questions."

Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, with adjusted operating EPS, up 8%. As strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds from low interest rates. Assets under management",1004,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, with adjusted operating EPS, up 8%. As strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds from low interest rates. Assets under management and administration reached a record $1.1 trillion including nearly $15 billion of inflows from RAP and Asset Management. 
We achieved our targeted reengineering for the year while investing for future growth in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. We continue to effectively manage our profile with continued mix shifts to lower risk, higher margin, Retirement & Protection Solution offerings and are actively exploring additional reinsurance opportunities. In 2020, we returned over $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders.
Our strong balance sheet fundamentals, coupled with sustained underlying business growth are driving free cash flow generation across our business segments. This positions us well as we enter 2021. Let's turn to slide 6. Ameriprise adjusted operating net revenue grew 6%, driven by strong underlying business trends and equity market appreciation. After excluding the benefit of $92 million of higher short-term interest rates in the prior period, general and administrative expenses are down 1%, even as we make investments for growth, including the bank. Expenses also include higher compensation associated with the impact of AMP share price appreciation in the quarter and strong business performance. We are able to achieve this result through disciplined reengineering initiatives. In total, we delivered strong underlying EPS growth, excluding interest rates of over 20% and very strong margins in the quarter.
Turning to slide 7. As Jim mentioned, Advice & Wealth management delivered robust organic growth. We continue to benefit from sustained traction and experienced adviser recruiting, a personalized client experience, effectiveness of our digital tools and success in reaching more of our target market. As you can see in these core areas, we had strong growth in client assets, wrap flows and adviser productivity. This is a good foundation as we move forward. 
On Page 8, financial results and Advice Wealth Management was strong, with underlying adjusted operating earnings, up 19% to $352 million after the $92 million interest rate headwind. This was driven by strong wrap net inflows, improved transactional activity and higher market levels as well as continued expense management. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, which would have been 160 basis points improvement year-over-year, excluding change in interest rates. On a sequential basis, the margin improved 60 basis points.
Turning to page 9. Asset Management delivered very good financial performance and continued improved flow trends. The cumulative impact of outflows has been a significant headwind for us in the past. As flows improved this year, that has declined, and if inflows continue, this would provide a tailwind for us in 2021. 
In the quarter, we had inflows of $8.3 billion, excluding former parent-related flows, which is a $4.1 billion improvement from a year ago. Investment performance, table stake for net inflows is excellent across a diverse product set. Adjusted operating revenues were $798 million. Revenue increased 7%, reflecting improved flow trends, stable fee rate and market appreciation after normalizing for the timing of the performance fees. 
General and administrative expenses remain well managed, reflecting disciplined expense reengineering that funded investments for growth. Adjusted for the timing of performance fees and other compensation related expense, G&A increased 2%. Putting this together, pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 13% with a 39.5% margin. Overall, we are very encouraged by the continued progress the business is making that is resulting in both strong flows and financial performance.
Let's turn to page 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectation in this market and rate environment. We are executing our strategy to shift our risk profile. In the quarter, 58% of sales were on products without living benefits, up 24% a year ago, driven by our new structured variable annuity product, along with the decline in sales of VA products with limping benefits. 
In Protection, sales were down 4% in total, with a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a significant decline in index universal life, a product that is not as attractive in this rate environment. These mix shifts are expected to continue going forward. 
Financial results continue to be in line with expectations. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 1% to $180 million. Like the industry, we are seeing an uptick in claim counts related to COVID-19, but we've experienced a limited financial impact. Overall, claims were more favorable than the prior year. This business is well managed. Net amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry, and our hedging has been extremely effective.
Turning to Page 11. In total, the Corporate & Other segment had a $60 million loss in the quarter, which was a $39 million improvement from the prior year. Excluding the closed blocks, the loss in Corporate segment improved 23% to $79 million. The prior-year period had elevated losses related to impairments in the affordable housing portfolio. The current year had approximately $24 million of incremental compensation expense related to the impacts of share price appreciation and company performance. 
In our closed blocks, long-term care had $21 million of earnings in the quarter due to a significant increase in terminations and lower new claims. Fixed annuities had a $2 million loss related to the low interest rate environment. We continue to evaluate opportunities to execute additional reinsurance transactions this year.
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong. Including a liquidity position of $2.3 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital of $1.9 billion, 98% hedge effectiveness in the quarter and 97% for the full year as well as a defensively positioned investment portfolio. Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 36%. We returned $502 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback, totaling over $1.8 billion for the full year. Overall, this was an excellent result for the quarter. 
With that, we'll take your questions."

I think what you're seeing, overall, and we've been talking about that, not just for like the fourth quarter, but over the course of the remaining part of the year after the pandemic. And so we had increased our reengineering goals in that regard, and we did achieve them.
Our expenses are being managed very well. But I would also say, we did also increase some investments we were making. We wanted to accelerate because of the great productivity we're having to even add a bit more in some of the technology and the capabilities that we wanted to bring to both the advisers and from a client perspective in our web activities. 
So our investment agenda, last year, was actually a bit higher in total dollars than in the year before. So that was embedded in our numbers. 
What I would say is the pickup you saw and a little bit of expenses were more from the stock price appreciation and what that does in some of our deferral programs on a mark-to-market. And that absorbed and some true-ups and some compensation based on the year and the strong fourth quarter. 
So I feel good about the expenses going into the new year. I think they will increase if the economy opens up a bit more as we bring travel and T&E and some other expenses back to some extent. And we continue our investment agenda. But I think we're going to manage expenses pretty well. And you can -- you know how we do that over time, but we'll continue to look at the business growth, the revenue growth and the market climate as we do that."

So we have a consistent capital deployment strategy as you've seen over the years.

From there, we then evaluate the opportunities that may, from both continuing to us to increase our dividend, buy back appropriately based on the free cash flow that we generate, which is very strong.
But we also evaluate acquisition opportunities. And in that regard, we do see that there's more opportunities coming about, but we're very disciplined of what would strategically help us grow, what we can get good returns, what would fit into both our culture and the environment to keep us on track.
And so we will continue to evaluate that. We have excess capital that would help along those lines as well as what we would do, as we look out based on the cash that we generate.
So that's the way we look at it. We haven't changed that philosophy, and we'll continue to focus in that way as we move forward."

So we feel like we have a broader, good lineup of funds. As what I mentioned to in my talking points, there were over 30 funds in that gross more than $1 billion. We had good net inflows and a number in the range of funds. So it's broadened from where we were. So we are continuing to see good flow in equities, particularly in the income-oriented equities across our lineup. 
We're seeing a pickup in activity in global and European activity in some of our funds there. In fixed income, we see it in certain of our income ranges, like mortgages, et cetera. And -- you -- also in equities and manage the -- we have risk allocation funds that are doing well and also growth.

Now whether that continues that $8 billion being the base? I can't tell you that, right?

I think we have a wide range of products that are -- a wider range that are being considered than in the past as well, and particularly, in certain categories that are making sense, like I said, in income categories. 
So I think it's a combination of factors that we worked hard at, over the last number of years that is starting to show some good results. We've made a lot of investments, both in the AWM business to continue to get flows and productivity. And the same thing in the Asset Management business. 
You know we continue -- we actually completed our whole trading and attribution platform in Columbia Threadneedle. The ability to share research globally has improved the ability to actually get more data and analytics informed to our investment people, our distribution people, to improve targeting, to understand where there might be some good opportunities. 
I actually think that Europe showed a nice bounce back. Remember, we had to go through a lot of change there of establishing a whole European lineup of funds with Brexit, and it sort of took us out of the market a bit for a while. And now that we're -- we've got that lineup established, we saw really strong flows into Europe this last quarter. 
U.K. is still a little weak because of the Brexit and the economy being closed, but we still see some signs that if that can open, with Brexit moving to another completion there that, that would also help. 
So I think it's a combination of factors, just as you said. I wouldn't point to one, but that's what gives us a good feeling as we move forward."

I mean, we feel like as we can continue to derive good margin and good returns from the bank activity as a complement to get greater spread or growth in various loan books there, like our pledged assets was growing nicely in the fourth quarter. We took over half of that book back and it -- the growth is being picked up, which is -- will be a good product for us. 
So we feel very comfortable continuing to add capital as required there. As you can see, all overall returns for the total firm are up in the mid- to upper 30s. So it's not as though we have a return issue. And with -- still, even with that, our cash flow and what we generate is strong. So it still gives us a good capital that we could continue to return or look for inorganic acquisitions. 
So I don't think that is going to be a pressing issue for us. But Walter, if you have something to comment."

Could you guys talk a little bit about the -- around sort of the incremental improvement in retail flows that we've seen for several quarters now? And by the way, it feels like that's continuing into the new year, which is great. 
But that incremental improvement, how much of that is coming from AWM versus third party distribution? I know that's been a big focus to kind of a bigger third-party distribution platforms. And as that occurs, how sort of does that mix shift, if it's meaningful at all, sort of impact the profitability for AMP as a whole? 
So in other words, like if you get much bigger in third-party distribution, does it impact sort the net profitability from wide kind of flows that are coming through those channels?"

I mean, I could probably say that organic growth in client acquisition is up, nicely, both for the overall client base, but in particular, also for what we would call the targeted clients that we want in the 525 category.
That has been nice and strong and picked up nicely as we went through the quarters in the year. The flows from the current client base continues to be good and actually picked up further in the fourth quarter, as I said to you. 
The years that we're bringing in and the business and production they're bringing in continues along the trend line that we spoke to you about. Particularly as we continue to move more years into both the employee channel and the independent channel. And that has picked up nicely and continue to add scale to us. 
So it's a combination of factors. We continue to get more efficient based on this technology we deployed that helps advisers concentrate more on their client engagement and can actually focus more on what they can do to deepen. 
Our advice formula is working really well. We have more than 50% of the -- majority of our clients now have goals online that they can track and progress with and see very visibly of what they're doing and executing their strategies. 
So all of those things, we feel really strengthen the underlying core of the base. And so remember, with the client base we have, with the deepening we have with those clients, with the further engagement around Advice. And with our advisers now feeling a little more comfortable dealing with the pandemic that they can go out and get more new clients and add clients in this environment or as the environment improves and open, I think, will be a positive for us. 
So I can't judge it against any particular. I know a number of our competitors have -- if I look at what the warehouses reported, et cetera, I think we're standing pretty strong against that. 
If I look at competitors that have acquired and have added through to acquisitions, of course, you're always going to see an increase because of what's put on from that end on a comparative basis. So I can't necessarily separate them. But I feel, organically, and from a core business, we're doing very well."

Thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. As you saw in yesterday's release, Ameriprise is off to a strong start in 2021. We're continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters, as you can see in our first quarter me",1636,"Good morning. Thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. As you saw in yesterday's release, Ameriprise is off to a strong start in 2021. We're continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters, as you can see in our first quarter metrics and financial results. 
Regarding the environment, equity markets continue to rally in the first quarter as vaccinations increased and activity accelerated with the U.S. beginning to open back up. The economy is gaining strength with the further fiscal stimulus as well as better employment data. 
With this backdrop, key for us is that we remain focused on serving our clients. Engagement is high, activity is strong, and we're bringing in record client flows across the business. We ended the quarter with assets under management and administration of 36% to $1.14 trillion, a new high. In addition, we recently announced the strategic acquisition of the BMO EMEA Asset Management business. 
Taking a step back, and looking at Ameriprise overall, I feel really good. We're executing well and delivering on our strategy for growth that we discussed with you. We continue to transform Ameriprise with Wealth Management and Asset Management now representing over 75% of operating earnings. 
You've seen the financials. Revenues are up 10% to over $3 billion. Earnings per share also increased nicely in the quarter of 27% ex the NOL benefit a year ago, even with low short-term interest rates this year versus last year's quarter, and ROE remains very strong at 30%. 
While we continue to invest strongly in the business, we are managing expenses thoughtfully. With our strong financial foundation and free cash flow generation, we returned more than $490 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our ongoing repurchase program, which is comparable to the last few quarters. Yesterday, we announced another 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, our 17th increase since becoming public 16 years ago. 
Let's discuss Advice & Wealth Management, where we've been executing well and driving growth. We're benefiting from the strategic investments we've been making to deliver a differentiated client adviser experience built on advice. We've been on a multiyear journey to take our client experience to the next level. 
A big part of that is the training and support we provide advisers and ensuring that the new digital tools and capabilities are fully integrated within their technology ecosystem. One of our more significant investments, our CRM platform, is increasingly serving as the hub for advisers allowing them to collaborate with clients while driving efficiencies. And we've seen good uptake as advisers integrate these capabilities into their practices. 
This strong engagement is helping to drive good client activity, excellent flows and new client acquisition as we continue to build on our momentum from last year. Our total client net flows was strong at $9.3 billion in the quarter, with total client assets of 36% to $762 billion. Our investment advisory business continues to grow nicely. In the quarter, wrap net inflows were more than $10 billion, up 55% over last year. This is another record for us and reinforces our excellent client adviser engagement and focus on organic growth. 
Transactional activity continued gaining strength in the first quarter, picking up 12% over last year, with good volume across a range of product solutions. Even with clients putting more of the cash back to work, client cash balances remain elevated at more than $40 billion. And adviser productivity was strong, up 8%, adjusting for interest rates. 
And we're bringing on new advisers. Our virtual recruiting program is driving good results with 93 advisers joining us in the quarter. Advisers recognize what we have to offer in terms of our culture, technology and high level of support. And as more states reopen their businesses and economies, we're looking forward to connecting with more advisers in person as we move through the balance of the year. 
We also continue to build out the Ameriprise Bank, where total assets grew to $8.8 billion in the quarter. As we discussed, we plan to move additional deposits to the bank over the course of this year. Pledge and margin loan volumes increased nicely in the quarter as our advisers engage with their clients with our lending solutions from a liquidity perspective. 
Wrapping up AWM, even with interest rates at all-time lows, AWM margin increased 90 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at a strong 20.7%. 
Turning to our Retirement and Protection Solutions business, we're off to a good start and continue to adapt to the low interest rate environment. We have been very proactive in this climate as we serve client needs and prudently manage the business. Variable annuity sales increased nicely, up 33%, driven by our success of structured product, as well as our annuities without living benefits. As a result, the percentage of VA sales without living benefits grew to 64% of total sales in the quarter. 
With regard to insurance, our focus has been on our flagship VUL product rather than IUL. In fact, VUL sales were up 76%. We're focused on making sure we have the right product for this rate environment while maintaining strong underwriting. Overall, I feel good about how the Retirement Protection Solutions business is performing in this challenging environment. 
As part of this strategy, we are actively pursuing a reinsurance transaction for the remaining closed block of fixed annuities, and we feel we can execute it in the near term. 
Turning to asset management with generating strong results. Our team is engaged, serving clients evolving needs well and driving profitable growth. I'll speak to the strength of the quarter and then comment on BMO's EMEA acquisition. 
With the continuation of positive flows in markets, assets under management were up significantly, increasing 32% to $564 billion. We're investing in the business, including in transforming how we use data. This is both within investments in terms of our use of data and our research as well as in distribution. In addition, and also key, is the thought leadership we provide and how we are targeting the right advisers to drive meaningful engagement. 
Regarding investment performance, our teams consistently generate strong performance for our clients. It's across all categories: equities, fixed income and asset allocation strategies. As an active manager, our research expertise is a key differentiator. 
I'd highlight the Columbia Threadneedle ranked in the top 10 and over the 1-, 5- and 10-year time frames in the recent Barron's Best Fund Family ranking, 1 of only 2 firms that ranked in the top 10 across all-time periods. We also won 7 Lipper Awards in the U.S. this year and over 22 awards in EMEA over the last year. This level of performance bodes very well in terms of earning future flows. 
At quarter end, Columbia Threadneedle had [ 103, 4 and 5 ] Star Morningstar rated funds globally, which represent close to 70% of our assets. This shows the breadth and strength of our product lineup. 
So with this type of investment performance and the strong execution of our plan, you saw that flows continue to be quite strong. In the quarter, we had net inflows of $4.9 billion, an improvement of $7.3 billion from a year ago. Excluding legacy insurance partner outflows, net inflows were $6.2 billion. Global retail net inflows were $4.6 billion, largely driven by the traction we've seen in North America. We're driving high engagement with clients and intermediaries, including with the larger broker-dealers and independents. 
Sales and flows traction is broad, and we're working hard to maintain that. In the quarter, we had 9 funds that generated over $250 million in net inflows, including 5 equity and 4 fixed income funds. 
In EMEA, we've seen good flows in Continental Europe in a number of key markets. In the U.K., we remained in outflows. However, we saw improvement in the quarter as the economy started to reopen there more fully, and we're hopeful that investor settlement will strengthen. 
In terms of Global Institutional, we had net inflows of $1.6 billion ex legacy partner outflows, driven by our results in EMEA. We've made considerable progress in strengthening our consultant relations and client service globally. Consultants have increased their ratings on a number of key strategies in recent quarters. This is important in terms of our ability to gain additional mandates from existing clients and grow our sales pipeline. 
As you saw earlier this month, we announced our strategic acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business. The acquisition is right in line with our strategy that we consistently discussed with you. It will add complementary capabilities and solutions with their established strengths in responsible investing, liability-driven investing, fiduciary outsource management and European real estate. It will also expand our scale in other traditional asset classes, especially in European fixed income, and recent flow trends in their EMEA business have been favorable. 
In addition, post close, BMO's North American Wealth Management clients will have the opportunity to access a broad range of Columbia Threadneedle investment management solutions. From an asset management perspective, we gained important geographic diversity. Upon close, EMEA's AUM will increase significantly to 40% of total AUM at Columbia Threadneedle, which provides a good balance to the U.S. business. 
We've always been a disciplined acquirer, and we expect this transaction will add to our strategic growth and generate a good return over time. Importantly, as we executed, the team will remain focused on maintaining our strong business momentum. 
So, for Ameriprise overall, we're in an excellent position. The business is performing really well and delivering strong results. Based on the current environment, we feel comfortable that we'll continue to generate strong returns with a strong balance sheet and substantial free cash flow. 
With that, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail, and then we'll take your questions."

Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, which are a direct result of our continued execution of the strategic priorities. We continue to demonstrate strong performance in our core growth businesses of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management, driven by ongoing organic growth and expense discipline. 
At the core, we remain focused on accelerating our mix shift through specific actions. For example, our recently announced strategic acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business will expand key capabilities in attractive and growing market segments, while also adding to traditional asset classes. This provides a larger combined capability to meet client needs. 
We have high confidence in the financial benefits from the acquisition as well. It will be accretive on a cash and operating basis by 2023, generating a 20%-plus IRR and have a payback period consistent with the Columbia acquisition of 8 years. In addition, we have established a strong partnership with BMO in North America, which we expect to generate strong profits. 
We are actively engaged in a fixed annuity reinsurance process and anticipate finalizing the transaction shortly. Lastly, we continue to effectively manage our risk profile and continued profit mix shift to lower risk and higher-margin retirement and protection solution offerings. 
Our diversified model continues to generate robust-free cash flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals. We remain on track to return approximately 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in 2021. 
Let's turn to Slide 6. Ameriprise's strong underlying business performance and activity levels in our core growth businesses continue to neutralize headwinds from short-term interest rates. As a reminder, this will be the last quarter where we have a reduction in short rates resorting the year-over-year comparison. 
Excluding the impact from interest, Ameriprise adjusted net operating revenue grew 13%. Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses profitability continues to increase, with adjusted pretax operating earnings up 35%. General and administrative expenses continue to be well managed. Excluding the impact of share price appreciation on compensation, G&A expenses were up 2% as we remain disciplined in executing reengineering initiatives. In total, we delivered excellent underlying EPS growth of 27%, excluding the net operating loss tax benefit and very strong margins in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. As Jim mentioned, Advice & Wealth Management continued to deliver excellent organic growth during the quarter, with total client assets up 36% to $762 billion. In response to the request from many of you, we are now disclosing total client flows, which increased 21% to $9.3 billion. 
From a product perspective, we had a terrific growth in our RAP flows, up 55% to $10.4 billion. Cash balances remain elevated at $40.4 billion, with a substantial opportunity for clients to put cash back to work in the future. 
On Page 8, financial results in Advice & Wealth Management were strong, with underlying adjusted operating earnings up 30% to $389 million after the $78 million interest rate headwind. Adjusted operating net revenues were up 16% to $1.9 billion, driven by client flows, improved transaction activity and higher market levels. On a sequential basis, revenues increased 6% from strong performance despite fewer fee days in the current quarter. 
Expenses remain well managed and we continue to exhibit strong expense discipline. G&A expense increased only 2% including higher volume-related expenses, bank expansion, investments for future growth and elevated share-based compensation. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 20.7%. Adjusting for interest rates, the margin would have been 215 basis points higher.  On a sequential basis, pretax operating earnings increased 11% and pretax adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points. 
Turning to Page 9. The significant growth in asset management was due to our investment engine that is driving revenue growth through consistent investment performance and compelling thought leadership leading to increased client engagement. Net inflows in the quarter was $6.2 billion, excluding legacy insurance partners, an $8 billion improvement from a year ago. Adjusted operating revenues increased 21% to $828 million, reflecting cumulative benefit of inflows, favorable mix shift towards equity strategies and market appreciation. The prior year quarter included an unfavorable impact from a performance fee adjustment. 
General and administrative expenses grew 12% from higher compensation expense related to strong performance, Amerprise share appreciation, as well as the costs associated with increased activity levels. Adjusted for compensation-related expense, G&A increased a more moderate 5%. Putting this together, pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 45% with a 43.9% margin. We continue to be very encouraged by the continuation of positive flow trends and strong profitability. 
Let's turn to Page 10. Retirement and Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectation in this market and rate environment. While we have a strong book of business from a risk perspective, we continue to execute our strategy to improve it further. In the quarter, 64% of retirement product sales did not have living benefit guarantees. This sales shift is already having an impact on our in-force block, with the account value of living benefit riders down from 65% to 63%. 
In protection, sales were flat, as we continue to see a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a significant decline in Index Universal Life. These mix shifts are expected to continue going forward. 
Financial results continue to be in line with expectations. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 10% to $183 million. We had a steep drop-off in claims following January's high level, and we were approaching pre-COVID levels of claims by the end of March. This business is very well managed. Net amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry, and our hedging remains very effective. 
Let's turn to Page 11. In total, the corporate and other segment had a $21 million loss in the quarter, which was a $29 million improvement from the prior year. Excluding closed blocks, the loss in the corporate segment was $63 million, which included a $15 million investment gain, largely offset by $11 million of higher share-based compensation expense. The year ago quarter had $11 million benefit from Ameriprise share price depreciation. 
Long-term care had $46 million of earnings in the quarter. The high COVID-related mortality and terminations that we saw in January declined in February and March and were approaching pre-COVID levels by the end of March. This benefit was partially offset by the COVID claims level on life insurance. 
Fixed annuities had a $4 million loss related to the low interest rate environment. As I mentioned, we are making good progress on our fixed annuity reinsurance transaction. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong. Including our liquidity position of $2.3 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital of $2 billion, 96% hedge effectiveness in the quarter and a [ defensely ] positioned investment portfolio. Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 30%. 
We returned $491 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback. We just announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, and we are on track with our commitment to return 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders this year. 
With that, we'll take your questions."

Particularly in the RAP account flows, as you pointed out, over $10 billion, and thanks for the new disclosure on the $9 billion for total. 
I guess the first question is there just kind of around sustainability, particularly in the RAP flows. And maybe we can tackle it from a perspective of kind of giving us a breakdown of how much of this is coming from existing clients sort of reengaging, given the fact that market backdrop is better versus new assets coming from either recruiting or same-store sales?"

But we also see good new organic growth from client acquisition coming in as well from our advisers. 
And as a complement from recruits that we've added over the last year, as they transfer their book, they're bringing over some of the clients.

And then from a financial perspective, I guess, Walter that one is for you. I think I heard you say accretion to operating earnings by 2023. I think you guys are paying for this with cash. So I guess, why is the deal not immediately accretive?

So what I can say really is that we know right now that the EMEA BMO area is in inflows for the last number of months through the first quarter. They're seeing it in some of their core programs and initiatives. The ones that we sort of laid out to you are the strategic capabilities that we think that will really enhance and strengthen our areas to really get a more formal presence on the continent there, but also that we could leverage globally. 
We feel like as we go through this transaction, since we're not really, what I would call, meshing together both investment process or distribution capabilities in some of those areas that's more of an add-on to us, that we shouldn't suffer, as you mentioned, a bit more of a attrition going through that process. 
We feel very comfortable that we're adding their people, we're adding the capabilities. And what we're spending more time integrating will be more of the back and middle offices. Adding our capabilities, which are much more state of the art much more current in what we can provide them technology-wise and support wise. And so we feel like it could be a win-win. 
We always factor in, when we do a transaction, there is always some breakage. You can't really determine how much it is, but we always factor in that in thinking about a deal. But we're hoping that, that would be one that will not be significant based on what we're looking to do here, which is very different than merging and integrating front offices and people from that standpoint. 
We like their capabilities. We think that those capabilities with our added distribution globally can actually enhance their flow picture as well. But we didn't count on the revenue flows when we did the deal to make it like a make or break. We really look at this from having the cost synergies from the back and middle office, plus what they think they can grow plus what we can add in. And then we complement that with our distribution as a plus. 
And so we feel like this is really good strategic is exactly what we were looking for. As a complement, it is one that we can easily handle through the excess cash and balance sheet that we have, and it doesn't take away from the organic growth that we want our people to continue to focus on in the asset management business."

There may have been a period just after the sort of the discussion on the DOL, et cetera, where there was more of a shift from some brokerage activity to the RAP, that we saw some blips in some of those initial quarters. But I think if you go back over the last number of quarters, you probably see more of a client flow close to, again, the RAP flows. 
There may be some timing issues quarter-to-quarter, et cetera. But I think that's along the lines, Walter, but I know you know more."

It was really good to see adviser headcount pickup here this quarter. 
So why not get a little bit more aggressive on the recruiting front or bolt-on M&A to try to grow that headcount more rapidly? Effectively, when we look across a lot of the wealth management peers, to get the best valuation in the stock tend to have solid growth in net new assets and in advisers. And obviously, churn is an impact. 
And so what steps do you think you can take to continue to kind of grind down churn? And then -- and is maybe picking up on the aggression for recruiting something that you think is compelling at this point, given where the market is for advisers?"

I think the way I'd probably answer that would be that we will continue to look at bringing in good advisers to the firm, and we could probably a bit more there, and we're reviewing it. 
But very important for us, we want to bring in the right advisers that fit the brand, the culture, the compliance, understand what their focus on growth. We don't want to just pay advisers to join us or be part of a network and process for them. 
We want to have advisers join us that we can help grow their productivity, grow their client relationships, have great client satisfaction, be with us a long time. That really builds on the culture and the brand. 
We think we have a great value proposition for advisers once they join us, both from how we onboard them, how we give them support, the leadership, the technology, the capabilities. We just don't want to roll up a bunch of firms or independents and just associate and process for them per se. 
So that's very important to us. I think we could probably -- maybe we could be more aggressive out there. And -- but we also think it's very important for the long term. 
The other thing we really spend a lot of time different than other competitors about just rolling up advisers, is that we focus on our 10,000 advisers growing their productivity, having strong client satisfaction. And I think when you compare us, the last time we did that analysis which we update, we were more than 2.5x any independent on annual productivity growth on a compounded basis for a long period of time. And the same thing against the wirehouses. 
So that's where we put a lot more of our energy. But to your point, we complement that with having good recruits and having good retention. And we'll continue to look at whether we could step that up where there may be some other firms, smaller firms suited to our cultural mix. But that's what we've been focused on, and we've been successful with it."

You or someone else or some people who had asked from the fourth quarter on a similar basis when we had good pickup in flows and client activity as well. 
What we've been seeing is -- and it's probably a combination of factors. I mean, we have a reopening of the economy. I think people are starting to feel a bit more comfortable. I think the markets have done well. So there's a little bit of that where people feel a little more comfortable in what they are doing right now. 
And so I think that's part of it, because of the positive nature of the reopening and the vaccine, rolling out, et cetera. But I also feel a part of it is a level of engagement that our advisers are also having with their clients. We've really rolled out our whole foundational advice in complement to our comprehensive advice. 
We have over 0.5 million of our clients already have [ golds ] online that they are very active with. We have been rolling out our integrated technology in the way our advisers can continue to connect with clients and understand the nature of what conversations they should be having, we'll be rolling out more tools along those lines. 
So we feel like we've stepped up our level of having the advisers engage with the clients and giving them a lot more of the tools and capabilities to do that more seamlessly in an integrated fashion. And I think that's having some effect. 
I mean, it's hard for me not knowing the market cycle and some of the things popping up around. But I feel good that we're going to continue to -- at least continue to gain those type of flows. I can't predict whether it's 9, 10, 8, 6 or whatever. But I feel like we're in a good spot right now, and we're very focused on helping that to continue."

And we also, as you also know, have a U.K. real estate property business, and we have a smaller U.S. business as well. So this would complement it nicely and bring some of that advanced capability in Europe to bear. 
We know ESG is very big, and they're a leader in ESG as well. And we've been ramping up our activities in ESG in the U.K. for European activity and U.K. activity. So overall, we feel like it will help us hit the ground running further in Europe, but we're also looking to further use that solution capability, complementing what we're already doing in the U.S. for the U.S. And we think that, that will give us a greater ability to bring in more solutions-oriented business for the longer term. 
So I don't know if that answers your question. But we had invested in solutions. We do have some of the different strategies already coming to bear for some of what we're doing internationally and domestically, but this would advance us further."

On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the first quarter. Below that, you see our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.

Thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. As you saw in yesterday's release, Ameriprise is off to a strong start in 2021. We're continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters, as you can see in our first quarter me",1633,"Good morning. Thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. As you saw in yesterday's release, Ameriprise is off to a strong start in 2021. We're continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters, as you can see in our first quarter metrics and financial results. 
Regarding the environment, equity markets continue to rally in the first quarter as vaccinations increased and activity accelerated with the U.S. beginning to open back up. The economy is gaining strength with the further fiscal stimulus as well as better employment data. 
With this backdrop, key for us is that we remain focused on serving our clients. Engagement is high, activity is strong, and we're bringing in record client flows across the business. We ended the quarter with assets under management and administration of 36% to $1.14 trillion, a new high. In addition, we recently announced the strategic acquisition of the BMO EMEA Asset Management business. 
Taking a step back, and looking at Ameriprise overall, I feel really good. We're executing well and delivering on our strategy for growth that we discussed with you. We continue to transform Ameriprise with Wealth Management and Asset Management now representing over 75% of operating earnings. 
You've seen the financials. Revenues are up 10% to over $3 billion. Earnings per share also increased nicely in the quarter of 27% ex the NOL benefit a year ago, even with low short-term interest rates this year versus last year's quarter, and ROE remains very strong at 30%. 
While we continue to invest strongly in the business, we are managing expenses thoughtfully. With our strong financial foundation and free cash flow generation, we returned more than $490 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our ongoing repurchase program, which is comparable to the last few quarters. Yesterday, we announced another 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, our 17th increase since becoming public 16 years ago. 
Let's discuss Advice & Wealth Management, where we've been executing well and driving growth. We're benefiting from the strategic investments we've been making to deliver a differentiated client/adviser experience built on advice. We've been on a multiyear journey to take our client experience to the next level. 
A big part of that is the training and support we provide advisers and ensuring that the new digital tools and capabilities are fully integrated within their technology ecosystem. One of our more significant investments, our CRM platform, is increasingly serving as the hub for advisers allowing them to collaborate with clients while driving efficiencies. And we've seen good uptake as advisers integrate these capabilities into their practices. 
This strong engagement is helping to drive good client activity, excellent flows and new client acquisition as we continue to build on our momentum from last year. Our total client net flows was strong at $9.3 billion in the quarter, with total client assets of 36% to $762 billion. Our investment advisory business continues to grow nicely. In the quarter, wrap net inflows were more than $10 billion, up 55% over last year. This is another record for us and reinforces our excellent client adviser engagement and focus on organic growth. 
Transactional activity continued gaining strength in the first quarter, picking up 12% over last year, with good volume across a range of product solutions. Even with clients putting more of the cash back to work, client cash balances remain elevated at more than $40 billion. And adviser productivity was strong, up 8%, adjusting for interest rates. 
And we're bringing on new advisers. Our virtual recruiting program is driving good results with 93 advisers joining us in the quarter. Advisers recognize what we have to offer in terms of our culture, technology and high level of support. And as more states reopen their businesses and economies, we're looking forward to connecting with more advisers in person as we move through the balance of the year. 
We also continue to build out the Ameriprise Bank, where total assets grew to $8.8 billion in the quarter. As we discussed, we plan to move additional deposits to the bank over the course of this year. Pledge and margin loan volumes increased nicely in the quarter as our advisers engage with their clients with our lending solutions from a liquidity perspective.  Wrapping up AWM, even with interest rates at all-time lows, AWM margin increased 90 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at a strong 20.7%. 
Turning to our Retirement and Protection Solutions business, we're off to a good start and continue to adapt to the low interest rate environment. We have been very proactive in this climate as we serve client needs and prudently manage the business. Variable annuity sales increased nicely, up 33%, driven by our success of structured product, as well as our annuities without living benefits. As a result, the percentage of VA sales without living benefits grew to 64% of total sales in the quarter. 
With regard to insurance, our focus has been on our flagship VUL product rather than IUL. In fact, VUL sales were up 76%. We're focused on making sure we have the right product for this rate environment while maintaining strong underwriting. Overall, I feel good about how the Retirement Protection Solutions business is performing in this challenging environment.  As part of this strategy, we are actively pursuing a reinsurance transaction for the remaining closed block of fixed annuities, and we feel we can execute it in the near term. 
Turning to Asset Management, we're generating strong results. Our team is engaged, serving clients' evolving needs well and driving profitable growth. I'll speak to the strength of the quarter and then comment on BMO's EMEA acquisition. 
With the continuation of positive flows in markets, assets under management were up significantly, increasing 32% to $564 billion. We're investing in the business, including in transforming how we use data. This is both within investments in terms of our use of data and our research as well as in distribution. In addition, and also key, is the thought leadership we provide and how we are targeting the right advisers to drive meaningful engagement. 
Regarding investment performance, our teams consistently generate strong performance for our clients. It's across all categories: equities, fixed income and asset allocation strategies. As an active manager, our research expertise is a key differentiator. 
I'd highlight that Columbia Threadneedle ranked in the top 10 and over the 1-, 5- and 10-year time frames in the recent Barron's Best Fund Family ranking, 1 of only 2 firms that ranked in the top 10 across all-time periods. We also won 7 Lipper Awards in the U.S. this year and over 22 awards in EMEA over the last year. This level of performance bodes very well in terms of earning future flows. 
At quarter end, Columbia Threadneedle had 103 4- and 5-star Morningstar rated funds globally, which represent the close to 70% of our assets. This shows the breadth and strength of our product lineup.  So with this type of investment performance and the strong execution of our plan, you saw that flows continue to be quite strong. 
In the quarter, we had net inflows of $4.9 billion, an improvement of $7.3 billion from a year ago. Excluding legacy insurance partner outflows, net inflows were $6.2 billion. Global retail net inflows were $4.6 billion, largely driven by the traction we've seen in North America. We're driving high engagement with clients and intermediaries, including with the larger broker-dealers and independents. 
Sales and flows traction is broad, and we're working hard to maintain that. In the quarter, we had 9 funds that generated over $250 million in net inflows, including 5 equity and 4 fixed income funds. 
In EMEA, we've seen good flows in Continental Europe in a number of key markets. In the U.K., we remained in outflows. However, we saw improvement in the quarter as the economy started to reopen there more fully, and we're hopeful that investor sentiment will strengthen. 
In terms of Global Institutional, we had net inflows of $1.6 billion ex legacy partner outflows, driven by our results in EMEA. We've made considerable progress in strengthening our consultant relations and client service globally. Consultants have increased their ratings on a number of key strategies in recent quarters. This is important in terms of our ability to gain additional mandates from existing clients and grow our sales pipeline. 
As you saw earlier this month, we announced our strategic acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business. The acquisition is right in line with our strategy that we consistently discuss with you. It will add complementary capabilities and solutions with their established strengths in responsible investing, liability-driven investing, fiduciary outsource management and European real estate. It will also expand our scale in other traditional asset classes, especially in European fixed income, and recent flow trends in their EMEA business have been favorable. 
In addition, post close, BMO's North American Wealth Management clients will have the opportunity to access a broad range of Columbia Threadneedle investment management solutions. From an asset management perspective, we gained important geographic diversity. Upon close, EMEA's AUM will increase significantly to 40% of total AUM at Columbia Threadneedle, which provides a good balance to the U.S. business. 
We've always been a disciplined acquirer, and we expect this transaction will add to our strategic growth and generate a good return over time. Importantly, as we executed, the team will remain focused on maintaining our strong business momentum. 
So, for Ameriprise overall, we're in an excellent position. The business is performing really well and delivering strong results. Based on the current environment, we feel comfortable that we'll continue to generate strong returns with a strong balance sheet and substantial free cash flow. 
With that, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail, and then we'll take your questions."

Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics, which are a direct result of our continued execution of the strategic priorities. We continue to demonstrate strong performance in our core growth businesses of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management, driven by ongoing organic growth and expense discipline. 
At the core, we remain focused on accelerating our mix shift through specific actions. For example, our recently announced strategic acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business will expand key capabilities in attractive and growing market segments, while also adding to traditional asset classes. This provides a larger combined capability to meet client needs. 
We have high confidence in the financial benefits from the acquisition as well. It will be accretive on a cash and operating basis by 2023, generating a 20%-plus IRR and have a payback period consistent with the Columbia acquisition of 8 years. In addition, we have established a strong partnership with BMO in North America, which we expect to generate strong profits. 
We are actively engaged in a fixed annuity reinsurance process and anticipate finalizing the transaction shortly. Lastly, we continue to effectively manage our risk profile and continued profit mix shift to lower risk and higher-margin retirement and protection solution offerings. 
Our diversified model continues to generate robust-free cash flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals. We remain on track to return approximately 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in 2021. 
Let's turn to Slide 6. Ameriprise's strong underlying business performance and activity levels in our core growth businesses continue to neutralize headwinds from short-term interest rates. As a reminder, this will be the last quarter where we have a reduction in short rates, sorting the year-over-year comparison. 
Excluding the impact from interest, Ameriprise adjusted net operating revenue grew 13%. Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses' profitability continues to increase, with adjusted pretax operating earnings up 35%. General and administrative expenses continue to be well managed. Excluding the impact of share price appreciation on compensation, G&A expenses were up 2% as we remain disciplined executing reengineering initiatives. In total, we delivered excellent underlying EPS growth of 27%, excluding the net operating loss tax benefit and very strong margins in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. As Jim mentioned, Advice & Wealth Management continued to deliver excellent organic growth during the quarter, with total client assets up 36% to $762 billion. In response to the request from many of you, we are now disclosing total client flows, which increased 21% to $9.3 billion. 
From a product perspective, we had a terrific growth in our wrap flows, up 55% to $10.4 billion. Cash balances remain elevated at $40.4 billion, with a substantial opportunity for clients to put cash back to work in the future. 
On Page 8, financial results in Advice & Wealth Management were strong, with underlying adjusted operating earnings up 30% to $389 million after the $78 million interest rate headwind. Adjusted operating net revenues were up 16% to $1.9 billion, driven by client flows, improved transaction activity and higher market levels. On a sequential basis, revenues increased 6% from strong performance despite fewer fee days in the current quarter. 
Expenses remain well managed and we continue to exhibit strong expense discipline. G&A expense increased only 2% including higher volume-related expenses, bank expansion, investments for future growth and elevated share-based compensation. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 20.7%. Adjusting for interest rates, the margin would have been 215 basis points higher. On a sequential basis, pretax operating earnings increased 11% and pretax adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points. 
Turning to Page 9. The significant growth in asset management was due to our investment engine that is driving revenue growth through consistent investment performance and compelling thought leadership leading to increased client engagement. Net inflows in the quarter was $6.2 billion, excluding legacy insurance partners, an $8 billion improvement from a year ago. Adjusted operating revenues increased 21% to $828 million, reflecting cumulative benefit of inflows, favorable mix shift toward equity strategies and market appreciation. The prior year quarter included an unfavorable impact from a performance fee adjustment. 
General and administrative expenses grew 12% from higher compensation expense related to strong performance, Ameriprise share appreciation, as well as the costs associated with increased activity levels. Adjusted for compensation-related expense, G&A increased a more moderate 5%. Putting this together, pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 45% with a 43.9% margin. We continue to be very encouraged by the continuation of positive flow trends and strong profitability. 
Let's turn to Page 10. Retirement and Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectation in this market and rate environment. While we have a strong book of business from a risk perspective, we continue to execute our strategy to improve it further. In the quarter, 64% of retirement product sales did not have living benefit guarantees. This sales shift is already having an impact on our in-force block, with the account value of living benefit riders down from 65% to 63%. 
In protection, sales were flat, as we continue to see a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a significant decline in index universal life. These mix shifts are expected to continue going forward. 
Financial results continue to be in line with expectations. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 10% to $183 million. We had a steep drop-off in claims following January's high level, and we were approaching pre-COVID levels of claims by the end of March. This business is very well managed. Net amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry, and our hedging remains very effective. 
Let's turn to Page 11. In total, the corporate and other segment had a $21 million loss in the quarter, which was a $29 million improvement from the prior year. Excluding closed blocks, the loss in the corporate segment was $63 million, which included a $15 million investment gain, largely offset by $11 million of higher share-based compensation expense. The year ago quarter had $11 million benefit from Ameriprise share price depreciation. 
Long-term care had $46 million of earnings in the quarter. The high COVID-related mortality and terminations that we saw in January declined in February and March and were approaching pre-COVID levels by the end of March. This benefit was partially offset by the COVID claims level on life insurance. 
Fixed annuities had a $4 million loss related to the low interest rate environment. As I mentioned, we are making good progress on our fixed annuity reinsurance transaction. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong. Including our liquidity position of $2.3 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital of $2 billion, 96% hedge effectiveness in the quarter and a defensively  positioned investment portfolio. Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 30%. 
We returned $491 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback. We just announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, and we are on track with our commitment to return 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders this year. 
With that, we'll take your questions."

I guess the first question is there, just kind of around sustainability, particularly in the wrap flows. And maybe we can tackle it from a perspective of kind of giving us a breakdown of how much of this is coming from existing clients sort of reengaging, given the fact that market backdrop is better versus new assets coming from either recruiting or same-store sales?"

But we also see good new organic growth from client acquisition coming in as well from our advisers. 
And as a complement from recruits that we've added over the last year, as they transfer their book, they're bringing over some of the clients.

So what I can say really is that we know right now that the EMEA BMO area is in inflows for the last number of months through the first quarter. They're seeing it in some of their core programs and initiatives. The ones that we sort of laid out to you are the strategic capabilities that we think that will really enhance and strengthen our areas to really get a more formal presence on the continent there, but also that we could leverage globally. 
We feel like as we go through this transaction, since we're not really, what I would call, meshing together, both investment process or distribution capabilities in some of those areas, they're more of an add-on to us, that we shouldn't suffer, as you mentioned, a bit more of a attrition going through that process. 
We feel very comfortable that we're adding their people, we're adding their capabilities. And what we're spending more time integrating will be more of the back and middle offices. Adding our capabilities, which are much more state of the art much more current in what we can provide them technology-wise and support wise. And so we feel like it could be a win-win. 
We always factor in, when we do a transaction, there is always some breakage. You can't really determine how much it is, but we always factor in that in thinking about a deal. But we're hoping that, that would be one that will not be significant based on what we're looking to do here, which is very different than merging and integrating front offices and people from that standpoint. 
We like their capabilities. We think that those capabilities with our added distribution globally can actually enhance their flow picture as well. But we didn't count on the revenue flows when we did the deal to make it like a make or break. We really look at this from having the cost synergies from the back and middle office, plus what they think they can grow, plus what we can add in. And then we complement that with our distribution as a plus. 
And so we feel like this is really good strategic. It's exactly what we were looking for as a complement. It is one that we can easily handle through the excess cash and balance sheet that we have, and it doesn't take away from the organic growth that we want our people to continue to focus on in the asset management business."

I think the way I'd probably answer that would be that we will continue to look at bringing in good advisers to the firm, and we could probably -- a bit more there, and we're reviewing it. 
But very important for us, we want to bring in the right advisers that fit the brand, the culture, the compliance, understand what their focus on growth. We don't want to just pay advisers to join us or be part of a network and process for them. 
We want to have advisers join us that we can help grow their productivity, grow their client relationships, have great client satisfaction, be with us a long time. That really builds on the culture and the brand. 
We think we have a great value proposition for advisers once they join us, both from how we onboard them, how we give them support, the leadership, the technology, the capabilities. We just don't want to roll up a bunch of firms or independents and just associate and process for them per se. 
So that's very important to us. I think we could probably -- maybe we could be more aggressive out there. And -- but we also think it's very important for the long term. 
The other thing we really spend a lot of time different than other competitors about just rolling up advisers is that we focus on our 10,000 advisers growing their productivity, having strong client satisfaction. And I think when you compare us, the last time we did that analysis which we update, we were more than 2.5x any independent on annual productivity growth on a compounded basis for a long period of time. And the same thing against the wirehouses. 
So that's where we put a lot more of our energy. But to your point, we complement that with having good recruits and having good retention. And we'll continue to look at whether we could step that up or there may be some other firms, smaller firms suited to our cultural mix.

You or someone else or some people had asked from the fourth quarter on a similar basis when we had good pickup in flows and client activity as well. 
What we've been seeing is -- and it's probably a combination of factors. I mean, we have a reopening of the economy. I think people are starting to feel a bit more comfortable. I think the markets have done well. So there's a little bit of that where people feel a little more comfortable in what they are doing right now. 
And so I think that's part of it, because of the positive nature of the reopening and the vaccine, rolling out, et cetera. But I also feel a part of it is a level of engagement that our advisers are also having with their clients. We've really rolled out our whole foundational advice in complement to our comprehensive advice. 
We have over 0.5 million of our clients already have [ goals ] online that they're very active with. We have been rolling out our integrated technology in the way our advisers can continue to connect with clients and understand the nature of what conversations they should be having. We'll be rolling out more tools along those lines. 
So we feel like we've stepped up our level of having the advisers engage with the clients and giving them a lot more of the tools and capabilities to do that more seamlessly in an integrated fashion. And I think that's having some effect.

As you saw in our release, Ameriprise had another strong quarter, and I feel good about how we're performing at this point in the year. The environment in the U.S. continues to improve as the economy reopens more fully and equity markets remain strong. 
Recent spikes in the virus are putting some pressure on Europe's recovery. But overall, there's a lot to be hopeful for as we look ahead. As I consider this landscape, we're executing well across our businesses, driving growth through our lower capital fee-based businesses and freeing up capital to generate shareholder value. 
We delivered another quarter of excellent organic growth in wealth and asset management and strong productivity across our system. This included strong client flows with more than $16 billion of inflows in wealth management and asset management in the quarter. And we ended with assets under management and administration of 28% to $1.2 trillion another new high. 
With regard to recent strategic moves, we completed the RiverSource life fixed annuity reinsurance transaction. This further advances our mix shift to capital-light businesses and frees up approximately $700 million of excess capital and our acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business, which we announced in April is on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
Let's turn to our adjusted operating results for the quarter. Momentum in the business continues, with revenues coming in strongly at $3.4 billion of 22%, fueled by organic growth in markets. Earnings increased 34%, excluding the reversal of the NOL a year ago, with earnings per share up 39%, reflecting strong business growth and capital return.  And ROE remains exceptionally strong at 37.5%. As always, we continue to manage expenses well. 
Let's move to advice in wealth management where we're consistently generating good growth. Our strategic investments continue to be an important part of what we're doing. People are coming to Ameriprise for a high-quality advice experience backed by leading-edge technology. Client satisfaction remains high and clients are engaging with us personally and through our extensive digital capabilities. 
Importantly, our advisers are embracing our training, coaching and powerful suite of tools that are fully integrated with our CRM platform. And we continue to add capabilities, including testing a new e-meeting tool that helps advisers prepare for client meetings in minutes. 
Our ongoing investments in the technology ecosystem are helping advisers connect with more clients and prospects and run their practices more efficiently. This high level of engagement is leading to really good client activity, asset flows and client acquisition. Total client inflows were up 54% to $9.5 billion and that continued the positive trend we've seen over the past several quarters. 
Consistent with strong client flows, wrapped net inflows were $10 billion, continuing a very strong run rate. Transactional activity also grew nicely, up nearly 30% over last year, with good volume across a range of product solutions. All of this momentum, along with positive markets, drove nice growth in adviser productivity, up 14%, adjusting for interest rates to a record of $731,000 per adviser. 
On the recruiting front, we have 42 experienced advisers join us in the quarter, a bit below where we've been. We're hearing that advisers have been focused on all that comes with reopening and some held off on transitioning firms or delayed their start dates. 
That said, people are getting back to a more normal rhythm. We're now hosting in-person meetings that complement our virtual recruiting, and we feel good about our pipeline for the third quarter. Turning to the bank. Total assets grew to $9.7 billion in the quarter. We continue to move additional deposits to the bank, and we have adjusted our investment strategy to extend duration a bit. 
We're also seeing a good pickup in demand for our lending solutions. Loan volumes are steadily increasing, led by a pledged product, which represents a nice opportunity for future growth. Wrapping up AWM on metrics and financials remain very strong. Margin increased 380 basis points year-over-year, ending the quarter at 21.4%, showing consistent expansion since the Fed cut short-term rates a year ago. 
Moving to Retirement & Protection Solutions. Results were good, and we continue to advance our strategic initiatives. With regard to Annuities, we had strong variable annuity sales with total sales up 88% from a year ago. This was driven by increased demand for both structured variable annuity product and our RAVA product without living benefits. 
Together, this represented over 2/3 of sales in the quarter, a continuation of the shift that we're driving. On the insurance side, Life and Health insurance sales approximately doubled driven by our VUL product, which is an appropriate product that is rate environment. 
Now let's discuss asset management, where we continue to grow the business consistent with our plans. Assets under management rose to $593 billion, up 25% over last year from strong business results in positive markets. Regarding investment performance, the team continues to generate excellent performance for clients across equity, fixed income and asset allocation strategies with more than 80% of the funds above medium over the longer-term time frames on an asset-weighted basis. 
At quarter end, we had 110 4- and 5-star Morningstar rated funds representing more than 70% of our funds. This quarter, we had net inflows of $6.7 billion, an improvement of $4.1 billion from a year ago. Excluding legacy insurance partner outflows, net inflows were $8.1 billion. These results build upon the favorable net flows we saw over the past several quarters. 
Global retail net inflows were $4.2 billion, driven by another quarter of strong results in North America.  Engagement with clients and intermediaries remain excellent. Sales and flows traction is broad-based with 15 of our investment capabilities, generating over $100 million of net inflows in the quarter. And in EMEA, retail sales have been weaker given the risk-off environment. 
As I said, we're hopeful that EMEA flows will strengthen in the second half as the post-pandemic reopening and economic recovery continue. In terms of global institutional, we saw a nice improvement with net inflows of $3.9 billion ex legacy partner outflows with wins across equity and fixed income strategies in both North America and EMEA. 
I feel good about our sales pipeline. Turning to BMO. As we discussed with you, the acquisition will add important capabilities and build on our reach in EMEA. Their business remains in positive flows, and we continue to receive good feedback from clients and institutional consultants. As I mentioned, we're on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of the balance sheet, our capital management is excellent. The business continues to generate substantial free cash flow, and we're freeing up additional capital. In fact, the approximately $700 million of our reinsurance deal largely pays for the BMO acquisition, giving us additional flexibility to return capital to shareholders at an attractive rate. 
In summary, Ameriprise is in a terrific position. We're performing well and generating strong results. Our team is serving more clients and deepening relationships. We're delivering excellent organic growth in both wealth and asset management. And the BMO transaction will add an additional growth opportunity, and we're accelerating our business mix shift with the reinsurance of the fixed annuity block. 
I'd like to close by talking about our team. Our people have been coming back to the office a few days a week this summer and re-acclimating. It's been great to be together again in person. We're looking forward to being more fully backed this fall where conditions are safe to do so while maintaining a level of flexibility. 
Now I'll turn it over to Walter and then take your questions."

Ameriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating EPS up 39% to $5.27. We continue to demonstrate excellent metrics, earnings growth and margin expansion in our core growth businesses of Advice & We",1039,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating EPS up 39% to $5.27. We continue to demonstrate excellent metrics, earnings growth and margin expansion in our core growth businesses of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. 
Sales of our Retirement & Protection products were significantly from last year and we'll focus on low risk and higher-margin offerings. We're already seeing a shift in our import block and expect this to continue going forward. As Jim mentioned, in the quarter, we continue to advance our strategic priorities to expand our growth businesses and reduce our risk profile. 
We remain on track to close the acquisition of BMO's EMEA Asset Management business in the fourth quarter, which will expand our core geographic and product capabilities in attractive and growing market segments. Additionally, we entered into an agreement to reinsure approximately $8 billion of fixed annuities and closed on the RiverSource Life transaction in early July. 
As noted, we will free up approximately $700 million of capital and will have a marginal projected impact on fixed annuity profitability. In addition to the reinsurance transaction, we continue to effectively manage our risk profile through product mix shift to lower risk and higher-margin retirement and protective solution offerings. 
Our diversified model generates robust free cash flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals. We returned 92% of adjusted op earnings to shareholders in the quarter. 
Aligning us to our projected 90% target for the full year. Let's turn to Slide 6. In the quarter, Ameriprise adjusted operating net revenues grew 22% and PTI increased 35%, reflecting continued excellent business performance. Revenue and earnings in our capital-light businesses of AWM and Asset Management drove nearly 80% of the total, excluding corporate and other, a significant shift from a year ago even normalizing for the unusually high earnings in RPS last year. 
We remain disciplined on expenses. G&A expenses were well managed, up 6%, given the strong business growth in the quarter. Overall, we delivered another excellent quarter that underscores the strength of the business model that continues to yield robust profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 7. Advice & Wealth Management delivered another quarter of excellent organic growth with total client assets up 28% to $807 billion. Total client flows were $9.5 billion, the third consecutive quarter of total client flows at or above $9 billion, demonstrating the sustainability of our organic growth. 
Our focus is not only on growth, but profitable growth. In the quarter, our pretax adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, an increase of 380 basis points from the prior year and an increase of 70 basis points sequentially despite continued low interest rates. 
On Page 8, financial results in Advice & Wealth Management were very strong with pretax adjusted operating earnings of $423 million, up 56%. Adjusted operating net revenues grew 29% to $2 billion, fueled by robust client flows and a 29% increase in transactional activity in addition to strong market appreciation. 
on a sequential basis, revenue increased nicely to 5%. Ameriprise Bank continues to grow at a solid pace, reaching nearly $10 billion in the quarter after adding $700 million of sweep cash to the balance sheet. Expenses remain well managed and we continue to exhibit strong expense discipline. 
G&A expense increased 3%, reflecting increased activity and the timing of performance-based compensation expense. Going forward, we remain committed to managing expense and margin in a disciplined manner. 
Turning to Page 9. Asset Management delivered another strong quarter, driven by excellent investment performance and sustained inflows resulting in outstanding financial results. Net inflows were $8.1 billion, excluding legacy insurance partners, which is a continuation of an improved solid flow trend. 
Adjusted operating revenues increased 32% to $879 million, a result of the cumulative benefit of net inflows and market appreciation. On a sequential basis, revenues were up 6%. Our fee rate remains strong at 52 basis points, reflecting the strong momentum we are seeing across the board with strength in both equity and fixed income strategies. 
Expenses remain well managed and in line with expectations given the revenue environment. G&A expenses grew 12% primarily from the timing of compensation expense related to strong business performance, as well as foreign exchange translation and higher volume-related expenses. 
As with AWM, going forward, we will manage the expense tightly. Pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 79%, and we delivered a 45% margin. Moving forward, we expect strong financial performance to continue and anticipate that margins will remain in the mid-40% range over the near term, driven by current robust equity markets. 
Let's turn to Page 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectations in this environment. Pretax adjusted operating earnings were $182 million. Sales in the quarter were up significantly off a low base in the prior year driven by the pandemic. 
Sales were above pre-COVID levels, resulting in an increase in distribution expense in the quarter. Additionally, earnings in the prior year were positively impacted by the lower surrenders and withdrawals leading to the pandemic environment. Importantly, we continue to reduce our risk profile by growing sales of retirement products without living benefits. 
Retirement sales increased 88% during the quarter, with 2/3 of the sales and products without living benefits. This is shifting the overall book and now only 62% of the AR block has living benefit riders down over 200 basis points from a year ago. 
In Protection, sales nearly doubled as we continue to see a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a significant decline in IUL. This mix shift in both retirement and protection products are expected to continue going forward. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong, including our liquidity position of $3 billion at the parent company and substantial excess capital of $2 billion, which does not include the capital release from the recently announced fixed annuity transaction. 
Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 37.5%.  We returned $585 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback, and we are on track with our commitment to return 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders for the year. With that, we'll take your questions."

Have you considered adjusting some of the AWM reporting or maybe providing some enhanced reporting that would be a little bit more in line with the wealth management competitors in the marketplace? And allow for a little bit more clean comparison on some of these metrics.  Distribution revenue, including some components that are yield-oriented, compensation being part of distribution expense.

But if you take that to your point, we have been moving more in that direction of disclosing more of that type of segmented results for our wealth and asset management. I know and team working with our finance people are looking at all those things. 
And just like we introduced some of those additional metrics, as you would imagine, we have to go back and make sure that the data and everything is consistent quarter-to-quarter, how we look at it to track it, et cetera.

Now for other transaction activity, we see good activity there as well. And we had to pick up generally both in there and wrap all through these periods. So the wrap business is really coming from both new client inflows as well as new clients that we're adding. And we had good client acquisition also during the period, and the flows also were strong. 
So I think it's a combination of those factors. I don't think there's 1 in particular. I think the environment, particularly with low interest rates now that people are looking for how do they get on a more return more holistically in our wrap program, we do do balanced portfolios and diversify it pretty well so that there is a level of what we would call not just over reliance on the equity markets, but not at the same time, just looking for yield from fixed income.

And that always lends itself to a consumer appetite to some speak about being comfortable investing. I think part of it is not just the market but sort of the economy reopening and the feeling that there's not going to be a big shoot a drop, so to speak, in the near term. 
I would also say that part of it is definitely the capabilities we put in place and the engagement we have with our advisers. We've done a lot over the last few years. Just the idea is like we're one of the few firms that were able to like fully operate virtually with all of our capabilities with not losing a beat with our advisers or engagement with the clients. Our digital activities with the clients and the advisers is very strong to keep on adding capabilities there. 
We are integrating everything in an ecosystem that works together, not just putting tools on a platform and saying, ""Hey, we got this service and look how great it is. And usually, when we talk to you about it, it's not something like we just like thought of or just introduced or just added. It's something that we really have tested out. We've proven we've actually rolled it out and it really works well. 
And so I would just say that has added a lot to our advisers having this type of engagement with their clients and also with the way they're able to transact with the firm and the information that we're providing. So I think it's a combination of that -- all of that. I mean I can't sit here and tell you how much we got from each. What I could tell you is the feedback from our advisers are very positive about what we have enabled for them and how that's operating as they're working through things, including some of the capabilities we've added on the whole advice modules and what that does in client flows. 
So that's why we feel good about our system. And we feel like when we do discuss these things with you, it's not vaporware. It's not something that we just like introduced, and we're making a big marketing play on it. It's something that we feel really comfortable that has been executed."

I think Europe, U.K. would actually be favorable if that started to turn around to add to that. BMO is not a negative at all. I mean that's what you're doing is you're weighing in like $100-and-something billion of assets that have an institutional base mainly. And with that, they have a lower fee. 
But we think the revenue contribution will be positive in the float situation, we can make positive as well. And so really, that's all you're doing is you're doing the math.

So it's not as though we're just being myopic at this point, looking at it more holistic. We will look at what that generates for shareholders as well as what it is from a client value proposition. But when I say that, I look at it, so just think about it for that 20% that's remaining, again, outside of the LTC, which we manage, and it's not going to be an earnings for us. 
The rest of the business that we have right now generates a very good return. Now there are subsets like low interest rates for like the IUL book is not as lucrative as the VUL and other things like that. But even our annuity book has a very good return. It's well risked even the guarantee portion and well managed. And so if there are assets that are favorable for us to evaluate something different, and we also take into account the PE, we'll evaluate.  If there are subsets that like we did with the fixed annuity that sort of optimizes the book right now as other things unfold, we'll look at that as well. 
So I can't sit here and give you a perfect again view of the crystal ball, but we're open and thinking about what makes sense, but we look at all aspects of that, not just the financial aspect in the short term."

But it's sort of where like some people who were there wanted to delay it, some people didn't want to sort of like, well, the reopening and what I'm looking at of the markets are what they are, et cetera. 
So right now, our pipeline looks really good, and we feel like we'll get back to those numbers, and that's really and maybe even a little more favorable. But I would probably say it was just the way it came. Now is there a competitive market? Absolutely. There's a competitive market. And we're being disciplined as well because we don't want to just -- if it's not right for us, we don't jump at it, just like we want it right for the adviser we're recruiting in that we can help them be successful. 
But I would probably say the second quarter, I wouldn't attribute it to competitive frame. I could contribute to a confluence of factors. And that's really what I'm getting from my people. So as I said, I'm not coming up with that myself. It's really what I got as feedback as I went through the system."

In AWM, it's just they're getting their similar share just that our growth is strong. And so they're getting a piece of that action. So they're no different than the third parties as far as what we're seeing in the pickup, but it's across. 
And also, I think we did mention that it's not in just 1 or 2 disciplines. We have a range of products that are actually getting. And I think if you looked at the industry outside of passive, there was a bit more of a slowdown like in the equity sales in the active. Our equity has held up pretty well. So even though there was a little bit of a slowing in certain aspects, it was still quite good. 
So we feel good about the retail and the consistency of it and the variety of products that we're putting in the market. I think where we had a little more softness was really in Europe. We had positives in Europe, U.K. was weaker previously. And now Europe slowed down a little just because of what happened in the environment, but we're hoping that will bounce back."

On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions.
Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website.
Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our second quarter 2021 earnings release, our 2020 annual report to shareholders and our 2020 10-K report.  
We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the second quarter. Below that, you see our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.
Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim."

As you saw in our release, Ameriprise had another strong quarter, and I feel good about how we're performing at this point in the year. The environment in the U.S. continues to improve as the economy reopens more fully and equity markets remain strong.
Recent spikes in the virus are putting some pressure on Europe's recovery. But overall, there's a lot to be hopeful for as we look ahead. As I consider this landscape, we're executing well across our businesses, driving growth through our lower capital fee-based businesses and freeing up capital to generate shareholder value.  
We delivered another quarter of excellent organic growth in wealth and asset management and strong productivity across our system. This included strong client flows with more than $16 billion of inflows in wealth management and asset management in the quarter. And we ended with assets under management and administration up 28% to $1.2 trillion, another new high.
With regard to recent strategic moves, we completed the RiverSource Life fixed annuity reinsurance transaction. This further advances our mix shift to capital-light businesses and frees up approximately $700 million of excess capital and our acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business, which we announced in April is on track to close in the fourth quarter.
Let's turn to our adjusted operating results for the quarter. Momentum in the business continues, with revenues coming in strongly at $3.4 billion up 22%, fueled by organic growth in markets. Earnings increased 34%, excluding the reversal of the NOL a year ago, with earnings per share up 39%, reflecting strong business growth and capital return. And ROE remains exceptionally strong at 37.5%. As always, we continue to manage expenses well.
Let's move to Advice & Wealth Management where we're consistently generating good growth. Our strategic investments continue to be an important part of what we're doing. People are coming to Ameriprise for a high-quality advice experience backed by leading-edge technology. Client satisfaction remains high and clients are engaging with us personally and through our extensive digital capabilities.
Importantly, our advisers are embracing our training, coaching and powerful suite of tools that are fully integrated with our CRM platform. And we continue to add capabilities, including testing a new e-meeting tool that helps advisers prepare for client meetings in minutes.
Our ongoing investments in the technology ecosystem are helping advisers connect with more clients and prospects and run their practices more efficiently. This high level of engagement is leading to really good client activity, asset flows and client acquisition. Total client inflows were up 54% to $9.5 billion and that continued the positive trend we're seeing over the past several quarters.
Consistent with strong client flows, wrapped net inflows were $10 billion, continuing a very strong run rate. Transactional activity also grew nicely, up nearly 30% over last year, with good volume across a range of product solutions. All of this momentum, along with positive markets, drove nice growth in adviser productivity, up 14%, adjusting for interest rates to a record of $731,000 per adviser.
On the recruiting front, we have 42 experienced advisers join us in the quarter, a bit below where we've been. We're hearing that advisers have been focused on all that comes with reopening and some held off on transitioning firms or delayed their start dates.
That said, people are getting back to a more normal rhythm. We're now hosting in-person meetings that complement our virtual recruiting, and we feel good about our pipeline for the third quarter. Turning to the bank. Total assets grew to $9.7 billion in the quarter. We continue to move additional deposits to the bank, and we have adjusted our investment strategy to extend duration a bit.  
We're also seeing a good pickup in demand for our lending solutions. Loan volumes are steadily increasing, led by a pledged product, which represents a nice opportunity for future growth. Wrapping up AWM on metrics and financials remain very strong. Margin increased 380 basis points year-over-year, ending the quarter at 21.4%, showing consistent expansion since the Fed cut short-term rates a year ago.
Moving to Retirement & Protection Solutions. Results were good, and we continue to advance our strategic initiatives. With regard to Annuities, we had strong variable annuity sales with total sales up 88% from a year ago. This was driven by increased demand for both our structured variable annuity product and our RAVA product without living benefits.  
Together, this represented over 2/3 of sales in the quarter, a continuation of the shift that we're driving. On the insurance side, Life and Health insurance sales approximately doubled driven by our VUL product, which is an appropriate product to this rate environment.  
Now let's discuss asset management, where we continue to grow the business consistent with our plans. Assets under management rose to $593 billion, up 25% over last year from strong business results in positive markets. Regarding investment performance, the team continues to generate excellent performance for clients across equity, fixed income and asset allocation strategies, with more than 80% of the funds above medium over the longer-term time frames on an asset-weighted basis.
At quarter end, we had 110 4- and 5-star Morningstar-rated funds representing more than 70% of our funds. This quarter, we had net inflows of $6.7 billion, an improvement of $4.1 billion from a year ago. Excluding legacy insurance partner outflows, net inflows were $8.1 billion. These results build upon the favorable net flows we saw over the past several quarters.
Global retail net inflows were $4.2 billion, driven by another quarter of strong results in North America. Engagement with clients and intermediaries remain excellent. Sales and flows traction is broad-based with 15 of our investment capabilities, generating over $100 million of net inflows in the quarter. And in EMEA, retail sales have been weaker given the risk-off environment.
As I said, we're hopeful that EMEA flows will strengthen in the second half as the post-pandemic reopening and economic recovery continue. In terms of global institutional, we saw a nice improvement with net inflows of $3.9 billion ex legacy partner outflows with wins across equity and fixed income strategies in both North America and EMEA.
I feel good about our sales pipeline. Turning to BMO. As we discussed with you, the acquisition will add important capabilities and build on our reach in EMEA. Their business remains in positive flows, and we continue to receive good feedback from clients and institutional consultants. As I mentioned, we're on track to close in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of the balance sheet, our capital management is excellent. The business continues to generate substantial free cash flow, and we're freeing up additional capital. In fact, the approximately $700 million of our reinsurance deal largely pays for the BMO acquisition, giving us additional flexibility to return capital to shareholders at an attractive rate.
In summary, Ameriprise is in a terrific position. We're performing well and generating strong results. Our team is serving more clients and deepening relationships. We're delivering excellent organic growth in both wealth and asset management. And the BMO transaction will add an additional growth opportunity, and we're accelerating our business mix shift with the reinsurance of the fixed annuity block.
I'd like to close by talking about our team. Our people have been coming back to the office a few days a week this summer and re-acclimating. It's been great to be together again in-person. We're looking forward to being more fully backed this fall where conditions are safe to do so while maintaining a level of flexibility.
Now I'll turn it over to Walter and then take your questions."

Ameriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating EPS up 39% to $5.27. We continue to demonstrate excellent metrics, earnings growth and margin expansion in our core growth businesses of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management.  
Sales of our Retirement & Protection products were up significantly from last year, and were focused on low risk and higher-margin offerings. We're already seeing a shift in our import block and expect this to continue going forward. As Jim mentioned, in the quarter, we continue to advance our strategic priorities to expand our growth businesses and reduce our risk profile.
We remain on track to close the acquisition of BMO's EMEA Asset Management business in the fourth quarter, which will expand our core geographic and product capabilities in attractive and growing market segments. Additionally, we entered into an agreement to reinsure approximately $8 billion of fixed annuities and closed on the RiverSource Life transaction in early July.  
As noted, we will free up approximately $700 million of capital and will have a marginal projected impact on fixed annuity profitability. In addition to the reinsurance transaction, we continue to effectively manage our risk profile through product mix shift to lower risk and higher-margin Retirement & Protection Solutions offerings.  
Our diversified model generates robust free cash flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals. We returned 92% of adjusted op earnings to shareholders in the quarter, aligning us to our projected 90% target for the full year. 
Let's turn to Slide 6. In the quarter, Ameriprise adjusted operating net revenues grew 22% and PTI increased 35%, reflecting continued excellent business performance. Revenue and earnings in our capital-light businesses of AWM and Asset Management drove nearly 80% of the total, excluding corporate and other, a significant shift from a year ago even normalizing for the unusually high earnings in RPS last year.
We remain disciplined on expenses. G&A expenses were well managed, up 6%, given the strong business growth in the quarter. Overall, we delivered another excellent quarter that underscores the strength of the business model that continues to yield robust profitable growth.
Turning to Slide 7. Advice & Wealth Management delivered another quarter of excellent organic growth with total client assets up 28% to $807 billion. Total client flows were $9.5 billion, the third consecutive quarter of total client flows at or above $9 billion, demonstrating the sustainability of our organic growth.
Our focus is not only on growth, but profitable growth. In the quarter, our pretax-adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, an increase of 380 basis points from the prior year and an increase of 70 basis points sequentially despite continued low interest rates.
On Page 8, financial results in Advice & Wealth Management were very strong with pretax adjusted operating earnings of $423 million, up 56%. Adjusted operating net revenues grew 29% to $2 billion, fueled by robust client flows and a 29% increase in transactional activity in addition to strong market appreciation.
On a sequential basis, revenue increased nicely to 5%. Ameriprise Bank continues to grow at a solid pace, reaching nearly $10 billion in the quarter after adding $700 million of sweep cash to the balance sheet. Expenses remain well managed, and we continue to exhibit strong expense discipline.  
G&A expense increased 3%, reflecting increased activity and the timing of performance-based compensation expense. Going forward, we remain committed to managing expense and margin in a disciplined manner.
Turning to Page 9. Asset Management delivered another strong quarter, driven by excellent investment performance and sustained inflows resulting in outstanding financial results. Net inflows were $8.1 billion, excluding legacy insurance partners, which is a continuation of an improved solid flow trend.
Adjusted operating revenues increased 32% to $879 million, a result of the cumulative benefit of net inflows and market appreciation. On a sequential basis, revenues were up 6%. Our fee rate remains strong at 52 basis points, reflecting the strong momentum we are seeing across the board with strength in both equity and fixed income strategies.
Expenses remain well managed and in line with expectations given the revenue environment. G&A expenses grew 12% primarily from the timing of compensation expense related to strong business performance as well as foreign exchange translation and higher volume-related expenses.
As with AWM, going forward, we will manage the expense tightly. Pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 79%, and we delivered a 45% margin. Moving forward, we expect strong financial performance to continue and anticipate that margins will remain in the mid-40% range over the near term, driven by current robust equity markets.
Let's turn to Page 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectations in this environment. Pretax adjusted operating earnings were $182 million. Sales in the quarter were up significantly off a low base in the prior year driven by the pandemic.
Sales were above pre-COVID levels, resulting in an increase in distribution expense in the quarter. Additionally, earnings in the prior year were positively impacted by the lower surrenders and withdrawals relating to the pandemic environment. Importantly, we continue to reduce our risk profile by growing sales of retirement products without living benefits.
Retirement sales increased 88% during the quarter, with 2/3 of the sales on products without living benefits. This is shifting the overall book and now only 62% of the AUR block has living benefit riders down over 200 basis points from a year ago. 
In Protection, sales nearly doubled as we continue to see a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a significant decline in IUL. This mix shift in both retirement and protection products are expected to continue going forward. 
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong, including our liquidity position of $3 billion at the parent company and substantial excess capital of $2 billion, which does not include the capital release from the recently announced fixed annuity transaction. 
Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 37.5%. We returned $585 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback, and we are on track with our commitment to return 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders for the year. With that, we'll take your questions."

Have you considered adjusting some of the AWM reporting or maybe providing some enhanced reporting that would be a little bit more in line with the wealth management competitors in the marketplace? And allow for a little bit more clean comparison on some of these metrics. Distribution revenue, including some components that are yield-oriented, compensation being part of distribution expense. Just some of these metrics that are probably really more tied to the insurance legacy of the firm that don't make for the easiest comparisons to the wealth management firms.

But if you take that to your point, we have been moving more in that direction of disclosing more of that type of segmented results for our wealth and asset management. I know Alicia and team working with our finance people are looking at all those things. 
And just like we introduced some of those additional metrics, as you would imagine, we have to go back and make sure that well, the data and everything is consistent quarter-to-quarter, how we look at it to track it, et cetera.

And certainly -- we do not see inflationary pressures yet. Certainly, our compensation is up, as we talked about, because of the performance characteristics this year versus last year. 
But from our standpoint, the underlying expenses are being well managed, and we will continue to spend money as it's prudent, but you could expect that they're going to be a disciplined approach to it.

So as you saw I mean our sales of Retirement & Protection Solutions activity really picked up strongly, whether it's maybe our VUL product or it's a structured or even our RAVA product, which has no living benefits. 
And so I think now as you look at the market environment and you look at the ability for our advisers to feel more comfortable actually executing those type of transactions in the environment and with the clients, even a combination of remote and in-person that has picked up nicely. 
Now for other transaction activity, we see good activity there as well. And we had to pick up generally both in there and wrap all through these periods. So the wrap business is really coming from both new client inflows as well as new clients that we're adding. And we had good client acquisition also during the period, and the flows also were strong. 
So I think it's a combination of those factors. I don't think there's one in particular. I think the environment, particularly with low interest rates now that people are looking for how do they get on -- a more return more holistically. In our wrap program, we do, do balanced portfolios and diversify it pretty well so that there is a level of what we would call not just overreliance on the equity markets, but not at the same time, just looking for yield from fixed income. 
And so I think it's a combination of those factors. I don't know if that answers your question, but as you saw, it continued from the latter part of last year all through the first half of this year."

I would also say that part of it is definitely the capabilities we put in place and the engagement we have with our advisers. We've done a lot over the last few years. Just the idea is like we're one of the few firms that were able to like fully operate virtually with all of our capabilities with not losing a beat with our advisers or engagement with the clients. Our digital activities with the clients and the advisers is very strong. We keep on adding capabilities there. 
We are integrating everything in an ecosystem that works together, not just putting tools on a platform and saying, ""Hey, we got this service and look how great it is."" And usually, when we talk to you about it, it's not something like we just like thought of or just introduced or just added. It's something that we really have tested out. We've proven. We've actually rolled it out, and it really works well. 
And so I would just say that has added a lot to our advisers having this type of engagement with their clients and also with the way they're able to transact with the firm and the information that we're providing. So I think it's a combination of that -- all of that. I mean I can't sit here and tell you how much we got from each. What I could tell you is the feedback from our advisers is very positive about what we have enabled for them and how that's operating as they're working through things, including some of the capabilities we've added on the whole advice modules and what that does in client flows. 
So that's why we feel good about our system. And we feel like when we do discuss these things with you, it's not vaporware. It's not something that we just like introduced, and we're making a big marketing play on it. It's something that we feel really comfortable that has been executed."

I think Europe, U.K. would actually be favorable if that started to turn around to add to that. BMO is not a negative at all. I mean that's what you're doing is you're weighing in like $100-and-something billion of assets that have an institutional base mainly. And with that, they have a lower fee.

Would it be something similar to FA where you might do a slice of your remaining risk, whether that's life insurance, variable annuities, even long-term care? Or would you be open to doing something far more strategic like a full divestiture of RiverSource Life? When you -- and how -- I don't know how closely you've really looked at it yet, but when you think about the drag on your valuation and your multiple today from those businesses compared to bid-ask spreads in the market?

So as an example, if something optimizes us for slices, we will look at that. If something strategic that really makes sense from what we're doing for our system or a client, et cetera, it makes sense, we'll evaluate it. 
So it's not as though we're just being myopic at this point. We're looking at it more holistic. We will look at what that generates for shareholders as well as what it is from a client value proposition. But when I say that, I look at it, so just think about it for that 20% that's remaining, again, outside of the LTC, which we manage, and it's not going to be an earnings for us. 
The rest of the business that we have right now generates a very good return. Now there are subsets like low interest rates for like the IUL book is not as lucrative as the VUL and other things like that. But even our annuity book has a very good return. It's well risked, even the guarantee portion and well managed. And so if there are assets that are favorable for us to evaluate something different, and we also take into account the PE, we'll evaluate it. If there are subsets that like we did with the fixed annuity that sort of optimizes the book right now as other things unfold, we'll look at that as well. 
So I can't sit here and give you a perfect again view of the crystal ball, but we're open and thinking about what makes sense, but we look at all aspects of that, not just the financial aspect in the short term."

And we're being disciplined as well because we don't want to just -- if it's not right for us, we don't jump at it, just like we want it right for the adviser we're recruiting in that we can help them be successful.

So they're no different than the third parties as far as what we're seeing in the pickup, but it's across. 
And also, I think we did mention that it's not in just 1 or 2 disciplines. We have a range of products that are actually getting. And I think if you looked at the industry outside of passive, there was a bit more of a slowdown like in the equity sales, in the active. Our equity has held up pretty well. So even though there was a little bit of a slowing in certain aspects, it was still quite good. 
So we feel good about the retail and the consistency of it and the variety of products that we're putting in the market. I think where we had a little more softness was really in Europe. We had positives in Europe, U.K. was weaker previously. And now Europe slowed down a little just because of what happened in the environment, but we're hoping that will bounce back."

On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions. 
Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company operations. 
Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. 
These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our third quarter 2021 earnings release, our 2020 annual report to shareholders and our 2020 10-K report. 
We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that, you'll see our adjusted operating results, followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.

As you saw, Ameriprise delivered another excellent quarter, building on a strong year. We continue to perform extremely well. The environment in the U.S. is largely positive as the economy continues to show solid growth. 
Equity markets remain strong and have recovered from a weaker September. Inflation has picked up given demand, and there remains some headwinds due to pandemic. In Europe, conditions continue to improve. As you consider this backdrop, we're executing well and consistently generating important organic growth and shareholder value. 
Our differentiated results reflect the strategic investments we've made in the business and a culture built on performance and a high level of care for our clients and team. Our growth businesses are delivering strong client flows and nearly $14 billion of inflows in the wealth management and asset management businesses in the quarter. So with these positive flows and markets, assets under management and administration are up 21% to $1.2 trillion. 
Turning to our financials. The excellent results we delivered in the quarter reflect the high level of performance we've generated this year. Adjusted operating results for the quarter, excluding unlocking, revenues came in strongly at $3.5 billion, up 17%, fueled by continued organic growth in attractive markets. Earnings rose 32%, with earnings per share up 38%, reflecting strong business growth and capital management and ROE is exceptional at nearly 48% compared to 35.5% a year ago. Let's move to Advice & Wealth Management, where we continue to deliver meaningful and consistent growth. 
With the strategic investments we've made over many years coupled with our expertise in planning, we're delivering a differentiated and referable advice experience. Clients are actively engaged with us. They're turning to Ameriprise and our advisers for comprehensive advice and solutions. 
And they're leveraging our extensive digital capabilities to track and achieve their goals. Our client experience is sophisticated, personalized and supported by our integrated digital technology in backed by our strong reputation. 
In fact, Investor's Business Daily recently named Ameriprise, the #1 Most Trusted Wealth Manager. We've earned this impressive credential based on how consumers rate Ameriprise for how we serve them, the quality of our products and services, our commitment to ethical practices, fair prices and protecting personal data. To being #1 in trust is high praise and we're honored. 
This type of recognition and client satisfaction doesn't happen without an industry-leading adviser force that's highly engaged. Our advisers are benefiting from our training, coaching and suite of tools to build and deepen client relationships, track prospects and run and grow their practices through our fully integrated platform. 
This positive momentum and engagement are leading to robust client activity, asset flows and client acquisition. Our results reflect the traction on organic growth that we've consistently demonstrated. Total client inflows were up 64% to $10 billion, continuing the positive trend we've seen over the past several quarters. 
Wrapped net inflows were excellent at $9.4 billion, up 65%. Transactional activity gre for another quarter up nearly 16% over the last year, with good volume across a range of product solutions. Adviser productivity reached another new high of 18%, adjusted for interest rates to a record $766,000 per adviser. 
I'd highlight that our advisers continue to be recognized across the industry, including in top national rankings from Barron's, Forbes and Working Mother. We have long focused on driving productivity growth for our advisers, and we're generating some of the highest growth rates in the industry. 
At the same time, we complement this with targeted recruiting of experienced productive advisers who are attracted to our brand And value proposition. In the quarter, recruiting picked up nicely and another 104 experienced advisers joined us. 
We're getting a great response from our in-person events and virtual recruiting activities. And importantly, the quality of our recruits is very good. Let's turn to the bank where total assets grew to nearly $11 billion in the quarter. The trends we've been discussing with you remain consistent. 
We continue to move additional deposits to the bank, and we're seeing a growing demand for our recently introduced Lending Solutions, especially our pledge loan product that is getting good initial traction. To wrap up Advice & Wealth Management, our metrics and financials are very strong. 
Pretax income was $459 million, up 43%, and margin was strong at 22.4%, up 320 basis points, which compares very well in the industry. Now I'll turn to Asset Management, where we continue to build on our momentum and results. 
Assets under management increased 17% to $583 billion. Our outstanding research is core to our business and our ability to consistently generate excellent investment performance for clients. That's across equity, fixed income and asset allocation strategies with more than 85% of our funds above the medium on an asset-weighted basis on a 3-, 5- and 10-year basis. 
In fact, compared to the broad group of U.S. peers we tracked, we performed at or near the top of the Lipper rankings for multiple time periods. Flows remained strong given our excellent investment performance, client experience and continued support we provide advisers and our partner firms. We had net inflows of $3.9 billion in the quarter. This is an improvement of nearly $5.5 billion from a year ago. 
Global retail net inflows were $1.8 billion, driven by North America. While overall industry sales were a bit weaker in the quarter given the summer months. Overall, our flow traction is good. We continue to have good sales and equity strategies. And consistent with our plans, we're gaining traction within fixed income, and that's across multiple channels and structures. 
I'd note that we expanded our successful suite of strategic beta fixed income ETFs in the quarter with the launch of the Columbia short duration bond to ETF. In EMEA retail, market conditions remain challenging. And while we experienced some net outflows, flows have improved from the second quarter. 
In terms of global institutional, excluding legacy insurance partners, net inflows were $3.5 billion. The team is working hard to generate winds across equity and fixed income strategies in each of our 3 regions. In fact, we're seeing a number of current clients adding to their positions. 
Of course, we recognize there will be shifts and flows quarter-to-quarter given the size of certain institutional mandates. Our client service and consultant relations teams have good traction, and we're making considerable progress expanding our consultant ratings, which position us well for growth. 
As I look at the year thus far for institutional, we're making good progress. That includes expanding our presence in APAC, where we announced the opening of our new Japan office that complements our other locations in the region. Turning to BMO EMEA acquisition. We look forward to closing the transaction shortly pending final regulatory approval. I feel good about how we're tracking. 
We'll be able to provide more details after we close and when we release fourth quarter results in January. To wrap up Asset Management, we're serving clients well while maintaining our attractive organic growth and profitability. Moving to Retirement & Protection Solutions. 
Our results continue to be strong. These are high-quality businesses that generate solid earnings and excellent free cash flow. We continue to focus on nonguaranteed retirement and asset accumulation protection products that deliver benefits to clients and our shareholders. 
Consistent with this strategy, the majority of our annuity sales in the quarter did not include living benefit guarantees. Sales increased 28% and have shifted to both our structured variable annuity product and our RAVA product without living benefits. On the insurance side, life and health insurance sales increased 77% driven by our VUL product, appropriate given the current low rates. 
We've also seen good response to our DI products reflecting our financial planning approach. To summarize, Ameriprise has built a differentiated book of business over many years that deliver superior financial results that are sustainable. It starts with providing clients with solutions that meet their long-term retirement needs, have appropriate benefits and generate good risk-adjusted returns for the company. 
Now let me highlight why Ameriprise is clearly differentiated in financial services. In terms of our balance sheet, our capital management remains a real strength. Our Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses are performing very well in generating excellent growth, margins and returns. We compare quite favorably across the industry. 
And our Retirement & Protection business is valuable and high quality, generating good free cash flow and returns. It's entirely focused on our channel and differentiated from anything else out there. Listen, we're generating some of the strongest returns in the industry and have been for quite some time, and we're able to do it with lower volatility. Importantly, we've returned capital to shareholders at very attractive levels. 
In fact, we consistently return nearly all of our operating earnings to shareholders annually. And if you look at that over the last 5 years, we reduced our average weighted diluted share count by 28%. This is all while we're consistently investing in the business and maintaining a sizable excess capital position that gives us flexibility. 
In closing, Ameriprise is positioned well. Our team is focused on key priorities to drive organic growth and we're delivering for our clients. In fact, I was just with our top advisers last week to recognize their achievements and discuss our growth priorities. It was terrific being together. 
As I think about all of the Ameriprise, it's great to have people back in the office more in person again as we focus on finishing the year strong. Now Walter will review the numbers in more detail, and then we'll take your questions."
4165019,1684957166,2414099,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating EPS of 38% to $5.91, excluding unlocking. In fact, we reached new record levels for revenue pretax adjusted operating earnings and return on equity",1976,"Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating EPS of 38% to $5.91, excluding unlocking. In fact, we reached new record levels for revenue pretax adjusted operating earnings and return on equity in the quarter. 
We delivered strong flows, earnings growth and margin expansion in our core wealth and asset management businesses. Results in the quarter are a continuation of the excellent trends we have been seeing this year as we successfully execute our growth strategies. 
This is driving our business mix shift, both wealth and asset management representing about 80% of earnings. Retirement & Protection performed well, and we remain focused on optimizing our risk return trade-offs in this environment. We generate robust free cash flow across all our businesses. Our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent with significant excess capital. 
Combined, this allows Ameriprise to consistently return substantial capital to shareholders with 95% of adjusted operating earnings returned in the quarter, putting us on track to achieve our 90% target for the full year. Let's turn to Slide 6. 
We are focused on growth in our core wealth and asset management businesses, and we hit some important milestones this quarter. We are seeing excellent AUM growth of 21% to $1.2 trillion on flows and markets. 
Flows in these businesses have improved substantially, up over 200% from a year ago and up nearly 140% on a year-to-date basis, representing the successful execution of our growth strategies in each of these businesses. Let's turn to Slide 7, where you can see that we are delivering profitable organic growth. 
Revenues in wealth and asset management grew 23% to nearly $3 billion with pretax operating earnings of [ $744 million ], up 44%. Importantly, earnings growth from wealth and asset management outpaced revenue growth demonstrating the operating leverage of the business. And the blended margin for these 2 businesses expanded 370 basis points from last year, with wealth management up 320 basis points and asset management up 500 basis points, further illustrating our ability to deliver profitable growth. 
Turning to Slide 8. This chart clearly illustrates our success executing our growth and business mix shift strategy. Specifically, the wealth and asset management businesses are driving about 80% of the earnings over the past 12 months. 
This is coupled with a stable $700 million contribution from Retirement & Protection Solutions. With that as an overview, let's review the individual segment performance beginning with wealth management on Slide 9. 
The strategies we have in place to support advisers and improve their productivity using integrated industry-leading tools technology and training has resulted in increased flows and transactional activity. Total client assets were up over 25% to $811 billion over the past 2 years. 
Our adviser force continued to deliver exceptional productivity growth across market cycles. Revenue per adviser reached a new high of $766,000 in the quarter, up 24% over the past 2 years. Importantly, over the past 2 years, the annualized organic growth rate for wealth management flows improved to 6% compared to 4% in 2019. 
This is coming from advisers penetrating their existing client base and adding new clients, complemented by recruiting experienced advisers. And we are pleased that our strategies are translating to this level of organic growth. On Page 10, you can see that we are delivering growth as well as excellent financial results in wealth management. In fact, revenue and earnings for wealth management also reached record levels this quarter. 
Adjusted operating net revenues grew 23% to over $2 billion fueled by robust client flows, a 16% increase in transactional activities and market appreciation. Wealth management pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 43% to $459 million. 
Ameriprise Bank is adding to the growth in wealth meneprimarily by allowing us to pick up incremental spread and cash sweep deposits. In total, the bank has nearly $11 billion of assets after moving an additional $1.1 billion of [ sweet ] cash onto our balance sheet in the quarter. 
In the quarter, the average spread on the bank assets was 144 basis points compared to off-balance sheet cash earnings of 28 basis points. In addition, we are seeing good growth in banking products, including Pledged Lending that has gained substantial traction with our adviser base since the product was launched in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Expenses remain well managed. G&A expense increased 1% as higher activity based expenses and performance based compensation were largely offset by expense discipline. In the quarter, our pretax adjusted operating margin was 22.4%, an increase of 320 basis points from the prior year and 100 basis points sequentially. Let's turn to Asset Management on Slide 11, where significant success is also being realized. 
Over the past 2 years, asset under management increased 18%. We also saw a net flow shift from outflows in 2019 to a 5% prganic growth rate this year. As Jim mentioned, we are seeing positive flows across both retail and institutional distribution channels, supported by excellent investment performance. 
And like the industry, we saw a bit of a slowdown during the summer months, though our relative position among our peers remain strong. The operating leverage in asset management is significant with margins for the trailing 12 months up 44.6%, up 830 basis points over the last 2 years. 
Turning to Page 12. You see these trends generated excellent financial performance in Asset Management. Adjusted operating revenues increased 24% to $915 million, a result of the cumulative benefit of net inflows, market depreciation and performance fees. On a sequential basis, revenues grew 4%. Importantly, our fee rate remained strong and stable at 53 basis points. 
Expenses remain well managed and in line with expectations given the revenue growth. G&A expenses were up 14%, primarily from compensation expense and other variable costs related to strong business performance as well as foreign exchange translation. 
Pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 44% to $285 million, and we delivered a 49% margin. Moving forward, we expect strong financial performance to continue, and anticipate that margins will remain in the mid-40% range over the near term, driven by the continued flow momentum and equity markets at these levels. 
As Jim mentioned, we are on track to close the BMO EMEA transaction in the fourth quarter. This acquisition will add significant capabilities from a strategic perspective and drive improved business fundamentals going forward. Let's turn to Page 13. Retirement & Protection Solutions continued to reflect excellent underlying business performance, differentiated risk profile and a continued generation of substantial free cash flow. 
Pretax adjusted operating earnings were $192 million, excluding unlocking, down from $206 million a year ago. Current year results reflect lower profitability from increased sales levels whereas results in the prior year benefited from lower sales as well as lower surrenders and withdrawals. 
In total, unlocking impacts in the quarter were immaterial resulting from consistent client behavior and interest rates that were in line with prior year estimates. We saw a strong pickup in sales of retirement and protection products in the quarter with a continued mix shift towards non-guaranteed retirement products. 
During the quarter, the variable annuity sales increased 28% from last year, with 72% of sales and products without living benefit guarantees. Account value with living benefits represent only 62% of the overall book now, down another 200 basis points in the past year. We had similar trends in protection with sales up 77% driven by higher margin VUL sales. 
This mix in sales and account values for both retirement and protection products are expected to continue. 
Additionally, in the appendix of this presentation, we have provided our annual update on long-term care business. You will observe that the business continues to perform in line with expectations from a claims perspective. The policy count continues to decline as the book ages, and we are garnering additional premium rate increases. 
Now approximately 90% of the book has extensive or substantial credible experience. And I will note that we did not incorporate recent improvements in mortality and morbidity related to COVID-19 into our long-term assumptions. Overall, our actual performance continues to be in line with expectations. 
Let's turn to Slide 14. In the quarter, you have seen transactions announced in insurance and annuity space. In light of these announcements, I felt it will be helpful to provide additional context as it relates to how we view our business. 
As Jim has indicated, we believe our I&A business is a highly valuable asset with a client solution-driven capability that has generated sustainable and predictable financial results, and free cash flow generation, coupled with a low risk profile. 
The driver of this is our prudent approach in building all aspects of this business, resulting in a proven track record of superior value creation. The behavior of our clients has been consistent, reflecting the nature of the product sale as part of the financial plan. 
We have taken a conservative approach to product features, including guarantees and crediting rates as well as requiring asset allocation for living benefits. We have maintained consistent sales level and industry market share over the last decade, avoiding the arms race seen from time to time in the industry. And our economic hedging program has performed well across market cycles with 97% effectiveness over the past 5 years. Finally, we have taken prudent and appropriate actions to manage the risk profile of the business. 
For example, we stopped sales of LTC in 2002 and have successfully implemented premium rate actions and increased protection with our LTC reinsurance partner. We also sold our order and home business, reinsured our fixed annuity businesses and have reduced living benefit sales. This consistent and prudent approach has resulted in stable earnings with 24% margins and a pretax return on capital exceeding 50% with consistent free cash flow generation. 
Our balance sheet fundamentals are strong with a high-quality investment portfolio and strong risk-based capital ratio. This performance is best-in-class in the industry over many years. We have demonstrated superior return on capital, dividends paid and capital ratios. And our net amount at risk is substantially lower than peers. 
In summary, this is a very valuable business and we are well positioned. It is now only 20% of our earnings. We have demonstrated that the exposure profile is well managed, and we completed our annual unlocking with very minor updates. With that being said, we will continue to evaluate options from a position of strength to make the best decisions to drive all aspects of shareholder value creation. Now let's move to the balance sheet, another area we have delivered strong results. 
Our balance sheet fundamentals and risk management capability are cornerstones of what we do. It starts with how we manage the business to generate substantial free cash flow in each of our segments. We had holding company available liquidity of $3.7 billion and excess capital of $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter. 
We prudently manage credit risk where we maintain an overall AA minus credit quality in our investment portfolio and have a highly effective hedge strategy. These strong fundamentals allow us to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders. 
As I mentioned, we returned 95% of earnings to shareholders in the quarter, and we are on track to hit our 90% target for the full year. We have executed our capital return consistently over the years. Our share count declined 28% over the past 5 years, even with issuing shares to fund share-based compensation programs. 
Over the past year alone, our share count declined 5%. In summary, strong fundamentals across our businesses deliver substantial free cash flow. We manage the balance sheet conservatively, and we have substantial liquidity and capital flexibility. Combined, these attributes position us to continue delivering a differentiated level of capital return to shareholders going forward. With that, we will take your questions."

Where do you see the bank levels getting to on a more steady-state basis?

So we do see we have a substantial room to grow as we take deposits right now, they're in the $11 billion range, to be increasing that by at least $2 billion to $3 billion as we move forward into the years and evaluate the situation. 
It gives us certainly a yield pickup from that standpoint and gives diversity. As it relates to the underlying assets, we are seeing a tremendous success as we look at our pledged loan activity and margin loan activity, which, of course, is in the broker deal. But -- and the other actives, we are investing to build that.

So we feel like what we've made is good investments there. Training and development is really starting to show its fruits. In regard to the external recruitment, that has picked up again, which we did as we moved from the virtual back to in-person. We're seeing good advisers join us, good quality books. 
And we feel like we have a good opportunity as people better understand the type of capabilities that we offer, the brand support that we provide as well as the recognition that we're getting there from a client perspective for trust in regard to our brand. And that's very important. And we see that both in the adviser and employee channel, the franchisee, but as well in the [indiscernible] channel.

So let me try to clarify that, and what we try to do there. 
We've seen the transactions, as Walter said, come out to market, and people are starting to realize that our book is a bit better than what they've seen out there. And very clearly, we think it is significantly better. In that regard, the business is less than 20% of our total today. 
It is very well managed. It generates very strong returns and cash flows. And so the first thing I would convey to you as an investor and as an analyst is that it does not detract from our business. It provides the level of diversity, it actually gives us strong cash flows that we use for buyback as to free cash flows we generate in the other businesses. So it doesn't, in any way, have a draw on capital. 
And that it's been very steady and consistent with excellent returns on the overall capital that's deployed there. So one thing we would bring to highlight is, as we hold the business, it should not be a discount or an overhang on us, is the first thing. 
The second thing we would clearly say, just like we've sold the Auto & Home, we reinsured part of the book, we've diverted our sales from activities that don't give us really good strong returns. We're very open to continue to explore strategic opportunities with the book, either reinsurance of aspects or even the sale of certain of the businesses or total. 
But as long as it makes sense from a strategic perspective, supports our clients and we can generate reasonable value for that, we think it's a good operating business. It's really a great client-oriented business. It really has great distribution capabilities as part of our solution set. 
So it might be a great opportunity strategically for us to evaluate, but we wanted to be clear that this is not a discounted book that we must get rid of for whatever reason, because it doesn't detract from us. And in fact, it shouldn't be a discount to the business today as we hold it. 
But if someone was or we evaluated strategically, it made sense, I would tell you it's a valued business that should be a valued price."

It's just that we don't go out and sell to new clients to add new mandates to it. 
And since we have a really good book with the amount of incremental flows that come in from that book anyway, it still continues to be nice accretive. On the other side, to the point that you raised, we have been able to really diversify our mix. And so over the course of the year again, we have more than 10 different disciplines that are adding over $1 billion of flows too. 
So we feel really good about the diversification and what may still be in income products, if that's where people are interested versus as well our fixed income business has grown as well as some of the other equity products have also been gaining traction. So we feel like our lineup is pretty diversified now. and each of what we're selling actually has excellent performance."

The biggest thing that we try to do is educate advisers versus what people are selling out there of what we offer more completely and comprehensively. And we think it is very differentiated. We think that it really helps an adviser really improve their productivity and drive a really good, strong practice. And so that's really what we focus on. 
Now part of that is the package financial for someone to transition, et cetera, we think that we offer competitive packages there. We don't get overly aggressive less some that will sort of buy the business per se. We look at the economics of that. I want to make sure that it is reasonable and appropriate to cycle.

And we are launching more of the lending products in the bank and some more deposit gathering products in the bank as well for our retail clients. Now with that, it will continue to take time to develop those books, but we see a really good traction in the ones we've launched already.

Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will see discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company operations.
Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance.
These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Release, our 2020 annual report to shareholders and our 2020 10-K report.
We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that, you'll see our adjusted operating results, followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.
We completed our annual unlocking in the third quarter. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim."

As you saw, Ameriprise delivered another excellent quarter, building on a strong year. We continue to perform extremely well. The environment in the U.S. is largely positive as the economy continues to show solid growth.
Equity markets remain strong and have recovered from a weaker September. Inflation has picked up given demand, and there remains some headwinds due to pandemic. In Europe, conditions continue to improve. As you consider this backdrop, we're executing well and consistently generating important organic growth and shareholder value.
Our differentiated results reflect the strategic investments we've made in the business and a culture built on performance and a high level of care for our clients and team. Our growth businesses are delivering strong client flows and nearly $14 billion of inflows in the Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses in the quarter. So with these positive flows and markets, assets under management and administration are up 21% to $1.2 trillion.
Turning to our financials. The excellent results we delivered in the quarter reflect the high level of performance we've generated this year. Adjusted operating results for the quarter, excluding unlocking, revenues came in strongly at $3.5 billion, up 17%, fueled by continued organic growth in attractive markets. Earnings rose 32%, with earnings per share up 38%, reflecting strong business growth and capital management. And ROE is exceptional at nearly 48% compared to 35.5% a year ago. Let's move to Advice & Wealth Management, where we continue to deliver meaningful and consistent growth.
With the strategic investments we've made over the many years, coupled with our expertise in planning, we're delivering a differentiated and referable advice experience. Clients are actively engaged with us. They're turning to Ameriprise and our advisers for comprehensive advice and solutions.
And they're leveraging our extensive digital capabilities to track and achieve their goals. Our client experience is sophisticated, personalized and supported by our integrated digital technology and backed by our strong reputation.
In fact, Investor's Business Daily recently named Ameriprise, the #1 Most Trusted Wealth Manager. We've earned this impressive credential based on how consumers rate Ameriprise for how we serve them, the quality of our products and services, our commitment to ethical practices, fair prices and protecting personal data. To being #1 in trust is high praise and we're honored.
This type of recognition and client satisfaction doesn't happen without an industry-leading adviser force that's highly engaged. Our advisers are benefiting from our training, coaching and suite of tools to build and deepen client relationships, track prospects and run and grow their practices through our fully integrated platform.
This positive momentum and engagement are leading to robust client activity, asset flows and client acquisition. Our results reflect the traction on organic growth that we've consistently demonstrated. Total client inflows were up 64% to $10 billion, continuing the positive trend we've seen over the past several quarters.
Wrap net inflows were excellent at $9.4 billion, up 65%. Transactional activity grew for another quarter, up nearly 16% over the last year, with good volume across a range of product solutions. Adviser productivity reached another new high of 18%, adjusted for interest rates to a record $766,000 per adviser.
I'd highlight that our advisers continue to be recognized across the industry, including in top national rankings from Barron's, Forbes and Working Mother. We have long focused on driving productivity growth for our advisers, and we're generating some of the highest growth rates in the industry.
At the same time, we complement this with targeted recruiting of experienced productive advisers who are attracted to our brand and value proposition. In the quarter, recruiting picked up nicely and another 104 experienced advisers joined us.
We're getting a great response from our in-person events and virtual recruiting activities. And importantly, the quality of our recruits is very good. Let's turn to the bank where total assets grew to nearly $11 billion in the quarter. The trends we've been discussing with you remain consistent.
We continue to move additional deposits to the bank, and we're seeing a growing demand for our recently introduced Lending Solutions, especially our pledge loan product that is getting good initial traction. To wrap up Advice & Wealth Management, our metrics and financials are very strong.
Pretax income was $459 million, up 43%, and margin was strong at 22.4%, up 320 basis points, which compares very well in the industry.
Now I'll turn to Asset Management, where we continue to build on our momentum and results.
Assets under management increased 17% to $583 billion. Our outstanding research is core to our business and our ability to consistently generate excellent investment performance for clients. That's across equity, fixed income and asset allocation strategies with more than 85% of our funds above the medium on an asset-weighted basis on a 3-, 5- and 10-year basis.
In fact, compared to the broad group of U.S. peers we tracked, we performed at or near the top of the Lipper rankings for multiple time periods. Flows remained strong given our excellent investment performance, client experience and continued support we provide advisers and our partner firms. We had net inflows of $3.9 billion in the quarter. This is an improvement of nearly $5.5 billion from a year ago.
Global retail net inflows were $1.8 billion, driven by North America, while overall industry sales were a bit weaker in the quarter given the summer months. Overall, our flow traction is good. We continue to have good sales and equity strategies. And consistent with our plans, we're gaining traction within fixed income, and that's across multiple channels and structures.
I'd note that we expanded our successful suite of strategic beta fixed income ETFs in the quarter with the launch of the Columbia short duration bond to ETF. In EMEA retail, market conditions remain challenging. And while we experienced some net outflows, flows have improved from the second quarter.
In terms of global institutional, excluding legacy insurance partners, net inflows were $3.5 billion. The team is working hard to generate wins across equity and fixed income strategies in each of our 3 regions. In fact, we're seeing a number of current clients adding to their positions.
Of course, we recognize there will be shifts and flows quarter-to-quarter given the size of certain institutional mandates. Our client service and consultant relation teams have good traction, and we're making considerable progress expanding our consultant ratings, which position us well for growth.
As I look at the year thus far for institutional, we're making good progress. That includes expanding our presence in APAC, where we announced the opening of our new Japan office that complements our other locations in the region.
Turning to BMO, EMEA acquisition. We look forward to closing the transaction shortly pending final regulatory approval. I feel good about how we're tracking.
We'll be able to provide more details after we close and when we release fourth quarter results in January. To wrap up Asset Management, we're serving clients well, while maintaining our attractive organic growth and profitability.
Moving to Retirement & Protection Solutions. Our results continue to be strong. These are high-quality businesses that generate solid earnings and excellent free cash flow. We continue to focus on non-guaranteed retirement and asset accumulation protection products that deliver benefits to clients and our shareholders.
Consistent with this strategy, the majority of our annuity sales in the quarter did not include living benefit guarantees. Sales increased 28% and have shifted to both our structured variable annuity product and our RAVA product without living benefits. On the insurance side, life and health insurance sales increased 77% driven by our VUL product, appropriate given the current low rates.
We've also seen good response to our DI products reflecting our financial planning approach. To summarize, Ameriprise has built a differentiated book of business over many years that deliver superior financial results that are sustainable. It starts with providing clients with solutions that meet their long-term retirement needs, have appropriate benefits and generate good risk-adjusted returns for the company.
Now let me highlight why Ameriprise is clearly differentiated in financial services. In terms of our balance sheet, our capital management remains a real strength. Our Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses are performing very well in generating excellent growth, margins and returns. We compare quite favorably across the industry.
And our Retirement & Protection business is valuable and high quality, generating good free cash flow and returns. It's entirely focused on our channel and differentiated from anything else out there. Listen, we're generating some of the strongest returns in the industry and have been for quite some time, and we're able to do it with lower volatility. Importantly, we've returned capital to shareholders at very attractive levels.
In fact, we consistently return nearly all of our operating earnings to shareholders annually. And if you look at that over the last 5 years, we reduced our average weighted diluted share count by 28%. This is all while we're consistently investing in the business and maintaining a sizable excess capital position that gives us flexibility.
In closing, Ameriprise is positioned well. Our team is focused on key priorities to drive organic growth and we're delivering for our clients. In fact, I was just with our top advisers last week to recognize their achievements and discussed our growth priorities. It was terrific being together.
As I think about all of Ameriprise, it's great to have people back in the office more in-person again, as we focus on finishing the year strong.
Now Walter will review the numbers in more detail, and then we'll take your questions."

Ameriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating EPS of 38% to $5.91, excluding unlocking.

Ameriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating EPS of 38% to $5.91, excluding unlocking. In fact, we reached new record levels for revenue, pretax adjusted operating earnings and return on equity in the quarter.
We delivered strong flows, earnings growth and margin expansion in our core Wealth and Asset Management businesses. Results in the quarter are a continuation of the excellent trends we have been seeing this year as we successfully execute our growth strategies.
This is driving our business mix shift, both Wealth and Asset Management representing about 80% of earnings. Retirement & Protection performed well, and we remain focused on optimizing our risk return trade-offs in this environment. We generate robust free cash flow across all our businesses. Our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent with significant excess capital.
Combined, this allows Ameriprise to consistently return substantial capital to shareholders with 95% of adjusted operating earnings returned in the quarter, putting us on track to achieve our 90% target for the full year. Let's turn to Slide 6.
We are focused on growth in our core Wealth and Asset Management businesses, and we hit some important milestones this quarter. We are seeing excellent AUM growth of 21% to $1.2 trillion on flows and markets.
Flows in these businesses have improved substantially, up over 200% from a year ago and up nearly 140% on a year-to-date basis, representing the successful execution of our growth strategies in each of these businesses.
Let's turn to Slide 7, where you can see that we are delivering profitable organic growth.
Revenues in Wealth and Asset Management grew 23% to nearly $3 billion with pretax operating earnings of $744 million, up 44%. Importantly, earnings growth from Wealth and Asset Management outpaced revenue growth demonstrating the operating leverage of the business. And the blended margin for these 2 businesses expanded 370 basis points from last year, with Wealth Management up 320 basis points and Asset Management up 500 basis points, further illustrating our ability to deliver profitable growth.
Turning to Slide 8. This chart clearly illustrates our success executing our growth and business mix shift strategy. Specifically, the Wealth and Asset Management businesses are driving about 80% of the earnings over the past 12 months.
This is coupled with a stable $700 million contribution from Retirement & Protection Solutions. With that as an overview, let's review the individual segment performance beginning with Wealth Management on Slide 9.
The strategies we have in place to support advisers and improve their productivity using integrated industry-leading tools, technology and training has resulted in increased flows and transactional activity. Total client assets were up over 25% to $811 billion over the past 2 years.
Our adviser force continued to deliver exceptional productivity growth across market cycles. Revenue per adviser reached a new high of $766,000 in the quarter, up 24% over the past 2 years. Importantly, over the past 2 years, the annualized organic growth rate for Wealth Management flows improved to 6% compared to 4% in 2019.
This is coming from advisers penetrating their existing client base and adding new clients, complemented by recruiting experienced advisers. And we are pleased that our strategies are translating to this level of organic growth. On Page 10, you can see that we are delivering growth as well as excellent financial results in Wealth Management. In fact, revenue and earnings for Wealth Management also reached record levels this quarter.
Adjusted operating net revenues grew 23% to over $2 billion fueled by robust client flows, a 16% increase in transactional activities and market appreciation. Wealth Management pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 43% to $459 million.
Ameriprise Bank is adding to the growth in Wealth Management primarily by allowing us to pick up incremental spread and cash sweep deposits. In total, the bank has nearly $11 billion of assets after moving an additional $1.1 billion of sweep cash on to our balance sheet in the quarter.
In the quarter, the average spread on the bank assets was 144 basis points compared to off-balance sheet cash earnings of 28 basis points. In addition, we are seeing good growth in banking products, including pledged lending that has gained substantial traction with our adviser base since the product was launched in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Expenses remained well managed. G&A expense increased 1% as higher activity based expenses and performance based compensation were largely offset by expense discipline. In the quarter, our pretax adjusted operating margin was 22.4%, an increase of 320 basis points from the prior year and 100 basis points sequentially. Let's turn to Asset Management on Slide 11, where significant success is also being realized.
Over the past 2 years, asset under management increased to 18%. We also saw a net flow shift from outflows in 2019 to a 5% organic growth rate this year. As Jim mentioned, we are seeing positive flows across both retail and institutional distribution channels, supported by excellent investment performance.
And like the industry, we saw a bit of a slowdown during the summer months, though our relative position among our peers remain strong. The operating leverage in asset management is significant with margins for the trailing 12 months up 44.6%, up 830 basis points over the past 2 years.
Turning to Page 12. You see these trends generated excellent financial performance in Asset Management. Adjusted operating revenues increased 24% to $915 million, a result of the cumulative benefit of net inflows, market depreciation and performance fees. On a sequential basis, revenues grew 4%. Importantly, our fee rate remained strong and stable at 53 basis points.
Expenses remain well managed and in line with expectations given the revenue growth. G&A expenses were up 14%, primarily from compensation expense and other variable costs related to strong business performance as well as foreign exchange translation.
Pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 44% to $285 million, and we delivered a 49% margin. Moving forward, we expect strong financial performance to continue, and anticipate that margins will remain in the mid-40% range over the near term, driven by the continued flow momentum and equity markets at these levels.
As Jim mentioned, we are on track to close the BMO EMEA transaction in the fourth quarter. This acquisition will add significant capabilities from a strategic perspective and drive improved business fundamentals going forward.
Let's turn to Page 13. Retirement & Protection Solutions continued to reflect excellent underlying business performance, differentiated risk profile and a continued generation of substantial free cash flow.
Pretax adjusted operating earnings were $192 million, excluding unlocking, down from $206 million a year ago. Current year results reflect lower profitability from increased sales levels, whereas results in the prior year benefited from lower sales as well as lower surrenders and withdrawals.
In total, unlocking impacts in the quarter were immaterial resulting from consistent client behavior and interest rates that were in line with prior year estimates. We saw a strong pickup in sales of Retirement & Protection products in the quarter with a continued mix shift towards non-guaranteed retirement products.
During the quarter, the variable annuity sales increased 28% from last year, with 72% of sales and products without living benefit guarantees. Account value with living benefits represent only 62% of the overall book now, down another 200 basis points in the past year. We had similar trends in protection with sales up 77% driven by higher margin VUL sales.
This mix in sales and account values for both Retirement & Protection products are expected to continue.
Additionally, in the appendix of this presentation, we have provided our annual update on long-term care business. You will observe that the business continues to perform in line with expectations from a claims perspective. The policy count continues to decline as the book ages, and we are garnering additional premium rate increases.
Now approximately 90% of the book has extensive or substantial credible experience. And I will note that we did not incorporate recent improvements in mortality and morbidity related to COVID-19 into our long-term assumptions. Overall, our actual performance continues to be in line with expectations.
Let's turn to Slide 14. In the quarter, you have seen transactions announced in insurance and annuity space. In light of these announcements, I felt it will be helpful to provide additional context as it relates to how we view our business.
As Jim has indicated, we believe our I&A business is a highly valuable asset with a client solution-driven capability that has generated sustainable and predictable financial results, and free cash flow generation, coupled with a low risk profile.
The driver of this is our prudent approach in building all aspects of this business, resulting in a proven track record of superior value creation. The behavior of our clients has been consistent, reflecting the nature of the product sale as part of the financial plan.
We have taken a conservative approach to product features, including guarantees and crediting rates as well as requiring asset allocation for living benefits. We have maintained consistent sales level and industry market share over the last decade, avoiding the arms race seen from time to time in the industry. And our economic hedging program has performed well across market cycles with 97% effectiveness over the past 5 years. Finally, we have taken prudent and appropriate actions to manage the risk profile of the business.
For example, we stopped sales of LTC in 2002 and have successfully implemented premium rate actions and increased protection with our LTC reinsurance partner. We also sold our Auto & Home business, reinsured our fixed annuity businesses and have reduced living benefit sales. This consistent and prudent approach has resulted in a stable earnings with 24% margins and a pretax return on capital exceeding 50% with consistent free cash flow generation.
Our balance sheet fundamentals are strong with a high-quality investment portfolio and strong risk-based capital ratio. This performance is best-in-class in the industry over many years. We have demonstrated superior return on capital, dividends paid and capital ratios. And our net amount at risk is substantially lower than peers.
In summary, this is a very valuable business and we are well positioned. It is now only 20% of our earnings. We have demonstrated that the exposure profile is well managed, and we completed our annual unlocking with very minor updates. With that being said, we will continue to evaluate options from a position of strength to make the best decisions to drive all aspects of shareholder value creation. Now let's move to the balance sheet, another area we have delivered strong results.
Our balance sheet fundamentals and risk management capability are cornerstones of what we do. It starts with how we manage the business to generate substantial free cash flow in each of our segments. We had holding company available liquidity of $3.7 billion and excess capital of $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter.
We prudently manage credit risk where we maintain an overall AA- credit quality in our investment portfolio and have a highly effective hedge strategy. These strong fundamentals allow us to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders.
As I mentioned, we returned 95% of earnings to shareholders in the quarter, and we are on track to hit our 90% target for the full year. We have executed our capital return consistently over the years. Our share count declined 28% over the past 5 years, even with issuing shares to fund the share-based compensation programs. Over the past year alone, the share count declined 5%.
In summary, strong fundamentals across our businesses deliver substantial free cash flow. We manage the balance sheet conservatively, and we have substantial liquidity and capital flexibility. Combined, these attributes position us to continue delivering a differentiated level of capital return to shareholders going forward. With that, we will take your questions."

So we do see we have a substantial room to grow as we take deposits. Right now, they're in the $11 billion range, to be -- increasing that by at least $2 billion to $3 billion, as we move forward into the years and evaluate the situation.
It gives us certainly yield pickup from that standpoint and gives diversity. As it relates to the underlying assets, we are seeing a tremendous success as we look at our pledged loan activity and margin loan activity, which, of course, is in the broker deal. But -- and the other actives, we are investing to build that.

So we feel like what we've made is good investments there. Training and development is really starting to show its fruits. In regard to the external recruitment, that has picked up again, which we did as we moved from the virtual back to in-person. We're seeing good advisers join us, good quality books.
And we feel like we have a good opportunity as people better understand the type of capabilities that we offer, the brand support that we provide as well as the recognition that we're getting there from a client perspective for trust in regard to our brand. And that's very important. And we see that both in the adviser and employee channel, the franchisee, but as well in the FIG channel.

But we actually see that, with the economy starting to bounce back, the pandemic starting to get a bit less impactful, that we should start to see a bit more pickup there, but that was the weak spot in EMEA. But overall, it did improve over the course of the year.
Now on the institutional side, we've seen good inflows in EMEA, and in certain of the mandates as well as in the U.K., we've gotten a big mandate there as well. So we see the institutional being a little firmer in that regard versus the wholesaler intermediate at this point."

And we figured that by giving you more information, someone would read something into it different than someone else. So let me try to clarify that, and what we try to do there.
We've seen the transactions, as Walter said, come out to market, and people starting to realize that our book is a bit better than what they've seen out there. And very clearly, we think it is significantly better. In that regard, the business is less than 20% of our total today.
It is very well managed. It generates very strong returns and cash flows. And so the first thing I would convey to you as an investor and as an analyst is that it does not detract from our business. It provides the level of diversity, it actually gives us strong cash flows that we use for buyback as a compliment towards free cash flows we generate in the other businesses. So it doesn't, in any way, have a draw on capital.
And that it's been very steady and consistent with excellent returns on the overall capital that's deployed there. So one thing we would bring to highlight is, as we hold the business, it should not be a discount or an overhang on us, is the first thing.
The second thing we would clearly say, just like we've sold the Auto & Home, we reinsured part of the book, we've diverted our sales from activities that don't give us really good strong returns. We're very open to continue to explore strategic opportunities with the book, either reinsurance of aspects or even the sale of certain of the businesses or total.
But as long as it makes sense from a strategic perspective, supports our clients and we can generate reasonable value for that, we think it's a good operating business. It's really a great client-oriented business. It really has great distribution capabilities as part of our solution set.
So it might be a great opportunity, strategically, for us to evaluate, but we wanted to be clear that this is not a discounted book that we must get rid of for whatever reason because it doesn't detract from us. And in fact, it shouldn't be a discount to the business today as we hold it.
But if someone was or we evaluated strategically, it made sense, I would tell you it's a valued business that should be of a valued price."

And so over the course of the year again, we have more than 10 different disciplines that are adding over $1 billion of flows too.
