I'll begin this morning with an overview of fourth quarter and full year results and drivers of performance and share some thoughts on 2021. Collin will take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. 
Our fourth quarter and fiscal year results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $5 billion, 11% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of 1 fewer business day in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019 and up 10.7% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 13.3% to $881 million. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $376 million, an increase of 9.9%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, 16.1% above last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant currency. For the year, net sales were $18.5 billion, up nearly $0.5 billion year-over-year or 2.4% on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross profit increased 5.6% to $3.2 billion. Non-GAAP operating income increased [ 2.6% ] to $1.4 billion and non-GAAP net income per share increased 8% on a reported and constant currency basis to $6.59. 
2020 was an extraordinary year. I'm very proud of how the CDW team quickly and smartly adapted to help our customers and partners during a challenging time. The diversity of our solutions portfolio and customer end markets served us well in 2020, providing balance and driving our exceptional results. 
During the year, our team helps customers across the full IT solution stack in the full IT life cycle from client devices to cloud from design to managed services We executed against our strategy and continued to invest in high-growth solutions and services capabilities, including 3 acquisitions: IGNW, a leading provider of cloud-native service expertise and software development capabilities; and [indiscernible] and Southern Dakota Solutions, which expanded our ServiceNow team. 
Performance for our customer end markets varied. Demand increased in some and decreased in others, but all experience change or disruption to their technology needs and to their operations last year due to COVID-19. Our value proposition resonated with customers. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and logistical and distribution capabilities to deliver the best outcomes for our customers. This led to meaningful outperformance compared to the U.S. IT market. We emerged from 2020 stronger and even more committed to executing our strategy. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. We continue to help customers with remote enablement and resource optimization, cost reduction, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. Similar to the third quarter, some customers resumed solutions projects and others started new projects. Performance for our most impacted customer end markets improved, and trends for our more resilient customer end markets remained strong. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges and support our customers, in particular, for Chromebooks for K-12 customers where demand greatly outstrip supply. 
Now let's take a deeper look at fourth quarter customer end-market performance. Corporate declined 11% with similar levels of performance for transactions and solutions. In total, there was improvement versus the last 2 quarters. Customer spend for corporate customers is not uniform. Some customers were doing well and investing in technology, whereas other customers, those who are in challenged industries or geographies who were impacted by spikes and coverages, were still cautious. 
Small Business declined mid-single digits as notebooks returned to growth. Small Business customers tend to be more nimble than Corporate customers, which drove the improvement versus the third quarter. 
The Government team increased net sales 30%. Federal delivered another excellent quarter with net sales up strong double digits. During the quarter, our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau was mostly completed. All devices were return to us for decommissioning, and we started the process to resell the clean units through third-party remarketers. Our team did an excellent job with this program. It was a multiyear effort to develop and execute this large complex undertaking, moving the nation's once-a-decade population count from paper to digital for the first time. Our services and logistical capabilities and multi-vendor solutions set us apart from the competition. We are unique in what we can deliver to our customers. 
Outside of the Census project, the federal team continued to help civilian agencies with remote enablement and device refresh. We also delivered on Department of Defense projects that were awarded at the end of the third quarter. The state and local team delivered strong double-digit growth. IT investments continued to be a priority despite budget pressure. Our team helps customers enable remote capabilities and restart solution projects. 
Education increased in extraordinary 140%, driven by phenomenal growth in K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access and remote learning, which drove triple-digit growth for notebooks related to -- related accessories and solutions as customers turn to us for holistic capabilities. Higher education increased low double digits as schools continued to help students with remote enablement and resumed net comp projects with a focus on creating connected communities to enhance the student experience. 
Healthcare declined mid-teens, a meaningful improvement compared to the third quarter. Customers continued to be cautious with their spend due to ongoing budget pressure, focusing on key areas like remote enablement, telehealth and support infrastructure. 
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, was flat on a reported basis. U.K. net sales increased mid-single digits in constant currency, and Canada net sales decreased low double digits in constant currency. Performance for both markets was driven by strong education demand to enable remote learning and health care spending to address the pandemic with softer corporate performance. 
In the U.K., there was some pull-in up customer demand before the announcement of the agreement with the EU as customers prepared for a potential hard exit. Over the last several weeks, the U.K. team has executed against its well-planned Brexit mitigation strategy and has done a great job helping customers navigate through the complexity of the new agreement. 
Our fourth quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers across all categories. Hardware was up strong double digits driven by excellent notebook growth, in particular for our public segment customers, leading to over 30% client device growth. While software was flat, software gross profit increased mid-teens, reflecting continued [ growth ] into Software-as-a-Service. 
Services grew low double digits, driven by device decommission services for the Census project and configuration services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. Transactions increased strong double digits. Solutions declined low single digits as some customers continued to restore infrastructure and larger project engagement. 
The team delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in collaboration, infrastructure as a service, security and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue. 
Let me also share a little more color on our security practice, given its importance to our customers as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double digits as customers improve their security framework to respond to increasing threat. Last year, customers spent $2 billion with us on security. 
Our fourth quarter and full year operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy. They are important drivers of our path and our future performance. 
The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. As I've shared, the balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in current environment. 
And the final driver of our performance, our 3-part strategy for growth is, first, to acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share a few examples of our strategy and action and how we helped customers last quarter. 
Our Small Business team helped the born-in-the-cloud financial technology company add more agility and flexibility to its operations and technology stack by becoming multi-cloud. The customer initially came to our team requesting help to implement a backup solution for its existing public cloud provider. After a review by our digital velocity team, our team uncover the need for the customer to become multi-cloud with additional capabilities and redundancies. Our team helped the customer build a secure second public cloud environment and address additional needs, including application development, functionality and consumption management. Our team has established CDW as a trusted partner with expensive cloud capabilities to help with research, evaluation, procurement, implementation and management. Our customers are increasingly adopting cloud but are also finding a [indiscernible] need to become multi-cloud. CDW's cloud expertise and cloud management platform across the multi public clouds are a differentiator in the marketplace. 
Let me share another story in health care sector. To address COVID, health care customers have turned to CDW to provide care in new settings and in new ways. An independent nonprofit health care provider in the U.S. Northeast needed our guidance to enable remote COVID testing and vaccine distribution in numerous outdoor locations. The CDW account manager engaged 1 of our networking specialists to develop a solution that would deliver the required performance and scale quickly. The solution has since been rolled out to all locations and in next work with the customer on the site's wireless connectivity further leveraging our technical resources and strengthening their relationship. Our team saved the customer time and energy and provided great service as a forward-thinking partner that the customer can trust. The pandemic has created new issues requiring creative solutions and leading customers to rely on us more than ever as an extension of their team. This is the value that CDW brings to our customers. We pair our broad solutions portfolio with our deep technical expertise to deliver the full outcomes that customers [ feed ]. 
Finally, the digital divide has created significant learning challenges around the world. Our teams have worked closely with education customers in the U.S., in the U.K. and in Canada to tackle this challenge. 
In the U.K., we are working with the London [ Grace ] To Learning, a charitable trust dedicated to the advancement of education to provide technology for hundreds of schools across the country. Last quarter, our team developed and provisioned unique turnkey solutions comprised of client devices, accessories, software and services, leveraging our strong logistical and distribution capabilities and deep vendor relationships. There has been tight collaboration with our clients' vendor partner to provide the best possible device availability for the customer due to the current global Chromebook's buy constraint. Our distribution center in the U.K. has done a tremendous job to deliver over 100,000 units to date to hundreds of schools. CDW is uniquely positioned to deliver for our customers and our vendor partners. This is a great example of our critical role. 
These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the success of investments in cloud, our strong relationships with customers and vendors and the importance of our competitive advantages. I am proud of the way our team continues to deliver. 
Let me briefly update you now on our COVID response efforts. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have followed 3 key principles: First, safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers; second, serve the mission-driven needs of our customers; and third, support our communities. I'm proud of how the team has managed the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Teams at our distribution and configuration centers have done an outstanding job maintaining the high level of customer service we are known for, while adhering to new protocols that safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers who come to work every day. 
We have also taken deliberate actions to foster collaboration and coworker engagement and to maintain connectivity and productivity to preserve and bolster our culture even while we are distant. These actions include leveraging new tools and learning and development opportunities, expanded health and well-being programs, increased content from our business resource groups and compensation investment to recognize the team's tremendous efforts and performance. 
Now let me share some thoughts on 2021. The near-term global health and macroeconomic environment is still uncertain. Our current outlook is for the U.S. IT market to return to growth and grow between 2.5% and 3%. As you know, we hold ourselves accountable for growing faster than the IT market, and we expect our top line in 2021 to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. 
There are many wildcards, though, including COVID-19 government restrictions and vaccine rollout; policies from the new administration, including stimulus programs and tax changes; and supply constraints, in particular, for Chromebooks. We are encouraged about our Q1 performance to date and how our teams are executing, but we are also cautious about the macro environment. 
Even though uncertainty continues, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Last year, we went through our rigorous strategic planning process as we do every 3 years, and we are now accelerating investment and execution against it. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners to enhance our competitive position and to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. This confidence has led our Board of Directors to increase our share repurchase authorization by $1.25 billion. 
Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best: Leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives; and of course, out-execute the competition. 
Now Colin will share more details on our financial performance. Collin?"

I'm going to provide more detail on fourth quarter and full year results, capital allocation priorities and initial thoughts on 2021. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 9. Consolidated net sales were $5",2252,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on fourth quarter and full year results, capital allocation priorities and initial thoughts on 2021. 
Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 9. Consolidated net sales were $5 billion, up 9.2% on a reported basis and 11% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 less selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 7.6% versus the third quarter. This was higher than historical seasonality of a mid-single-digit decline, primarily due to how COVID-19 is impacting our channels differently. During this uncertain time, seasonality has been, and is expected to continue to be, different than historical experience. 
Our customer channels generally performed consistent with the demand writings commentary shared on our last earnings call other than K-12, where demand was even stronger than expected. Pockets of supply constraints continued in the quarter, primarily for lower-end client devices such as Chromebooks. Our team did a great job navigating the fluid environment and leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure a healthy share of supply for customers. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $881 million, an increase of 13.3%. Gross margin was 17.8%, up 70 basis points over last year. The gross margin expansion was driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. 
Turning to SG&A on Slide 10. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 15.9%. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll costs due to higher gross profit and compensation investments in our coworkers to recognize and reward their tremendous efforts and performance in 2020; the acquisition of IGNW, an ongoing investment in Aptris; and COVID-19 expenses to safeguard and compensate frontline coworkers, partially offset by continued cost savings measures, including decreased travel and entertainment. 
Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was 9,982, up 2 from the third quarter. Year-over-year, coworker count increased 86, driven by an increase of approximately 150 customer-facing coworkers, including IGNW, partially offset by a decrease in noncustomer-facing coworker count. 
GAAP operating income was $332 million, up 17.1%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $376 million, up 9.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%. 
Moving to Slide 11. Interest expense was $37 million, down 2.9%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from the August refinancing. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on Slide 12 was 19.2%. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $57 million compared to $50 million last year. 
To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.2%, down 150 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with new regulations for global intangible low tax income and nondeductible expenses, partially offset by lower tax credits. 
As you can see on Slide 14, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 145 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.65, up 29.6%. Our non-GAAP net income was $264 million in the quarter, up 15%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, up 16.1% from last year. 
Turning to our full year results on Slides 15 through 20. Revenue was $18.5 billion, an increase of 2.4%. Gross profit was $3.2 billion, up 5.6%. Gross profit margin was 17.4%, up 50 basis points, driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. 
Before moving down the rest of the P&L, I want to take a moment to put 2020 sales and gross profit in context. We have consistently highlighted the power of our diverse portfolio and customer end markets. We pivot to where the growth is, leveraging our competitive advantages to better serve customers and gain share. In 2020, we estimate the U.S. IT market declined low single digits, call it down 2%. CDW net sales grew 440 basis points faster, and gross profit grew 760 basis points faster than the 2% market decline. Census contributed 170 basis points of year-over-year net sales growth. Excluding the Census, CDW still delivered meaningful net sales and gross profit growth in excess of market. During the 2009 recession, our net sales premium narrowed as customers paused on hardware purchases, and gross profit margin compressed due to product margin pressure in the competitive environment. In 2020, our portfolio performed differently, partially because of the unique dynamics of the pandemic but also because of the progress we've made building out the solution and services capabilities our customers value. 
For example, while U.S. software and services collectively totaled 18% of U.S. net sales in 2020, they accounted for approximately 40% of U.S. gross profit. 
Returning to the full year P&L. Operating income was $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, up 2.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, down 120 basis points versus last year's rate. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to new regulations for global intangible low tax income and nondeductible expenses that are not expected to contribute as much of a benefit to the tax rate in 2021. 
Net income was $789 million and non-GAAP net income was $954 million, up 5.8%. Non-GAAP net  income per share was $6.59, up 8%. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 21. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion, and net debt was $2.5 billion. Liquidity further strengthened with cash-plus-revolver availability of approximately $2.5 billion. 
Full year free cash flow was $1.2 billion, as shown on Slide 22, and This equates to 6.7% of sales, well above our historical free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25%. A portion of the outperformance was driven by timing or onetime items, including mixing into vendors with extended payment terms, the Census, deferred payroll and U.K. tax payments and the timing of collections from some large customers. We expect the favorable timing to reverse over the next few quarters. 
Moving to Slide 23. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down 1 day from last year's fourth quarter. DSO and DIO were unchanged from last year, while DPO increased by 1 day. The increase in DPO was primarily driven by mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. 
As previously mentioned, we resumed our share buyback program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of stock. For full year 2020, we returned $561 million to shareholders, including $220 million of dividends and $341 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $129 per share. 
Turning to capital allocation priorities on Slide 24. Given our strong liquidity position, our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the year at 1.7x. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 2 small ServiceNow solution practices to build on the success from our 2019 acquisition of Aptris. We remain active evaluating targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. 
Going forward, we expect to move closer to our target net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash return to shareholders. We expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. At the end of December, we had $338 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As Chris mentioned, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.25 billion increase to the share repurchase program in support of our capital allocation priorities. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. 
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 25. The current environment continues to be highly uncertain, making it challenging to forecast expectations for IT market growth with a high degree of confidence. Therefore, we are providing a base case for 2021 IT market growth and how we expect CDW's business to perform in that environment. 
Our base case assumes U.S. IT market growth between 2.5% to 3%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than market. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 50 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. 
In terms of performance by segment for the year, there continues to be uncertainty among customers across end markets, but here are some drivers to consider. 
On the commercial side of the business, Corporate and Small Business customers tend to respond quicker to the macroeconomic environment. We saw that last year, Q1 was the strongest quarter, then Q2 experienced the steepest decline with quarterly declines moderating thereafter. We expect the timing and slope of the rebound in 2021 to be closely tied to customer confidence, which will be a function of the macroeconomic environment and success containing the virus. 
Moving to Public. We expect continued success supporting Department of Defense and civilian agencies. However, Government is not expected to fully make up the loss of the Census project, which contributed a total of approximately 230 basis points of net sales to CDW in 2020. Education growth is expected to be strong earlier in the year, with sales above historical seasonality and then decelerate throughout the year due to overlaps in the unusual seasonality experienced in 2020. 
Chromebook supply continued to be a wildcard. 
Healthcare overlaps are tougher in the first half as customer demand spiked at the beginning of the pandemic and then comparison [ feeds ] in the second half. The timing and slope of a rebound in 2021 is linked to budget clarity, which we expect to be a function of success containing the virus and potential stimulus support. 
Finally, our international businesses are more weighted to Corporate customers, so the pace of recovery will be driven by the macro environments in the U.K. and Canada. 
Moving down the P&L. Assuming IT market growth of 2.5% to 3%, we expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range and non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be in the mid- to high single digits, call it 6.5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the following below the operating line assumptions: One, a modest decline in interest expense to the mid- to high 140s. Two, a non-GAAP effective tax rate at the low end of our typical 25.5% to 26.5% range, assuming current tax rates. The low end of the range is approximately 150 basis points higher than 2020's 24% rate, creating a headwind of over 200 basis points on earnings per share growth. Three, contribution from share repurchases with non-GAAP earnings per share growing approximately 200 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. 
Currency is expected to contribute approximately 40 basis points to reported earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization can be found on Page 26. 
Turning to the first quarter. Historically, the Q4 to Q1 sequential decline on an average daily sales basis has averaged down approximately 7%. We expect this year's first quarter sequential decline to be down high single digits more than historical seasonality, primarily due to Census and Mississippi Department of Education. On a year-over-year average daily sales basis, this equates to mid-single-digit growth reflecting continued education and government strength, improving commercial trends, partially offset by the overlap of the March 2020 work-from-home surge. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be a couple of hundred basis points higher than the full year EPS outlook as we overlap last year's increase in the credit loss reserve, partially offset by having 1 fewer selling day, which adversely impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. This is timing, and we will recoup the day in the fourth quarter. January segment trends are generally in line with my commentary on first quarter expectations. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 27. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged to 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. 
Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. We expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. We believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. 
As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cree to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

There is a little bit of a give back on the sales comp line because we pay on gross profit dollars. I think, Katy, from a secular perspective, our expectation is consistent with yours that we would expect netted-down items in software and services to grow faster than the balance of the business. I think we're just a little careful though of trying to understand where we are in the cycle and whether a hardware refresh is coming and if it is coming, how strong it could be. So I think that's something to keep in mind as you think about that netted-down mix and the impact it has on gross margin going forward, at least over the next several quarters. 
I think the other thing to think through on the margin and then the flow-through to NOI margin is we did benefit from really an exceptional product margin in 2020. And I think some of that was due to the unique dynamics of the supply environment as well as the premium that customers were placing on speed. And so I think that's just also another thing to keep in mind as we think about gross margin going forward. Now again, I think those are probably more cyclical than secular, but something to think about."

So on a relative basis, we always expect ourselves to do better. And when you think about the combination of our competitive advantages, you saw them in play really in one of the hardest periods in history in 2020. So we are confident that the advantages that we bring to the market will position us and allow us to continue to outperform a [ pit ] to where our customers need us and grow faster than the market. 
When I think about headwinds and tailwinds going into 2020, certainly, think about remote work and remote everything. And that has certainly been driving growth in 2020 and should continue to do so into 2021, that we've got some very significant compares, as you all know, because of the first quarter of last year, because of the timing of the Education [ at ] the end of this past year in census. But it will still continue to be a trend, we believe. Everyone will not be billing straight back to work, and we think it will be a work-from-everywhere kind of situation. 
We also believe that this digital acceleration is just going to continue. And so our strength across the full stack. And when I say full stack, I mean cloud services, software and hardware plays very well with our customers because customers are always full stack, and they're looking for a full solution. So as they think about combined multi-vendor, multi component solutions, so you use a great partner for them. And we can take them from the very front end of advising and designing to building, implementing, integrating, orchestrating and managing. And I'll tell you, it seems that 2020 has really propelled customers to look for that value-added, one-stop shop trusted IT provider that can do the full spectrum across the whole life cycle. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our customers. 
On the federal side, I think you asked about specifically the Department of Defense and civilian. We expect to continue to maintain pretty strong. Look, on the commercial side on Small Business and Corporate, I'll tell you as Colin said, the speed and the slope of any recovery is tied to confidence, which is tied to the macro, which is tied to the virus. It's all tied together. So that's very hard to predict. But we've been staying so close to our customers during 2020 that we feel absolutely confident that we will be well positioned to help them on their way up and to capture growth as they're growing. 
On the Government side, stimulus is another wildcard out there. And under the new administration, if we see some stronger stimulus, that should also help to support on the Education, Healthcare and state and local side."

So while we've gone back into lockdown, it does feel like -- it feels like customers are used to working that way and are still buying in the areas where they have needs like remote work -- optimizing remote work, et cetera. So we haven't seen a significant impact any different than we would have seen in 2020. And we're managing this really quite well at this point. 
In terms of M&A, yes, look, we never really pinpoint where we're going to be -- what we're going to be doing, but you know we're focused on geographic expansion as well as expanding our capabilities, our technology capabilities. So we continue to look. We continue to be very active. I doubt there's a deal out there that doesn't get to CDW store to see, but we also have our screens that we need to adhere to, which are the cultural and operating match, the financial match and the strategic match. So we'll continue to look.

And whether that be in the client hardware refresh area, whether it be in building out cloud capabilities, we're able to go in either direction. And we're just staying very close to our customers working with them literally day by day, week by week and supporting them in their technology needs. 
Certainly, technology is more essential than ever. We don't see any of the trends slowing down, frankly. We might see some things prolonged as a result of the pandemic, and the vaccine don't go as we all hope. But at the end of the day, it's a mix, and it's really quite hard to tell. 
I know that's not a great answer to the question of what it comprises, but it's very hard to know given the unprecedented uncertainty that we still have.

And that's where we're able to bring a great deal of value to the customer and the planning, particularly in a world where things are changing so quickly and plans that had been expected and in place 4, 5, 12 months ago are moving, and we're very well positioned to help them with that. So it's both customers, new and existing. And we do expect to continue to see growth there. 
I would note that on the -- you asked about existing customers and migrating to the cloud. One of the interesting things that I know you're aware of, that it's not just migrating to the cloud, but it's also some customers who are already cloud and becoming multi-cloud. So multi public cloud, other customers who are -- have some public cloud capabilities that they need to almost mirror that on-prem. So it's the whole -- I'll call it the cloud environment, the whole ecosystem that our teams are able to support customers with now. Again, which is a real advantage because it's bringing the customer the best for the customer and not just some narrow product category that we sell.

I would say what we do is we really hone where we're focusing our energy and investments to evolve the business as technology evolves. And where we're focusing now are those areas in strategic services and solutions that our customers need. 
You heard me mention full stack is a way that we go to market and investments in the capabilities across that full stack, such as cloud solutions, cloud services, software solutions and services in particular, security and then obviously, our hardware. 
I think about a couple of recent acquisitions, [ Scaler ] and IGNW, as excellent examples of that strategy in action where we invested in cloud and DevOps capabilities and ServiceNow capabilities, and those are the areas that customers are needing advisers. 
The other area that you can think about that we're investing in is our talent and digital in particular. So our technology, our own technology, we kind of put the mirror on ourselves and made some decisions about what we need as an organization. And we're investing in our own technical capabilities, but also those digital tools that we've talked about in the past for sellers. I think you've heard us talk about AMANDA. We have a number of other tools in the pipeline that allow our sellers in our digital platform, our e-commerce platform to work for our customer in a really integrated, seamless intelligent way. And that's what we're going for. 
And then obviously, we're also reviewing our operating model as we always do, but even what was more [ does to ], I would say, now to really remove those things that we -- that are inefficiencies and recoup where we can and then reimagine critical elements for a digital world and then reinvest back in the business. So investing in technology, also investing in talent. 
We talked last quarter about a reduction in our workforce, but a reduction was also to open up capacity for those rules and capabilities that we need, and we have been investing in people there.

I will say that we did see some budget flush at the end of the year, which felt like a good thing.

So if we can get that under control and we can stem the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and I think we'll see it recover more quickly and maybe with a very healthy slope given the importance of technology. If we don't see that, I think we're going to see more muted growth over a longer period of time. Certainly, the stimulus is yet another wildcard, which can help in the areas that we've mentioned, education, state and local, et cetera, and can, of course, help get that positive momentum going with the consumer, which ultimately impacts the businesses. But I just think the dynamics of this environment and the pandemic make it incredibly difficult to predict timing and float. 
Again, the beautiful thing is the diversity of our end markets allows us to make sure that we are where the growth is and able to support our customers wherever they need us better than anyone."

It's really important to understand that what was happening here was a great focus on equity and assets for students and student success. And therefore, schools were looking to get full holistic outcomes solutions to their schools with a lot of speed. And not a lot of providers could do that because they needed to get in the hands of the students quite quickly. 
And so when you look at the tremendous success our team had in K-12, it is because of the capabilities that they're able to bring together and literally get turnkey solutions to the schools in a timely fashion. And it's because of the relationships we have with our vendors to make sure we're getting a healthy proportion of the supply out there, which was really constrained. So I would say a couple of things. 
Number one, the timing, the seasonality was different because of the great urgency schools have. Number two, our execution was just extraordinary. And I want to say that loud and clear because it seems to be an extraordinary job. We have some backlog going into the first quarter of the next year, which will certainly benefit us in the first quarter. And then one would expect that going into the back half of next year, we'll get back to more, I guess, normal seasonality in K-12. But it's a confluence of both the demand and our capabilities and an unbelievable execution by the team."

Collin will take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. 
Our fourth quarter and fiscal year results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $5 billion, 11% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of 1 fewer business day in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019 and up 10.7% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 13.3% to $881 million. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $376 million, an increase of 9.9%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, 16.1% above last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant currency. For the year, net sales were $18.5 billion, up nearly $0.5 billion year-over-year or 2.4% on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross profit increased 5.6% to $3.2 billion. Non-GAAP operating income increased 2.6 (sic) [ 2.7 ]% to $1.4 billion and non-GAAP net income per share increased 8% on a reported and constant currency basis to $6.59. 
2020 was an extraordinary year. I'm very proud of how the CDW team quickly and smartly adapted to help our customers and partners during a challenging time. The diversity of our solutions portfolio and customer end markets served us well in 2020, providing balance and driving our exceptional results. 
During the year, our team helped customers across the full IT solution stack in the full IT life cycle, from client devices to cloud, from design to managed services. We executed against our strategy and continued to invest in high-growth solutions and services capabilities, including 3 acquisitions: IGNW, a leading provider of cloud-native service expertise and software development capabilities; and [ Arazing ] and Southern Dakota Solutions, which expanded our ServiceNow team. 
Performance for our customer end markets varied. Demand increased in some and decreased in others, but all experienced change or disruption to their technology needs and to their operations last year due to COVID-19. Our value proposition resonated with customers. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and logistical and distribution capabilities to deliver the best outcomes for our customers. This led to meaningful outperformance compared to the U.S. IT market. We emerged from 2020 stronger and even more committed to executing our strategy. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. We continue to help customers with remote enablement and resource optimization, cost reduction, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. Similar to the third quarter, some customers resumed solutions projects and others started new projects. Performance for our most impacted customer end markets improved, and trends for our more resilient customer end markets remained strong. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges and support our customers; in particular, for Chromebooks for K-12 customers where demand greatly outstripped supply. 
Now let's take a deeper look at fourth quarter customer end-market performance. Corporate declined 11% with similar levels of performance for transactions and solutions. In total, there was an improvement versus the last 2 quarters. Customer spend for corporate customers was not uniform. Some customers were doing well and investing in technology, whereas other customers, those who are in challenged industries or geographies who were impacted by spikes in COVID cases, were still cautious. 
Small Business declined mid-single digits as notebooks returned to growth. Small Business customers tend to be more nimble than Corporate customers, which drove the improvement versus the third quarter. 
The Government team increased net sales 30%. Federal delivered another excellent quarter with net sales up strong double digits. During the quarter, our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau was mostly completed. All devices were returned to us for decommissioning, and we started the process to resell the clean units through third-party remarketers. Our team did an excellent job with this program. It was a multiyear effort to develop and execute this large complex undertaking, moving the nation's once-a-decade population count from paper to digital for the first time. Our services and logistical capabilities and multi-vendor solutions set us apart from the competition. We are unique in what we can deliver to our customers. 
Outside of the Census project, the federal team continued to help civilian agencies with remote enablement and device refresh. We also delivered on Department of Defense projects that were awarded at the end of the third quarter. The state and local team delivered strong double-digit growth. IT investments continued to be a priority despite budget pressure. Our team helped customers enable remote capabilities and restart solutions projects. 
Education increased an extraordinary 140%, driven by phenomenal growth in K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access and remote learning, which drove triple-digit growth for notebooks, related accessories and solutions as customers turned to us for holistic capabilities. Higher education increased low double digits, as schools continued to help students with remote enablement and resumed [ net comm ] projects with a focus on creating connected communities to enhance the student experience. 
Healthcare declined mid-teens, a meaningful improvement compared to the third quarter. Customers continued to be cautious with their spend due to ongoing budget pressure, focusing on key areas like remote enablement, telehealth and support infrastructure. 
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, was flat on a reported basis. U.K. net sales increased mid-single digits in constant currency, and Canada net sales decreased low double digits in constant currency. Performance for both markets was driven by strong education demand to enable remote learning and health care spending to address the pandemic with softer corporate performance. 
In the U.K., there was some pull-in of customer demand before the announcement of the agreement with the EU, as customers prepared for a potential hard exit. Over the last several weeks, the U.K. team has executed against its well-planned Brexit mitigation strategy and has done a great job helping customers navigate through the complexity of the new agreement. 
Our fourth quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers across all categories. Hardware was up strong double digits driven by excellent notebook growth, in particular for our public segment customers, leading to over 30% client device growth. While software was flat, software gross profit increased mid-teens, reflecting continued mix into Software-as-a-Service. 
Services grew low double digits, driven by device decommission services for the Census project and configuration services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. Transactions increased strong double digits. Solutions declined low single digits as some customers continued to restore infrastructure and larger project engagement. 
The team delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in collaboration, infrastructure as a service, security and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue. 
Let me also share a little more color on our security practice, given its importance to our customers as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double digits as customers improved their security framework to respond to increasing threats. Last year, customers spent $2 billion with us on security. 
Our fourth quarter and full year operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy. They are important drivers of our past and our future performance. 
The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. As I've shared, the balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in current environments. 
And the final driver of our performance, our 3-part strategy for growth is, first, to acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action and how we helped customers last quarter. 
Our Small Business team helped a born-in-the-cloud financial technology company add more agility and flexibility to its operations and technology stack by becoming multi-cloud. The customer initially came to our team requesting help to implement a backup solution for its existing public cloud provider. After a review by our digital velocity team, our team uncovered a need for the customer to become multi-cloud with additional capabilities and redundancies. Our team helped the customer build a secure second public cloud environment and address additional needs, including application development functionality and consumption management. Our team has established CDW as a trusted partner with extensive cloud capabilities to help with research, evaluation, procurement, implementation and management. Our customers are increasingly adept in cloud but are also finding a growing need to become multi-cloud. CDW's cloud expertise and cloud management platform across multi public clouds are a differentiator in the marketplace. 
Let me share another story in the health care sector. To address COVID, health care customers have turned to CDW to provide care in new settings and in new ways. An independent nonprofit health care provider in the U.S. Northeast needed our guidance to enable remote COVID testing and vaccine distribution in numerous outdoor locations. The CDW account manager engaged 1 of our networking specialists to develop a solution that would deliver the required performance and scale quickly. The solution has since been rolled out to all locations and we next work with the customer on the site's wireless connectivity, further leveraging our technical resources and strengthening the relationship. Our team saved the customer time and energy and provided great service as a forward-thinking partner who the customer can trust. The pandemic has created new issues requiring creative solutions, and leading customers to rely on us more than ever as an extension of their team. This is the value that CDW brings to our customers. We pair our broad solutions portfolio with our deep technical expertise to deliver the full outcomes that customers [ can  seize ].
Finally, the digital divide has created significant learning challenges around the world. Our teams have worked closely with education customers in the U.S., in the U.K. and in Canada to tackle this challenge. 
In the U.K., we are working with the London Grid For Learning, a charitable trust dedicated to the advancement of education, to provide technology for hundreds of schools across the country. Last quarter, our team developed and provisioned unique turnkey solutions comprised of client devices, accessories, software and services, leveraging our strong logistical and distribution capabilities and deep vendor relationships. There has been tight collaboration with our client's vendor partner to provide the best possible device availability for the customer due to the current Google Chromebook supply constraint. Our distribution center in the U.K. has done a tremendous job to deliver over 100,000 units to date to hundreds of schools. CDW is uniquely positioned to deliver for our customers and our vendor partners. This is a great example of our critical role. 
These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the success of investments in cloud, our strong relationships with customers and vendors, and the importance of our competitive advantages. I am proud of the way our team continues to deliver. 
Let me briefly update you now on our COVID response efforts. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have followed 3 key principles: First, safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers; second, serve the mission-driven needs of our customers; and third, support our communities. I'm proud of how the team has managed the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Teams at our distribution and configuration centers have done an outstanding job maintaining the high level of customer service we are known for, while adhering to new protocols that safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers who come to work every day. 
We have also taken deliberate actions to foster collaboration and coworker engagement and to maintain connectivity and productivity to preserve and bolster our culture even while we are distant. These actions include leveraging new tools and learning and development opportunities, expanded health and well-being programs, increased content from our business resource groups and compensation investment to recognize the team's tremendous efforts and performance. 
Now let me share some thoughts on 2021. The near-term global health and macroeconomic environment is still uncertain. Our current outlook is for the U.S. IT market to return to growth and grow between 2.5% and 3%. As you know, we hold ourselves accountable for growing faster than the IT market, and we expect our top line in 2021 to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. 
There are many wildcards, though, including COVID-19 government restrictions and vaccine rollout; policies from the new administration, including stimulus programs and tax changes; and supply constraints, in particular for Chromebooks. We are encouraged about our Q1 performance to date and how our teams are executing, but we are also cautious about the macro environment. 
Even though uncertainty continues, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Last year, we went through our rigorous strategic planning process as we do every 3 years, and we are now accelerating investment and execution against it. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, to enhance our competitive position and to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. This confidence has led our Board of Directors to increase our share repurchase authorization by $1.25 billion. 
Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best: leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives; and of course, out-execute the competition. 
Now Collin will share more details on our financial performance. Collin?"

I'm going to provide more detail on fourth quarter and full year results, capital allocation priorities and initial thoughts on 2021. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 9. Consolidated net sales were $5",2248,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on fourth quarter and full year results, capital allocation priorities and initial thoughts on 2021. 
Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 9. Consolidated net sales were $5 billion, up 9.2% on a reported basis and 11% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 less selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 7.6% versus the third quarter. This was higher than historical seasonality of a mid-single-digit decline, primarily due to how COVID-19 is impacting our channels differently. During this uncertain time seasonality has been, and is expected to continue to be, different than historical experience. 
Our customer channels generally performed consistent with the demand [ writings ] commentary shared on our last earnings call, other than K-12, where demand was even stronger than expected. Pockets of supply constraints continued in the quarter, primarily for lower-end client devices such as Chromebooks. Our team did a great job navigating the fluid environment and leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure a healthy share of supply for customers. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $881 million, an increase of 13.3%. Gross margin was 17.8%, up 70 basis points over last year. The gross margin expansion was driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. 
Turning to SG&A on Slide 10. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 15.9%. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll costs due to higher gross profit and compensation investments in our coworkers to recognize and reward their tremendous efforts and performance in 2020; the acquisition of IGNW, an ongoing investment in Aptris; and COVID-19 expenses to safeguard and compensate frontline coworkers, partially offset by continued cost savings measures, including decreased travel and entertainment. 
Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was 9,982, up 2 from the third quarter. Year-over-year, coworker count increased 86, driven by an increase of approximately 150 customer-facing coworkers, including IGNW, partially offset by a decrease in non-customer-facing coworker count. 
GAAP operating income was $332 million, up 17.1%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $376 million, up 9.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%. 
Moving to Slide 11. Interest expense was $37 million, down 2.9%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from the August refinancing. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on Slide 12 was 19.2%. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $57 million compared to $50 million last year. 
To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.2%, down 150 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with new regulations for global intangible low-taxed income and nondeductible expenses, partially offset by lower tax credits. 
As you can see on Slide 14, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 145 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.65, up 29.6%. Our non-GAAP net income was $264 million in the quarter, up 15%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, up 16.1% from last year. 
Turning to our full year results on Slides 15 through 20. Revenue was $18.5 billion, an increase of 2.4%. Gross profit was $3.2 billion, up 5.6%. Gross profit margin was 17.4%, up 50 basis points, driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. 
Before moving down the rest of the P&L, I want to take a moment to put 2020 sales and gross profit in context. We have consistently highlighted the power of our diverse portfolio and customer end markets. We pivot to where the growth is, leveraging our competitive advantages to better serve customers and gain share. In 2020, we estimate the U.S. IT market declined low single digits, call it down 2%. CDW net sales grew 440 basis points faster, and gross profit grew 760 basis points faster than the 2% market decline. Census contributed 170 basis points of year-over-year net sales growth. Excluding the Census, CDW still delivered meaningful net sales and gross profit growth in excess of market. During the 2009 recession, our net sales premium narrowed as customers paused on hardware purchases, and gross profit margin compressed due to product margin pressure in the competitive environment. In 2020, our portfolio performed differently, partially because of the unique dynamics of the pandemic but also because of the progress we've made building out the solution and services capabilities our customers value. 
For example, while U.S. software and services collectively totaled 18% of U.S. net sales in 2020, they accounted for approximately 40% of U.S. gross profit. 
Returning to the full year P&L. Operating income was $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, up 2.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, down 120 basis points versus last year's rate. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to new regulations for global intangible low-taxed income and nondeductible expenses that are not expected to contribute as much of a benefit to the tax rate in 2021. 
Net income was $789 million and non-GAAP net income was $954 million, up 5.8%. Non-GAAP net  income per share was $6.59, up 8%. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 21. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion, and net debt was $2.5 billion. Liquidity further strengthened, with cash-plus-revolver availability of approximately $2.5 billion. 
Full year free cash flow was $1.2 billion, as shown on Slide 22. This equates to 6.7% of sales, well above our historical free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25%. A portion of the outperformance was driven by timing or onetime items, including mixing into vendors with extended payment terms, the Census, deferred payroll and U.K. tax payments, and the timing of collections from some large customers. We expect the favorable timing to reverse over the next few quarters. 
Moving to Slide 23. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down 1 day from last year's fourth quarter. DSO and DIO were unchanged from last year, while DPO increased by 1 day. The increase in DPO was primarily driven by mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. 
As previously mentioned, we resumed our share buyback program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of stock. For full year 2020, we returned $561 million to shareholders, including $220 million of dividends and $341 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $129 per share. 
Turning to capital allocation priorities on Slide 24. Given our strong liquidity position, our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the year at 1.7x. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 2 small ServiceNow solution practices to build on the success from our 2019 acquisition of Aptris. We remain active evaluating targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. 
Going forward, we expect to move closer to our target net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash returned to shareholders. We expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. At the end of December, we had $338 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As Chris mentioned, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.25 billion increase to the share repurchase program in support of our capital allocation priorities. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. 
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 25. The current environment continues to be highly uncertain, making it challenging to forecast expectations for IT market growth with a high degree of confidence. Therefore, we are providing a base case for 2021 IT market growth and how we expect CDW's business to perform in that environment. 
Our base case assumes U.S. IT market growth between 2.5% to 3%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than market. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 50 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. 
In terms of performance by segment for the year, there continues to be uncertainty among customers across end markets, but here are some drivers to consider. 
On the commercial side of the business, Corporate and Small Business customers tend to respond quicker to the macroeconomic environment. We saw that last year Q1 was the strongest quarter, then Q2 experienced the steepest decline with quarterly declines moderating thereafter. We expect the timing and slope of the rebound in 2021 to be closely tied to customer confidence, which will be a function of the macroeconomic environment and success containing the virus. 
Moving to Public. We expect continued success supporting Department of Defense and civilian agencies. However, Government is not expected to fully make up the loss of the Census project, which contributed a total of approximately 230 basis points of net sales to CDW in 2020. Education growth is expected to be strong earlier in the year, with sales above historical seasonality, and then decelerate throughout the year due to overlaps in the unusual seasonality experienced in 2020. 
Chromebook supply continues to be a wildcard. 
Healthcare overlaps are tougher in the first half as customer demand spiked at the beginning of the pandemic and then comparisons ease in the second half. The timing and slope of a rebound in 2021 is linked to budget clarity, which we expect to be a function of success containing the virus and potential stimulus support. 
Finally, our international businesses are more weighted to Corporate customers, so the pace of recovery will be driven by the macro environments in the U.K. and Canada. 
Moving down the P&L. Assuming IT market growth of 2.5% to 3%, we expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range and non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be in the mid- to high single digits, call it 6.5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the following below the operating line assumptions: One, a modest decline in interest expense to the mid- to high 140s. Two, a non-GAAP effective tax rate at the low end of our typical 25.5% to 26.5% range, assuming current tax rates. The low end of the range is approximately 150 basis points higher than 2020's 24% rate, creating a headwind of over 200 basis points on earnings per share growth. Three, contribution from share repurchases, with non-GAAP earnings per share growing approximately 200 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. 
Currency is expected to contribute approximately 40 basis points to reported earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization can be found on Page 26. 
Turning to the first quarter. Historically, the Q4 to Q1 sequential decline on an average daily sales basis has averaged down approximately 7%. We expect this year's first quarter sequential decline to be down high single digits, more than historical seasonality, primarily due to Census and Mississippi Department of Education. On a year-over-year average daily sales basis, this equates to mid-single-digit growth reflecting continued education and government strength, improving commercial trends, partially offset by the overlap of the March 2020 work-from-home surge. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be a couple of hundred basis points higher than the full year EPS outlook as we overlap last year's increase in the credit loss reserve, partially offset by having 1 fewer selling day, which adversely impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. This is timing, and we will recoup the day in the fourth quarter. January segment trends are generally in line with my commentary on first quarter expectations. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 27. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. 
Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020's significant overdelivery, we expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. We expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. We believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. 
As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cree to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

There is a little bit of a giveback on the sales comp line because we pay on gross profit dollars. I think, Katy, from a secular perspective, our expectation is consistent with yours that we would expect netted-down items in software and services to grow faster than the balance of the business. I think we're just a little careful though of trying to understand where we are in the cycle and whether a hardware refresh is coming and if it is coming, how strong it could be. So I think that's something to keep in mind as you think about that netted-down mix and the impact it has on gross margin going forward, at least over the next several quarters. 
I think the other thing to think through on the margin and then the flow-through to NGOI margin is we did benefit from really an exceptional product margin in 2020. And I think some of that was due to the unique dynamics of the supply environment as well as the premium that customers were placing on speed. And so I think that's just also another thing to keep in mind as we think about gross margin going forward. Now again, I think those are probably more cyclical than secular, but something to think about."

So on a relative basis, we always expect ourselves to do better. And when you think about the combination of our competitive advantages, you saw them in play really in one of the hardest periods in history in 2020. So we are confident that the advantages that we bring to the market will position us and allow us to continue to outperform [ a pit ] to where our customers need us and grow faster than the market. 
When I think about headwinds and tailwinds going into 2020, certainly, think about remote work and remote everything. And that has certainly been driving growth in 2020 and should continue to do so in 2021, though we've got some very significant compares, as you all know, because of the first quarter of last year, because of the timing of the Education needs at the end of this past year in Census. But it will still continue to be a trend, we believe. Everyone will not be going straight back to work, and we think it will be a work-from-everywhere kind of situation. 
We also believe that this digital acceleration is just going to continue. And so our strength across the full stack -- and when I say full stack, I mean cloud, services, software and hardware -- plays very well with our customers because customers are always full stack, and they're looking for a full solution. So as they think about combined multi-vendor, multi component solutions, so [ they view us ] as a great partner for them. And we can take them from the very front end of advising and designing to building, implementing, integrating, orchestrating and managing. And I'll tell you, it seems that 2020 has really propelled customers to look for that value-added, one-stop shop trusted IT provider that can do the full spectrum across the whole life cycle. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our customers. 
On the federal side, I think you asked about specifically the Department of Defense and civilian. We expect to continue to maintain pretty strong. Look, on the commercial side on Small Business and Corporate, I'll tell you as Colin said, the speed and the slope of any recovery is tied to confidence, which is tied to the macro, which is tied to the virus. It's all tied together. So that's very hard to predict. But we've been staying so close to our customers during 2020 that we feel absolutely confident that we will be well positioned to help them on their way up and to capture growth as they're growing. 
On the Government side, stimulus is another wildcard out there. And under the new administration, if we see some stronger stimulus, that should also help to support on the Education, Healthcare and state and local side."

But the good news, Ruplu, is remember we put the mitigation strategy in place with our Netherlands entity, and we've really been helping customers utilize that entity in the EU. So while we've gone back into lockdown, it does feel like -- it feels like customers are used to working that way and are still buying in the areas where they have needs like remote work -- optimizing remote work, et cetera. So we haven't seen a significant impact any different than we would have seen in 2020. And we're managing those really quite well at this point. 
In terms of M&A, yes, look, we never really pinpoint where we're going to be -- what we're going to be doing, but you know we're focused on geographic expansion as well as expanding our capabilities, our technology capabilities. So we continue to look. We continue to be very active. I doubt there's a deal out there that doesn't get to CDW's door to see, but we also have our screens that we need to adhere to, which are the cultural and operating match, the financial match and the strategic match. So we'll continue to look. 
We're excited about the 3 we did this year that continue to grow our cloud native and ServiceNow capabilities. And frankly, we're seeing the real benefit from those in terms of traction with our sales organization and deeper connections with our customers because we're really at the front end of that IT supply chain, if you will, helping them to devise solutions and then fulfilling. So those have been real positive winners for CDW and our customers."

I would tell you that 2021 is almost a harder year to determine what sits underneath that IT market rate of growth. There's a wide dispersion of forecasts out there across various technologies. And what I would say is -- I don't think anybody really knows precisely -- what we plan to do is what we do best, which is pivot where our customers need us. And whether that be in the client hardware refresh area, whether it be in building out cloud capabilities, we're able to go in either direction. And we're just staying very close to our customers, working with them literally day by day, week by week and supporting them in their technology needs. 
Certainly, technology is more essential than ever. We don't see any of the trends slowing down, frankly. We might see some things prolonged if the pandemic and the vaccine don't go as we all hope. But at the end of the day, it's a mix, and it's really quite hard to tell. 
I know that's not a great answer to the question of what it comprises, but it's very hard to know given the unprecedented uncertainty that we still have. I think sometimes, I think people felt in some ways we've come through 2020, and now we're in 2021 and it's sunrise and glory ahead. And I think we really have to be cautious and conscious of where we sit in the vaccine rollout and new strains coming up, and we just have to be very methodical in listening to our customers and taking care of them, which we're very good at doing."

On the first question, Amit, I'd say both. We are -- we certainly lean more heavily into penetrating current customers as [ we go ], but we are bringing in new customers with our cloud capabilities and our digital Velocity and ServiceNow practices in particular. 
Again, as I mentioned earlier, they're really at the front end of that discussion advisory. And that's where we're able to bring a great deal of value to the customer and the planning, particularly in a world where things are changing so quickly and plans that had been expected and in place 4, 5, 12 months ago are moving, and we're very well positioned to help them with that. So it's both customers, new and existing. And we do expect to continue to see growth there. 
I would note that on the -- you asked about existing customers and migrating to the cloud. One of the interesting things that I know you're aware of, but it's not just migrating to the cloud, but it's also some customers who are already cloud and becoming multi-cloud, so multi public cloud. Other customers who are -- have some public cloud capabilities that they need to almost mirror that on-prem. So it's the whole -- I'll call it the cloud environment, the whole ecosystem that our teams are able to support customers with now. Again, which is a real advantage because it's bringing the customer the best for the customer and not just some narrow product category that we sell. 
In terms of the impact on the P&L, I think Collin is going to jump in here."

Security would be a good example of that. A lot of it's delivered via the cloud. And there are other things that are more commodity-like in terms of cloud offerings and would have lower margins. So in terms of the absolute amount of profit, it's really a function of how margin-rich the particular offering is, which is typically rooted in value from the -- perceived value from the customer as well as then the services that we can wrap around add another value we can bring by consumption."

And our overarching strategy hasn't changed, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. I would say what we do is we really hone where we're focusing our energy and investments to evolve the business as technology evolves. And where we're focusing now are those areas in strategic services and solutions that our customers need us. 
You heard me mention full stack is the way that we go to market and investments in the capabilities across that full stack, such as cloud solutions, cloud services, software solutions and services, in particular security, and then obviously, our hardware. 
I think about a couple of recent acquisitions, Scalar and IGNW, as excellent examples of that strategy in action where we invested in cloud and DevOps capabilities and ServiceNow capabilities, and those are the areas that customers are needing advisers. 
The other area that you can think about that we're investing in is our talent, and digital in particular. So our technology, our own technology, we kind of put the mirror on ourselves and made some decisions about what we need as an organization. And we're investing in our own technical capabilities, but also those digital tools that we've talked about in the past for sellers. I think you've heard us talk about AMANDA. We have a number of other tools in the pipeline that allow our sellers in our digital platform, our e-commerce platform to work for our customer in a really integrated, seamless intelligent way. And that's what we're gunning for. 
And then obviously, we're also reviewing our operating model as we always do, but even with more gusto, I would say, now to really remove those things that we -- that are inefficiencies and improve where we can and then reimagine critical elements for a digital world and then reinvest back in the business. So investing in technology, also investing in talent. 
We talked last quarter about a reduction in our workforce, but a reduction was also to open up capacity for those rules and capabilities that we need, and we have been investing in people there. So technology, people and digital as well you see investment, as well as capabilities behind those high-growth areas."

But until we start to see, I think, a strength in recovery, which, of course, is related to the virus, we're pretty cautious around on-prem solutions.

On the Corporate side, it's really -- we've referenced it as kind of multiple layers and mosaics, and it's the same -- that we're really seeing the same thing. It depends by geography. It depends by industry, even individual customers within segments, winners and losers, so to speak. So it's really a mix across geo, industry and individual customers. 
I will say that we did see some budget flush at the end of the year, which felt like a good thing. But again, until we see the macroeconomics uncertainty subside and we see more customer confidence, which of course is driven by the success in stemming the virus, I think we're still going to be a little cautious on Corporate.

So if we can get that under control and we can stem the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, then I think we'll see it recover more quickly and maybe with a very healthy slope given the importance of technology. If we don't see that, I think we're going to see more muted growth over a longer period of time. Certainly, the stimulus is yet another wildcard, which can help in the areas that we've mentioned -- education, state and local, et cetera -- and can, of course, help get that positive momentum going with the consumer, which ultimately impacts the businesses. But I just think the dynamics of this environment and the pandemic make it incredibly difficult to predict timing and flow.

It's really important to understand that what was happening here was a great focus on equity in assets for students and student success. And therefore, schools were looking to get full holistic outcome solutions to their schools with a lot of speed. And not a lot of providers could do that, because they needed to get in the hands of the students quite quickly. 
And so when you look at the tremendous success our team had in K-12, it is because of the capabilities that they're able to bring together and literally get turnkey solutions to the schools in a timely fashion. And it's because of the relationships we have with our vendors to make sure we're getting a healthy proportion of the supply out there, which was really constrained. So I would say a couple of things. 
Number one, the timing, the seasonality was different because of the great urgency schools have. Number two, our execution was just extraordinary. And I want to say that loud and clear because the teams did such an extraordinary job. We have some backlog going into the first quarter of next year, which will certainly benefit us in the first quarter. And then one would expect that going into the back half of next year, we'll get back to more, I guess, normal seasonality in K-12. But it's a confluence of both the demand and our capabilities, and an unbelievable execution by the team."

So we're seeing it across the full stack, hardware and software in particular. We certainly provide some services wrapped around those, but it's across the full stack.

And again, I'd say there are different flavors of what customers are doing. We have a healthy dose of customers who are -- in some ways like CDW, not so much waiting and seeing but planning in a very flexible, adaptable optionality-type kind of way. So they're not clear on whether they're going back at the end of the year, or whether they're going to go back 50%, et cetera. So I guess what I'm saying is, we've got customers, some who are already back in the office, maybe 20% of our customers. And we're obviously helping them set up in the office et cetera.
But others are still planning for what their workforce ought to look like. I mean I'm sure you hear the types of things that companies are saying they need to be in person for now: collaboration, innovation, acculturation. These are things companies are saying, we need to be in the office for that. So we're helping them to design spaces that are most suitable for that. If in fact customers decide 80% of their workforce can work  from anywhere, we are absolutely in the throes of  talking with them about what the blueprint for 
everybody is coming into the office at different times for different types of work. I mean it's a really interesting time right now because I don't -- well, while there was a lot of talk about where this would settle out, the hard work really begins in the planning and what that looks like and how you create efficiency and productivity for your workforce. And we're right in the throes of that. And I think we're going to see a number of flavors, frankly. So we'll be -- we're helping customers with all kinds of flavors."

New use cases, we've been talking about this for quite a long time as companies start evolving their business models, think retailers, for example, contactless purchasing. We think new use cases will be a tailwind for client devices.

I'll begin this morning with an overview of fourth quarter and full year results and drivers of performance and share some thoughts on 2021. Collin will take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. 
Our fourth quarter and fiscal year results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $5 billion, 11% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of 1 fewer business day in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019 and up 10.7% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 13.3% to $881 million. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $376 million, an increase of 9.9%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, 16.1% above last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant currency. For the year, net sales were $18.5 billion, up nearly $0.5 billion year-over-year or 2.4% on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross profit increased 5.6% to $3.2 billion. Non-GAAP operating income increased 2.6 (sic) [ 2.7 ]% to $1.4 billion and non-GAAP net income per share increased 8% on a reported and constant currency basis to $6.59. 
2020 was an extraordinary year. I'm very proud of how the CDW team quickly and smartly adapted to help our customers and partners during a challenging time. The diversity of our solutions portfolio and customer end-markets served us well in 2020, providing balance and driving our exceptional results. 
During the year, our team helped customers across the full IT solution stack in the full IT life cycle, from client devices to cloud, from design to managed services. We executed against our strategy and continued to invest in high-growth solutions and services capabilities, including 3 acquisitions: IGNW, a leading provider of cloud-native service expertise and software development capabilities; and Aeritae and Southern Dakota Solutions, which expanded our ServiceNow team. 
Performance for our customer end markets varied. Demand increased in some and decreased in others, but all experienced change or disruption to their technology needs and to their operations last year due to COVID-19. Our value proposition resonated with customers. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and logistical and distribution capabilities to deliver the best outcomes for our customers. This led to meaningful outperformance compared to the U.S. IT market. We emerged from 2020 stronger and even more committed to executing our strategy. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. We continue to help customers with remote enablement and resource optimization, cost reduction, security, hybrid and cloud solutions, and digital transformation. Similar to the third quarter, some customers resumed solutions projects and others started new projects. Performance for our most impacted customer end-markets improved, and trends for our more resilient customer end-markets remained strong. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges and support our customers,in particular, for Chromebooks for K-12 customers where demand greatly outstripped supply. 
Now let's take a deeper look at fourth quarter customer end-market performance. Corporate declined 11% with similar levels of performance for transactions and solutions. In total, there was an improvement versus the last 2 quarters. Customer spend for corporate customers was not uniform. Some customers were doing well and investing in technology, whereas other customers, those who are in challenged industries or geographies who were impacted by spikes in COVID cases, were still cautious. 
Small Business declined mid-single digits as notebooks returned to growth. Small Business customers tend to be more nimble than Corporate customers, which drove the improvement versus the third quarter. 
The Government team increased net sales 30%. Federal delivered another excellent quarter with net sales up strong double digits. During the quarter, our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau was mostly completed. All devices were returned to us for decommissioning, and we started the process to resell the clean units through third-party remarketers. Our team did an excellent job with this program. It was a multiyear effort to develop and execute this large complex undertaking, moving the nation's once-a-decade population count from paper to digital for the first time. Our services and logistical capabilities and multi-vendor solutions set us apart from the competition. We are unique in what we can deliver to our customers. 
Outside of the Census project, the federal team continued to help civilian agencies with remote enablement and device refresh. We also delivered on Department of Defense projects that were awarded at the end of the third quarter. The state and local team delivered strong double-digit growth. IT investments continued to be a priority despite budget pressure. Our team helped customers enable remote capabilities and restart solutions projects. 
Education increased an extraordinary 140%, driven by phenomenal growth in K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access and remote learning, which drove triple-digit growth for notebooks, related accessories and solutions as customers turned to us for holistic capabilities. Higher education increased low- double digits, as schools continued to help students with remote enablement and resumed net com projects with a focus on creating connected communities to enhance the student experience. 
Healthcare declined mid-teens, a meaningful improvement compared to the third quarter. Customers continued to be cautious with their spend due to ongoing budget pressure, focusing on key areas like remote enablement, telehealth and support infrastructure. 
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, was flat on a reported basis. U.K. net sales increased mid-single digits in constant currency, and Canada net sales decreased low- double digits in constant currency. Performance for both markets was driven by strong education demand to enable remote learning and health care spending to address the pandemic with softer corporate performance. 
In the U.K., there was some pull-in of customer demand before the announcement of the agreement with the EU, as customers prepared for a potential hard exit. Over the last several weeks, the U.K. team has executed against its well-planned Brexit mitigation strategy and has done a great job helping customers navigate through the complexity of the new agreement. 
Our fourth quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers across all categories. Hardware was up strong double digits driven by excellent notebook growth, in particular for our public segment customers, leading to over 30% client device growth. While software was flat, software gross profit increased mid-teens, reflecting continued mix into Software-as-a-Service. 
Services grew low- double digits, driven by device decommission services for the Census project and configuration services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. Transactions increased strong double digits. Solutions declined low- single digits as some customers continued to restore infrastructure and larger project engagement. 
The team delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in collaboration, infrastructure as a service, security and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue. 
Let me also share a little more color on our security practice, given its importance to our customers as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double digits as customers improved their security framework to respond to increasing threats. Last year, customers spent $2 billion with us on security. 
Our fourth quarter and full year operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy. They are important drivers of our past and our future performance. 
The diversity of our customer end-markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customer's total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. As I've shared, the balance of our customer end-markets and our offerings are especially relevant in current environments. 
And the final driver of our performance, our 3-part strategy for growth is, first, to acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action and how we helped customers last quarter. 
Our Small Business team helped a born-in-the-cloud financial technology company add more agility and flexibility to its operations and technology stack by becoming multi-cloud. The customer initially came to our team requesting help to implement a backup solution for its existing public cloud provider. After a review by our digital velocity team, our team uncovered a need for the customer to become multi-cloud with additional capabilities and redundancies. Our team helped the customer build a secure second public cloud environment and address additional needs, including application development functionality and consumption management. Our team has established CDW as a trusted partner with extensive cloud capabilities to help with research, evaluation, procurement, implementation and management. Our customers are increasingly adept in cloud but are also finding a growing need to become multi-cloud. CDW's cloud expertise and cloud management platform across multi public clouds are a differentiator in the marketplace. 
Let me share another story in the health care sector. To address COVID, health care customers have turned to CDW to provide care in new settings and in new ways. An independent nonprofit health care provider in the U.S. Northeast needed our guidance to enable remote COVID testing and vaccine distribution in numerous outdoor locations. The CDW account manager engaged one of our networking specialists to develop a solution that would deliver the required performance and scale quickly. The solution has since been rolled out to all locations and we next work with the customer on the site's wireless connectivity, further leveraging our technical resources and strengthening the relationship. Our team saved the customer time and energy and provided great service as a forward-thinking partner who the customer can trust. The pandemic has created new issues requiring creative solutions, and leading customers to rely on us more than ever as an extension of their team. This is the value that CDW brings to our customers. We pair our broad solutions portfolio with our deep technical expertise to deliver the full outcomes that customers need.
Finally, the digital divide has created significant learning challenges around the world. Our teams have worked closely with education customers in the U.S., in the U.K. and in Canada to tackle this challenge. 
In the U.K., we are working with the London Grid For Learning, a charitable trust dedicated to the advancement of education, to provide technology for hundreds of schools across the country. Last quarter, our team developed and provisioned unique turnkey solutions comprised of client devices, accessories, software and services, leveraging our strong logistical and distribution capabilities and deep vendor relationships. There has been tight collaboration with our client's vendor partner to provide the best possible device availability for the customer due to the current global Chromebook supply constraint. Our distribution center in the U.K. has done a tremendous job to deliver over 100,000 units to date to hundreds of schools. CDW is uniquely positioned to deliver for our customers and our vendor partners. This is a great example of our critical role. 
These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the success of investments in cloud, our strong relationships with customers and vendors, and the importance of our competitive advantages. I am proud of the way our team continues to deliver. 
Let me briefly update you now on our COVID response efforts. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have followed 3 key principles: First, safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers; second, serve the mission-driven needs of our customers; and third, support our communities. I'm proud of how the team has managed the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Teams at our distribution and configuration centers have done an outstanding job maintaining the high level of customer service we are known for, while adhering to new protocols that safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers who come to work every day. 
We have also taken deliberate actions to foster collaboration and coworker engagement and to maintain connectivity and productivity to preserve and bolster our culture even while we are distanced. These actions include leveraging new tools and learning and development opportunities, expanded health and well-being programs, increased content from our business resource groups and compensation investment to recognize the team's tremendous efforts and performance. 
Now let me share some thoughts on 2021. The near-term global health and macroeconomic environment is still uncertain. Our current outlook is for the U.S. IT market to return to growth and grow between 2.5% and 3%. As you know, we hold ourselves accountable for growing faster than the IT market, and we expect our top-line in 2021 to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. 
There are many wildcards, though, including COVID-19 government restrictions and vaccine rollout; policies from the newly elected administration, including stimulus programs and tax changes; and supply constraints, in particular for Chromebooks. We are encouraged about our Q1 performance to-date and how our teams are executing, but we are also cautious about the macro environment. 
Even though uncertainty continues, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. We believe that technology will be more essential for all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Last year, we went through our rigorous strategic planning process as we do every 3 years, and we are now accelerating investment and execution against it. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, to enhance our competitive position and to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. This confidence has led our Board of Directors to increase our share repurchase authorization by $1.25 billion. 
Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best: leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives, and of course, out-execute the competition. 
Now Collin will share more details on our financial performance. Collin?"

I'm going to provide more detail on fourth quarter and full year results, capital allocation priorities and initial thoughts on 2021. 
Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 9. Consolidated net sales were $5 billion, up 9.2% on a reported basis and 11% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 less selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 7.6% versus the third quarter. This was higher than historical seasonality of a mid-single-digit decline, primarily due to how COVID-19 is impacting our channels differently. During this uncertain time seasonality has been, and is expected to continue to be, different than historical experience. 
Our customer channels generally performed consistent with the demand [ writings ] commentary shared on our last earnings call, other than K-12, where demand was even stronger than expected. Pockets of supply constraints continued in the quarter, primarily for lower-end client devices such as Chromebooks. Our team did a great job navigating the fluid environment and leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure a healthy share of supply for customers. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $881 million, an increase of 13.3%. Gross margin was 17.8%, up 70 basis points over last year. The gross margin expansion was driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. 
Turning to SG&A on Slide 10. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 15.9%. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll costs due to higher gross profit and compensation investments in our coworkers to recognize and reward their tremendous efforts and performance in 2020; the acquisition of IGNW, an ongoing investment in Aptris; and COVID-19 expenses to safeguard and compensate frontline coworkers, partially offset by continued cost savings measures, including decreased travel and entertainment. 
Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was 9,982, up 2 from the third quarter. Year-over-year, coworker count increased 86, driven by an increase of approximately 150 customer-facing coworkers, including IGNW, partially offset by a decrease in non-customer-facing coworker count. 
GAAP operating income was $332 million, up 17.1%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $376 million, up 9.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%. 
Moving to Slide 11. Interest expense was $37 million, down 2.9%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from the August refinancing. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on Slide 12 was 19.2%. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $57 million compared to $50 million last year. 
To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.2%, down 150 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with new regulations for global intangible low-taxed income and nondeductible expenses, partially offset by lower tax credits. 
As you can see on Slide 14, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 145 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.65, up 29.6%. Our non-GAAP net income was $264 million in the quarter, up 15%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, up 16.1% from last year. 
Turning to our full year results on Slides 15 through 20. Revenue was $18.5 billion, an increase of 2.4%. Gross profit was $3.2 billion, up 5.6%. Gross profit margin was 17.4%, up 50 basis points, driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. 
Before moving down the rest of the P&L, I want to take a moment to put 2020 sales and gross profit in context. We have consistently highlighted the power of our diverse portfolio and customer end- markets. We pivot to where the growth is, leveraging our competitive advantages to better serve customers and gain share. In 2020, we estimate the U.S. IT market declined low- single digits, call it down 2%. CDW net sales grew 440 basis points faster, and gross profit grew 760 basis points faster than the 2% market decline. Census contributed 170 basis points of year-over-year net sales growth. Excluding the Census, CDW still delivered meaningful net sales and gross profit growth in excess of market. During the 2009 recession, our net sales premium narrowed as customers paused on hardware purchases, and gross profit margin compressed due to product margin pressure in the competitive environment. In 2020, our portfolio performed differently, partially because of the unique dynamics of the pandemic but also because of the progress we've made building out the solution and services capabilities our customers value. 
For example, while U.S. software and services collectively totaled 18% of U.S. net sales in 2020, they accounted for approximately 40% of U.S. gross profit. 
Returning to the full year P&L. Operating income was $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, up 2.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, down 120 basis points versus last year's rate. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to new regulations for global intangible low-taxed income and nondeductible expenses that are not expected to contribute as much of a benefit to the tax rate in 2021. 
Net income was $789 million and non-GAAP net income was $954 million, up 5.8%. Non-GAAP net  income per share was $6.59, up 8%. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 21. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion, and net debt was $2.5 billion. Liquidity further strengthened, with cash-plus-revolver availability of approximately $2.5 billion. 
Full year free cash flow was $1.2 billion, as shown on Slide 22. This equates to 6.7% of sales, well above our historical free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25%. A portion of the outperformance was driven by timing or onetime items, including mixing into vendors with extended payment terms, the Census, deferred payroll and U.K. tax payments, and the timing of collections from some large customers. We expect the favorable timing to reverse over the next few quarters. 
Moving to Slide 23. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down 1 day from last year's fourth quarter. DSO and DIO were unchanged from last year, while DPO increased by 1 day. The increase in DPO was primarily driven by mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. 
As previously mentioned, we resumed our share buyback program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of stock. For full year 2020, we returned $561 million to shareholders, including $220 million of dividends and $341 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $129 per share. 
Turning to capital allocation priorities on Slide 24. Given our strong liquidity position, our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in-line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the year at 1.7x. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 2 small ServiceNow solution practices to build on the success from our 2019 acquisition of Aptris. We remain active evaluating targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. 
Going forward, we expect to move closer to our target net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash returned to shareholders. We expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. At the end of December, we had $338 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As Chris mentioned, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.25 billion increase to the share repurchase program in support of our capital allocation priorities. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. 
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 25. The current environment continues to be highly uncertain, making it challenging to forecast expectations for IT market growth with a high degree of confidence. Therefore, we are providing a base case for 2021 IT market growth and how we expect CDW's business to perform in that environment. 
Our base case assumes U.S. IT market growth between 2.5% to 3%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than market. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 50 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. 
In terms of performance by segment for the year, there continues to be uncertainty among customers across end-markets, but here are some drivers to consider. 
On the commercial side of the business, Corporate and Small Business customers tend to respond quicker to the macroeconomic environment. We saw that last year. Q1 was the strongest quarter, then Q2 experienced the steepest decline with quarterly declines moderating thereafter. We expect the timing and slope of the rebound in 2021 to be closely tied to customer confidence, which will be a function of the macroeconomic environment and success containing the virus. 
Moving to Public. We expect continued success supporting Department of Defense and civilian agencies. However, Government is not expected to fully make up the loss of the Census project, which contributed a total of approximately 230 basis points of net sales to CDW in 2020. Education growth is expected to be strong earlier in the year, with sales above historical seasonality, and then decelerate throughout the year due to overlaps in the unusual seasonality experienced in 2020. 
Chromebook supply continues to be a wildcard. 
Healthcare overlaps are tougher in the first half as customer demand spiked at the beginning of the pandemic and then comparisons eased in the second half. The timing and slope of a rebound in 2021 is linked to budget clarity, which we expect to be a function of success containing the virus and potential stimulus support. 
Finally, our international businesses are more weighted to Corporate customers, so the pace of recovery will be driven by the macro environments in the U.K. and Canada. 
Moving down the P&L. Assuming IT market growth of 2.5% to 3%, we expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range and non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be in the mid- to high single digits, call it 6.5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the following below the operating line assumptions: One, a modest decline in interest expense to the mid- to high 140s. Two, a non-GAAP effective tax rate at the low-end of our typical 25.5% to 26.5% range, assuming current tax rates. The low-end of the range is approximately 150 basis points higher than 2020's 24% rate, creating a headwind of over 200 basis points on earnings per share growth. Three, contribution from share repurchases, with non-GAAP earnings per share growing approximately 200 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. 
Currency is expected to contribute approximately 40 basis points to reported earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization can be found on Page 26. 
Turning to the first quarter. Historically, the Q4 to Q1 sequential decline on an average daily sales basis has averaged down approximately 7%. We expect this year's first quarter sequential decline to be down high- single digits, more than historical seasonality, primarily due to Census and Mississippi Department of Education. On a year-over-year average daily sales basis, this equates to mid-single-digit growth reflecting continued education and government strength, improving commercial trends, partially offset by the overlap of the March 2020 work-from-home surge. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be a couple of hundred basis points higher than the full year EPS outlook as we overlap last year's increase in the credit loss reserve, partially offset by having 1 fewer selling day, which adversely impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. This is timing, and we will recoup the day in the fourth quarter. January segment trends are generally in line with my commentary on first quarter expectations. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 27. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. 
Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020's significant overdelivery, we expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low-end of the range. We expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. We believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. 
As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cree to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

There is a little bit of a giveback on the sales comp line because we pay on gross profit dollars. I think, Katy, from a secular perspective, our expectation is consistent with yours that we would expect netted-down items in software and services to grow faster than the balance of the business. I think we're just a little careful, though, of trying to understand where we are in the cycle and whether a hardware refresh is coming and if it is coming, how strong it could be. So I think that's something to keep in mind as you think about that netted-down mix and the impact it has on gross margin going forward, at least over the next several quarters. 
I think the other thing to think through on the margin and then the flow-through to NGOI margin is we did benefit from really an exceptional product margin in 2020. And I think some of that was due to the unique dynamics of the supply environment as well as the premium that customers were placing on speed. And so I think that's just also another thing to keep in mind as we think about gross margin going forward. Now again, I think those are probably more cyclical than secular, but something to think about."

So on a relative basis, we always expect ourselves to do better. And when you think about the combination of our competitive advantages, you saw them in play really in one of the hardest periods in history in 2020. So we are confident that the advantages that we bring to the market will position us and allow us to continue to outperform [ on par ] to where our customers need us and grow faster than the market. 
When I think about headwinds and tailwinds going into 2020, certainly, think about remote work and remote everything. And that has certainly been driving growth in 2020 and should continue to do so in 2021, though we've got some very significant compares, as you all know, because of the first quarter of last year, because of the timing of the Education needs at the end of this past year, and Census. But it will still continue to be a trend, we believe. Everyone will not be going straight back to work, and we think it will be a work-from-everywhere kind of situation. 
We also believe that this digital acceleration is just going to continue. And so our strength across the full stack -- and when I say full stack, I mean cloud, services, software and hardware -- plays very well with our customers because customers are always full stack, and they're looking for a full solution. So as they think about combined multi-vendor, multi component solutions, so [ they view us ] as a great partner for them. And we can take them from the very front end of advising and designing to building, implementing, integrating, orchestrating and managing. And I'll tell you, it seems that 2020 has really propelled customers to look for that value-added, one-stop shop trusted IT provider that can do the full spectrum across the whole life cycle. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our customers. 
On the federal side, I think you asked about specifically the Department of Defense and civilian. We expect to continue to -- this to maintain pretty strong. Look, on the commercial side on Small Business and Corporate, I'll tell you as Collin said, the speed and the slope of any recovery is tied to confidence, which is tied to the macro, which is tied to the virus. It's all tied together. So that's very hard to predict. But we've been staying so close to our customers during 2020 that we feel absolutely confident that we will be well-positioned to help them on their way up and to capture growth as they're growing. 
On the Government side, stimulus is another wildcard out there. And under the new administration, if we see some stronger stimulus, that should also help to support on the Education, Healthcare and state and local side."

But the good news, Ruplu, is remember we put the mitigation strategy in place with our Netherlands entity, and we've really been helping customers utilize that entity in the EU. So while we've gone back into lockdown, it does feel like -- it feels like customers are used to working that way and are still buying in the areas where they have needs like remote work -- optimizing remote work, et cetera. So we haven't seen a significant impact any different than we would have seen in 2020. And we're managing those really quite well at this point. 
In terms of M&A, yes, look, we never really pinpoint where we're going to be -- what we're going to be doing, but you know we're focused on geographic expansion as well as expanding our capabilities, our technology capabilities. So we continue to look. We continue to be very active. I doubt there's a deal out there that doesn't get to CDW's door to see, but we also have our screens that we need to adhere to, which are the cultural and operating match, the financial match and the strategic match. So we'll continue to look. 
We're excited about the 3 we did this year that continue to grow our cloud native and ServiceNow capabilities. And frankly, we're seeing the real benefit from those in terms of traction with our sales organization and deeper connections with our customers because we're really at the front-end of that IT supply chain, if you will, helping them to devise solutions and then fulfill them.

And that's where we're able to bring a great deal of value to the customer and the planning, particularly in a world where things are changing so quickly and plans that had been expected and in place 4, 5, 12 months ago are moving, and we're very well-positioned to help them with that. So it's both customers, new and existing. And we do expect to continue to see growth there. 
I would note that on the -- you asked about existing customers and migrating to the cloud. One of the interesting things that I know you're aware of, but it's not just migrating to the cloud, but it's also some customers who are in-cloud and becoming multi-cloud, so multi- public cloud. Other customers who are -- have some public cloud capabilities that they need to almost mirror that on-prem. So it's the whole -- I'll call it the cloud environment, the whole ecosystem that our teams are able to support customers with now. Again, which is a real advantage because it's bringing the customer the best for the customer and not just some narrow product category that we sell.

I mean because most of it gets netted down, it obviously has the lift on gross margin and operating margin. If you look at it on gross profit divided by what the customer is actually spending, I would say cloud is very much like our entire portfolio. There are some things in it that are higher margin. Security would be a good example of that. A lot of it's delivered via the cloud. And there are other things that are more commodity-like in terms of cloud offerings and would have lower margins. So in terms of the absolute amount of profit, it's really a function of how margin-rich the particular offering is, which is typically rooted in value from the -- perceived value from the customer as well as then the services that we can wrap around it and another value we can bring by consumption."

And our overarching strategy hasn't changed, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. I would say what we do is we really hone where we're focusing our energy and investments to evolve the business as technology evolves. And where we're focusing now are those areas in strategic services and solutions that our customers need us. 
You heard me mention full stack is the way that we go to market and investments in the capabilities across that full stack, such as cloud solutions, cloud services, software solutions and services, in particular security, and then obviously, our hardware. 
I think about a couple of recent acquisitions, Scalar and IGNW, as excellent examples of that strategy in action where we invested in cloud and DevOps capabilities and ServiceNow capabilities, and those are the areas that customers are needing advisers. 
The other area that you can think about that we're investing in is our talent, and digital in particular. So our technology, our own technology, we kind of put the mirror on ourselves and made some decisions about what we need as an organization. And we're investing in our own technical capabilities, but also those digital tools that we've talked about in the past for sellers. I think you've heard us talk about AMANDA. We have a number of other tools in the pipeline that allow our sellers in our digital platform, our e-commerce platform to work for our customer in a really integrated, seamless intelligent way. And that's what we're going for. 
And then obviously, we're also reviewing our operating model as we always do, but even with more gusto, I would say now, to really remove those things that we -- that are inefficiencies and improve where we can and then reimagine critical elements for a digital world and then reinvest back in the business. So investing in technology, also investing in talent. 
We talked last quarter about a reduction in our workforce, but a reduction was also to open up capacity for those rules and capabilities that we need, and we have been investing in people there. So technology, people and digital as well you see investment, as well as capabilities behind those high-growth areas."

We are seeing some pickup in areas like higher ed as example, where they're really focused on a connected community. So they've really extended what that connected campus looks like. But until we start to see, I think, a strength in recovery, which, of course, is related to the virus, we're pretty cautious around on-prem solutions. 
We also haven't obviously been able to get into locations. We still haven't been able to get into too many locations to help our customers there. So I would just say, look, a refresh will be coming. It's hard to know when in 2021 or beyond that will be."

On the Corporate side, it's really -- we've referenced it as kind of multiple layers and mosaics, and it's the same -- that we're really seeing the same thing. It depends by geography. It depends by industry, even individual customers within segments, winners and losers, so to speak. So it's really a mix across geo, industry and individual customers. 
I will say that we did see some budget flush at the end of the year, which felt like a good thing. But again, until we see the macroeconomics uncertainty subside and we see more customer confidence, which of course is driven by the success in stemming the virus, I think we're still going to be a little cautious on Corporate. On the other hand, look, when things do normalize, we would expect Corporate and Small Business similar to what we saw in 2009 and '10 to really pick up again, and we'll be well prepared to help them do that."

And Collin said in his prepared remarks, the speed and the slope of the recovery is really in every way related to the success containing the virus. So if we can get that under control and we can stem the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, then I think we'll see it recover more quickly and maybe with a very healthy slope given the importance of technology. If we don't see that, I think we're going to see more muted growth over a longer period of time. Certainly, the stimulus is yet another wildcard, which can help in the areas that we've mentioned -- education, state and local, et cetera -- and can, of course, help get that positive momentum going with the consumer, which ultimately impacts the businesses. But I just think the dynamics of this environment and the pandemic make it incredibly difficult to predict timing and flow.

It's really important to understand that what was happening here was a great focus on equity in assets for students and student success. And therefore, schools were looking to get full holistic outcome solutions to their schools with a lot of speed. And not a lot of providers could do that, because they needed to get in the hands of the students quite quickly. 
And so when you look at the tremendous success our team had in K-12, it is because of the capabilities that they're able to bring together and literally get turnkey solutions to the schools in a timely fashion. And it's because of the relationships we have with our vendors to make sure we're getting a healthy proportion of the supply out there, which was really constrained. So I would say a couple of things. 
Number one, the timing, the seasonality was different because of the great urgency schools have. Number two, our execution was just extraordinary. And I want to say that loud and clear because the teams did such an extraordinary job. We have some backlog going into the first quarter of next year, which will certainly benefit us in the first quarter. And then one would expect that going into the back half of next year, we'll get back to more, I guess, normal seasonality in K-12. But it's a confluence of both the demand and our capabilities, and an unbelievable execution by the team."

I'll begin this morning with an overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021.

I'll begin this morning with an overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.
We had a strong first quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the first quarter, net sales were $4.8 billion, 12% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of one fewer business day in the first quarter of 2021 than 2020, and up 10.9% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 5.1% to $795 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $368 million, an increase of 21%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% on a reported basis and up 25.3% in constant currency.
The diversity of our end markets and solutions portfolio continue to serve us well, providing balance and driving our strong results as we overlap last year's end-of-quarter surge in demand for remote solutions. During the first quarter, we saw early signs of recovery as customers became more optimistic about the macroeconomic environment due to lower COVID case count, higher vaccination rates and new government stimulus. Customer spending and channels most impacted by COVID last year rebounded. 
We continue to help customers with remote enablement, resource optimization, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. This past quarter, customers allocated more technology spend to infrastructure needs, driving growth for our solutions portfolio. Customers were focused on investments for the future, reconfiguring how they interact customers, strengthening hybrid environments, industrializing remote enablement and restarting projects that had been delayed due to COVID. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers.
Customers choose CDW for 3 simple reasons. First, customers want a partner who know their business and their industry. Second, customers want a partner with broad and deep technical capabilities. And third, they want a partner who is focused on the optimal outcome, one who is agnostic across brand, technology and consumption model and has an informed opinion. These reasons are fundamental to why CDW outperformed in the first quarter and will continue to win in the market.
During the first quarter, we remain focused on executing against our strategy and investing in high relevance and high-growth solutions and services capabilities, including our acquisition of Amplified IT. Amplified IT is a Google premium education partner and a leading provider of cloud-based services, solutions and software for education customers and has been a partner of CDW since 2016. We share a similar culture that puts customers first and together, we will accelerate our work to help customers' schools achieve great educational outcomes through technology.
Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges. Supply constraints and availability for client devices and some infrastructure products have been more challenging since the first quarter ended. Disruption has been caused by both component availability issues and supply chain logistical issues. The supply situation is fluid. Constraints will likely continue through the second half of the year and potentially into next year.
Now let's take a deeper look at first quarter customer end market performance. Corporate declined 4% as customer spend continue to recover. Customer expectations that a hybrid environment will become the future work model, drove investments in notebooks and other remote enablement tools, while desktop and video sales declined. Solutions performance was flat, a significant improvement versus the previous quarter as netcomm and data center projects returned. Small business delivered strong growth, increasing 12% as optimism improved. Our team helped customers with remote enablement, netcomm and data center projects, leading to solid growth in both transactional and solution spend. Net sales for our government channel decreased high single digit. Federal declined mid-single digits. However, excluding our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau, federal grew high single digits, led by engagements for the Department of Defense across both transactional and solutions categories.
The state and local channel decreased high single digits. Customers paused their spending as they took a wait-and-see approach during the quarter for a stimulus support under the new administration. Education again grew triple digits, achieving over 100% growth, powered by K-12. K-12 customers continue to focus on equity and access as well as ways to address learning loss, which drove strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers turn to us for holistic capabilities and expertise to help schools enable a variety of learning models, remote, hybrid, blended and in-person.
Higher Ed increased low single digits. Growth slowed versus prior quarters as customers assess their plans to invest stimulus funding to prepare for returning students. Healthcare declined 2%, a meaningful improvement to prior quarters. Customers were more optimistic due to increased income generated from the return to elected procedures and the accelerated vaccination pace. Solutions returned to growth driven by customers refreshing and updating their data centers.
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, the U.K. team increased net sales double digits, and the Canada team drove high single-digit growth. Strong results for both markets were driven by fiscal year-end government spending as well as continued investment by health care and education customers.
Our first quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. We continue to meet the critical demands of our customers. Transactions increased strong double digits and solutions returned to growth, increasing low single digits. Hardware was up strong double digits, driven by excellent notebook growth across all channels, leading to 26% client device growth. Software declined high single digits due to a decline in software licenses, but software gross profit growth remains solid.
While services decreased low single digits when adjusted for overlapping the contribution from the Census project last year, services grew strong double digits, driven by strength in our professional and managed services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition.
We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in Infrastructure as a Service, security, productivity and collaboration. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver.
Our first quarter operating and financial performance reflects the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy for growth. They are important drivers of our past and future performance.
The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment.
And the final driver of our performance is our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to, first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future.
Let me share 2 examples of our strategy in action and how we help customers last quarter. Our Small Business team helped a customer that enables digital platforms to utilize natural language processing and machine learning to upgrade its technology infrastructure after it had been postponed due to COVID last spring. In early 2020, our account manager was working with the customers' technology team on a server upgrade at its primary data center. COVID hit and the customer froze all capital expenditures. Our account manager did a great job nurturing the relationship so that CDW is well positioned to help our customer when the project resumed. Last quarter, the customer was more optimistic about its future prospects and ready to proceed. We get access to capital and wanted to take advantage of its employees still working remotely. The project scope was expanded to upgrade all infrastructure, security, networking, storage, servers and software at its headquarters and its primary data center. The customer relied heavily on our team for its expertise to design and implement the complex solutions.
In 2020, customers had to react quickly to the impact of COVID. In 2021, we see that our customers are being strategic and proactively looking to technology to be more effective and efficient in a post-COVID world.
As I shared earlier, we acquired Amplified IT at the end of the first quarter. We are excited about the opportunity to go to market together with our combined strengths and to orchestrate complete hardware, software, services and cloud solutions that leverage our full stack capabilities and drive full outcomes for and deep engagement with our education customers. We started to execute against this vision immediately. CDW's relationships and extensive contract vehicles with the State Department of Education enabled the customer frictionless access to Amplified IT's portfolio. The school system needed to enhance its communication and collaboration tools to service community in different learning formats, so it centralized and standardized its technology with the help of Amplify IT and CDW to provide the right tools and support to its teachers and students across approximately 250 schools. We are excited about the addition of Amplified IT and see significant opportunity ahead.
These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate our relentless focus on customer service, the importance of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I'm so proud of the way that our teams continue to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remains fully operational. We expect our office coworkers to continue to be remote until at least this fall, with plans underway by our Reunite team to reimagine our future of work, to continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can.
Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are increasing our outlook for both the U.S. IT market growth and CDW's net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market growth to be about 4% and our top line to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency.
For the second quarter, we are encouraged about customer demand to date and how our teams are executing. That said, we are cautious about the supply environment, which, as I mentioned, has become more challenged since the end of the first quarter. While there are other wildcards such as new COVID variants, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects of the business have never been higher. Technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable profitable growth.
CDW's role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition.
Before I turn the call over to Collin for his comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition plans we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Collin for his contributions to CDW over the past 13 years and his strong leadership as our CFO since 2018. Collin has played a significant role in our evolution and consistent market-leading growth as a public company, and he has established a truly best-in-class finance team.
On a personal note, it's been wonderful to be a close colleague of Collin over 13 years, and I've greatly appreciated his partnership. We are also appreciative of Collin's commitment to support CDW in a search for his successor and to remain on the Board to ensure a smooth transition.
With that, I'll turn it over to Collin."

I also want to thank the finance team for bringing it every day. I'll miss CDW, but I'm confident the company has never been stronger and its best days are ahead. Following a successful transition, I'm looking forward to retiring so I can spend more time with family and helping others.
I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.8 billion, up 10.2% on a reported basis and 12% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 fewer selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.9%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 3.9% versus the fourth quarter.
First quarter sales were stronger than expected, reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the timing and slope of the recovery was better than expected in several channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Small Business, CDW Canada and CDW U.K. all delivered strong growth and declines in Corporate and Healthcare improved meaningfully versus the previous quarter.
On the supply side, our team did a great job navigating the challenging environment, leveraging our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships and was able to work down a portion of the backlog in Chromebooks, which was higher than normal coming into the year. This supply, coupled with continued strong demand from education customers, resulted in Education net sales doubling compared to the prior year.
Gross profit for the quarter was $795 million, an increase of 5.1% on a reported basis and 6.8% on an average daily sales basis. Gross margin was 16.4%, down 80 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by lower product margin, including notebook mix and rate and overlapping higher-margin configuration services for the Census project last year, partially offset by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues, merely Software as a Service. 
Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A decreased 5.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and entertainment expense. If you recall, last year, we increased our credit loss reserve as a result of the expected impact of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher investments in coworkers.
Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 10,186. Coworker count increased 204% from the fourth quarter, driven by an increase of approximately 120 customer-facing coworkers, including over 40 from Amplified IT. The increase in coworker count reflects investments to support high-growth solution areas and the digital transformation of our own business. Year-over-year coworker count increased to 82, driven by organic and inorganic investments in coworkers to support high-growth solution areas and our digital transformation, partially offset by cost management actions in 2020.
GAAP operating income was $323 million, up 31.6%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $368 million, up 21%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%, a record high margin for our first quarter, reflecting the benefit of our variable cost structure.
Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 6.1%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from last year's refinancing, partially offset by notes issued in April of 2020. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 19.5%, this resulted in first quarter tax expense of $56 million compared to $44 million last year.
To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, down 70 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to lower global intangible low taxed income and lower nondeductible expenses.
As you can see on Slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $143 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.63, up 40.3%. Our non-GAAP net income was $249 million in the quarter, up 24.7%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% from last year.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $879 million and net debt was $3.1 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $101 million, as shown on Slide 15. This was lighter than a typical first quarter, but expected given last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items.
In Q1, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms and made payments related to the Census. For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, purchasing Amplified IT and returning $415 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $358 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $148 per share.
Moving to Slide 16. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 22 days, up 2 days from last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a 2-day increase in DIO as we made investments in inventory to support customers through the choppy supply environment.
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 17. Our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place, with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the first quarter at 2x, up 0.3 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions, the acquisition of Amplified IT that Chris highlighted as a great example of this. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases.
Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5 to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash return to shareholders. We continue to expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed.
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 18. The current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we are encouraged by the activity and building momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers, where tape writings for corporate and small business were up healthy double digits on a year-over-year basis. We're also seeing good activity at CDW Canada and CDW U.K. 
On the supply side, uncertainty has increased since the first quarter. Our backlog is higher than normal and increasing with lead times extending and visibility challenge with suppliers. Notebooks, certain Chromebooks, displays and pockets of infrastructure hardware are becoming more constrained. Net demand, particularly with commercial customers, feels stronger than 3 months ago, but supply is more challenged.
With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 4%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency, including the contribution from Amplified IT. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 60 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar.
Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the low double digits, call it, 11% to 11.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 50 basis points to earnings per share growth. This updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.30 over last quarter. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate are unchanged from last quarter and can be found on Page 19.
Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. On the February earnings call, we did not provide our first half, second half sales split as we typically because of the uncertainty. Based on our current assessment, we expect the split to be approximately 48.5% to 49% first half, 51.5% to 51% second half. This assumes a slight sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis and equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth in the second quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth. 
If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand, that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the next 3 quarters and potentially into 2022. 
Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 20. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range.
We continue to expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. As we mentioned before, we believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. 
That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cristal to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

I would say the biggest driver is product margin particularly driven by notebook, mix and rate. Obviously, we've had strong growth in Chromebooks and Education.
The other thing that happened in the quarter was really strong growth in our U.K. and Canadian businesses. It was a fiscal year-end for many of their public customers. We had a very strong fiscal year end in those markets, and a lot of those deals tended to be in client devices. So you have public and client device end market mix internationally.
In the previous quarter, Q4 benefited from strong configuration services as we decommissioned the majority of the devices we had from the Census Device as a Service offering last year. A little of that spilled over into the first quarter, but for the most part, it was done.
As you think about gross margin, as you know, we don't provide an outlook. It can bounce around from quarter-to-quarter based on a variety of factors. We do tend to focus on the NOI margin because of our variable cost structure, and that's more variable. 
But if I can just share some thoughts on some of the puts and takes to gross margin as you think about the next couple of quarters. I think from a tailwind perspective, I would expect the longer-term secular trend to 100% gross margin items and as well as us continuing to grow our higher-margin services businesses. In terms of headwinds, we've talked about this for some time, but there's hardware mix, and particularly within the hardware mix, client devices and Chromebooks.
And then from a product margin perspective, I think some things to think about, there's that continuous commoditization that you can see. I think we went through a unique period over the past couple of quarters where we saw customers prioritizing speed and execution over price. We're beginning to move into what I would describe as a more normalized customer behavior environment where customers are willing to wait a little bit longer and prioritize price over speed because the urgency and kind of existential threat of the pandemic and business continuity isn't as great as it was just a few quarters ago.
From an OEM perspective, obviously, there's some supply challenges out there and OEMs are getting as aggressive on special pricing programs as they might with a channel more normalized environment. So I think you have a lot of things going on there.
We have been through cycles like this before. I'd point to the 2018 to 2019 time frame, where our top line ticks up into the high single digits or even low double digits as we sell a lot of hardware, we exceed our 200 to 300 basis point premium by a meaningful amount, but gross margin has a 16 handle on it. And I think that's part of the power of the business model is that we pivot to where the profitable growth is, and that's why we do focus on non-GAAP operating income and EPS and free cash flow."

And I'd say, look, as customers continue to work through their budgets and keep a close eye on the macro environment, the vaccine rollout, that's really going to dictate where they're spending and if we continue to see this uptick in hardware refresh.
In terms of software, look, that can be fairly lumpy as we've talked about before. Depending on the mix of software, this quarter, we saw license -- shorter-term licenses and licenses not as strong, but I'll tell you, SaaS continues to be quite strong across the portfolio. So we don't expect software to start to diminish as we move forward in the year, notwithstanding a hardware refresh. It's still critically important, obviously, to the full stack. So I think we'll continue to see software strong. It's just going to bounce around depending on what's being bought and whether or not it's netted down."

And we have a team actually that goes through the stimulus bills and understands where the dollars are going and frankly, help our customers play a bit in understanding how and where and when they can spend their dollars. So we see there's an absolute tailwind and our customers do look to us to help understand how best to utilize those cons.
If you look at the most recent of the American Rescue plan in March, there's about $350 billion going to state and local and $130 billion going to K-12. So we certainly look forward to helping them use those and invest in technology as they come out of the current environment."

We hold ourselves accountable for that. And when we sell a lot of hardware, as you know, which is recognized at full revenue, we tend to outperform that premium. So we brought it up to 300 to 400 basis points. When you think about the mix of hardware, that seems to make a lot of sense to us. 
So if I just go through the math, if we take Census out of the baseline, which contribute about 2 -- 200 to 240 basis points to premium last year, we're looking at a good 500 to 600 basis points this year by bringing our premium up those 100 basis points. So when you ask about whether or not we -- that's a kind of durable forecast or outlook for outperformance, I would say it really depends on the mix. In years where we have high hardware, we tend to outperform because we recognize much of what we sell on a full net sales basis. In times when we have slower sales of hardware, and we have more netted down items, that's when we'll see the top line more muted. So we're hesitant to commit to a higher premium generally because of the mix of the business. And the beauty of the model is exactly that mix of the business. We've got the full range of IT products and we go where our customers need them when they need us. So I don't see us bringing that up to a higher level at any point soon, but rather toggling to where our customers need us."

But I do have to ask -- I mean I know there's notebook demand, but devices have been strong for some time. Sequentially, SMB and international grew most, which are among the higher gross margin segments. But this gross margin compression is so much more than normal.

This is one of the parts of the job that I won't miss down the road. But putting all the mix issues aside, we are seeing some product margin compression in certain categories.
And just to go a little bit deeper on some of the comments I've made before. Again, I just -- I think 2020 was really unique in the way that customers were prioritizing speed and execution overtaking every last basis point off the table in terms of their IT buying behavior. And I think now that we're moving into a different phase of the pandemic where that mission-critical nature of getting that IT purchase as quickly as possible, just isn't there, we're seeing a return to kind of some of that more normal customer buying behavior.
I would characterize the competitive environment as competitive, not irrational, but we compete in a highly competitive marketplace. From an OEM perspective, they are obviously wrestling with higher input costs and supply challenges, right? And so because of that -- [indiscernible] a couple of things. One, they are not incentivized to aggressively invest as much in the channel and special pricing programs and things like that, that they might in a more normal supply environment and a more normal competitive environment where they're battling it out to gain share. And in some instances, they're taking those higher costs and passing them along in the form of price increases. 
Now we do work on a cost-plus model, as we've talked about over the years, but if you just think about the math of the way a price increase works, if, for argument's sake, we make $100 per unit of gross profit on a notebook. And that notebook price goes up by 5% or 10%, that is a lower reported gross margin percentage. So I think those are some of the dynamics that are driving some of the changes we're seeing on product margin currently versus some of the preceding quarters."

And I guess taking a step back, I'd be curious for your perspective on just how customers are balancing the desire to refresh or invest in their on-prem footprint versus this push to accelerate the move toward the public cloud going forward?"

If you think across our customers here, quite a bit about when people are going back or returning to the office. And I'll tell you, well, certainly there you see in the news a couple of larger organizations that are returning to the office pretty quickly in this summer, most of our customers around -- across Commercial and Small Business are still, I'd say, not rushing. They're still planning and they're still a little cautious because they've got employees on both sides of the spectrum. Those who want to get back and those who frankly aren't yet ready to get back.
So first, I would just say we're in a time right now where as the vaccination at pace might accelerate and we see what happens over the next couple of years. We've got to be patient for a couple of months. All that said, clearly, the hybrid world is here to stay and our customers are thinking and planning around how to have flexible, where people are now calling high flex environment, hybrid and flexible environment.
And so we are in the -- we are still planning with them. We are seeing some customers that have had just old infrastructure and a real need to upgrade, get to it over the past couple of months. But we are still heavily in the phase of, I'll call it, assessment to optimize, whether old plans to upgrade throughout the window and we start to move more to cloud, whether customers think more strongly about on-prem cloud-like solutions, which are now really readily available and of great interest.
So what I would say Matt is that we're still -- customers are still assessing and they're being more reflected. As Collin mentioned, last year, there was just a kind of a rush to get business continuity. And now there's a more measured reflected strategic approach on what's going to be durable competitive advantage for the long term. 
So what does that all mean? We have seen customers spending more on infrastructure, hardware infrastructure. Obviously, cloud is doing really quite well. We saw a server uptick. Storage is getting stronger. One would expect we'd see NetComm really come to life later in the year or midyear as customers are heading back to the office. But there's -- on-prem hardware is not going to go away, it's just what's going to be most optimal. And as I said, customers are really weighing the benefits right now."

If you look historically what has driven the increase in sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, Education is, by far, the #1 factor when you look across our end markets. So we just come into the typical education peak season with a much stronger base. And we've talked about several quarters now of unusual or abnormal education seasonality. So I would say that's the first driver.
I touched on a couple of other ones in my prepared comments. But again, just an unusually strong public year-end finish in the U.K. and Canada. I know it's public year-end every year in the first quarter, but we just had a particularly strong finish this year.
And then we also carried a little bit of Census revenue in the first quarter as we completed the device to decommissioning. We are completely done with that and have no Census revenue going forward.
I think the other thing that I would think about, and I made this comment in one of the answers earlier, was that our backlog was relatively unchanged over the course of the first quarter. If supply is more resilient than we think, I don't think it -- but if supply is more resilient and we can begin whittling down that backlog or if demand is even greater, and supply can keep up with that greater demand, I think that could provide some upside in terms of sequential growth and into the back half of the year. We just don't have the visibility at this point, though, to build that confidence on supply into the full year outlook and into the second quarter."

So there is some capacity there. It's tight. And again, I think we would use more of a flexible model and more of a renting space in the short term as we need it until we get a better sense of what supply and demand look like over the longer term."

Our guidance isn't dependent on when or how many people we get back into the office or going on to customer sites. So we've really done a great job. The team has done a great job of staying connected and staying productive. So we're not -- it's not dependent on that.
In terms of going back to the office and how we think about that, a couple of things. First of all, we have coworkers on both ends of the spectrum. As I mentioned before, as most companies do, we've got some who are really eager to be back and some who are still cautious until we get through the pandemic more fully. 
So what we've done is we've created opportunities for customer -- for coworkers to come together and have social and networking time in a safe way. We've also given guidance to our coworkers who are customer-facing around getting together with customers who would like to get together again in a safe way, and that started to happen.
We also have customers who are very comfortable with our service provision in a remote way, which we've been doing throughout the pandemic, but we also have customers who are now opening up and allowing us back on site. We have bases that are opening, et cetera.
So I guess I'd say, look, we're doing very well from a productivity and connectivity perspective. We are starting to get together with customers in-person. And you can imagine it depends on what's happening within each state, for example, or each country. I think the U.K. just had their garden pubs open, and that was a big event and customers do want to get together.
But we're going to do this right. We don't really want to do this with [indiscernible].  That's really the key for us. We want to be able to have our coworkers come back together in a way that is -- continues our highly engaged and high-performing culture and keeps the customer at the center of how we actually work together so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else."

For those who are going -- have some folks going back into the office. What we're observing is a continued investment in mobile employees, the ability to be in the office on a flexible basis, the ability to move around the office and use the office in a different way. 
Now the question is, what work are you doing in the office? And do you even more collaboration spaces and the ability for your employees to have mobile devices that they can move around with eCom? So I would say our view is that the flexible hybrid work environment is what the preponderance of our customers expect to be in over the long term. And that includes notebooks, a higher density of notebooks, obviously, more enterprise-level collaboration capabilities.
We do have some customers who are contemplating whether to have a desktop in the office and a notebook at home for coworkers, it really depends on the industry. Things like lockers and hoteling are really points of discussion now. But that's what we're seeing overall, if that's helpful."

I guess if I think about K-12 education, I'll start with K-12, there are a couple of things. Device demand continues to remain strong because there is such a gap to that one-on-one device ratio that schools are trying to get to for equity and access and also for something they're referring to as learning loss of these gaps that might have happened over the pandemic. So there's plenty of headroom for devices going forward.
With regard to CDW, what we face are tough compares from last year. So if you think about our growth over last year, very tough compares, but the demand is strong. The other thing I would say is, as we're going into the next school year, schools are figuring -- and we're working with schools to figure out how to create the most optimal classroom experience, and that would be a blended experience, hybrid experience all in-class. Schools really have -- they're looking at the ways of learning that they can use technology within a classroom or outside the classroom that we're working the walls at the school in much more creative ways. 
So from an infrastructure, I call it networking and particular perspective, we would expect to see upticks there. And then think of audio and visual. The older interactive flat screen panels are getting old now, but there are newer availabilities of solutions that work better. So that's another opportunity to help really modernize the classroom.
So net-net, demand will remain strong with regard to devices, but the opportunity for infrastructure, network augmentation and for video will be a good opportunity as well."

I'll begin this morning with an overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. 
We had a strong first quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the first quarter, net sales were $4.8 billion, 12% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of 1 fewer business day in the first quarter of 2021 than 2020, and up 10.9% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 5.1% to $795 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $368 million, an increase of 21%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% on a reported basis and up 25.3% in constant currency. 
The diversity of our end markets and solutions portfolio continued to serve us well, providing balance and driving our strong results as we overlap last year's end-of-quarter surge in demand for remote solutions. During the first quarter, we saw early signs of recovery as customers became more optimistic about the macroeconomic environment due to lower COVID case count, higher vaccination rates and new government stimulus. Customer spending and channels most impacted by COVID last year rebounded.  
We continue to help customers with remote enablement, resource optimization, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. This past quarter, customers allocated more technology spend to infrastructure needs, driving growth for our solutions portfolio. Customers were focused on investments for the future, reconfiguring how they interact customers, strengthening hybrid environments, industrializing remote enablement and restarting projects that had been delayed due to COVID. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. 
Customers choose CDW for 3 simple reasons. First, customers want a partner who know their business and their industry. Second, customers want to partner with broad and deep technical capabilities. And third, they want a partner who is focused on the optimal outcome, one who is agnostic across brand, technology and consumption model and has an informed opinion. These reasons are fundamental to why CDW outperformed in the first quarter and will continue to win in the marketplace. 
During the first quarter, we remained focused on executing against our strategy and investing in high relevance and high-growth solutions and services capabilities, including our acquisition of Amplified IT. Amplified IT is a Google premium education partner and a leading provider of cloud-based services, solutions and software for education customers and has been a partner of CDW since 2016. We share a similar culture that puts customers first, and together, we will accelerate our work to help customers' schools achieve great educational outcomes through technology. 
Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers' extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges. Supply constraints and availability for client devices and some infrastructure products have been more challenging since the first quarter ended. Disruption has been caused by both component availability issues and supply chain logistical issues. 
The supply situation is fluid. Constraints will likely continue through the second half of the year and potentially into next year. 
Now let's take a deeper look at first quarter customer end market performance. Corporate declined 4% as customer spend continued to recover. Customer expectations that a hybrid environment will become the future work model drove investments in notebooks and other remote enablement tools, while desktop and video sales declined. 
Solutions performance was flat, a significant improvement versus the previous quarter as net comm and data center projects returned. 
Small Business delivered strong growth, increasing 12% as optimism improved. Our team helped customers with remote enablement, netcomm and data center projects, leading to solid growth in both transactional and solution spend. 
Net sales for our government channel decreased high single digit. Federal declined mid-single digits. However, excluding our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau, Federal grew high single digits, led by engagements for the Department of Defense across both transactional and solutions categories. 
The state and local channel decreased high single digits. Customers paused their spending as they took a wait-and-see approach during the quarter for a stimulus support under the new administration. 
Education again grew triple digits, achieving over 100% growth, powered by K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access as well as ways to address learning loss, which drove strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers turn to us for holistic capabilities and expertise to help schools enable a variety of learning models, remote, hybrid, blended and in-person. 
Higher ed increased low single digits. Growth slowed versus prior quarters as customers assess their plans to invest stimulus funding to prepare for returning students. 
Healthcare declined 2%, a meaningful improvement to prior quarters. Customers were more optimistic due to increased income generated from the return to elective procedures and the accelerated vaccination pace. Solutions returned to growth driven by customers refreshing and updating their data centers. 
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, the U.K. team increased net sales double digits, and the Canada team drove high single-digit growth. Strong results for both markets were driven by fiscal year-end government spending as well as continued investment by health care and education customers. 
Our first quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers. Transactions increased strong double digits and solutions returned to growth, increasing low single digits. Hardware was up strong double digits, driven by excellent notebook growth across all channels, leading to 26% client device growth. Software declined high single digits due to a decline in software licenses, but software gross profit growth remains solid. 
While services decreased low single digits when adjusted for overlapping the contribution from the Census project last year, services grew strong double digits, driven by strength in our professional and managed services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. 
We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in Infrastructure as a Service, security, productivity and collaboration. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver. 
Our first quarter operating and financial performance reflects the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy for growth. They are important drivers of our past and future performance. 
The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. 
And the final driver of our performance is our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to, first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. 
Let me share 2 examples of our strategy in action and how we help customers last quarter. Our Small Business team helped a customer that enables digital platforms to utilize natural language processing and machine learning to upgrade its technology infrastructure after it had been postponed due to COVID last spring. In early 2020, our account manager was working with the customer's technology team on a server upgrade at its primary data center. COVID hit and the customer froze all capital expenditures. Our account manager did a great job nurturing the relationship so that CDW is well positioned to help our customer when the project resumed. 
Last quarter, the customer was more optimistic about its future prospects and ready to proceed. It got access to capital and wanted to take advantage of its employees still working remotely. The project scope was expanded to upgrade all infrastructure, security, networking, storage, servers and software at its headquarters and its primary data center. The customer relied heavily on our team for its expertise to design and implement the complex solutions. 
In 2020, customers had to react quickly to the impact of COVID. In 2021, we see that our customers are being strategic and proactively looking to technology to be more effective and efficient in a post-COVID world. 
As I shared earlier, we acquired Amplified IT at the end of the first quarter. We are excited about the opportunity to go to market together with our combined strengths and to orchestrate complete hardware, software, services and cloud solutions that leverage our full stack capabilities and drive full outcomes for and deep engagement with our education customers. 
We started to execute against this vision immediately. CDW's relationships and extensive contract vehicles with the State Department of Education enabled the customer frictionless access to Amplified IT's portfolio. The school system needed to enhance its communication and collaboration tools to service community in different learning formats, so it centralized and standardized its technology with the help of Amplified IT and CDW to provide the right tools and support to its teachers and students across approximately 250 schools. We are excited about the addition of Amplified IT and see significant opportunity ahead. 
These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate our relentless focus on customer service, the importance of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I'm so proud of the way that our teams continue to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. We expect our office coworkers to continue to be remote until at least this fall, with plans underway by our ReunITe team to reimagine our future of work to continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can. 
Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are increasing our outlook for both the U.S. IT market growth and CDW's net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market growth to be about 4% and our top line to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. 
For the second quarter, we are encouraged about customer demand to date and how our teams are executing. That said, we are cautious about the supply environment, which, as I mentioned, has become more challenged since the end of the first quarter. While there are other wildcards such as new COVID variants, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects of the business have never been higher. Technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable profitable growth. 
CDW's role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition. 
Before I turn the call over to Collin for his comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition plans we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Collin for his contributions to CDW over the past 13 years and his strong leadership as our CFO since 2018. Collin has played a significant role in our evolution and consistent market-leading growth as a public company, and he has established a truly best-in-class finance team. 
On a personal note, it's been wonderful to be a close colleague of Collin's over 13 years, and I've greatly appreciated his partnership. We are also appreciative of Collin's commitment to support CDW in the search for his successor and to remain on the Board to ensure a smooth transition. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Collin."

My 13 years at CDW have been among the most rewarding of my career, and I want to thank you, the leadership team and all coworkers for making CDW so special. I also want to thank the finance team for bringing it every day. I'll miss CDW, but I'm confident the company has never been stronger and its best days are ahead. Following a successful transition, I'm looking forward to retiring so I can spend more time with family and helping others. 
I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.8 billion, up 10.2% on a reported basis and 12% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 fewer selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.9%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 3.9% versus the fourth quarter. 
First quarter sales were stronger than expected, reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the timing and slope of the recovery was better than expected in several channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Small Business, CDW Canada and CDW U.K. all delivered strong growth and declines in Corporate and Healthcare improved meaningfully versus the previous quarter. 
On the supply side, our team did a great job navigating the challenging environment, leveraging our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships and was able to work down a portion of the backlog in Chromebooks, which was higher than normal coming into the year. This supply, coupled with continued strong demand from education customers, resulted in education net sales doubling compared to the prior year. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $795 million, an increase of 5.1% on a reported basis and 6.8% on an average daily sales basis. Gross margin was 16.4%, down 80 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by lower product margin, including notebook mix and rate and overlapping higher-margin configuration services for the Census project last year, partially offset by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service.  
Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A decreased 5.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and entertainment expense. If you recall, last year, we increased our credit loss reserve as a result of the expected impact of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher investments in coworkers. 
Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 10,186. Coworker count increased 204 from the fourth quarter, driven by an increase of approximately 120 customer-facing coworkers, including over 40 from Amplified IT. The increase in coworker count reflects investments to support high-growth solution areas and the digital transformation of our own business. Year-over-year coworker count increased to 82, driven by organic and inorganic investments in coworkers to support high-growth solution areas and our digital transformation, partially offset by cost management actions in 2020. 
GAAP operating income was $323 million, up 31.6%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $368 million, up 21%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%, a record high margin for our first quarter, reflecting the benefit of our variable cost structure. 
Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 6.1%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from last year's refinancing, partially offset by notes issued in April of 2020. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 19.5%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $56 million compared to $44 million last year. 
To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, down 70 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to lower global intangible low-taxed income and lower nondeductible expenses. 
As you can see on Slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 143 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.63, up 40.3%. 
Our non-GAAP net income was $249 million in the quarter, up 24.7%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% from last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $879 million and net debt was $3.1 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $101 million, as shown on Slide 15. This was lighter than a typical first quarter, but expected given last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items. 
In Q1, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms and made payments related to the Census. 
For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, purchasing Amplified IT and returning $415 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $358 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $148 per share. 
Moving to Slide 16. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 22 days, up 2 days from last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a 2-day increase in DIO as we made investments in inventory to support customers through the choppy supply environment. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 17. Our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place, with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the first quarter at 2x, up 0.3 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Amplified IT that Chris highlighted is a great example of this. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. 
Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5 to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash return to shareholders. We continue to expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. 
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 18. The current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we are encouraged by the activity and building momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers, where April writings for corporate and small business were up healthy double digits on a year-over-year basis. We're also seeing good activity at CDW Canada and CDW U.K.  
On the supply side, uncertainty has increased since the first quarter. Our backlog is higher than normal and increasing with lead times extending and visibility challenged at suppliers. Notebooks, certain Chromebooks, displays and pockets of infrastructure hardware are becoming more constrained. Net demand, particularly with commercial customers, feels stronger than 3 months ago, but supply is more challenged. 
With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 4%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency, including the contribution from Amplified IT. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 60 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. 
Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the low double digits, call it, 11% to 11.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 50 basis points to earnings per share growth. This updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.30 over last quarter. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate are unchanged from last quarter and can be found on Page 19. 
Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. On the February earnings call, we did not provide a first half, second half sales split as we typically would because of the uncertainty. Based on our current assessment, we expect the split to be approximately 48.5% to 49% first half, 51.5% to 51% second half. This assumes a slight sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis and equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth in the second quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth.  
If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand, that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the next 3 quarters and potentially into 2022.  
Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 20. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. 
We continue to expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. As we mentioned before, we believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls.  
That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cristal to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

I guess maybe first question, this is the one I'm getting asked by clients a lot. Please step back and talk a little bit of what happened to gross margin, at least on a sequential basis, I'll hold on the year-over-year. But what drove the drop on a sequential basis, the lowest we've seen in a while. And then how will be gross margins progressing as we go through the year?"

On both the year-over-year and sequential basis, there's some recurring things. I would say the biggest driver is product margin particularly driven by notebook, mix and rate.

I would say the biggest driver is product margin particularly driven by notebook, mix and rate. Obviously, we've had strong growth in Chromebooks in education.
The other thing that happened in the quarter was really strong growth in our U.K. and Canadian businesses. It was a fiscal year-end for many of their public customers. We had a very strong fiscal year end in those markets, and a lot of those deals tended to be in client devices. So you have public and client device end market mix internationally.
In the previous quarter, Q4 benefited from strong configuration services as we decommissioned the majority of the devices we had from the Census Device as a Service offering last year. A little of that spilled over into the first quarter, but for the most part, it was done.
As you think about gross margin, as you know, we don't provide an outlook. It can bounce around from quarter-to-quarter based on a variety of factors. We do tend to focus on the NGLI margin because of our variable cost structure, and that's more variable. 
But if I can just share some thoughts on some of the puts and takes to gross margin as you think about the next couple of quarters. I think from a tailwind perspective, I would expect the longer-term secular trend to 100% gross margin items and as well as us continuing to grow our higher-margin services businesses. In terms of headwinds, we've talked about this for some time, but there's hardware mix, and particularly within the hardware mix, client devices and Chromebooks.
And then from a product margin perspective, I think some things to think about, there's that continuous commoditization that you can see. I think we went through a unique period over the past couple of quarters where we saw customers prioritizing speed and execution over price. We're beginning to move into what I would describe as a more normalized customer behavior environment where customers are willing to wait a little bit longer and prioritize price over speed because the urgency and kind of existential threat of the pandemic in business continuity isn't as great as it was just a few quarters ago.
From an OEM perspective, obviously, there's some supply challenges out there and OEMs aren't getting as aggressive on special pricing programs as they might with a channel with more normalized environment. So I think you have a lot of things going on there.
We have been through cycles like this before. I'd point to the 2018 to 2019 time frame, where our top line ticks up into the high single digits or even low double digits as we sell a lot of hardware, we exceed our 200 to 300 basis point premium by a meaningful amount, but gross margin has a [ '16 ] handle on it. And I think that's part of the power of the business model is that we pivot to where the profitable growth is, and that's why we do focus on non-GAAP operating income and EPS and free cash flow."

One thing, Amit. And I'd say, look, as customers continue to work through their budgets and keep a close eye on the macro environment, the vaccine rollout, that's really going to dictate where they're spending and if we continue to see this uptick in hardware refresh.
In terms of software, look, that can be fairly lumpy as we've talked about before. Depending on the mix of software, this quarter, we saw license -- shorter-term licenses and licenses not as strong, but I'll tell you, SaaS continues to be quite strong across the portfolio. So we don't expect software to start to diminish as we move forward in the year, notwithstanding a hardware refresh. It's still critically important, obviously, to the full stack. So I think we'll continue to see software strong. It's just going to bounce around depending on what's being bought and whether or not it's netted down."

I think about it a little bit like getting an elephant through the snake. It takes some time to actually get it moving through the system.
So when you think about the 3 different stimulus acts that have been passed last March and then last December and then most recently in March, there are funds that have been available for state and local K-12 and Healthcare, in particular, where we see the most benefit for our customers. And we have a team actually that goes through the stimulus bills and understands where the dollars are going and frankly, help our customers quite a bit in understanding how and where and when they can spend their dollars. So we see it as an absolute tailwind and our customers do look to us to help understand how best to utilize those funds.
If you look at the most recent of the American Rescue Plan in March, there's about $350 billion going to state and local and $130 billion going to K-12. So we certainly look forward to helping them use those and invest in technology as they come out of the current environment."

We hold ourselves accountable for that. And when we sell a lot of hardware, as you know, which is recognized at full revenue, we tend to outperform that premium. So we brought it up to 300 to 400 basis points. When you think about the mix of hardware, that seems to make a lot of sense to us. 
So if I just go through the math. If we take Census out of the baseline, which contribute about 2 -- 200 to 240 basis points to premium last year, we're looking at a good 500 to 600 basis points this year by bringing our premium up those 100 basis points. So when you ask about whether or not we, as I said, kind of durable forecast or outlook for outperformance, I would say it really depends on the mix. 
In years where we have high hardware, we tend to outperform because we recognize much of what we sell on a full net sales basis. In times when we have slower sales of hardware, and we have more netted down items, that's when we'll see the top line more muted. 
So we're hesitant to commit to a higher premium generally because of the mix of the business. And the beauty of the model is exactly that mix of the business. We've got the full range of IT products and we go where our customers need them when they need us. So I don't see us bringing that up to a higher level at any point soon, but rather toggling to where our customers need us."

And maybe as a follow-up, Collin, congrats, and I'm sure there's going to be some aspects of the job that you won't miss like this one where I'm going to beat a dead horse on gross margin.
But I do have to ask. I mean I know there's notebook demand, but devices have been strong for some time. Sequentially, SMB and international grew most, which are among the higher gross margin segments. But this gross margin compression is so much more than normal.
So I guess the question would be, on a like-for-like product basis, are you seeing pressure on gross margin? And why? Is there inflation or price increases that you're eating more of or sharing in some of the pain that's helping you to gain some share?"

But putting all the mix issues aside, we are seeing some product margin compression in certain categories. And just to go a little bit deeper on some of the comments I've made before. 
Again, I just -- I think 2020 was really unique in the way that customers were prioritizing speed and execution overtaking every last basis point off the table in terms of their IT buying behavior. And I think now that we're moving into a different phase of the pandemic where that mission-critical nature of getting that IT purchase as quickly as possible just isn't there, we're seeing a return to kind of some of that more normal customer buying behavior.  
I would characterize the competitive environment as competitive, not irrational, but we compete in a highly competitive marketplace. 
From an OEM perspective, they are obviously wrestling with higher input costs and supply challenges, right? And so because of that -- that drives a couple of things. One, they are not incentivized to aggressively invest as much in the channel and special pricing programs and things like that, that they might in a more normal supply environment and a more normal competitive environment where they're battling it out to gain share. And in some instances, they're taking those higher costs and passing them along in the form of price increases. 
Now we do work on a cost-plus model, as we've talked about over the years. But if you just think about the math of the way a price increase works, if, for argument's sake, we make $100 per unit of gross profit on a notebook. And that notebook price goes up by 5% or 10%, that is going to be a lower reported gross margin percentage. So I think those are some of the dynamics that are driving some of the changes we're seeing on product margin currently versus some of the preceding quarters."

If you think across our customers, you hear quite a bit about when people are going back or returning to the office. And I'll tell you, while certainly there you see in the news a couple of large organizations that are returning to the office pretty quickly in the summer, most of our customers around -- across Commercial and Small Business are still, I'd say, not rushing. They're still planning and they're still a little cautious because they've got employees on both sides of the spectrum. Those who want to get back and those who frankly aren't yet ready to get back.
So first, I would just say we're in a time right now where as the vaccination pace might accelerate and we see what happens over the next couple of years. We've got to be patient for a couple of months. All that said, clearly, the hybrid world is here to stay and our customers are thinking and planning around how to have flexible -- where people are now calling Hyflex environment, hybrid and flexible environment.
And so we are in the -- we are still planning with them. We are seeing some customers that have had just old infrastructure and a real need to upgrade get to it over the past couple of months. But we are still heavily in the phase of, I'll call it, assessment to optimize, whether old plans to upgrade throughout the window and we start to move more to cloud, whether customers think more strongly about on-prem cloud-like solutions, which are now really readily available and of great interest.
So what I would say, Matt, is that we're still -- customers are still assessing and they're being more reflective. As Collin mentioned, last year, there was just a kind of a rush to get business continuity. And now there's a more measured, reflective strategic approach on what's going to be durable competitive advantage for the long term. 
So what does that all mean? We have seen customers spending more on infrastructure, hardware infrastructure. Obviously, cloud is doing really quite well. We saw a server uptick. Storage is getting stronger. One would expect we'd see netcomm really come to life later in the year or midyear as customers are heading back to the office. But there's -- on-prem hardware is not going to go away, it's just what's going to be most optimal. And as I said, customers are really weighing the benefits right now."

If you look historically what has driven the increase in sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, education is, by far, the #1 factor when you look across our end markets. So we just come into the typical education peak season with a much stronger base. And we've talked about several quarters now of unusual or abnormal education seasonality. So I would say that's the first driver.
I touched on a couple of other ones in my prepared comments. But again, just an unusually strong public year-end finish in the U.K. and Canada. I know it's public year-end every year in the first quarter, but we just had a particularly strong finish this year.
And then we also carried a little bit of Census revenue in the first quarter as we completed the device to decommissioning. We are completely done with that and have no Census revenue going forward.
I think the other thing that I would think about, and I made this comment in one of the answers earlier, was that our backlog was relatively unchanged over the course of the first quarter. If supply is more resilient than we think -- actually, I don't think it is. But if supply is more resilient and we can begin whittling down that backlog or if demand is even greater, and supply can keep up with that greater demand, I think that could provide some upside in terms of sequential growth and into the back half of the year. We just don't have the visibility at this point, though, to build that confidence on supply into the full year outlook and into the second quarter."

In terms of adding another distribution center, I don't know that in the next few years, we would have a -- build another 0.5 million square foot distribution center. I think we would look at more dynamic and flexible models, working with third-party logistics organizations and really thinking through how to optimize our footprint across the U.S. from a supply chain perspective.
Oh, and I think you had a question on utilization. Yes. Look, the distribution centers are busy. There's no doubt about that. Part of that is us flexing our muscles and where we can, bringing inventory in and configuring that and staging it for our customers and helping them through this choppy environment. 
So there is some capacity there. It's tight. And again, I think we would use more of a flexible model and more of a renting space in the short term as we need it until we get a better sense of what supply and demand look like over the longer term."

The team has done a great job of staying connected and staying productive. So we're not -- it's not dependent on that.
In terms of going back to the office and how we think about that, a couple of things. First of all, we have coworkers on both ends of the spectrum. As I mentioned before, as most companies do, we've got some who are really eager to be back and some who are still cautious until we get through the pandemic more fully. 
So what we've done is we've created opportunities for customer -- for coworkers to come together and have social and networking time in a safe way. We've also given guidance to our coworkers who are customer-facing around getting together with customers who would like to get together again in a safe way, and that started to happen.
We also have customers who are very comfortable with our service provision in a remote way, which we've been doing throughout the pandemic. But we also have customers who are now opening up and allowing us back on site. We have bases that are opening, et cetera.
So I guess I'd say, look, we're doing very well from a productivity and connectivity perspective. We are starting to get together with customers in-person. And you can imagine it depends on what's happening within each state, for example, or each country. I think the U.K. just had their garden pubs open, and that was a big event and customers do want to get together.
But we're going to do this right. We don't really want to do this with fits and starts. That's really the key for us. We want to be able to have our coworkers come back together in a way that is -- continues our highly engaged and high-performing culture and keeps the customer at the center of how we actually work together so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else."

So there's plenty of headroom for devices going forward.
With regard to CDW, what we face are tough compares from last year. So if you think about our growth over last year, very tough compares, but the demand is strong. The other thing I would say is, as we're going into the next school year, schools are figuring -- and we're working with schools to figure out how to create the most optimal classroom experience, and that would be a blended experience, hybrid experience, all in-class. Schools really have -- they're looking at the ways of learning that they can use technology within a classroom or outside the classroom but within the walls of the school in much more creative ways. 
So from an infrastructure, I call it networking and particular perspective, we would expect to see upticks there. And then think of audio and visual. The older interactive flat screen panels are getting old now, but there are newer availabilities of solutions that work better. So that's another opportunity to help really modernize the classroom.
So net-net, demand will remain strong with regard to devices, but the opportunity for infrastructure, network augmentation and for video will be a good opportunity as well."

I'll begin this morning with an overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. 
We had a strong first quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the first quarter, net sales were $4.8 billion, 12% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of 1 fewer business day in the first quarter of 2021 than 2020, and up 10.9% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 5.1% to $795 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $368 million, an increase of 21%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% on a reported basis and up 25.3% in constant currency. 
The diversity of our end markets and solutions portfolio continued to serve us well, providing balance and driving our strong results as we overlapped last year's end-of-quarter surge in demand for remote solutions. During the first quarter, we saw early signs of recovery as customers became more optimistic about the macroeconomic environment due to lower COVID case count, higher vaccination rates and new government stimulus. Customer spending in channels most impacted by COVID last year rebounded. 
We continue to help customers with remote enablement, resource optimization, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. This past quarter, customers allocated more technology spend to infrastructure needs, driving growth for our solutions portfolio. Customers were focused on investments for the future, reconfiguring how they interact with customers, strengthening hybrid environments, industrializing remote enablement and restarting projects that had been delayed due to COVID. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. 
Customers choose CDW for 3 simple reasons. First, customers want a partner who know their business and their industry. Second, customers want to partner with broad and deep technical capabilities. And third, they want a partner who is focused on the optimal outcome, one who is agnostic across brand, technology and consumption model and has an informed opinion. These reasons are fundamental to why CDW outperformed in the first quarter and will continue to win in the marketplace. 
During the first quarter, we remained focused on executing against our strategy and investing in high relevance and high-growth solutions and services capabilities, including our acquisition of Amplified IT. Amplified IT is a Google premium education partner and a leading provider of cloud-based services, solutions and software for education customers and has been a partner of CDW since 2016. We share a similar culture that puts customers first, and together, we will accelerate our work to help customers' schools achieve great educational outcomes through technology. 
Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers' extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges. Supply constraints and availability for client devices and some infrastructure products have been more challenging since the first quarter ended. Disruption has been caused by both component availability issues and supply chain logistical issues. 
The supply situation is fluid. Constraints will likely continue through the second half of the year and potentially into next year. 
Now let's take a deeper look at first quarter customer end market performance. Corporate declined 4% as customer spend continued to recover. Customer expectations that a hybrid environment will become the future work model drove investments in notebooks and other remote enablement tools, while desktop and video sales declined. 
Solutions performance was flat, a significant improvement versus the previous quarter as net comm and data center projects returned. 
Small Business delivered strong growth, increasing 12% as optimism improved. Our team helped customers with remote enablement, netcomm and data center projects, leading to solid growth in both transactional and solution spend. 
Net sales for our government channel decreased high single digit. Federal declined mid-single digits. However, excluding our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau, Federal grew high single digits, led by engagements for the Department of Defense across both transactional and solutions categories. 
The state and local channel decreased high single digits. Customers paused their spending as they took a wait-and-see approach during the quarter for a stimulus support under the new administration. 
Education again grew triple digits, achieving over 100% growth, powered by K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access as well as ways to address learning loss, which drove strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers turn to us for holistic capabilities and expertise to help schools enable a variety of learning models, remote, hybrid, blended and in-person. 
Higher ed increased low single digits. Growth slowed versus prior quarters as customers assessed their plans to invest stimulus funding to prepare for returning students. 
Healthcare declined 2%, a meaningful improvement to prior quarters. Customers were more optimistic due to increased income generated from the return to elective procedures and the accelerated vaccination pace. Solutions returned to growth driven by customers refreshing and updating their data centers. 
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, the U.K. team increased net sales double digits, and the Canada team drove high single-digit growth. Strong results for both markets were driven by fiscal year-end government spending as well as continued investment by health care and education customers. 
Our first quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers. Transactions increased strong double digits and solutions returned to growth, increasing low single digits. Hardware was up strong double digits, driven by excellent notebook growth across all channels, leading to 26% client device growth. Software declined high single digits due to a decline in software licenses, but software gross profit growth remained solid. 
While services decreased low single digits, when adjusted for overlapping the contribution from the Census project last year, services grew strong double digits, driven by strength in our professional and managed services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. 
We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in Infrastructure as a Service, security, productivity and collaboration. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver. 
Our first quarter operating and financial performance reflects the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy for growth. They are important drivers of our past and future performance. 
The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. 
And the final driver of our performance is our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to, first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. 
Let me share 2 examples of our strategy in action and how we helped customers last quarter. Our Small Business team helped a customer that enables digital platforms to utilize natural language processing and machine learning to upgrade its technology infrastructure after it had been postponed due to COVID last spring. In early 2020, our account manager was working with the customer's technology team on a server upgrade at its primary data center. COVID hit and the customer froze all capital expenditures. Our account manager did a great job nurturing the relationship so that CDW is well positioned to help our customer when the project resumed. 
Last quarter, the customer was more optimistic about its future prospects and ready to proceed. It got access to capital and wanted to take advantage of its employees still working remotely. The project scope was expanded to upgrade all infrastructure, security, networking, storage, servers and software at its headquarters and its primary data center. The customer relied heavily on our team for its expertise to design and implement the complex solutions. 
In 2020, customers had to react quickly to the impact of COVID. In 2021, we see that our customers are being strategic and proactively looking to technology to be more effective and efficient in a post-COVID world. 
As I shared earlier, we acquired Amplified IT at the end of the first quarter. We are excited about the opportunity to go to market together with our combined strengths and to orchestrate complete hardware, software, services and cloud solutions that leverage our full stack capabilities and drive full outcomes for and deep engagement with our education customers. 
We started to execute against this vision immediately. CDW's relationships and extensive contract vehicles with the State Department of Education enabled the customer frictionless access to Amplified IT's portfolio. The school system needed to enhance its communication and collaboration tools to service community in different learning formats, so it centralized and standardized its technology with the help of Amplified IT and CDW to provide the right tools and support to its teachers and students across approximately 250 schools. We are excited about the addition of Amplified IT and see significant opportunity ahead. 
These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate our relentless focus on customer service, the importance of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I'm so proud of the way that our teams continue to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. We expect our office coworkers to continue to be remote until at least this fall, with plans underway by our ReunITe team to reimagine our future of work to continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can. 
Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are increasing our outlook for both the U.S. IT market growth and CDW's net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market growth to be about 4% and our top line to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. 
For the second quarter, we are encouraged about customer demand to date and how our teams are executing. That said, we are cautious about the supply environment, which, as I mentioned, has become more challenged since the end of the first quarter. While there are other wildcards such as new COVID variants, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects of the business have never been higher. Technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable profitable growth. 
CDW's role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition. 
Before I turn the call over to Collin for his comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition plans we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Collin for his contributions to CDW over the past 13 years and his strong leadership as our CFO since 2018. Collin has played a significant role in our evolution and consistent market-leading growth as a public company, and he has established a truly best-in-class finance team. 
On a personal note, it's been wonderful to be a close colleague of Collin's over 13 years, and I've greatly appreciated his partnership. We are also appreciative of Collin's commitment to support CDW in the search for his successor and to remain on the Board to ensure a smooth transition. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Collin."

I also want to thank the finance team for bringing it every day. I'll miss CDW, but I'm confident the company has never been stronger and its best days are ahead. Following a successful transition, I'm looking forward to retiring so I can spend more time with family and helping others. 
I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.8 billion, up 10.2% on a reported basis and 12% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 fewer selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.9%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 3.9% versus the fourth quarter. 
First quarter sales were stronger than expected, reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the timing and slope of the recovery was better than expected in several channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Small Business, CDW Canada and CDW U.K. all delivered strong growth and declines in Corporate and Healthcare improved meaningfully versus the previous quarter. 
On the supply side, our team did a great job navigating the challenging environment, leveraging our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships and was able to work down a portion of the backlog in Chromebooks, which was higher than normal coming into the year. This supply, coupled with continued strong demand from education customers, resulted in education net sales doubling compared to the prior year. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $795 million, an increase of 5.1% on a reported basis and 6.8% on an average daily sales basis. Gross margin was 16.4%, down 80 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by lower product margin, including notebook mix and rate and overlapping higher-margin configuration services for the Census project last year, partially offset by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service.  
Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A decreased 5.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and entertainment expense. If you recall, last year, we increased our credit loss reserve as a result of the expected impact of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher investments in coworkers. 
Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 10,186. Coworker count increased 204 from the fourth quarter, driven by an increase of approximately 120 customer-facing coworkers, including over 40 from Amplified IT. The increase in coworker count reflects investments to support high-growth solution areas and the digital transformation of our own business. Year-over-year coworker count increased to 82, driven by organic and inorganic investments in coworkers to support high-growth solution areas and our digital transformation, partially offset by cost management actions in 2020. 
GAAP operating income was $323 million, up 31.6%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $368 million, up 21%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%, a record high margin for a first quarter, reflecting the benefit of our variable cost structure. 
Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 6.1%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from last year's refinancing, partially offset by notes issued in April of 2020. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 19.5%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $56 million compared to $44 million last year. 
To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, down 70 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to lower global intangible low-taxed income and lower nondeductible expenses. 
As you can see on Slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 143 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.63, up 40.3%. 
Our non-GAAP net income was $249 million in the quarter, up 24.7%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% from last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $879 million and net debt was $3.1 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $101 million, as shown on Slide 15. This was lighter than a typical first quarter, but expected given last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items. 
In Q1, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms and made payments related to the Census. 
For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, purchasing Amplified IT and returning $415 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $358 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $148 per share. 
Moving to Slide 16. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 22 days, up 2 days from last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a 2-day increase in DIO as we made investments in inventory to support customers through the choppy supply environment. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 17. Our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place, with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the first quarter at 2x, up 0.3 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Amplified IT that Chris highlighted is a great example of this. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. 
Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5 to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash returned to shareholders. We continue to expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. 
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 18. The current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we are encouraged by the activity and building momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers, where April writings for corporate and small business were up healthy double digits on a year-over-year basis. We're also seeing good activity at CDW Canada and CDW U.K.  
On the supply side, uncertainty has increased since the first quarter. Our backlog is higher than normal and increasing with lead times extending and visibility challenged at suppliers. Notebooks, certain Chromebooks, displays and pockets of infrastructure hardware are becoming more constrained. Net demand, particularly with commercial customers, feels stronger than 3 months ago, but supply is more challenged. 
With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 4%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency, including the contribution from Amplified IT. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 60 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. 
Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the low double digits, call it, 11% to 11.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 50 basis points to earnings per share growth. This updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.30 over last quarter. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate are unchanged from last quarter and can be found on Page 19. 
Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. On the February earnings call, we did not provide a first half, second half sales split as we typically would because of the uncertainty. Based on our current assessment, we expect the split to be approximately 48.5% to 49% first half, 51.5% to 51% second half. This assumes a slight sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis and equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth in the second quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth.  
If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand, that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the next 3 quarters and potentially into 2022.  
Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 20. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. 
We continue to expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. As we mentioned before, we believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls.  
That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cristal to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

I guess maybe first question, this is the one I'm getting asked by clients a lot is maybe step back and talk a little bit of what’s happened to gross margin, at least on a sequential basis, I'll hold on the year-over-year. But what drove the drop on a sequential basis, the lowest we've seen in a while. And then how will be gross margins progressing as we go through the year?"

On both the year-over-year and sequential basis, there's some recurring things. I would say the biggest driver is product margin particularly driven by notebook, mix and rate.

I would say the biggest driver is product margin particularly driven by notebook, mix and rate. Obviously, we've had strong growth in Chromebooks in education.
The other thing that happened in the quarter was really strong growth in our U.K. and Canadian businesses. It was a fiscal year-end for many of their public customers. We had a very strong fiscal year end in those markets, and a lot of those deals tended to be in client devices. So you have public and client device end market mix internationally.
In the previous quarter, Q4 benefited from strong configuration services as we decommissioned the majority of the devices we had from the Census Device as a Service offering last year. A little of that spilled over into the first quarter, but for the most part, it was done.
As you think about gross margin, as you know, we don't provide an outlook. It can bounce around from quarter-to-quarter based on a variety of factors. We do tend to focus on the NGLI margin because of our variable cost structure, and that's more variable. 
But if I can just share some thoughts on some of the puts and takes to gross margin as you think about the next couple of quarters. I think from a tailwind perspective, I would expect the longer-term secular trend to 100% gross margin items and as well as us continuing to grow our higher-margin services businesses. In terms of headwinds, we've talked about this for some time, but there's hardware mix, and particularly within hardware mix, client devices and Chromebooks.
And then from a product margin perspective, I think some things to think about, there's that continuous commoditization that you can see. I think we went through a unique period over the past couple of quarters where we saw customers prioritizing speed and execution over price. We're beginning to move into what I would describe as a more normalized customer behavior environment where customers are willing to wait a little bit longer and prioritize price over speed because the urgency and kind of existential threat of the pandemic in business continuity isn't as great as it was just a few quarters ago.
From an OEM perspective, obviously, there's some supply challenges out there and OEMs aren't getting as aggressive on special pricing programs as they might with a channel with more normalized environment. So I think you have a lot of things going on there.
We have been through cycles like this before. I'd point to the 2018 to 2019 time frame, where our top line ticks up into the high single digits or even low double digits as we sell a lot of hardware, we exceed our 200 to 300 basis point premium by a meaningful amount, but gross margin has a [ '16 ] handle on it. And I think that's part of the power of the business model is that we pivot to where the profitable growth is, and that's why we do focus on non-GAAP operating income and EPS and free cash flow."

One thing, Amit. And I'd say, look, as customers continue to work through their budgets and keep a close eye on the macro environment, the vaccine rollout, that's really going to dictate where they're spending and if we continue to see this uptick in hardware refresh.
In terms of software, look, that can be fairly lumpy as we've talked about before depending on the mix of software. This quarter, we saw license -- shorter-term licenses and licenses not as strong, but I'll tell you, SaaS continues to be quite strong across the portfolio. So we don't expect software to start to diminish as we move forward in the year, notwithstanding a hardware refresh. It's still critically important, obviously, to the full stack. So I think we'll continue to see software strong. It's just going to bounce around depending on what's being bought and whether or not it's netted down."

So when you think about the 3 different stimulus acts that have been passed last March and then last December and then most recently in March, there are funds that have been available for state and local K-12 and Healthcare, in particular, are where we see the most benefit for our customers. And we have a team actually that goes through the stimulus bills and understands where the dollars are going and frankly, help our customers quite a bit in understanding how and where and when they can spend their dollars. So we see it as an absolute tailwind and our customers do look to us to help understand how best to utilize those funds.
If you look at the most recent of the American Rescue Plan in March, there's about $350 billion going to state and local and $130 billion going to K-12. So we certainly look forward to helping them use those and invest in technology as they come out of the current environment."

We hold ourselves accountable for that. And when we sell a lot of hardware, as you know, which is recognized at full revenue, we tend to outperform that premium. So we brought it up to 300 to 400 basis points. When you think about the mix of hardware, that seems to make a lot of sense to us. 
So if I just go through the math. If we take Census out of the baseline, which contribute about 2 -- 200 to 240 basis points to premium last year, we're looking at a good 500 to 600 basis points this year by bringing our premium up those 100 basis points. So when you ask about whether or not we, as I said, kind of durable forecast or outlook for outperformance, I would say it really depends on the mix. 
In years where we have high hardware, we tend to outperform because we recognize much of what we sell on a full net sales basis. In times when we have slower sales of hardware, and we have more netted down items, that's when we'll see the top line more muted. 
So we're hesitant to commit to a higher premium generally because of the mix of the business. And the beauty of the model is exactly that mix of the business. We've got the full range of IT products and we go where our customers need them when they need us. So I don't see us bringing that up to a higher level at any point soon, but rather toggling to where our customers need us."

But I do have to ask. I mean I know there's notebook demand, but devices have been strong for some time. Sequentially, SMB and international grew most, which are among the higher gross margin segments. But this gross margin compression is so much more than normal.

But putting all the mix issues aside, we are seeing some product margin compression in certain categories. And just to go a little bit deeper on some of the comments I've made before. 
Again, I just -- I think 2020 was really unique in the way that customers were prioritizing speed and execution overtaking every last basis point off the table in terms of their IT buying behavior. And I think now that we're moving into a different phase of the pandemic where that mission-critical nature of getting that IT purchase as quickly as possible just isn't there, we're seeing a return to kind of some of that more normal customer buying behavior.  
I would characterize the competitive environment as competitive, not irrational, but we compete in a highly competitive marketplace. 
From an OEM perspective, they are obviously wrestling with higher input costs and supply challenges, right? And so because of that -- that drives a couple of things. One, they are not incentivized to aggressively invest as much in the channel and special pricing programs and things like that, that they might in a more normal supply environment and a more normal competitive environment where they're battling it out to gain share. And in some instances, they're taking those higher costs and passing them along in the form of price increases. 
Now we do work on a cost-plus model, as we've talked about over the years. But if you just think about the math of the way a price increase works, if, for argument's sake, we make $100 per unit of gross profit on a notebook. And that notebook price goes up by 5% or 10%, that is going to be a lower reported gross margin percentage. So I think those are some of the dynamics that are driving some of the changes we're seeing on product margin currently versus some of the preceding quarters."

If you think across our customers, you hear quite a bit about when people are going back or returning to the office. And I'll tell you, while certainly there you see in the news a couple of large organizations that are returning to the office pretty quickly in the summer, most of our customers around -- across Commercial and Small Business are still, I'd say, not rushing. They're still planning and they're still a little cautious because they've got employees on both sides of the spectrum. Those who want to get back and those who frankly aren't yet ready to get back.
So first, I would just say we're in a time right now where as the vaccination pace might accelerate and we see what happens over the next couple of years, we've got to be patient for a couple of months. All that said, clearly, the hybrid world is here to stay and our customers are thinking and planning around how to have flexible -- where people are now calling Hyflex environment, hybrid and flexible environment.
And so we are in the -- we are still planning with them. We are seeing some customers that have had just old infrastructure and a real need to upgrade get to it over the past couple of months. But we are still heavily in the phase of, I'll call it, assessment to optimize, whether old plans to upgrade throughout the window and we start to move more to cloud, whether customers think more strongly about on-prem cloud-like solutions, which are now really readily available and of great interest.
So what I would say, Matt, is that we're still -- customers are still assessing and they're being more reflective. As Collin mentioned, last year, there was just a kind of a rush to get business continuity. And now there's a more measured, reflective strategic approach on what's going to be durable competitive advantage for the long term. 
So what does that all mean? We have seen customers spending more on infrastructure, hardware infrastructure. Obviously, cloud is doing really quite well. We saw a server uptick. Storage is getting stronger. One would expect we'd see netcomm really come to life later in the year or midyear as customers are heading back to the office. But there's -- on-prem hardware is not going to go away, it's just what's going to be most optimal. And as I said, customers are really weighing the benefits right now."

So we just come into the typical education peak season with a much stronger base. And we've talked about several quarters now of unusual or abnormal education seasonality. So I would say that's the first driver.
I touched on a couple of other ones in my prepared comments. But again, just an unusually strong public year-end finish in the U.K. and Canada. I know it's public year-end every year in the first quarter, but we just had a particularly strong finish this year.
And then we also carried a little bit of Census revenue in the first quarter as we completed the device decommissioning. We are completely done with that and have no Census revenue going forward.
I think the other thing that I would think about, and I made this comment in one of the answers earlier, was that our backlog was relatively unchanged over the course of the first quarter. If supply is more resilient than we think -- actually, I don't think it is. But if supply is more resilient and we can begin whittling down that backlog or if demand is even greater, and supply can keep up with that greater demand, I think that could provide some upside in terms of sequential growth and into the back half of the year. We just don't have the visibility at this point, though, to build that confidence on supply into the full year outlook and into the second quarter."

In terms of our own CapEx, again, we talked about this a little bit on the call. But a lot of that is going into our own digital transformation, and that can be better tools for our sellers, more AI, how our customers interact with CDW and making those transactions more frictionless as well as investments we're making in supply chain, both resiliency as well as flexibility. So I would think about CapEx going across those buckets.
In terms of adding another distribution center, I don't know that in the next few years, we would have a -- build another 0.5 million square foot distribution center. I think we would look at more dynamic and flexible models, working with third-party logistics organizations and really thinking through how to optimize our footprint across the U.S. from a supply chain perspective.
Oh, and I think you had a question on utilization. Yes. Look, the distribution centers are busy. There's no doubt about that. Part of that is us flexing our muscles and where we can, bringing inventory in and configuring that and staging it for our customers and helping them through this choppy environment. 
So there is some capacity there. It's tight. And again, I think we would use more of a flexible model and more of a renting space in the short term as we need it until we get a better sense of what supply and demand look like over the longer term."

Our guidance isn't dependent on when or how many people we get back into the office or going on to customer sites. So we've really done a great job. The team has done a great job of staying connected and staying productive. So we're not -- it's not dependent on that.
In terms of going back to the office and how we think about that, a couple of things. First of all, we have coworkers on both ends of the spectrum. As I mentioned before, as most companies do, we've got some who are really eager to be back and some who are still cautious until we get through the pandemic more fully. 
So what we've done is we've created opportunities for customer -- for coworkers to come together and have social and networking time in a safe way. We've also given guidance to our coworkers who are customer-facing around getting together with customers who would like to get together again in a safe way, and that's started to happen.
We also have customers who are very comfortable with our service provision in a remote way, which we've been doing throughout the pandemic. But we also have customers who are now opening up and allowing us back on site. We have bases that are opening, et cetera.
So I guess I'd say, look, we're doing very well from a productivity and connectivity perspective. We are starting to get together with customers in-person. And you can imagine it depends on what's happening within each state, for example, or each country. I think the U.K. just had their garden pubs open, and that was a big event and customers do want to get together.
But we're going to do this right. We don't really want to do this with fits and starts. That's really the key for us. We want to be able to have our coworkers come back together in a way that is -- continues our highly engaged and high-performing culture and keeps the customer at the center of how we actually work together so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else."

For those who are going -- have some folks going back into the office. What we're observing is a continued investment in mobile employees, the ability to be in the office on a flexible basis, the ability to move around the office and use the office in a different way. 
Now the question is, what work are you doing in the office? And do you need to have more -- even more collaboration spaces and the ability for your employees to have mobile devices that they can move around with and take home? So I would say our view is that the flexible hybrid work environment is what the preponderance of our customers expect to be in over the long term. And that includes notebooks, a higher density of notebooks, obviously, more enterprise-level collaboration capabilities.
We do have some customers who are contemplating whether to have a desktop in the office and a notebook at home for coworkers, it really depends on the industry. Things like lockers and hoteling are really points of discussion now. But that's what we're seeing overall, if that's helpful."

I guess if I think about K-12 education, I'll start with K-12, there are a couple of things. Device demand continues to remain strong because there is such a gap to that one-on-one device ratio that schools are trying to get to for equity and access and also for something they're referring to as learning loss, these gaps that might have happened over the pandemic. So there's plenty of headroom for devices going forward.
With regard to CDW, what we face are tough compares from last year. So if you think about our growth over last year, very tough compares, but the demand is strong. The other thing I would say is, as we're going into the next school year, schools are figuring -- and we're working with schools to figure out how to create the most optimal classroom experience, and that would be a blended experience, hybrid experience, all in-class. Schools really have -- they're looking at the ways of learning that they can use technology within a classroom or outside the classroom but within the walls of the school in much more creative ways. 
So from an infrastructure, I call it networking and particular perspective, we would expect to see upticks there. And then think of audio and visual. The older interactive flat screen panels are getting old now, but there are newer availabilities of solutions that work better. So that's another opportunity to help really modernize the classroom.
So net-net, demand will remain strong with regard to devices, but the opportunity for infrastructure, network augmentation and for video will be a good opportunity as well."

So when we think about tailwinds, certainly, the need for more remote devices, and we've talked a lot about that today, whether it's remote-enabled work or learning and device density.

You've got leverage -- get the ability to leverage the stimulus. We've got those dollars flowing through. And then we also have our Corporate and Small Business segments that are recovering nicely, and the comparables over last year are pretty low. So we've got some positives in there.
Then you mentioned the refresh, absolutely, 2017 and '18, we have seen and would expect to continue to see that refresh go on. So we are selling into that. 
On the headwind side, look, we had big overlaps over 2020 in some of our segments including K-12. And the economy is still a wildcard, though employment looks like it's picking up, and that's been quite helpful, frankly, in the Small Business space with regard to endpoint solutions. And then the last thing I would just emphasize is the headwinds and the challenges that we're facing. There's real lot visibility there.

I'll begin this morning with an overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021.

I'll begin this morning with an overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. 
We had a strong first quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the first quarter, net sales were $4.8 billion, 12% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of 1 fewer business day in the first quarter of 2021 than 2020, and up 10.9% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 5.1% to $795 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $368 million, an increase of 21%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% on a reported basis and up 25.3% in constant currency. 
The diversity of our end markets and solutions portfolio continued to serve us well, providing balance and driving our strong results as we overlapped last year's end-of-quarter surge in demand for remote solutions. During the first quarter, we saw early signs of recovery as customers became more optimistic about the macroeconomic environment due to lower COVID case count, higher vaccination rates and new government stimulus. Customer spending in channels most impacted by COVID last year rebounded. 
We continue to help customers with remote enablement, resource optimization, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. This past quarter, customers allocated more technology spend to infrastructure needs, driving growth for our solutions portfolio. Customers were focused on investments for the future, reconfiguring how they interact with customers, strengthening hybrid environments, industrializing remote enablement and restarting projects that had been delayed due to COVID. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. 
Customers choose CDW for 3 simple reasons. First, customers want a partner who know their business and their industry. Second, customers want to partner with broad and deep technical capabilities. And third, they want a partner who is focused on the optimal outcome, one who is agnostic across brand, technology and consumption model and has an informed opinion. These reasons are fundamental to why CDW outperformed in the first quarter and will continue to win in the marketplace. 
During the first quarter, we remained focused on executing against our strategy and investing in high relevance and high-growth solutions and services capabilities, including our acquisition of Amplified IT. Amplified IT is a Google premium education partner and a leading provider of cloud-based services, solutions and software for education customers and has been a partner of CDW since 2016. We share a similar culture that puts customers first, and together, we will accelerate our work to help customers' schools achieve great educational outcomes through technology. 
Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers' extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges. Supply constraints and availability for client devices and some infrastructure products have been more challenging since the first quarter ended. Disruption has been caused by both component availability issues and supply chain logistical issues. 
The supply situation is fluid. Constraints will likely continue through the second half of the year and potentially into next year. 
Now let's take a deeper look at first quarter customer end market performance. Corporate declined 4% as customer spend continued to recover. Customer expectations that a hybrid environment will become the future work model drove investments in notebooks and other remote enablement tools, while desktop and video sales declined. 
Solutions performance was flat, a significant improvement versus the previous quarter as net comm and data center projects returned. 
Small Business delivered strong growth, increasing 12% as optimism improved. Our team helped customers with remote enablement, netcomm and data center projects, leading to solid growth in both transactional and solution spend. 
Net sales for our government channel decreased high single digit. Federal declined mid-single digits. However, excluding our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau, Federal grew high single digits, led by engagements for the Department of Defense across both transactional and solutions categories. 
The state and local channel decreased high single digits. Customers paused their spending as they took a wait-and-see approach during the quarter for a stimulus support under the new administration. 
Education again grew triple digits, achieving over 100% growth, powered by K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access as well as ways to address learning loss, which drove strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers turn to us for holistic capabilities and expertise to help schools enable a variety of learning models, remote, hybrid, blended and in-person. 
Higher ed increased low single digits. Growth slowed versus prior quarters as customers assessed their plans to invest stimulus funding to prepare for returning students. 
Healthcare declined 2%, a meaningful improvement to prior quarters. Customers were more optimistic due to increased income generated from the return to elective procedures and the accelerated vaccination pace. Solutions returned to growth driven by customers refreshing and updating their data centers. 
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, the U.K. team increased net sales double digits, and the Canada team drove high single-digit growth. Strong results for both markets were driven by fiscal year-end government spending as well as continued investment by health care and education customers. 
Our first quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers. Transactions increased strong double digits and solutions returned to growth, increasing low single digits. Hardware was up strong double digits, driven by excellent notebook growth across all channels, leading to 26% client device growth. Software declined high single digits due to a decline in software licenses, but software gross profit growth remained solid. 
While services decreased low single digits, when adjusted for overlapping the contribution from the Census project last year, services grew strong double digits, driven by strength in our professional and managed services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. 
We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in Infrastructure as a Service, security, productivity and collaboration. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver. 
Our first quarter operating and financial performance reflects the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy for growth. They are important drivers of our past and future performance. 
The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. 
And the final driver of our performance is our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to, first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. 
Let me share 2 examples of our strategy in action and how we helped customers last quarter. Our Small Business team helped a customer that enables digital platforms to utilize natural language processing and machine learning to upgrade its technology infrastructure after it had been postponed due to COVID last spring. In early 2020, our account manager was working with the customer's technology team on a server upgrade at its primary data center. COVID hit and the customer froze all capital expenditures. Our account manager did a great job nurturing the relationship so that CDW is well positioned to help our customer when the project resumed. 
Last quarter, the customer was more optimistic about its future prospects and ready to proceed. It got access to capital and wanted to take advantage of its employees still working remotely. The project scope was expanded to upgrade all infrastructure, security, networking, storage, servers and software at its headquarters and its primary data center. The customer relied heavily on our team for its expertise to design and implement the complex solutions. 
In 2020, customers had to react quickly to the impact of COVID. In 2021, we see that our customers are being strategic and proactively looking to technology to be more effective and efficient in a post-COVID world. 
As I shared earlier, we acquired Amplified IT at the end of the first quarter. We are excited about the opportunity to go to market together with our combined strengths and to orchestrate complete hardware, software, services and cloud solutions that leverage our full stack capabilities and drive full outcomes for and deep engagement with our education customers. 
We started to execute against this vision immediately. CDW's relationships and extensive contract vehicles with the State Department of Education enabled the customer frictionless access to Amplified IT's portfolio. The school system needed to enhance its communication and collaboration tools to service community in different learning formats, so it centralized and standardized its technology with the help of Amplified IT and CDW to provide the right tools and support to its teachers and students across approximately 250 schools. We are excited about the addition of Amplified IT and see significant opportunity ahead. 
These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate our relentless focus on customer service, the importance of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I'm so proud of the way that our teams continue to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. We expect our office coworkers to continue to be remote until at least this fall, with plans underway by our ReunITe team to reimagine our future of work to continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can. 
Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are increasing our outlook for both the U.S. IT market growth and CDW's net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market growth to be about 4% and our top line to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. 
For the second quarter, we are encouraged about customer demand to date and how our teams are executing. That said, we are cautious about the supply environment, which, as I mentioned, has become more challenged since the end of the first quarter. While there are other wildcards such as new COVID variants, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects of the business have never been higher. Technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable profitable growth. 
CDW's role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition. 
Before I turn the call over to Collin for his comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition plans we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Collin for his contributions to CDW over the past 13 years and his strong leadership as our CFO since 2018. Collin has played a significant role in our evolution and consistent market-leading growth as a public company, and he has established a truly best-in-class finance team. 
On a personal note, it's been wonderful to be a close colleague of Collin's over 13 years, and I've greatly appreciated his partnership. We are also appreciative of Collin's commitment to support CDW in the search for his successor and to remain on the Board to ensure a smooth transition. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Collin."

My 13 years at CDW have been among the most rewarding of my career, and I want to thank you, the leadership team and all coworkers for making CDW so special. I also want to thank the finance team for bringing it every day. I'll miss CDW, but I'm confident the company has never been stronger and its best days are ahead. Following a successful transition, I'm looking forward to retiring so I can spend more time with family and helping others. 
I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.8 billion, up 10.2% on a reported basis and 12% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 fewer selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.9%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 3.9% versus the fourth quarter. 
First quarter sales were stronger than expected, reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the timing and slope of the recovery was better than expected in several channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Small Business, CDW Canada and CDW U.K. all delivered strong growth and declines in Corporate and Healthcare improved meaningfully versus the previous quarter. 
On the supply side, our team did a great job navigating the challenging environment, leveraging our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships and was able to work down a portion of the backlog in Chromebooks, which was higher than normal coming into the year. This supply, coupled with continued strong demand from education customers, resulted in education net sales doubling compared to the prior year. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $795 million, an increase of 5.1% on a reported basis and 6.8% on an average daily sales basis. Gross margin was 16.4%, down 80 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by lower product margin, including notebook mix and rate and overlapping higher-margin configuration services for the Census project last year, partially offset by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service.  
Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A decreased 5.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and entertainment expense. If you recall, last year, we increased our credit loss reserve as a result of the expected impact of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher investments in coworkers. 
Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 10,186. Coworker count increased 204 from the fourth quarter, driven by an increase of approximately 120 customer-facing coworkers, including over 40 from Amplified IT. The increase in coworker count reflects investments to support high-growth solution areas and the digital transformation of our own business. Year-over-year coworker count increased to 82, driven by organic and inorganic investments in coworkers to support high-growth solution areas and our digital transformation, partially offset by cost management actions in 2020. 
GAAP operating income was $323 million, up 31.6%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $368 million, up 21%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%, a record high margin for a first quarter, reflecting the benefit of our variable cost structure. 
Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 6.1%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from last year's refinancing, partially offset by notes issued in April of 2020. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 19.5%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $56 million compared to $44 million last year. 
To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, down 70 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to lower global intangible low-taxed income and lower nondeductible expenses. 
As you can see on Slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 143 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.63, up 40.3%. 
Our non-GAAP net income was $249 million in the quarter, up 24.7%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% from last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $879 million and net debt was $3.1 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $101 million, as shown on Slide 15. This was lighter than a typical first quarter, but expected given last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items. 
In Q1, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms and made payments related to the Census. 
For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, purchasing Amplified IT and returning $415 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $358 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $148 per share. 
Moving to Slide 16. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 22 days, up 2 days from last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a 2-day increase in DIO as we made investments in inventory to support customers through the choppy supply environment. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 17. Our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place, with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the first quarter at 2x, up 0.3 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Amplified IT that Chris highlighted is a great example of this. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. 
Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5 to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash returned to shareholders. We continue to expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. 
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 18. The current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we are encouraged by the activity and building momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers, where April writings for corporate and small business were up healthy double digits on a year-over-year basis. We're also seeing good activity at CDW Canada and CDW U.K.  
On the supply side, uncertainty has increased since the first quarter. Our backlog is higher than normal and increasing with lead times extending and visibility challenged at suppliers. Notebooks, certain Chromebooks, displays and pockets of infrastructure hardware are becoming more constrained. Net demand, particularly with commercial customers, feels stronger than 3 months ago, but supply is more challenged. 
With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 4%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency, including the contribution from Amplified IT. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 60 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. 
Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the low double digits, call it, 11% to 11.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 50 basis points to earnings per share growth. This updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.30 over last quarter. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate are unchanged from last quarter and can be found on Page 19. 
Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. On the February earnings call, we did not provide a first half, second half sales split as we typically would because of the uncertainty. Based on our current assessment, we expect the split to be approximately 48.5% to 49% first half, 51.5% to 51% second half. This assumes a slight sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis and equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth in the second quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth.  
If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand, that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the next 3 quarters and potentially into 2022.  
Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 20. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. 
We continue to expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. As we mentioned before, we believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls.  
That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cristal to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

I guess maybe first question, this is the one I'm getting asked by clients a lot is maybe step back and talk a little bit of what’s happened to gross margin, at least on a sequential basis, I'll hold on the year-over-year.

I would say the biggest driver is product margin particularly driven by notebook, mix and rate. Obviously, we've had strong growth in Chromebooks in education.
The other thing that happened in the quarter was really strong growth in our U.K. and Canadian businesses. It was a fiscal year-end for many of their public customers. We had a very strong fiscal year end in those markets, and a lot of those deals tended to be in client devices. So you have public and client device end market mix internationally.
In the previous quarter, Q4 benefited from strong configuration services as we decommissioned the majority of the devices we had from the Census Device as a Service offering last year. A little of that spilled over into the first quarter, but for the most part, it was done.
As you think about gross margin, as you know, we don't provide an outlook. It can bounce around from quarter-to-quarter based on a variety of factors. We do tend to focus on the NGLI margin because of our variable cost structure, and that's more variable. 
But if I can just share some thoughts on some of the puts and takes to gross margin as you think about the next couple of quarters. I think from a tailwind perspective, I would expect the longer-term secular trend to 100% gross margin items and as well as us continuing to grow our higher-margin services businesses. In terms of headwinds, we've talked about this for some time, but there's hardware mix, and particularly within hardware mix, client devices and Chromebooks.
And then from a product margin perspective, I think some things to think about, there's that continuous commoditization that you can see. I think we went through a unique period over the past couple of quarters where we saw customers prioritizing speed and execution over price. We're beginning to move into what I would describe as a more normalized customer behavior environment where customers are willing to wait a little bit longer and prioritize price over speed because the urgency and kind of existential threat of the pandemic in business continuity isn't as great as it was just a few quarters ago.
From an OEM perspective, obviously, there's some supply challenges out there and OEMs aren't getting as aggressive on special pricing programs as they might with a channel with more normalized environment. So I think you have a lot of things going on there.
We have been through cycles like this before. I'd point to the 2018 to 2019 time frame, where our top line ticks up into the high single digits or even low double digits as we sell a lot of hardware, we exceed our 200 to 300 basis point premium by a meaningful amount, but gross margin has a [ '16 ] handle on it. And I think that's part of the power of the business model is that we pivot to where the profitable growth is, and that's why we do focus on non-GAAP operating income and EPS and free cash flow."

One thing, Amit. And I'd say, look, as customers continue to work through their budgets and keep a close eye on the macro environment, the vaccine rollout, that's really going to dictate where they're spending and if we continue to see this uptick in hardware refresh.
In terms of software, look, that can be fairly lumpy as we've talked about before depending on the mix of software. This quarter, we saw license -- shorter-term licenses and licenses not as strong, but I'll tell you, SaaS continues to be quite strong across the portfolio. So we don't expect software to start to diminish as we move forward in the year, notwithstanding a hardware refresh. It's still critically important, obviously, to the full stack. So I think we'll continue to see software strong. It's just going to bounce around depending on what's being bought and whether or not it's netted down."

And while demand feels very healthy, I'm not sure how many of the external forecasts are incorporating the impact of supply chain that we've talked about.

I think about it a little bit like getting an elephant through the snake. It takes some time to actually get it moving through the system.
So when you think about the 3 different stimulus acts that have been passed last March and then last December and then most recently in March, there are funds that have been available for state and local K-12 and Healthcare, in particular, are where we see the most benefit for our customers. And we have a team actually that goes through the stimulus bills and understands where the dollars are going and frankly, help our customers quite a bit in understanding how and where and when they can spend their dollars. So we see it as an absolute tailwind and our customers do look to us to help understand how best to utilize those funds.
If you look at the most recent of the American Rescue Plan in March, there's about $350 billion going to state and local and $130 billion going to K-12. So we certainly look forward to helping them use those and invest in technology as they come out of the current environment."

We hold ourselves accountable for that. And when we sell a lot of hardware, as you know, which is recognized at full revenue, we tend to outperform that premium. So we brought it up to 300 to 400 basis points. When you think about the mix of hardware, that seems to make a lot of sense to us. 
So if I just go through the math. If we take Census out of the baseline, which contribute about 2 -- 200 to 240 basis points to premium last year, we're looking at a good 500 to 600 basis points this year by bringing our premium up those 100 basis points. So when you ask about whether or not we, as I said, kind of durable forecast or outlook for outperformance, I would say it really depends on the mix. 
In years where we have high hardware, we tend to outperform because we recognize much of what we sell on a full net sales basis. In times when we have slower sales of hardware, and we have more netted down items, that's when we'll see the top line more muted. 
So we're hesitant to commit to a higher premium generally because of the mix of the business. And the beauty of the model is exactly that mix of the business. We've got the full range of IT products and we go where our customers need them when they need us. So I don't see us bringing that up to a higher level at any point soon, but rather toggling to where our customers need us."

But I do have to ask. I mean I know there's notebook demand, but devices have been strong for some time. Sequentially, SMB and international grew most, which are among the higher gross margin segments. But this gross margin compression is so much more than normal.
So I guess the question would be, on a like-for-like product basis, are you seeing pressure on gross margin? And why? Is there inflation or price increases that you're eating more of or sharing in some of the pain that's helping you to gain some share?"

But putting all the mix issues aside, we are seeing some product margin compression in certain categories. And just to go a little bit deeper on some of the comments I've made before. 
Again, I just -- I think 2020 was really unique in the way that customers were prioritizing speed and execution overtaking every last basis point off the table in terms of their IT buying behavior. And I think now that we're moving into a different phase of the pandemic where that mission-critical nature of getting that IT purchase as quickly as possible just isn't there, we're seeing a return to kind of some of that more normal customer buying behavior.  
I would characterize the competitive environment as competitive, not irrational, but we compete in a highly competitive marketplace. 
From an OEM perspective, they are obviously wrestling with higher input costs and supply challenges, right? And so because of that -- that drives a couple of things. One, they are not incentivized to aggressively invest as much in the channel and special pricing programs and things like that, that they might in a more normal supply environment and a more normal competitive environment where they're battling it out to gain share. And in some instances, they're taking those higher costs and passing them along in the form of price increases. 
Now we do work on a cost-plus model, as we've talked about over the years. But if you just think about the math of the way a price increase works, if, for argument's sake, we make $100 per unit of gross profit on a notebook. And that notebook price goes up by 5% or 10%, that is going to be a lower reported gross margin percentage. So I think those are some of the dynamics that are driving some of the changes we're seeing on product margin currently versus some of the preceding quarters."

If you think across our customers, you hear quite a bit about when people are going back or returning to the office. And I'll tell you, while certainly there you see in the news a couple of large organizations that are returning to the office pretty quickly in the summer, most of our customers around -- across Commercial and Small Business are still, I'd say, not rushing. They're still planning and they're still a little cautious because they've got employees on both sides of the spectrum. Those who want to get back and those who frankly aren't yet ready to get back.
So first, I would just say we're in a time right now where as the vaccination pace might accelerate and we see what happens over the next couple of years, we've got to be patient for a couple of months. All that said, clearly, the hybrid world is here to stay and our customers are thinking and planning around how to have flexible -- where people are now calling Hyflex environment, hybrid and flexible environment.
And so we are in the -- we are still planning with them. We are seeing some customers that have had just old infrastructure and a real need to upgrade get to it over the past couple of months. But we are still heavily in the phase of, I'll call it, assessment to optimize, whether old plans to upgrade throughout the window and we start to move more to cloud, whether customers think more strongly about on-prem cloud-like solutions, which are now really readily available and of great interest.
So what I would say, Matt, is that we're still -- customers are still assessing and they're being more reflective. As Collin mentioned, last year, there was just a kind of a rush to get business continuity. And now there's a more measured, reflective strategic approach on what's going to be durable competitive advantage for the long term. 
So what does that all mean? We have seen customers spending more on infrastructure, hardware infrastructure. Obviously, cloud is doing really quite well. We saw a server uptick. Storage is getting stronger. One would expect we'd see netcomm really come to life later in the year or midyear as customers are heading back to the office. But there's -- on-prem hardware is not going to go away, it's just what's going to be most optimal. And as I said, customers are really weighing the benefits right now."

If you look historically what has driven the increase in sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, education is, by far, the #1 factor when you look across our end markets. So we just come into the typical education peak season with a much stronger base. And we've talked about several quarters now of unusual or abnormal education seasonality. So I would say that's the first driver.
I touched on a couple of other ones in my prepared comments. But again, just an unusually strong public year-end finish in the U.K. and Canada. I know it's public year-end every year in the first quarter, but we just had a particularly strong finish this year.
And then we also carried a little bit of Census revenue in the first quarter as we completed the device decommissioning. We are completely done with that and have no Census revenue going forward.
I think the other thing that I would think about, and I made this comment in one of the answers earlier, was that our backlog was relatively unchanged over the course of the first quarter. If supply is more resilient than we think -- actually, I don't think it is. But if supply is more resilient and we can begin whittling down that backlog or if demand is even greater, and supply can keep up with that greater demand, I think that could provide some upside in terms of sequential growth and into the back half of the year. We just don't have the visibility at this point, though, to build that confidence on supply into the full year outlook and into the second quarter."

In terms of adding another distribution center, I don't know that in the next few years, we would have a -- build another 0.5 million square foot distribution center. I think we would look at more dynamic and flexible models, working with third-party logistics organizations and really thinking through how to optimize our footprint across the U.S. from a supply chain perspective.
Oh, and I think you had a question on utilization. Yes. Look, the distribution centers are busy. There's no doubt about that. Part of that is us flexing our muscles and where we can, bringing inventory in and configuring that and staging it for our customers and helping them through this choppy environment.

The team has done a great job of staying connected and staying productive. So we're not -- it's not dependent on that.
In terms of going back to the office and how we think about that, a couple of things. First of all, we have coworkers on both ends of the spectrum. As I mentioned before, as most companies do, we've got some who are really eager to be back and some who are still cautious until we get through the pandemic more fully. 
So what we've done is we've created opportunities for customer -- for coworkers to come together and have social and networking time in a safe way. We've also given guidance to our coworkers who are customer-facing around getting together with customers who would like to get together again in a safe way, and that's started to happen.
We also have customers who are very comfortable with our service provision in a remote way, which we've been doing throughout the pandemic. But we also have customers who are now opening up and allowing us back on site. We have bases that are opening, et cetera.
So I guess I'd say, look, we're doing very well from a productivity and connectivity perspective. We are starting to get together with customers in-person. And you can imagine it depends on what's happening within each state, for example, or each country. I think the U.K. just had their garden pubs open, and that was a big event and customers do want to get together.
But we're going to do this right. We don't really want to do this with fits and starts. That's really the key for us. We want to be able to have our coworkers come back together in a way that is -- continues our highly engaged and high-performing culture and keeps the customer at the center of how we actually work together so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else."

So there's plenty of headroom for devices going forward.
With regard to CDW, what we face are tough compares from last year. So if you think about our growth over last year, very tough compares, but the demand is strong. The other thing I would say is, as we're going into the next school year, schools are figuring -- and we're working with schools to figure out how to create the most optimal classroom experience, and that would be a blended experience, hybrid experience, all in-class. Schools really have -- they're looking at the ways of learning that they can use technology within a classroom or outside the classroom but within the walls of the school in much more creative ways. 
So from an infrastructure, I call it networking and particular perspective, we would expect to see upticks there. And then think of audio and visual. The older interactive flat screen panels are getting old now, but there are newer availabilities of solutions that work better. So that's another opportunity to help really modernize the classroom.
So net-net, demand will remain strong with regard to devices, but the opportunity for infrastructure, network augmentation and for video will be a good opportunity as well."

Let me -- we'll talk a little bit about maybe tailwinds and headwinds. So when we think about tailwinds, certainly, the need for more remote devices, and we've talked a lot about that today, whether it's remote-enabled work or learning and device density. Then there are new use cases. We've seen a great uptick in Catalyst, for example, in terms of how our customers engage with their customers in new ways. So you've got demand from there. You've got leverage -- get the ability to leverage the stimulus. We've got those dollars flowing through. And then we also have our Corporate and Small Business segments that are recovering nicely, and the comparables over last year are pretty low. So we've got some positives in there.
Then you mentioned the refresh, absolutely, 2017 and '18, we have seen and would expect to continue to see that refresh go on. So we are selling into that. 
On the headwind side, look, we had big overlaps over 2020 in some of our segments including K-12. And the economy is still a wildcard, though employment looks like it's picking up, and that's been quite helpful, frankly, in the Small Business space with regard to endpoint solutions. And then the last thing I would just emphasize is the headwinds and the challenges that we're facing. There's real lot visibility there. But otherwise, the demand for client devices continued to be strong."

I'll begin this morning with an overview of second quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at the financials and capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks as always to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. 
We had a record second quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the second quarter, net sales were $5.1 billion, a quarterly record in our first quarter over $5 billion of net sales. Net sales grew 17.9% above last year on a reported and average daily sales basis and up 16.3% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 18.2% to $883 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $418 million, an increase of 23.6% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.02, up 29.3% on a reported basis and up 27.9% in constant currency. 
Our outstanding results reflect our team's extraordinary execution and the importance of our scale, industry experience and knowledge and strong customer relationships. The diversity of our customer end markets and breadth of our solutions portfolio continues to serve us well. Our record second quarter performance reflected a rebound in commercial customer spending, driving excellent results in our corporate small business and Canada segments and continued strength in our Education channel. 
Our results reflect strong momentum across our business as technology spending recovers from lower spending last year and also increased demand as customers seek to modernize, optimize and innovate. In 2020, customers prioritize remote enablement and continuity. So far in 2021, customers have prioritized digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions as well as continued investments in end point solutions, driving strong growth for solutions and transactions. 
Customers are investing to enable the future and adding resilience into their operations, strengthening and securing infrastructure, platforms and end points, leveraging the cloud, preparing for return to in-person operations and industrializing remote enablement for permanently changed work models. We've combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and new logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. 
Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the supply environment. Our scale and strong financial position enabled us to continue helping customers navigate the choppy supply environment. 
As we previewed on our last earnings call, supply challenges increased during the second quarter for many transactional products and some infrastructure products. While -- strengthened as economies rebounded and more customers turn to CDW for expertise across the full technology solution stack and life cycle, our backlog increased compared to the first quarter. Another impact in the tight supply environment was increasing prices, which our teams were generally able to pass on. We expect supply constraints to continue through the second half of the year and into next year. 
Now let's take a deeper look at the second quarter customer end market performance. Corporate increased 27% as customer spend sharply recovered with strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers remain focused on digital transformation, hybrid and cloud and security. Customers also began to prepare for employees to return to the office in the coming months, driving end point solutions, including notebooks, video and accessory growth. Our Corporate backlog increased during the quarter as customers await availability due to standards requirements and generally larger orders. 
Small Business delivered exceptional growth, growing 60%, yes, 6-0 percent as optimism improved and hiring increased. Our team helps customers with remote enablement security and video, leading to strong growth in both transactional and solution spend. As we've shared previously, Small Business customers tend to be nimbler in their technology requirements. So performance was less impacted by supply constraints. 
Net sales for our government channel decreased 29%. Federal declined double digits due to overlapping our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and other client device programs that were strong last year. 
State & Local decreased mid-single digits. Customers evaluated their needs at the beginning of the quarter and started to make investments utilizing stimulus funding towards the end of the quarter, making timing versus demand more of a driver of performance. 
Our Education channel grew 27%. The team delivered another $1 billion-plus quarter with strong double-digit growth from both K-12 and higher ed.  K-12 and higher ed customers are focused on investments to support equity and access and to enhance the in-classroom experience as schools prepare for students to return this fall, which drove both strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers continue to turn to us for our holistic capabilities across technology solutions and our deep education experience. 
Healthcare increased 7%, returning to year-over-year growth. Customers resumed projects that have been sidelined during the pandemic as budgets reopened, driven by patients returning for elective procedures and providers made investments for the future. Growth was balanced between transactional and solutions categories. 
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, U.K. net sales decreased low single digits overlapping strong public sector performance and reflecting a slower commercial recovery. The Canada team drove strong double-digit growth in local currency, powered by commercial customer strength and strong transactional and solutions performance. 
Our second quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. Transactions increased strong double digits driven by client device growth of 17% as well as strong growth in video and accessories. Solutions also increased strong double digits driven by software, collaboration tools and data center solutions. This led to balanced double-digit growth across hardware, software and services. 
Our services growth reflects strong organic performance and inorganic contributions. As I've shared before, services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. 
We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer segments driven by robust growth in security, Infrastructure as a Service and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we're well positioned to deliver. 
I want to take a moment to highlight our security process given its importance to our customers as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double digits as customers improve their security frameworks to respond to increasing threats. Our teams help customers through a cohesive strategy of security assessment, data protection and threat mitigation. 
Our second quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy for growth. They are all important drivers of our past and future performance. 
The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extent of products, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the sector of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. Technology has become more essential to our customers, and we are best positioned to help them navigate the complexity. 
And the final driver of our performance, our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to: first, acquire new customers and actual share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. 
Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action. Earlier this week, we announced that we acquired Focal pun. Focal Point is a leading provider of cybersecurity services with deep capabilities in identity and access management as well as the ability to serve customers across the full cybersecurity landscape. Focal Point is a leader in the cybersecurity space with an expert team and complementary customer relationships. As I shared earlier, security is a top focus area for our customers. The addition of Focal Point expands and accelerates our security practice, adding over 200 coworkers who we welcome to CDW. 
We see many significant opportunities ahead, and this is a great example of adding capability to help customers across the full technology solution stack and full technology life cycle. We view M&A as an important part of our capital allocation strategy to expand CDW's strategic capabilities. Our success is a testament to our coworkers, including those who joined CDW through acquisition, who have delivered consistent with the strategic rationale of each deal, delivering tremendous value to our customers. 
Let me share another example. Over the last year, Education customers have embraced technology more than ever and fundamentally changed how they purchased with districts and school systems banding together to access stimulus programs and procure technology to enable remote hybrid and in-person model. A long-time higher ed customer who was transitioning from a decentralized technology program to centralized turned to us to provide a better end-user experience for its students and staff across its 20-plus campuses. 
Our team leveraged our digital capabilities to integrate directly into their systems. This greatly improved the ease of purchasing, providing configured branded bundles, hitting prenegotiated pricing, direct-to-home logistics and product availability in a constrained environment. Our customer-first focus and logistical capabilities continue to be differentiators that drive value with our customers and vendor partners. This is a great example of how we leverage our competitive advantages. 
Last, I want to share a story about a corporate customer that our team helps execute a global compute refresh, changing from a BYOD organization to corporate standards. The Director of Global IT service delivery leading the project has turned exclusively to us to partner on this important initiative for over 8,000 employees in 20 countries. Having a global partner was very important. Our teams in the U.S., U.K. and Canada worked closely together to deliver for the customer. We worked with our vendor partners to ensure we had product when the customer needed it, which is crucial in the current environment, and the capability we have, given our partner relationships, strong financial position and distribution centers. 
What started as a device refresh has led to partnering on the customers' return to office initiative and technology enhancements as well as software and security projects, throwing the account from less than $1 million in net sales last year to over $7 million this year. Our team understood the customers' challenges and leveraged CDW's capabilities on a worldwide basis to provide outstanding service, leading to more opportunities. 
These examples highlight CW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the value of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I am so proud of the way our teams continued to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. 
During the quarter, our teams continued to safely reengage with customers and partners in person. Although the environment is dynamic, groups of coworkers have started to return to our offices for key leadings and small events and others are starting to work more regularly in our offices. Our ReunITe team is working hard to thoughtfully reimagine and orchestrate the future of work, so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can, while we continue to fortify our strong culture. 
Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are again increasing our outlook for both U.S. IT market growth and CDW's net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market to grow about 5% and our top line to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. For the third quarter, we expect customer demand trends to continue and have confidence in how our teams are executing and in our solutions and services portfolio. That said, we remain cautious about the supply environment, which we expect to continue to be challenged. 
While there are other wildcards such as COVID variant vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. Technology is more essential to all sectors of the economy and will continue to play an increasingly important role in years ahead. We have great confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. 
Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition. 
Finally, let me take a moment to update you on our CFO transition. The process is progressing very well. I'm really pleased with the caliber of candidates interested and excited about CDW. We will provide further updates once the process is complete. Until then, Collin is fully engaged and after this sector's name, we will remain on board to ensure a fully extended transition. With that, I'll turn it over to Collin."

I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated",1650,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. 
Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.1 billion, up 17.9% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 16.3%. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, net sales increased more than $0.5 billion or 11.2%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 4.7% versus the first quarter. Second quarter sales were stronger than expected, reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the rebound was sharper than expected in several channels, most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Corporate, Small Business and CDW Canada all delivered very healthy double-digit growth versus 2020 and are up versus 2019. So the strong growth reflects more than easy comparisons. 
As Chris mentioned, Education momentum continued, delivering the fourth consecutive quarter of over $1 billion of net sales. On the supply side, while the backlog increased several hundred million dollars in the second quarter, the team did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages and supporting stronger-than-expected demand, so the backlog did not increase even more. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $883 million, an increase of 18.2%. Gross margin was 17.2%, up approximately 10 basis points versus last year primarily driven by an increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily Software as a Service and strong professional services performance,, ,partially offset by overlapping higher-margin configuration services for the Census project last year. 
Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 13.6%. The increase was primarily driven by payroll costs, including sales compensation, which moves with gross profit growth; performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals; and investments in the business, including coworker count to drive our strategy. 
Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was 10,666. Coworker count increased 480 from the first quarter and 18% from the prior year. The increase in coworker count reflects organic and inorganic investments to support high-growth solution areas and our digital transformation. 
GAAP operating income was $370 million, up 30.5%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $418 million, up 23.6%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.1%. 
Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 10.6%. The decrease was primarily due to savings from last year's refinancing, a lower LIBOR rate and lower revolving credit facility borrowings. Other income reflects $36 million from the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investment. Proceeds from the sale were excluded from non-GAAP metrics. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 26.2%. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $97 million compared to $56 million last year. 
To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.4% and up 50 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to higher foreign taxes. 
As you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $142 million GAAP net income per share was $1.93, up 47.4%. Our non-GAAP net income was $286 million in the quarter, up 27%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.02, up 29.3% from last year. 
Turning to first half results on Slides 14 through 19. Net sales were $10 billion, an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 14.9% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 fewer selling day in the first half of 2021. The 1 fewer selling day will be made up in Q4 when we have 1 extra selling day compared to the prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, first half consolidated net sales were 13.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $1.7 billion up 11.6% and gross profit margin was 16.8% down approximately 40 basis points. Operating income was $693 million and non-GAAP operating income was $786 million, up 22.4%. Net income was $507 million, and non-GAAP net income was $536 million, up 25.9%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $3.76, up 27.9%. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $0.5 billion and net debt was $3.4 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $110 million, as shown on Slide 21. This was lighter than a typical first half but expected given last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items. Year-to-date, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. 
Additionally, working capital increases during periods of rapid growth and we made strategic investments in inventory to support customers during this choppy supply environment. For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, returning $433 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $377 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $170 per share. 
Moving to Slide 22. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down 4 days from last year's second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by improved accounts receivable collection performance. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 23. Our priorities remain the same: first, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the second quarter at 2.1x, up 0.4 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Focal Point and Amplified IT are great examples. And fourth, we turn excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. 
Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5 to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash returned to shareholders. We now expect to return over $1.7 billion to shareholders in 2021, including at least $1.5 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. This $0.5 billion increase from last quarter's comments reflects our confidence in the cash flow generation and earnings power of the business. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets, and we'll continue to deploy capital for M&A that passes our screens. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. 
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 24. The current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers and in CDW Canada. On the supply side, visibility remains a challenge. Notebooks, displays, docking stations, certain infrastructure hardware, including networking and servers are constrained, resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog. With the exception of Chromebooks, the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call, and most vendor partners do not expect the situation to improve in the second half. 
With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 5%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the market in constant currency including the contribution from Focal Point. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 80 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. 
Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the strong mid-teens, call it, 16% to 16.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 70 basis points to earnings per share growth. The updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.35 over last quarter. 
Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. The 2015 to 2019 5-year average sequential increase from Q2 to Q3 on an average daily sales basis was approximately 4%, and we expect this year's third quarter to be in line with normal seasonality, which equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow low double digits. 
Our updated outlook for the balance of the year assumes modest growth in the backlog. If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand, that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the second half and into 2022. 
Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant overdelivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of free cash flow, including capital expenditures and the cash conversion cycle, can also be found on Slide 25. 
As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Tamia to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

Good to hear from you. In terms of our increase, look, if you look at where we've had meaningful growth, client devices, video, other hardware categories and what customers' priorities are going forward, where they're allocating more technology spend to infrastructure needs, we don't think the market is growing at the same rate that we are growing. So we're flowing some of that increase through to our premium. And as you know, the CDW tends to outpace the U.S. IT market by more than 200 to 300 basis points in periods of hardware fresh. So we tend to overindex because we have more recognized at the net line. 
The one thing I would say is supply remains a wildcard. Collin's talked about it. I've talked about it. We're not underestimating supply.

That said, I just -- I'll repeat what we've been saying for the past couple of quarters. It's so prevalent at this point and the visibility is very difficult that it's hard to really have a good view over the next couple of quarters other than just saying we think it's going to get a little worse before it gets better. It's going to continue into next year. But I'll tell you, we've been working very closely with our OEMs, and they've just been terrific.

I think also, when you think about what the majority of our customers are ordering, they're not widgets. It's customized to the specs of a large corporate customer or the needs of the school district. And the thought that you're going to place an order like that with multiple vendors, I think, is low. At very small and -- a small office, home office customer that needs 20 notebooks, it's impossible that there's some double ordering going on there. Yes. But I think overall, when you look at the backlog, we feel pretty good that those are firm orders sitting in the backlog. 
The comment I'll make actually gets into your next one. What we have seen, though, is what I would call an order pull-forward-where customers are placing orders sooner than they might normally because of the supply environment or to try to get ahead of expected price increases from our OEM vendor partners. So sitting in that backlog is a little bit of a pull-forward. And I think that's getting to your question around the air pocket. I guess the way I think about it is there's a little bit of a hedge here. To the extent that there may then be a little bit of a lull in the ordering. If, at some point in the future, orders return to a normal timing and flow pattern, we would also then have the flush of the backlog at some point in time. So I think maybe that's one way to think about it."

There's the Emerging Connectivity Act which is about $7.1 billion, and we have worked closely with educational systems to tap that. So that's been something that the Education customers are very focused on and taking advantage of with our help facilitating and navigating. So absolutely there. 
And we also say State & Local, we've talked about the 3 rounds of stimulus funding, last March, last December, this March and how that impact is stable, in particular, because in December's Appropriations Act, there was no additional funding for State & Local. So State & Local tended to pause kind of step back and say, what's going to happen in the next round. Well, in the next round, which was this March, there were dollars allocated to State & Local. So we have now seen the use of those funds pick up. I'd tell you that the first couple of months in this quarter was a lot of assessing, understanding, again, working with our customers to help them understand how to tap the funds and where we get the money, how to get the money, et cetera. But we did see a nice pickup in the last part of second quarter in terms of using the stimulus dollars. So that's another area where we're seeing strength in stimulus. 
In terms of the packages coming forward, the new ones coming out yet to be seen, we'll review those. And to the extent that there's opportunity to help our customers, certainly, we'll take advantage of those. Clearly, the focus of the administration on things like technology, infrastructure or technology as infrastructure and cybersecurity are high on the list of priorities for our customers, and we have capabilities that can help them to both implement solutions around those but, more importantly, navigate the stimulus funds.

So we said having such strength last year in the sense of -- and kind of coming back to the year, if you will, with I'd say, next year, 2022, picking up from a growth perspective, we've got all of our other customer end markets that are  going to be constrained. 
The other thing I would just say is a reminder of the federal space. The Census deal and some other deals that we're doing there are, frankly, that we're working on that are fairly similar, really reflects the positioning that we have with our customers in that customer end market, which is a real thought leader, a real solutions provider and a services first player. So kudos to the team for continuing to grow our reputation and capabilities. And we can see it paying off in the opportunities that we've got in the pipeline."

Now we have a variable cost structure. So not all of that passes to the operating margin. I would say that there are some elements of seasonality in that. When you think about -- there's a software vendor, a big partner of ours who has a fiscal year-end in June. And as we mentioned in our comments, we had very strong software results and very strong cloud and Software as a Service results. So we did benefit seasonally from mixing into some netted down items there that I wouldn't expect to recur at necessarily the same pace in the second half of the year. And then also our partner funding improved a bit sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Our partners reimburse some of our advertising. And as we increased our advertising investment sequentially, you saw part of that sitting in the gross margin. 
So I think most of the increase then is primarily explained by the gross margin. And then in terms of how you think about the back half of the year, I just -- the comment I made to Matt earlier in the call around we are continuing to invest in the business, and that coworker count gets layered in and you'll have full quarter's worth of that expense coming up in subsequent quarters."

I think one of -- our leader in the solutions area for our partner relationships kind of refer to 2020 as a range away in terms of as we think about refresh. And that's not a bad way to think about it. Last year was a pause on a lot of things. So now we're seeing servers growing double digits. Certainly, what our customers are focusing on is things like workload optimization and application performance. And so that's where they're focusing to invest in infrastructure. And ultimately, frankly, this is tied to supporting digital transformation, which is at the forefront of every customers'  mind. 
So I think if we look forward, hybrid work is driving assessment on what customers are going to need, so supporting the office. As we get new next general leases in compute technologies, given the analytic heavy nature of the future and the analytics that customers are needing to really win and -- in the marketplace, I think we're going to continue to see some upgrades in the needs there. 
And then in the other areas like storage, what we're seeing now is a real enhanced focus on data center observability. So customers are looking at costs and optimizing operations. And so there's a growing and leading system, modest churn and automation. And so our digital velocity and ServiceNow businesses are really on fire. And we're just continuing to scrutinize the spend. 
Now that said, our customers are ending up, I think, and is proved out by how customers are [indiscernible] in the future is a multi-cloud world, which includes on-prem, on-subject cloud-like capabilities, which is growing in terms of -- assets as well as multiple clouds that they're using. 
Last year, I think we talked about, and earlier this year, about customers really taking a step back and reassess how to optimize their infrastructure, and that's what we're seeing. The good news is whether they're refreshing and updating, whether they're moving to a meter consumption model on time, whether they're going to colo or whether they're moving workloads to various clouds, public clouds, we're helping them at the front end to play in that then to implement the plan. So it keeps us right front and center of helping them to deploy their infrastructure strategy."

So we continue to see it as a growth opportunity because of the natural evolution of education in this country and in our other markets. 
I think, certainly, given how strong last year was, in particular, Q4, I don't think we're going to see the kind of equity and access, the classroom experience opportunities that we're selling into, we're not going to see ourselves overlap or overcome how well we did last quarter. But over the long term, Matt, I would say it's a great market. We have fantastic expertise, especially when you think about Amplified IT, the acquisition we did last quarter. And we're seeing traction in the market incredibly strong. So we're very bullish on K-12."

I'll begin this morning with an overview of second quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at the financials and capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks, as always, to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. 
We had a record second quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the second quarter, net sales were $5.1 billion, a quarterly record and our first quarter over $5 billion of net sales. Net sales grew 17.9% above last year on a reported and average daily sales basis and up 16.3% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 18.2% to $883 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $418 million, an increase of 23.6% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.02, up 29.3% on a reported basis and up 27.9% in constant currency. 
Our outstanding results reflect our team's extraordinary execution and the importance of our scale, industry experience and knowledge and strong customer relationships. The diversity of our customer end markets and breadth of our solutions portfolio continues to serve us well. Our record second quarter performance reflected a rebound in commercial customer spending, driving excellent results in our Corporate, Small Business and Canada segments and continued strength in our Education channel. 
Our results reflect strong momentum across our business as technology spending recovers from lower spending last year and also increased demand as customers seek to modernize, optimize and innovate. In 2020, customers prioritize remote enablement and continuity. So far in 2021, customers have prioritized digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions as well as continued investments in end point solutions, driving strong growth for solutions and transactions. 
Customers are investing to enable the future and adding resilience into their operations, strengthening and securing infrastructure, platforms and end points, leveraging the cloud, preparing for return to in-person operations and industrializing remote enablement for permanently changed work models. We've combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the supply environment. Our scale and strong financial position enabled us to continue helping customers navigate the choppy supply environment. 
As we previewed on our last earnings call, supply challenges increased during the second quarter for many transactional products and some infrastructure products. While writings strengthened as economies rebounded and more customers turned to CDW for expertise across the full technology solution stack and life cycle, our backlog increased compared to the first quarter. Another impact in the tight supply environment was increasing prices, which our teams were generally able to pass on. We expect supply constraints to continue through the second half of the year and into next year. 
Now let's take a deeper look at the second quarter customer end market performance. Corporate increased 27% as customer spend sharply recovered with strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers remain focused on digital transformation, hybrid and cloud and security. Customers also began to prepare for employees to return to the office in the coming months, driving end point solutions, including notebooks, video and accessory growth. Our Corporate backlog increased during the quarter as customers await availability due to standards requirements and generally larger orders. 
Small Business delivered exceptional growth, growing 60%, yes, 6-0 percent, as optimism improved and hiring increased. Our team helps customers with remote enablement, security and video, leading to strong growth in both transactional and solution spend. As we've shared previously, Small Business customers tend to be nimbler in their technology requirements so performance was less impacted by supply constraints. Net sales for our Government channel decreased 29%. Federal declined double digits due to overlapping our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and other client device programs that were strong last year. State & Local decreased mid-single digits. Customers evaluated their needs at the beginning of the quarter and started to make investments utilizing stimulus funding towards the end of the quarter, making timing versus demand more of a driver of performance. 
Our Education channel grew 27%. The team delivered another $1 billion-plus quarter with strong double-digit growth from both K-12 and higher ed. K-12 and higher ed customers are focused on investments to support equity and access and to enhance the in-classroom experience as schools prepare for students to return this fall, which drove both strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers continue to turn to us for our holistic capabilities across technology solutions and our deep education experience. Healthcare increased 7%, returning to year-over-year growth. Customers resumed projects that have been sidelined during the pandemic as budgets reopened driven by patients returning for elective procedures and providers made investments for the future. Growth was balanced between transactional and solutions categories. 
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, U.K. net sales decreased low single digits, overlapping strong public sector performance and reflecting a slower commercial recovery. The Canada team drove strong double-digit growth in local currency, powered by commercial customer strength and strong transactional and solutions performance. Our second quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. Transactions increased strong double digits driven by client device growth of 17% as well as strong growth in video and accessories. Solutions also increased strong double digits driven by software, collaboration tools and data center solutions. This led to balanced double-digit growth across hardware, software and services. 
Our services growth reflects strong organic performance and inorganic contributions. As I've shared before, services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer segments driven by robust growth in security, Infrastructure as a Service and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we're well positioned to deliver. 
I want to take a moment to highlight our security practice given its importance to our customers as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double digits as customers improve their security frameworks to respond to increasing threats. Our teams help customers through a cohesive strategy of security assessment, data protection and threat mitigation. Our second quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy for growth. They are all important drivers of our past and future performance. 
The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extent of products, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the sector of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. Technology has become more essential to our customers, and we are best positioned to help them navigate the complexity. And the final driver of our performance, our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to: first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. 
Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action. Earlier this week, we announced that we acquired Focal Point. Focal Point is a leading provider of cybersecurity services with deep capabilities in identity and access management as well as the ability to serve customers across the full cybersecurity landscape. Focal Point is a leader in the cybersecurity space with an expert team and complementary customer relationships. As I shared earlier, security is a top focus area for our customers. The addition of Focal Point expands and accelerates our security practice, adding over 200 coworkers, who we welcome to CDW. 
We see many significant opportunities ahead, and this is a great example of adding capability to help customers across the full technology solution stack and full technology life cycle. We view M&A as an important part of our capital allocation strategy to expand CDW's strategic capabilities. Our success is a testament to our coworkers, including those who joined CDW through acquisition, who have delivered consistent with the strategic rationale of each deal, delivering tremendous value to our customers. 
Let me share another example. Over the last year, Education customers have embraced technology more than ever and fundamentally changed how they purchased, with districts and school systems banding together to access stimulus programs and procure technology to enable remote, hybrid and in-person model. A long-time higher ed customer who was transitioning from a decentralized technology program to centralized turned to us to provide a better end-user experience for its students and staff across its 20-plus campuses. Our team leveraged our digital capabilities to integrate directly into their systems. This greatly improved the ease of purchasing, providing configured branded bundles, hitting prenegotiated pricing, direct-to-home logistics and product availability in a constrained environment. Our customer-first focus and logistical capabilities continue to be differentiators that drive value with our customers and vendor partners. This is a great example of how we leverage our competitive advantages to win.
Last, I want to share a story about a corporate customer that our team helped execute a global compute refresh, changing from a BYOD organization to corporate standards. The Director of Global IT Service Delivery leading the project turned exclusively to us to partner on this important initiative for over 8,000 employees in 20 countries. Having a global partner was very important. Our teams in the U.S., U.K. and Canada worked closely together to deliver for the customer. We worked with our vendor partners to ensure we had product when the customer needed it, which is crucial in the current environment, and the capability we have, given our deep partner relationships, strong financial position and distribution centers. 
What started as a device refresh has led to partnering on the customer's return-to-office initiative and technology enhancements as well as software and security projects, growing the account from less than $1 million in net sales last year to over $7 million this year. Our team understood the customer's challenges and leveraged CDW's capabilities on a worldwide basis to provide outstanding service, leading to more opportunities. These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrates the value of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I am so proud of the way our teams continue to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. 
During the quarter, our teams continued to safely reengage with customers and partners in person. Although the environment is dynamic, groups of coworkers have started to return to our offices for team meetings and small events and others are starting to work more regularly in our offices. Our ReunITe team is working hard to thoughtfully reimagine and orchestrate the future of work so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can, while we continue to fortify our strong culture. 
Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are again increasing our outlook for both U.S. IT market growth and CDW's net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market to grow about 5% and our top line to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. For the third quarter, we expect customer demand trends to continue and have confidence in how our teams are executing and in our solutions and services portfolio. That said, we remain cautious about the supply environment, which we expect to continue to be challenged. 
While there are other wildcards such as COVID variants, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. Technology is more essential to all sectors of the economy and will continue to play an increasingly important role in years ahead. We have great confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition.
Finally, let me take a moment to update you on our CFO transition. The process is progressing very well. I'm really pleased with the caliber of candidates interested and excited about CDW. We will provide further updates once the process is complete. Until then, Collin is fully engaged and after a successor is named, he will remain onboard to ensure a smooth transition.
 With that, I'll turn it over to Collin."

I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated",1647,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. 
Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.1 billion, up 17.9% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 16.3%. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, net sales increased more than $0.5 billion or 11.2%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 4.7% versus the first quarter. Second quarter sales were stronger than expected, reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the rebound was sharper than expected in several channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Corporate, Small Business and CDW Canada all delivered very healthy double-digit growth versus 2020 and are up versus 2019, so the strong growth reflects more than easy comparisons. 
As Chris mentioned, Education momentum continued, delivering the fourth consecutive quarter of over $1 billion of net sales. On the supply side, while the backlog increased several hundred million dollars in the second quarter, the team did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages and supporting stronger-than-expected demand so the backlog did not increase even more. Gross profit for the quarter was $883 million, an increase of 18.2%. Gross margin was 17.2%, up approximately 10 basis points versus last year primarily driven by an increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily Software as a Service and strong professional services performance partially offset by overlapping higher-margin configuration services for the Census project last year. 
Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 13.6%. The increase was primarily driven by payroll costs, including sales compensation, which moves with gross profit growth; performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals; and investments in the business, including coworker count to drive our strategy. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was 10,666. Coworker count increased 480 from the first quarter and 618 from the prior year. The increase in coworker count reflects organic and inorganic investments to support high-growth solution areas and our digital transformation. GAAP operating income was $370 million, up 30.5%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $418 million, up 23.6%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.1%. 
Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 10.6%. The decrease was primarily due to savings from last year's refinancing, a lower LIBOR rate and lower revolving credit facility borrowings. Other income reflects $36 million from the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investment. Proceeds from the sale were excluded from non-GAAP metrics. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 26.2%. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $97 million compared to $56 million last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.4%, up 50 basis points versus last year's rate primarily due to higher foreign taxes. 
As you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 142 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.93, up 47.4%. Our non-GAAP net income was $286 million in the quarter, up 27%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.02, up 29.3% from last year. 
Turning to first half results on Slides 14 through 19. Net sales were $10 billion, an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 14.9% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 fewer selling day in the first half of 2021. The 1 fewer selling day will be made up in Q4 when we have 1 extra selling day compared to the prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, first half consolidated net sales were 13.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $1.7 billion, up 11.6%, and gross profit margin was 16.8%, down approximately 40 basis points. Operating income was $693 million and non-GAAP operating income was $786 million, up 22.4%. Net income was $507 million and non-GAAP net income was $536 million, up 25.9%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $3.76, up 27.9%. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $0.5 billion and net debt was $3.4 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $110 million, as shown on Slide 21. This was lighter than a typical first half but expected given last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items. Year-to-date, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms, additionally, working capital increases during periods of rapid growth and we made strategic investments in inventory to support customers during this choppy supply environment. For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, returning $433 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $377 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $170 per share. 
Moving to Slide 22. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down 4 days from last year's second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by improved accounts receivable collection performance. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 23. Our priorities remain the same: first, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the second quarter at 2.1x, up 0.4 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Focal Point and Amplified IT are great examples. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. 
Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5 to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash returned to shareholders. We now expect to return over $1.7 billion to shareholders in 2021, including at least $1.5 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. This $0.5 billion increase from last quarter's comments reflects our confidence in the cash flow generation and earnings power of the business. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets, and we'll continue to deploy capital for M&A that passes our screens. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. 
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 24. The current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers and in CDW Canada. On the supply side, visibility remains a challenge. Notebooks, displays, docking stations, certain infrastructure hardware, including networking and servers, are constrained, resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog. With the exception of Chromebooks, the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call, and most vendor partners do not expect the situation to improve in the second half. With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 5%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the market in constant currency, including the contribution from Focal Point. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 80 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. 
Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the strong mid-teens, call it, 16% to 16.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 70 basis points to earnings per share growth. The updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.35 over last quarter. 
Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. The 2015 to 2019 5-year average sequential increase from Q2 to Q3 on an average daily sales basis was approximately 4%, and we expect this year's third quarter to be in line with normal seasonality, which equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow low double digits. Our updated outlook for the balance of the year assumes modest growth in the backlog. If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand, that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the second half and into 2022. 
Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020's significant overdelivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of free cash flow, including capital expenditures and the cash conversion cycle, can also be found on Slide 25. 
As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Tamia to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

And then you add on refresh that's coming up, pretty large installed base that's looking towards refresh. I would just tell you that the demand feels resilient. Vis-à-vis CDW, we certainly have some tough overlaps, some compares we're looking at in K-12 given the enormous growth last year. But generally speaking, demand remains solid. On the supply side, Chromebooks have really started to ease up a little bit. That's -- the OEMs had to plan for that last fall and they did, but we are still seeing supply constraints with regard to some notebooks."

So I was hoping you could kind of give some commentary because I would kind of assume, and maybe I'm wrong, that small and midsized businesses and Education really can't and don't double-order because they just don't have quite the large needs as maybe, say, the Fortune 100 companies where they know they're going to always need so much. Maybe I'm wrong on that, but any thoughts about double-ordering from your end markets? And then that leads to the follow-up question part about the concern about a potential pocket of error or a slowdown post when the supply chain gets back to equilibrium. Any commentaries on those would be great."

Of course, that's something that we would -- we always worry about and look at carefully in this type of environment. What I'd tell you is the information that we are working with our OEMs to get and provide some level of visibility to our customers is resonating really well. And therefore, they have a level of confidence when CDW says it's going to be 8 weeks or 12 weeks and we can get it, that we actually have it or can get it. We have seen minimal, if really any, double-ordering with our customers. So we feel very confident in the orders have come in, in our backlog and in the way that we're operating with the customers. 
In terms of an air pocket, Collin, do you want to chat a little bit about backlog supply and air pockets?"

I think also, when you think about what the majority of our customers are ordering, they're not widgets. It's customized to the specs of a large corporate customer or the needs of the school district. And the thought that you're going to place an order like that with multiple vendors, I think, is low. At the very small end, a small office, home office customer that needs 20 notebooks, is it possible that there's some double-ordering going on there? Yes. But I think overall, when you look at the backlog, we feel pretty good that those are firm orders sitting in the backlog. 
The comment I'll make actually gets into your next one. What we have seen, though, is what I would call an order pull-forward, where customers are placing orders sooner than they might normally because of the supply environment or to try to get ahead of expected price increases from our OEM vendor partners. So sitting in that backlog is a little bit of a pull-forward. And I think that's getting to your question around the air pocket. I guess the way I think about it is there's a little bit of a hedge here. To the extent that there may then be a little bit of a lull in the ordering, if at some point in the future, orders return to a normal timing and flow pattern, we would also then have the flush of the backlog at some point in time. So I think maybe that's one way to think about it."

There's the Emergency Connectivity Act, which is about $7.1 billion, and we have worked closely with educational systems to tap that. So that's been something that the Education customers are very focused on and taking advantage of with our help facilitating and navigating, so absolutely there. 
And we also say State & Local, we've talked about the 3 rounds of stimulus funding, last March, last December, this March and how that impacted State & Local, in particular, because in December's Appropriations Act, there was no additional funding for State & Local. So State & Local tended to pause, kind of step back and say, what's going to happen in the next round. Well, in the next round, which was this March, there were dollars allocated to State & Local. So we have now seen the use of those funds pick up. I'd tell you that the first couple of months in this quarter was a lot of assessing, understanding, again, working with our customers to help them understand how to tap the funds and where we get the money, how to get the money, et cetera. But we did see a nice pickup in the last part of second quarter in terms of using the stimulus dollars. So that's another area where we're seeing strength in stimulus. 
In terms of the packages coming forward, the new ones coming out yet to be seen, we'll review those. And to the extent that there's opportunity to help our customers, certainly, we'll take advantage of those. Clearly, the focus of the administration on things like technology infrastructure or technology as infrastructure and cybersecurity are high on the list of priorities for our customers, and we have capabilities that can help them to both implement solutions around those but, more importantly, navigate the stimulus funds. So we'll -- I think we'll be very effective in doing that."

As it relates to our total free cash flow, we were down in the first half of the year relative to a normal first half of the year.

So what we've got sitting in the back half of the year is not going to be enough, likely, to overcome that. But Ruplu, the beauty of our model is the diversity of our customer end markets. So we said having such strength last year in the Census and kind of coming back this year, if you will, with I'd say -- next year, 2022, picking up from a growth perspective, we've got all of our other customer end markets that are going to be constrained. 
The other thing I would just say is a reminder of the Federal space. The Census deal and some other deals that we're doing there are, frankly, that we're working on that are fairly similar, really reflects the positioning that we have with our customers in that customer end market, which is a real thought leader, a real solutions provider and a services-first player.

When you think about -- there's a software vendor, a big partner of ours who has a fiscal year-end in June. And as we mentioned in our comments, we had very strong software results and very strong cloud and Software as a Service results. So we did benefit seasonally from mixing into some netted-down items there that I wouldn't expect to recur at necessarily the same pace in the second half of the year. 
And then also our partner funding improved a bit sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Our partners reimburse some of our advertising. And as we increased our advertising investment sequentially, you saw part of that sitting in the gross margin. So I think most of the increase then is primarily explained by the gross margin.

I think one of -- our leader in the solutions area for our partner relationships kind of refer to 2020 as a rain delay in terms of as we think about refresh. And that's not a bad way to think about it. Last year was a pause on a lot of things. So now we're seeing servers growing double digits. Certainly, what our customers are focusing on is things like workload optimization and application performance. And so that's where they're focusing to invest in infrastructure. And ultimately, frankly, this is tied to supporting digital transformation, which is at the forefront of every customers' mind. 
So I think if we look forward, hybrid work is driving assessment on what customers are going to need, some supporting the office. As we get new next-gen releases in compute technologies, given the analytic-heavy nature of the future and the analytics that customers are needing to really win and compete in the marketplace, I think we're going to continue to see some upgrades in the needs there. And then in the other areas like storage, what we're seeing now is a real enhanced focus on data center observability. So customers are looking at costs and optimizing operations. And so there's a growing rejuvenation in monitoring and automation. And so our digital velocity and ServiceNow businesses are really on fire. And we're just continuing to scrutinize the spend. 
Now that said, where customers are ending up, I think, and it's proved out by how customers are in-housing the future is a multi-cloud world, which includes on-prem, on public cloud-like capabilities, which is growing in terms of ease of access as well as multiple clouds that they're using. Last year, I think we talked about, and earlier this year, about customers really taking a step back and reassessing how to optimize their infrastructure, and that's what we're seeing. The good news is whether they're refreshing and updating, whether they're moving to a meter-consumption model on-prem, whether they're going colo, whether they're moving workloads to various clouds, public clouds, we're helping them at the front end to plan that, then to implement the plan. So it keeps us right front and center of helping them to deploy their infrastructure strategy."

So we continue to see it as a growth opportunity because of the natural evolution of education in this country and in our other markets. 
I think, certainly, given how strong last year was, in particular, Q4, I don't think we're going to see the kind of equity in access, the classroom experience opportunities that we're selling into, we're not going to see ourselves overlap or overcome how well we did last quarter.

I'll begin today with an overview of third quarter results and drivers of performance. Al will take you then through a more detailed look at our financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks as we always try to do to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. 
But before I get started, I do want to pause for a moment to honor the life and legacy of our former CEO, Tom Richards, who passed away last week after a valiant fight with cancer. I suspect most of you on this call have likely met Tom in person. I'm certain that everyone on this call has been impacted by Tom. He was a fierce competitor and equally a kind human being. 
Tom had a lot of what we like to call it CDW Tomism, simple ways of getting to the essence of something in a way that's stuck. One of my personal favorites is when Tom used to say at CDW, we take what we do seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. That's the essence of who we are. That is our CDW culture, captured so simply and amplified so strongly by Tom Richards. 
Tom also had an unexpected way of signing off on our earnings call, usually with a right comment about an upcoming holiday like Halloween or Mother's Day or even Valentine's Day. As a result, we always ended these calls on a high note and with a chuckle. 
Tom knew his audience well. In honor Tom, I'd like to kick off this earnings call with the tagline he penned on every communication to a coworker. Tom always signed off with ""You make a difference,"" literally injecting into each coworker, Tom's personal belief in them and their important impact. On behalf of all of our coworkers around the globe, our customers and our partners, our communities and our investors, I would like to say thank you to Tom, you made a difference. 
Let me turn now to Q3 performance. Once again, CDW posted strong top line growth and profitability. Overall demand was strong and the teams did a great job addressing customer needs. For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $5.3 billion, 11.4% higher than last year and up 10.7% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP operating income of $435 million, up 12.6% and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.13, 15.4% higher than last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant currency. 
Our ability to deliver this strong top line and profitability was the result of 3 key drivers: our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio and our ongoing execution against our 3-part strategy, which is focused on taking share and investing in the solutions and capabilities our customers need and want. 
Let me walk through each one of these and share some detail about how they contributed to our performance. First, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: corporate; small business; health care; government, which includes federal and state and local customers; and education with K-12 and higher ed. 
We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, each serving public and commercial customers. All of these operations represent meaningful businesses in their own right. Often different factors impact these diverse customer end markets. And this quarter, we saw that play out as our commercial business in the U.S., our small and corporate channels and our international operations posted significant double-digit increases, while our U.S. publics business posted a mid-single-digit decline. 
From a macro perspective, supply remained under pressure this quarter. Demand outpaced supply and lead times extended, particularly in several solutions areas. The team continued to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the supply environment. They did an exceptional job working with our partners to stay on top of availability status. 
Our sellers and technical specialists also work with customers and whenever possible, found alternative available product and build alternative solutions. These efforts helped mitigate some of the pressure and our backlog increase was consistent with last quarter. The tight supply environment continued to impact prices, which our teams were generally able to pass along. 
Let's take a deeper look at third quarter customer end market performance. Commercial customer priorities remain the same as in the second quarter, digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions. Customers continue to prioritize investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations to strengthen and secure infrastructure platform and end points. 
Within this backdrop, Corporate increased 25% and customer demand remains strong. While many customers delayed return to office, they continued to prepare as well as invest to facilitate hybrid work. This drove ongoing strong double-digit increases in transactions, propelled by notebook, audiovisual and desktop. At the same time, digital transformation remained a top priority. While buying sentiment was clearly there, in many cases, the product was not. 
Writings were strong, but with extended lead time backlog built during the quarter. Lack of product availability, particularly in NetComm and storage muted corporate solutions growth. 
Small business also delivered another exceptional quarter of growth, increasing almost 40%. The team continued to help customers with remote enablement, security and video, driving strong growth across both transactional and solutions categories. 
As we have shared previously, small business customers tend to be more flexible in their technology requirements. So while they did see some impact from supply constraints, Small Business did not experience as much as Corporate, a great example of the power of diverse end markets. 
You also see the power of our diverse end markets and our public performance. Net sales for our government channel decreased 33%. Federal declined double digits, in large part due to the overlapping of our Device-as-a-Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and other client device programs that were particularly strong last year. 
Security remains robust, with net sales up more than 30%. The gears of Washington were slower than typical at federal year-end, and we had contracting delays in several large contracts. This is not unusual. Given the magnitude of federal contracts, timing can influence performance. You've heard us talk about Federal's lumpy nature in the past. This will unwind, and we expect to see a reversal back to growth in the first half of 2022. 
State and local posted a mid-single-digit decline. Stimulus funding remained largely unallocated to the local level. This is because access to the multiyear American Rescue Plan Act funding with deadlines in 2024 led to greater focus on multiyear budget planning. 
At the same time, state and local customers were focused on digesting last year's meaningful stimulus-funded IT investments. We continue to work with our customers, but given the complexity of the various funding opportunities and multiyear phasing, we do not expect to see projects moving ahead meaningfully until early 2022. 
Education increased by 2%. Higher Ed delivered high single-digit growth, driven by ongoing focus on campus connectivity and enhancing the dorm room experience with double-digit growth in both security software and servers. 
The K-12 team did an excellent job and matched last year's record net sales coming in flat on top of last year's 30%-plus growth. This was consistent with the expectations we shared on our year-end 2020 call, where we looked for strong nonseasonal first half performance to be followed by a deceleration in the second half. 
Chromebook availability continued to improve during the quarter and client devices increased low single digits on top of last year's stimulus equity and access-driven growth. Overall, transactions increased low single digits on top of last year's strong double-digit growth. Solutions declined driven by a double-digit decline in net comp, largely reflecting supply challenges. 
We continue to expect above historical net sales against some very tough unseasonal fourth quarter compares. Healthcare posted a 31% increase despite the second wave of COVID, staff shortages and limited ICU bed availability during the quarter. Some projects that have been sidelined did resume. This was particularly the case in security and health care remains a target for cyber crime. 
Our security experts continue to guide hospital systems to find the best solutions that protect their sensitive data and security sales increased strong double digits. 
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 30% on a reported basis. Both the U.K. and Canada delivered mid-20% growth in local currency. Customer priorities in both markets remain the same as the U.S. digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions, as do their investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations. 
Both operations experienced increased back orders. Clearly, the 11%-plus sales growth we delivered demonstrates the power of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. It also demonstrates the power of the second driver of our performance this quarter, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio, which you can see in our major category performance. 
Transactions increased low double digits, driven by client device growth in video. Solutions were flat with double-digit increases in servers and collaboration tools, offset by declines in NetComm and Enterprise Storage. 
Drilling further down into key solutions categories, cloud customer spend once again increased strong double digits. We saw robust growth across all 3 top cloud workloads: security, Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver. 
And once again, given its ongoing importance to our customers, our security practice delivered excellent results. Customer spend was up strong double digits. Our teams continue to guide customers on their security posture, assess their environment, design the best approach and deploy and manage the solutions throughout its life cycle. 
Overall, for the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in hardware, low single-digit growth in software and strong double-digit growth in services. Software net sales increased low single digits. Strong double-digit increase in security software, database software and backup and recovery were partially offset by declines in network management software, storage and telephony-related software. 
As I have shared before, services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. This quarter's nearly 30% growth was a product of both organic performance and inorganic contribution and was driven by both professional and managed services. 
And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, the impact of investments we are making in our 3-part strategy for growth. As you know, in October, we announced our planned acquisition of Sirius Computer Solutions. 
When we announced the acquisition, I shared how it deepens and adds scale to our services capabilities, capabilities that will ensure we remain the trusted technology adviser to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformation. 
Notice I had deepens Sirius' additive to our existing capabilities, capabilities we have built through both organic and inorganic investments, capabilities that enable us to serve customers as their trusted adviser, whether in a physical, digital or cloud-based environment in the U.S. and internationally. 
Why so many investments in services capabilities? Simply put, services are becoming an increasingly larger component of total e-customer IT spend. For CDW, services position us to enable the whole solution increase our engagement with customers and stickiness and provide insights into opportunities to further help our customers across the full IT life cycle. 
Today, IT leaders are accountable for both running the business and using technology to transform the business and deliver strategic outcomes to both run the business and transform it, leaders need to invest resources where they can have the greatest impact and do so with the greatest speed. 
Services are critical to making this happen. To address this need, we have built engineering services capability that span the full stack and full life cycle. Our technical organization has grown to more than 3,700 presales specialists and engineers. 
Today, we can deliver complex digital transformation solutions from code to cloud and data center to database and deliver them quickly. Let me share an example of how our services team is helping a global online home retailer to transform their business for their next wave of growth, a transformation that was hindered by legacy technology. 
To accelerate their transformation, our customer opted for a combination of public cloud technologies and new cloud native pattern. This would create the agility they needed essentially an on-demand environment. A great idea about accelerating cloud technology requires specialized expertise that is inefficient to keep on staff, and that is where CDW payment. 
First, we leveraged our cloud managed services and offloaded some of the cloud projects from the customer to CDW. Then we pulled in our Digital Velocity Talent orchestration services or DVT. DVT orchestration supplies customers with talent to work inside the customer's existing teams, talent that is becoming more and more vital in today's environment. 
Digital Velocity Talent orchestration delivers highly vetted resources, whether already employed by CDW or sourced by us. CDW Services enabled the solution, but it did so much more. As you can imagine, this level of high-touch integration creates customer loyalty with ongoing relationships on the ground and continued exchange between CDW and the customer, ultimately leading to more business, great for the customer and great for CDW. 
This is an excellent example of our 3-part strategy in action and how M&A enhances our organic investments to ensure we remain our customers' #1 choice as a trusted adviser. Solving key business problems for our customers in today's environment requires strong service and solutions capabilities, capabilities that when combined with our great relationships and competitive advantages of scale, scope and disciplined execution, enable us to win in the marketplace and deliver sustainable, profitable growth today and in the future. 
And that leads me to our expectations for the balance of the year. We continue to look for growth in 2021 to come in between 9.25% and 10% in constant currency, split roughly between 5% IT market growth and 425 to 500 basis points of CDW market outperformance. 
This reflects our expectation that supply constraints do not mitigate any time in the near future. but do not get materially worse. Remember, these constraints don't just reflect component shortages, but also labor and logistics challenges. Challenges we do not expect to reverse in the near term, and challenges that we do not expect to resolve as a flush rather gradually. 
As far as wildcards, in addition to the fluid supply situation and the potential for another wave of COVID, given the slowdown in third quarter GDP growth, we will keep a watchful eye out for any slowdown in the economy. 
As we do, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition. 
I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place, a strategy that serves us well when contrasted with macro or customer-specific challenges and positions us for sustainable growth. a strategy designed to continue our evolution as the leading IT solutions provider, and most importantly, a strategy that delivers profitable growth and returns to shareholders. 
This confidence underpins today's action by our Board to increase our quarterly cash dividend by 25%. I know many of you may be wondering what we expect for next year. We are in the middle of our planning process. And as we always do, we'll provide our outlook for 2022 on our year-end conference call. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Al?"

I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the third quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with the 2021 outlook. Turning to our third quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated ne",1624,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the third quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with the 2021 outlook. 
Turning to our third quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.3 billion, up 11.4% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7%. Net sales and channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year, Corporate, Small Business and International continue to rebound, posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter and delivering sales above 2019 levels. 
This quarter's growth also benefited from strong double-digit performance in health care, but was tempered by a slowdown in education and declining government. On the supply side, overall backlog increased several hundred million dollars in the quarter and continues to be elevated year-over-year. 
The team did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages so the backlog did not increase even more. Gross profit for the quarter was $915 million, an increase of 10.8% on a reported basis. Gross margin was 17.3%, down approximately 10 basis points versus last year. This is primarily driven by lower product margin, partially offset by an increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily in Software-as-a-Service in addition to strong Professional and Managed Services performance. 
Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 9.2%. Increase is primarily driven by payroll costs including sales compensation, which moves gross profit growth, and performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against financial goals. 
Finally, it reflects investments in the business, including increased coworker accounts focused on execution of our strategy. Coworker count at the end of the third quarter was 11,098, up 432 from the second quarter and 1,118 over prior year. The increase in coworker account reflects organic and organic, inorganic investments to support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation. 
GAAP operating income was $386 million, up 21.6%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $435 million, up 12.6%. And non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.2%. 
Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 9.4%. The decrease was primarily due to savings from last year's refinancing. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 23.9%. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. 
For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.3%, up 200 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to a onetime impact of state and foreign tax benefits recognized in the prior year. 
As you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $139 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.91, up 43.2%. Our non-GAAP net income was $298 million in the quarter, up 12.3%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $2.13, up 16.4% from last year. 
Turning to year-to-date results on Slides 14 through 19. Net sales were $15 billion, an increase of 13.1% on a reported basis and 13.7% on an average daily sales basis. We had 1 fewer selling day year-to-date in 2021, which will be made up in Q4, and we have 1 extra selling day compared to the prior year. 
On a constant currency average daily sales basis, year-to-date consolidated net sales were 12.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $2.6 billion, up 11.3% and gross profit margin was 17%, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. 
Operating income was roughly $1.1 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion, up 18.7%. Net income was $773 million and non-GAAP net income was $834 million, up 20.7%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $5.89, up 23.5%. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents were $245 million and net debt was $3.8 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. 
Year-to-date free cash flow was $341 million, as shown on Slide 21. This is lighter than last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items. 
Year-to-date, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. Additionally, working capital increased to support our strong year-to-date growth, and we continue to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers through this choppy supply environment. 
Moving to Slide 22. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 25 days, up 9 days from last year's third quarter. Increase was primarily driven by mixing out of vendors with longer payment cycles, in addition, to holding customer-driven stocking positions and the timing of receipts and shipments. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 23. Our 2021 priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income, including today's 25% increase to the dividend. The increased annual dividend of $2 is approximately 25% of trailing 12-month non-GAAP net income through September. 
The Q4 2021 dividend demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation of the business and marks the eighth consecutive year of increases since our initial public offering in 2013. 
Our dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 36% from its initial level. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio going forward, growing the dividend in line with earnings. 
Second, we ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the third quarter at 2.3x. 
Third, supplement organic growth for strategic acquisitions, Sirius, which we announced on October 18 and our recent Focal Point and Amplified IT acquisitions are great examples. 
And fourth, we return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. During the quarter, we continued to deploy cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, returning $505 million to shareholders, including $55 million of dividends and $450 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $188 per share. 
We continue to expect to return approximately $1.7 billion to shareholders for the full year 2021, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases with the balance from dividends. 
Going forward, we continue to continue to execute against our capital allocation priorities as we have done since 2014. In 2022, post closing of the Sirius acquisition, we expect to have an initial net leverage ratio of approximately 3.3x. While our capital allocation priorities will remain the same, we will shift our objectives to focus on paying the dividend and reducing debt. 
As a result of this focus, we'll put a lower priority on M&A and share repurchases until our net leverage is in our target range of 2.5x to 3x, which we expect to achieve by the end of 2022. We continue to expect to close the Sirius acquisition in December, and we intend to share additional thoughts on the financial impacts of consolidating Sirius into CDW on our fourth quarter call. 
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 24. Supply and product lead times remain fluid, making it challenging to comprehensively forecast the high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with both U.S. and international commercial customers. 
On the supply side, visibility remains a challenge. Constraints continue to notebooks, desktops, video, NetComm and data center categories, resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog. With the exception of Chromebooks, the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call; we do not expect it to improve in the near future. 
With that context for full year 2021, we continue to expect the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 5% and our net sales to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market in constant currency. This assumes a consistent supply chain environment and impact to our backlog. 
We feel good about the health of the business, and we continue to navigate the fluid supply environment. We continue to expect currency to contribute an approximately 80 basis points of the full year net sales growth, assuming exchange rates of $1.38 to the British pound and $0.80 to the Canadian dollar. 
Moving down the P&L. We now expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the high 7% range for full year 2021. As you've heard us say, we believe now is the time to invest in the business and expect investments made in the fourth quarter to drive an operating margin, which will deliver our full year outlook. 
Putting it all together, we now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the high teens, call it, 18% plus or minus 25 basis points. Currency is expected to contribute an additional 70 basis points to earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. 
For free cash flow, our long-term rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. However, given the timing impacts that contributed 2020's significant over delivery and ongoing customer-driven stocking positions as well as the time of receipts and shipments, we expect 2021 free cash flow to come in slightly below the low end of the range. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of free cash flow including capital expenditures and the cash conversion cycle can also be found on Slide 25. 
That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

And conversely, the CDW mid-market customers more interested in Sirius's services portfolio. So kind of a qualitative view from the customer perspective on potential revenue synergies in this deal."

So our customers at CDW are delighted about the acquisition and really looking forward to the combined entity and the capabilities that they help bolster CDW given their reputation in the market and the quality of their services. 
And the reciprocal is true as well. I talked to Joe Murten late in the day of the announcement, and he made his way through a lot of customers had their frontline sellers. And it was, for the most part, all positive. So again, we think that I said the word before a home run deal, and we're going to make it work really well, and our customers seem to be excited.

Look, we called this out earlier in the year, and I mentioned it again in our prepared -- my prepared remarks, but it's really been unseasonal, and we expected to see the first half of this year be quite strong as it has been, but we have -- we are lapping a big back half of the year. So we would expect to still continue to see, I'll call it, solid performance and it's a bit unseasonal because at the end of the year. 
But it's going to decelerate in our view, and it will be difficult to overcome the level of growth that we saw last year. That said Ruplu, if the stimulus funding, for example, the Emergency Connectivity Act is yet another source of funds for education institutions to be able to fortify their classrooms in the hybrid environment. 
The one thing with that funding is schools are able to use it for orders that are placed. So we're working our way through what of that money relates to orders that have been placed, but we're confident that there's a large portion that are additive to the base. 
And again, the team, as they always do, has done a phenomenal job helping our K-12 customers work through that funding. So as you've heard me say before, I feel very confident in education over the long term. It is a growth area. The education market has inflection points, and we have always been ahead of those inflection points, whether it's how the classroom itself changes, whether it's going to hybrid, whatever those are, we are usually there. 
And I'll tell you, Amplified IT, which we just added, is taking us to yet another leg of growth for K-12 with their cloud-enabled capabilities and their IP developed technology that they offer for classrooms. So tough half year, but the team is doing very well in long-term growth area."

And I'll just start, if you just put aside the supply chain environment, right? Mix does really matter. 
So if we think about components what's transactional, what's solutional from a mix perspective, that matters. Channel mix matters. All those things have an impact, I'll say, to start on your gross margin. And obviously, then the kind of the drop down from an operating margin perspective. 
So let's just keep that in minds. And again, kind of supply chain will matter as well. In the case of this particular quarter and maybe as an example, so on a sequential basis, our gross profit margin increased from the prior quarter, right? 
And some moving parts there in terms of mix there, that is a little bit less public mix from a channel perspective, and then you've got transactional solution. And then very notably, Ruplu, I would just note the fact that your 100% gross margin items will have an impact. In this quarter, our 100% gross margin items grew faster than our net sales. So that's going to have an impact as well. 
And so again, all of that steeped in focus on gross margin. Then finally, if we walk that down to operating margin, it's been just a matter of the -- at what pace is our non-GAAP SG&A spend happening? In the case of this quarter, I would say our non-GAAP SG&A spend lags some of that growth in gross profit and so we dropped more to the operating margin for the quarter. 
And when you look to our outlook, relative to what that operating margin was for this quarter, we're giving an outlook of high 7s. And that reflects that we would expect in the fourth quarter that spend is going to pick back up and it's going to balance is back out to a high 7s on the operating margin. 
As you look forward, look, I think you get a good sense for the strategy and the movement in where we're going longer term in terms of mixing into services and mixing in 100% gross margin, all those mix components will matter as we go forward."

Can you talk a little bit about the visibility? Are they starting to place orders or starting to say, ""Hey, if this gets approved and if we get this amount, here's what I want.""

So let me start with education, which is I think where you were going there. Yes, it's complicated, right? We've got the supply ecosystem that is -- has got some impacts to it right now. So we're trying to manage through all of that. 
Here's what I'd say about K-12. You know we have a lot of experience understanding funding, stimulus funding and other types of funding for educational institutions. So we sit side-by-side with our customers to make sure they understand both where the dollars can be used for what products in particular or for what outcomes because sometimes outcome based, and what the deadlines are and what those deadlines mean? 
Do you have to have the product in-house? Do you have to have the product order placed? So there's a lot of navigating that's going on, and I feel highly confident that the team is doing a phenomenal job with our customers and that our K-12 customers are not going to lose out on any funding. That's really clear. 
In the state and local space where we've got stimulus funding coming down, it's been a bit complicated because the funding packages, there were 3 of them, as we've talked about before. The CARES Act package, for example, had a deadline at the end of the coming year, that was from March of last year. 
The end of last year, it was -- there was nothing for states and locals in the stimulus package. And then in March, there was a hefty amount. But as we all know, when it comes to state and local, it's about budget cycles, and it's about funding deadlines. 
So the spending that's taken place in 2021 is primarily from the CARES package with a deadline this year. What we're seeing now is, I don't want to call it slowing down, but I'm going to say a moderating in planning and state and local governments now have the funding where they don't have to spend until the end of 2024. 
And so they are now looking at a multiyear approach. Pretty unusual, is a multiyear approach, but that's what they're doing. And we're helping them with it. There's a lot of complexity. It's very solution-based in my view, in terms of what customers are trying to do. So we don't really expect that to meaningfully come to fruition until early next year. 
But there's just a lot of tentacles, and they're all different based on the stimulus package and on the actual market that we're talking to. But again, I would just reiterate that this is something we do. It's frankly a core capability like working with partners. It's a core capability to understand in the federal state and local education, health care spaces, where the funding is, what it means, what the deadlines are and how to use it and then to basically walk our customers through it. So I know that was a long answer, it was helpful."

We've been asking ourselves that as well and talking to customers about it, given the kind of pervasive and persistent nature of the supply chain and the fact that it continues to extend, I would say -- I would characterize it this way: customers are rethinking and considering accelerating some movement to cloud and potentially rearchitecting some of their solutions in more -- in a public cloud-like environment versus, for example, on-prem cloud. 
But what I wouldn't characterize it as is just a wholesale shift. Customers are still very strategic in how they think about both flexibility, obviously, and scalability, but also cost. And if you combine all of those things together, they're still looking for the absolute best solution and, therefore, not just doing the wholesale shift. 
So I guess the answer would be: we are having those conversations, we are seeing some decisions made around accelerating to public cloud, but I wouldn't say that it's with and wholesale, if that helps."

We are going to see sort of replacement cycles of PCs for a couple of reasons, wear and tear, but also the technology improves at a faster pace and client devices are more and more important to the productivity of the people using them. 
You also have use cases that are expanding. And the hybrid work model obviously is really driving PC usage. So we will -- we feel good about PC growth and Win 11 will certainly be a driver of that at some point over probably a couple of year period."

All of that said, I'll tell you the sentiment of our customers is, we're moving forward. We're thinking and investing for getting back to kind of a robust environment and economy, and we're thinking forward. So I think a little bit unlike going into last year's winter months where the cautiousness, I would say, was on a really high level. 
We're just feeling customers saying, we got to invest. And so if we're not going to be going back to work until early next year or work from anywhere, we've got to invest. And that is, I would say, ubiquitous across the markets that we serve. 
So we -- in 2020, we talked about the unevenness and the impact of certain geos, certain industries, et cetera, I just feel like the tone has really changed to the platform of we got to get back, we got to get back, we got to build for the future. So that's what we're seeing."

Is there a willingness of your customers to move to another solution set or a hardware solution set that can be fulfilled by the end of the year? Because the thinking is a lot of these companies have IT budget, they want to spend anyway, and there's always a project to wish that they want to do. 
Are people willing to convert to other projects in order to spend that money? Or are they holding on until the products are available?"

So small businesses have always been more nimble and less kind of tied to particular requirements. And we have seen success there. And I think in my prepared remarks, we indicated the supply chain, while they were impacted, supply chain constraints didn't impact them as much as in corporate because we could help them find alternatives. 
When you get to larger organizations, it becomes harder because those organizations have specific requirements. And they really don't want to shift off of them. It creates more work, frankly, within the organization. What we've seen there, and I think Al mentioned it is, we have worked with our customers to get in line earlier. 
So a lot of customers have been working very hard to get their orders in earlier than they typically would in hopes that they will get -- get the product by year-end. All that said, anywhere that there are, I'll say, mission -- less than mission-critical type technology that we can help them find alternative whether it's a brand, whether it is the cloud, whether it's something else that they can be using, you can bet we're doing it.

We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks as we always try to do to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.  
But before I get started, I do want to pause for a moment to honor the life and legacy of our former CEO, Tom Richards, who passed away last week after a valiant fight with cancer. I suspect most of you on this call have likely met Tom in person. I'm certain that everyone on this call has been impacted by Tom. He was a fierce competitor and equally a kind human being.  
Tom had a lot of what we like to call it CDW Tomism, simple ways of getting to the essence of something in a way that's stuck. One of my personal favorites is when Tom used to say at CDW, we take what we do seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. That's the essence of who we are. That is our CDW culture, captured so simply and amplified so strongly by Tom Richards.  
Tom also had an unexpected way of signing off on our earnings call, usually with a right comment about an upcoming holiday like Halloween or Mother's Day or even Valentine's Day. As a result, we always ended these calls on a high note and with a chuckle.  
Tom knew his audience well. In honor of Tom, I'd like to kick off this earnings call with the tagline he penned on every communication to a coworker. Tom always signed off with ""You make a difference,"" literally injecting into each coworker, Tom's personal belief in them and their important impact. On behalf of all of our coworkers around the globe, our customers and our partners, our communities and our investors, I would like to say thank you to Tom, you made a difference. 
Let me turn now to Q3 performance. Once again, CDW posted strong top line growth and profitability. Overall demand was strong and the teams did a great job addressing customer needs. For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $5.3 billion, 11.4% higher than last year and up 10.7% in constant currency.  
Non-GAAP operating income of $435 million, up 12.6% and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.13, 15.4% higher than last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant currency.  
Our ability to deliver this strong top line and profitability was the result of 3 key drivers: our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio and our ongoing execution against our 3-part strategy, which is focused on taking share and investing in the solutions and capabilities our customers need and want.  
Let me walk through each one of these and share some detail about how they contributed to our performance. First, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: corporate; small business; health care; government, which includes federal and state and local customers; and education with K-12 and higher ed.  
We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, each serving public and commercial customers. All of these operations represent meaningful businesses in their own right. Often different factors impact these diverse customer end markets. And this quarter, we saw that play out as our commercial business in the U.S., our small and corporate channels and our international operations posted significant double-digit increases, while our U.S. public's business posted a mid-single-digit decline.  
From a macro perspective, supply remains under pressure this quarter. Demand outpaced supply and lead times extended, particularly in several solutions areas. The team continued to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the supply environment. They did an exceptional job working with our partners to stay on top of availability status.  
Our sellers and technical specialists also worked with customers and whenever possible, found alternative available product and built alternative solutions. These efforts helped mitigate some of the pressure and our backlog increase was consistent with last quarter. The tight supply environment continued to impact prices, which our teams were generally able to pass along.  
Let's take a deeper look at third quarter customer end market performance. Commercial customer priorities remain the same as in the second quarter, digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions. Customers continue to prioritize investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations to strengthen and secure infrastructure platform and end points.  
Within this backdrop, Corporate increased 25% and customer demand remains strong. While many customers delayed return to office, they continued to prepare as well as invest to facilitate hybrid work. This drove ongoing strong double-digit increases in transactions, propelled by notebook, audiovisual and desktop. At the same time, digital transformation remained a top priority. While buying sentiment was clearly there, in many cases, the product was not.  
Writings were strong, but with extended lead time backlog built during the quarter. Lack of product availability, particularly in NetComm and storage muted corporate solutions growth.  
Small business also delivered another exceptional quarter of growth, increasing almost 40%. The team continued to help customers with remote enablement, security and video, driving strong growth across both transactional and solutions categories.  
As we have shared previously, small business customers tend to be more flexible in their technology requirements. So while they did see some impact from supply constraints, small business did not experience as much as Corporate, a great example of the power of diverse end markets.  
You also see the power of our diverse end markets and our public performance. Net sales for our government channel decreased 33%. Federal declined double digits, in large part due to the overlapping of our Device-as-a-Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and other client device programs that were particularly strong last year.  
Security remains robust, with net sales up more than 30%. The gears of Washington were slower than typical at federal year-end, and we had contracting delays in several large contracts. This is not unusual. Given the magnitude of federal contracts, timing can influence performance. You've heard us talk about Federal's lumpy nature in the past. This will unwind, and we expect to see a reversal back to growth in the first half of 2022.  
State and local posted a mid-single-digit decline. Stimulus funding remained largely unallocated to the local level. This is because access to the multiyear American Rescue Plan Act funding with deadlines in 2024 led to greater focus on multiyear budget planning.  
At the same time, state and local customers were focused on digesting last year's meaningful stimulus-funded IT investments. We continue to work with our customers, but given the complexity of the various funding opportunities and multiyear phasing, we do not expect to see projects moving ahead meaningfully until early 2022.  
Education increased by 2%. Higher Ed delivered high single-digit growth, driven by ongoing focus on campus connectivity and enhancing the dorm room experience with double-digit growth in both security software and servers.  
The K-12 team did an excellent job and matched last year's record net sales coming in flat on top of last year's 30%-plus growth. This was consistent with the expectations we shared on our year-end 2020 call, where we looked for strong nonseasonal first half performance to be followed by a deceleration in the second half.  
Chromebook availability continued to improve during the quarter and client devices increased low single digits on top of last year's stimulus equity and access-driven growth. Overall, transactions increased low single digits on top of last year's strong double-digit growth. Solutions declined driven by a double-digit decline in net comp, largely reflecting supply challenges.  
We continue to expect above historical net sales against some very tough unseasonal fourth quarter compares. Healthcare posted a 31% increase despite the second wave of COVID, staff shortages and limited ICU bed availability during the quarter. Some projects that have been sidelined did resume. This was particularly the case in security and health care remains a target for cybercrime.  
Our security experts continue to guide hospital systems to find the best solutions that protect their sensitive data and security sales increased strong double digits.  
Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 30% on a reported basis. Both the U.K. and Canada delivered mid-20% growth in local currency. Customer priorities in both markets remain the same as the U.S. digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions, as do their investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations.  
Both operations experienced increased back orders. Clearly, the 11%-plus sales growth we delivered demonstrates the power of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. It also demonstrates the power of the second driver of our performance this quarter, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio, which you can see in our major category performance.  
Transactions increased low double digits, driven by client device growth in video. Solutions were flat with double-digit increases in servers and collaboration tools, offset by declines in NetComm and Enterprise Storage.  
Drilling further down into key solutions categories, cloud customer spend once again increased strong double digits. We saw robust growth across all 3 top cloud workloads: security, Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver.  
And once again, given its ongoing importance to our customers, our security practice delivered excellent results. Customer spend was up strong double digits. Our teams continue to guide customers on their security posture, assess their environment, design the best approach and deploy and manage the solutions throughout its life cycle.  
Overall, for the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in hardware, low single-digit growth in software and strong double-digit growth in services. Software net sales increased low single digits. Strong double-digit increase in security software, database software and backup and recovery were partially offset by declines in network management software, storage and telephony-related software.  
As I have shared before, services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. This quarter's nearly 30% growth was a product of both organic performance and inorganic contribution and was driven by both professional and managed services.  
And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, the impact of investments we are making in our 3-part strategy for growth. As you know, in October, we announced our planned acquisition of Sirius Computer Solutions.  
When we announced the acquisition, I shared how it deepens and adds scale to our services capabilities, capabilities that will ensure we remain the trusted technology adviser to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformation.  
Notice I said deepens Sirius' additive to our existing capabilities, capabilities we have built through both organic and inorganic investments, capabilities that enable us to serve customers as their trusted adviser, whether in a physical, digital or cloud-based environment in the U.S. and internationally.  
Why so many investments in services capabilities? Simply put, services are becoming an increasingly larger component of total e-customer IT spend. For CDW, services position us to enable the whole solution, increase our engagement with customers and stickiness, and provide insights into opportunities to further help our customers across the full IT life cycle.  
Today, IT leaders are accountable for both running the business and using technology to transform the business and deliver strategic outcomes to both run the business and transform it, leaders need to invest resources where they can have the greatest impact and do so with the greatest speed.  
Services are critical to making this happen. To address this need, we have built engineering services capability that span the full stack and full life cycle. Our technical organization has grown to more than 3,700 presales specialists and engineers.  
Today, we can deliver complex digital transformation solutions from code to cloud and data center to database and deliver them quickly. Let me share an example of how our services team is helping a global online home retailer to transform their business for their next wave of growth, a transformation that was hindered by legacy technology.  
To accelerate their transformation, our customer opted for a combination of public cloud technologies and new cloud native pattern. This would create the agility they needed essentially an on-demand environment. A great idea about accelerating cloud technology requires specialized expertise that is inefficient to keep on staff, and that is where CDW came in.  
First, we leveraged our cloud managed services and offloaded some of the cloud projects from the customer to CDW. Then we pulled in our Digital Velocity Talent orchestration services or DVT. DVT orchestration supplies customers with talent to work inside the customer's existing teams, talent that is becoming more and more vital in today's environment.  
Digital Velocity Talent orchestration delivers highly vetted resources, whether already employed by CDW or sourced by us. CDW Services enabled the solution, but it did so much more. As you can imagine, this level of high-touch integration creates customer loyalty with ongoing relationships on the ground and continued exchange between CDW and the customer, ultimately leading to more business, great for the customer and great for CDW.  
This is an excellent example of our 3-part strategy in action and how M&A enhances our organic investments to ensure we remain our customers' #1 choice as a trusted adviser. Solving key business problems for our customers in today's environment requires strong service and solutions capabilities, capabilities that when combined with our great relationships and competitive advantages of scale, scope and disciplined execution, enable us to win in the marketplace and deliver sustainable, profitable growth today and in the future.  
And that leads me to our expectations for the balance of the year. We continue to look for growth in 2021 to come in between 9.25% and 10% in constant currency, split roughly between 5% IT market growth and 425 to 500 basis points of CDW market outperformance.  
This reflects our expectation that supply constraints do not mitigate any time in the near future. but do not get materially worse. Remember, these constraints don't just reflect component shortages, but also labor and logistics challenges. Challenges we do not expect to reverse in the near term, and challenges that we do not expect to resolve as a flush rather gradually. 
As far as wildcards, in addition to the fluid supply situation and the potential for another wave of COVID, given the slowdown in third quarter GDP growth, we will keep a watchful eye out for any slowdown in the economy.  
As we do, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition.  
I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place, a strategy that serves us well when contrasted with macro or customer-specific challenges and positions us for sustainable growth, a strategy designed to continue our evolution as the leading IT solutions provider, and most importantly, a strategy that delivers profitable growth and returns to shareholders.  
This confidence underpins today's action by our Board to increase our quarterly cash dividend by 25%. I know many of you may be wondering what we expect for next year. We are in the middle of our planning process. And as we always do, we'll provide our outlook for 2022 on our year-end conference call.  
And with that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Al?"

I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the third quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with the 2021 outlook.  
Turning to our third quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.3 billion, up 11.4% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7%. Net sales and channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year, Corporate, Small Business and International continue to rebound, posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter and delivering sales above 2019 levels.  
This quarter's growth also benefited from strong double-digit performance in health care, but was tempered by a slowdown in education and decline in government. On the supply side, overall backlog increased several hundred million dollars in the quarter and continues to be elevated year-over-year.  
The team did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages so the backlog did not increase even more. Gross profit for the quarter was $915 million, an increase of 10.8% on a reported basis. Gross margin was 17.3%, down approximately 10 basis points versus last year. This is primarily driven by lower product margin, partially offset by an increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily in Software-as-a-Service in addition to strong Professional and Managed Services performance.  
Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 9.2%. Increase is primarily driven by payroll costs including sales compensation, which moves gross profit growth, and performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against financial goals.  
Finally, it reflects investments in the business, including increased coworker counts focused on execution of our strategy. Coworker count at the end of the third quarter was 11,098, up 432 from the second quarter and 1,118 over prior year. The increase in coworker count reflects organic and inorganic investments to support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation.  
GAAP operating income was $386 million, up 21.6%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $435 million, up 12.6%. And non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.2%.  
Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 9.4%. The decrease was primarily due to savings from last year's refinancing. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 23.9%. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12.  
For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.3%, up 200 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to a onetime impact of state and foreign tax benefits recognized in the prior year.  
As you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $139 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.91, up 43.2%. Our non-GAAP net income was $298 million in the quarter, up 12.3%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $2.13, up 16.4% from last year.  
Turning to year-to-date results on Slides 14 through 19. Net sales were $15 billion, an increase of 13.1% on a reported basis and 13.7% on an average daily sales basis. We had 1 fewer selling day year-to-date in 2021, which will be made up in Q4, and we have 1 extra selling day compared to the prior year.  
On a constant currency average daily sales basis, year-to-date consolidated net sales were 12.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $2.6 billion, up 11.3% and gross profit margin was 17%, down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year.  
Operating income was roughly $1.1 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion, up 18.7%. Net income was $773 million and non-GAAP net income was $834 million, up 20.7%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $5.89, up 23.5%.  
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents were $245 million and net debt was $3.8 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion.  
Year-to-date free cash flow was $341 million, as shown on Slide 21. This is lighter than last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items.  
Year-to-date, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. Additionally, working capital increased to support our strong year-to-date growth, and we continue to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers through this choppy supply environment.  
Moving to Slide 22. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 25 days, up 9 days from last year's third quarter. Increase was primarily driven by mixing out of vendors with longer payment cycles, in addition, to holding customer-driven stocking positions and the timing of receipts and shipments.  
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 23. Our 2021 priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income, including today's 25% increase to the dividend. The increased annual dividend of $2 is approximately 25% of trailing 12-month non-GAAP net income through September.  
The Q4 2021 dividend demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation of the business and marks the eighth consecutive year of increases since our initial public offering in 2013.  
Our dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 36% from its initial level. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio going forward, growing the dividend in line with earnings.  
Second, we ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the third quarter at 2.3x.  
Third, supplement organic growth for strategic acquisitions, Sirius, which we announced on October 18 and our recent Focal Point and Amplified IT acquisitions are great examples.  
And fourth, we return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. During the quarter, we continued to deploy cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, returning $505 million to shareholders, including $55 million of dividends and $450 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $188 per share.  
We continue to expect to return approximately $1.7 billion to shareholders for the full year 2021, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases with the balance from dividends.  
Going forward, we continue to execute against our capital allocation priorities as we have done since 2014. In 2022, post closing of the Sirius acquisition, we expect to have an initial net leverage ratio of approximately 3.3x. While our capital allocation priorities will remain the same, we will shift our objectives to focus on paying the dividend and reducing debt.  
As a result of this focus, we'll put a lower priority on M&A and share repurchases until our net leverage is in our target range of 2.5x to 3x, which we expect to achieve by the end of 2022. We continue to expect to close the Sirius acquisition in December, and we intend to share additional thoughts on the financial impacts of consolidating Sirius into CDW on our fourth quarter call.  
Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 24. Supply and product lead times remain fluid, making it challenging to comprehensively forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with both U.S. and international commercial customers.  
On the supply side, visibility remains a challenge. Constraints continue to notebooks, desktops, video, NetComm and data center categories, resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog. With the exception of Chromebooks, the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call; we do not expect it to improve in the near future.  
With that context for full year 2021, we continue to expect the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 5% and our net sales to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market in constant currency. This assumes a consistent supply chain environment and impact to our backlog.  
We feel good about the health of the business, and we continue to navigate the fluid supply environment. We continue to expect currency to contribute an approximately 80 basis points of the full year net sales growth, assuming exchange rates of $1.38 to the British pound and $0.80 to the Canadian dollar.  
Moving down the P&L. We now expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the high 7% range for full year 2021. As you've heard us say, we believe now is the time to invest in the business and expect investments made in the fourth quarter to drive an operating margin, which will deliver our full year outlook.  
Putting it all together, we now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the high teens. call it, 18% plus or minus 25 basis points. Currency is expected to contribute an additional 70 basis points to earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25.  
For free cash flow, our long-term rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. However, given the timing impacts that contributed 2020's significant over delivery and ongoing customer-driven stocking positions as well as the time of receipts and shipments, we expect 2021 free cash flow to come in slightly below the low end of the range. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of free cash flow including capital expenditures and the cash conversion cycle can also be found on Slide 25.  
That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

That said, one of the areas that we focus very quickly was feedback. And I would just tell you, it's been really, really positive on both fronts.  
So our customers at CDW are delighted about the acquisition and really looking forward to the combined entity and the capabilities that they help bolster CDW given their reputation in the market and the quality of their services.  
And the reciprocal is true as well. I talked to Joe Mertens late in the day of the announcement, and he made his way through a lot of customers as had their frontline sellers. And it was, for the most part, all positive. So again, we think that as I said the word before a home run deal, and we're going to make it work really well, and our customers seem to be excited. Our partners equally are thrilled. It's exactly what they were looking for us to do and they're thrilled."

So as we always do, we'll keep an eye on it. It feels a little worse than transitory. But again, we think that technology is an A1 priority, and our customers will continue to invest in technology. if, in fact, it becomes a little more expensive, we think they'll keep the priority there.

So how should we think about -- can you give us your thoughts on this end market going into 4Q? I mean how do you balance -- I mean, what are your thoughts on the stimulus package and the benefit you can get there versus the year-on-year headwinds you've had from a stronger year ago quarter?"

They will appreciate that. Look, we called this out earlier in the year, and I mentioned it again in our prepared -- my prepared remarks, but it's really been unseasonal, and we expected to see the first half of this year be quite strong as it has been, but we have -- we are lapping a big back half of the year. So we would expect to still continue to see, I'll call it, solid performance and it's a bit unseasonal because at the end of the year.  
But it's going to decelerate in our view, and it will be difficult to overcome the level of growth that we saw last year. That said Ruplu, it's the stimulus funding, for example, the Emergency Connectivity Act is yet another source of funds for education institutions to be able to fortify their classrooms in the hybrid environment.  
The one thing with that funding is schools are able to use it for orders that are placed. So we're working our way through what if that money relates to orders that have been placed, but we're confident that there's a large portion that are additive to the base.  
And again, the team, as they always do, has done a phenomenal job helping our K-12 customers work through that funding. So as you've heard me say before, I feel very confident in education over the long term. It is a growth area. The education market has inflection points, and we have always been ahead of those inflection points, whether it's how the classroom itself changes, whether it's going to hybrid, whatever those are, we are usually there.  
And I'll tell you, Amplified IT, which we just added, is taking us to yet another leg of growth for K-12 with their cloud-enabled capabilities and their IP developed technology that they offer for classrooms. So tough half year, but the team is doing very well in long-term growth area."

And I'll just start, if you just put aside the supply chain environment, right? Mix does really matter.  
So if we think about components what's transactional, what's solutional from a mix perspective, that matters. Channel mix matters. All those things have an impact, I'll say, to start on your gross margin. And obviously, then the kind of the drop down from an operating margin perspective.  
So let's just keep that in minds. And again, kind of supply chain will matter as well. In the case of this particular quarter and maybe as an example, so on a sequential basis, our gross profit margin increased from the prior quarter, right?  
And some moving parts there in terms of mix there, that is a little bit less public mix from a channel perspective, and then you've got transactional solution. And then very notably, Ruplu, I would just note the fact that your 100% gross margin items will have an impact. In this quarter, our 100% gross margin items grew faster than our net sales. So that's going to have an impact as well.  
And so again, all of that steeped in focus on gross margin. Then finally, if we walk that down to operating margin, it's been just a matter of the -- at what pace is our non-GAAP SG&A spend happening? In the case of this quarter, I would say our non-GAAP SG&A spend lags some of that growth in gross profit. And so we dropped more to the operating margin for the quarter.  
And when you look to our outlook, relative to what that operating margin was for this quarter, we're giving an outlook of high 7s. And that reflects that we would expect in the fourth quarter that spend is going to pick back up and it's going to balance us back out to a high 7s on the operating margin.  
As you look forward, look, I think you get a good sense for the strategy and the movement in where we're going longer term in terms of mixing into services and mixing into 100% gross margin, all those mix components will matter as we go forward."

So there's a lot of navigating that's going on, and I feel highly confident that the team is doing a phenomenal job with our customers and that our K-12 customers are not going to lose out on any funding. That's really clear. 
In the state and local space where we've got stimulus funding coming down, it's been a bit complicated because the funding packages, there were 3 of them, as we've talked about before. The CARES Act package, for example, had a deadline at the end of the coming year, that was from March of last year. 
The end of last year, it was -- there was nothing for states and locals in the stimulus package. And then in March, there was a hefty amount. But as we all know, when it comes to state and local, it's about budget cycles, and it's about funding deadlines. 
So the spending that's taken place in 2021 is primarily from the CARES package with a deadline this year. What we're seeing now is, I don't want to call it slowing down, but I'm going to say a moderating in planning and state and local governments now have the funding where they don't have to spend until the end of 2024. 
And so they are now looking at a multiyear approach. Pretty unusual this multiyear approach, but that's what they're doing. And we're helping them with it. There's a lot of complexity. It's very solution-based in my view, in terms of what customers are trying to do. So we don't really expect that to meaningfully come to fruition until early next year. 
But there's just a lot of tentacles, and they're all different based on the stimulus package and on the actual market that we're talking to. But again, I would just reiterate that this is something we do. It's frankly a core capability like working with partners. It's a core capability to understand in the federal state and local education, health care spaces, where the funding is, what it means, what the deadlines are and how to use it and then to basically walk our customers through it. So I know that was a long answer, I hope it was helpful."

From a cash balance perspective, I think, Katy, if you compare it to where we were at the end of the year and maybe a year ago, certainly, we look lower. And a couple of things there. One, we had a debt refinancing or financing, I should say, in 2021. So that bolstered that cash position. 
And then notably, for 2021, we've used a fair amount of cash for the existing acquisitions we've had as well as share repurchases. So I think the combination of where we sit from a cash balance on our revolver availability perspective, we feel quite good with where we stand and then we feel quite good about our ability to create and generate free cash flow in 2022."

We've been asking ourselves that as well and talking to customers about it, given the kind of pervasive and persistent nature of the supply chain and the fact that it continues to extend, I would say -- I would characterize it this way: customers are rethinking and considering accelerating some movement to cloud and potentially rearchitecting some of their solutions in more -- in a public cloud-like environment versus, for example, on-prem cloud. 
But what I wouldn't characterize it as is just a wholesale shift. Customers are still very strategic in how they think about both flexibility, obviously, and scalability, but also cost. And if you combine all of those things together, they're still looking for the absolute best solution and, therefore, not just doing the wholesale shift. 
So I guess the answer would be: we are having those conversations, we are seeing some decisions made around accelerating to public cloud, but I wouldn't say that it's with and wholesale, if that helps."

We are going to see sort of replacement cycles of PCs for a couple of reasons, wear and tear, but also the technology improves at a faster pace and client devices are more and more important to the productivity of the people using them. 
You also have use cases that are expanding. And the hybrid work model obviously is really driving PC usage. So we will -- we feel good about PC growth and Win 11 will certainly be a driver of that at some point over probably a couple of year period."

All of that said, I'll tell you the sentiment of our customers is, we're moving forward. We're thinking and investing for getting back to kind of a robust environment and economy, and we're thinking forward. So I think a little bit unlike going into last year's winter months where the cautiousness, I would say, was on a really high level. 
We're just feeling customers saying, we got to invest. And so if we're not going to be going back to work until early next year or work from anywhere, we've got to invest. And that is, I would say, ubiquitous across the markets that we serve.

Is there a willingness of your customers to move to another solution set or a hardware solution set that can be fulfilled by the end of the year?

So small businesses have always been more nimble and less kind of tied to particular requirements. And we have seen success there. And I think in my prepared remarks, we indicated the supply chain, while they were impacted, supply chain constraints didn't impact them as much as in corporate because we could help them find alternatives. 
When you get to larger organizations, it becomes harder because those organizations have specific requirements. And they really don't want to shift off of them. It creates more work, frankly, within the organization. What we've seen there, and I think Al mentioned it is, we have worked with our customers to get in line earlier. 
So a lot of customers have been working very hard to get their orders in earlier than they typically would in hopes that they will get -- get the product by year-end. All that said, anywhere that there are, I'll say, mission -- less than mission-critical type technology that we can help them find alternative whether it's a brand, whether it is the cloud, whether it's something else that they can be using, you can bet we're doing it.
