Our 2020 results and our outlook for the year ahead underscore the work we've done to build a stronger and more sustainable business, 1 that grows faster and more profitably and generate more consistent earnings and cash flows. I'm proud of how well our teams performed during these difficult times, and it remains challenging to meet recovery demand while managing through the COVID-19 pandemic and the further tightening of the global supply chain. 
Our continued resiliency is a result of the passion and the commitment of our team members to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. And as a result, we experienced strong fourth quarter financial results. Revenue increased 14% to $4.2 billion, representing 13 points of growth over the underlying market. Operating income and earnings per share totaled $476 million and $1.13, respectively, resulting from strong volume growth, partially offset by incremental manufacturing and logistics expenses associated with ongoing supply chain challenges, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. 
Our 2020 results further validate our business strategy, including revenue growth of 10 points over market and $18 billion of new business awards, reflecting our unique position at the intersection of the safe, green and connected mega trends that are accelerating in our industry. 
Moving to Slide 4. As we enter the start of the economic recovery, we face a new set of supply chain challenges while also continuing to operate safely in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our outlook for 2021 reflects market share gains and content growth in our key product lines, including high-voltage electrification and active safety, driving 16% revenue growth, 6 points over underlying vehicle production and translating into strong margin expansion and earnings growth. 
We also are forecasting significant cash flow generation, and our ability to reinvest that cash to deliver incremental value creation is a key component of our investment thesis. At the same time, we're closely monitoring and adjusting to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our operating environment. And our industry is now facing increased pressure from a global shortage in semiconductor chips, impacting virtually all of our suppliers and customers around the world. 
As a result, we expect the environment to remain challenging for at least the first half of the year and have reflected the uncertainty associated with OEM production schedules and the timing of replenished inventory levels in our full year forecast for vehicle production, which we now expect to increase 10% in 2021. While our team is doing an excellent job minimizing these effects, as customers idle plants and look to prioritize certain vehicle platforms, the costs associated with the related labor and manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics expenses have been included in our financial outlook for the full year. 
Due to limited visibility to near-term production schedules, this precludes us from providing guidance for the first quarter. However, our confidence in the strength of the underlying economic recovery, combined with the planned second half increase in semiconductor capacity, does give us a reasonable level of confidence in our full year outlook which Joe will cover in more detail shortly. 
Turning to Slide 5. Despite the challenges we currently face, we remain focused on further enhancing our track record of outperformance and long-term value creation. While our business model has been tested over the last several months, our performance has validated our industry-leading position and through-cycle resiliency. As we look ahead, we've positioned Aptiv to continue to outperform with focused investments that have enhanced our business model and expanded the addressable markets we served, leveraging our unique brain and nervous system capabilities to deliver even more content on the electrified software-defined vehicles of the future, yielding accretive growth opportunities in our 2 business segments and presenting incremental value creation opportunities through smart capital deployment and delivering meaningful shareholder returns as the economic recovery unfolds. 
As shown on Slide 6, fourth quarter new business bookings totaled $7.5 billion, reflecting robust win rates and a ramp-up in consumer activity. Full year 2020 bookings reached $18 billion, roughly flat compared to 2019 levels when you adjust for the current outlook for global vehicle production. Our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment new business bookings totaled $4.7 billion for the year, including $3.7 billion in Aptiv safety awards. 
New business bookings for our Signal and Power Solutions segment totaled more than $13 billion, including another $2 billion of high-voltage electrification awards. We continue to see an acceleration of powertrain electrification, driven by both more stringent CO2 regulations, principally in Europe and China, and the increasing momentum of consumer acceptance in the U.S. 
Our complementary high-voltage distribution and connection systems as well as cable management solutions significantly reduced the weight and mass of the vehicle architecture through smarter, more efficient design, perfectly positioning Aptiv to benefit from the twofold increase in addressable content on a high-voltage electric vehicle. 
In summary, the cumulative amount of our new business bookings over the last few years gives us confidence in our ability to sustain strong above-market growth across both of our business segments, validating the strength of our portfolio of market relevant technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends. 
Turning to Slide 7. Aptiv is enabling our customers to accelerate their transition to an electrified software-defined vehicle by employing a more holistic engineering and development approach to optimize the software and system solutions that span the full vehicle stack. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to fully fund strategic growth initiatives. And last month, we unveiled the latest result of those investments in our Innovation and Motion Virtual event, which included Aptiv smart vehicle architecture, which represents Aptiv's vision for the full electrical and electronic architecture of the vehicle. 
SCA represents a scalable approach that lowers the total cost of ownership for our OEM customers, while unlocking more value in the vehicle at the point of aggregation, creating new hardware and software revenue opportunities for both Aptiv and our OEM customers. Our industry-leading position in domain controllers and expertise in advanced ADAS solutions provides a terrific launching pad as we work with our customers on their next-gen architecture solutions. 
For customers on the path to SCA, we unveiled our next-gen ADAS platform, leveraging our deep systems expertise and learning from deploying the industry's largest, most diverse safety installed base over the last 20 years, with active safety technology in use by 20 different global automakers. 
We also highlighted our new approach to zone controllers, which leverages insights from our unique position with both the brain and nervous system of the vehicle to safely and efficiently distribute power and up integrate body functionality while simplifying the vehicle manufacturing process, thereby enhancing the scalability of advanced vehicle architecture systems. Aptiv will be the first to market with zone control with a European OEM in 2022, and we have a robust pipeline of commercial pursuits planned for 2021. 
Electrification is also an integral part of the roadmap, and Aptiv has emerged as a partner of choice, capable of providing comprehensive and optimized high-voltage solutions to our customers. That agility has led to increased share of wallet with both leading and emerging electric vehicle manufacturers ramping up production globally, including a leading U.S. EV company, as well as companies such as Rivian, NEO and Volkswagen. 
Lastly, many of these same advancements apply inside the cabin, where we've developed a scalable user experience platform solution, enhancing performance while reducing total systems costs through seamless integration of multiple functional domains. 
As we look to 2021 and beyond, the innovation that we have in motion will further expand our competitive moat and take us closer to our mission of delivering a safer, greener and more connected future of mobility. 
Before turning it over to Joe, on Slide 8, I want to take a moment to highlight a number of commercial and technological milestones at Motional, our automated driving joint venture with the Hyundai Motor Group. In December, Motional announced an agreement with Lyft to launch a multi-market robotaxi service in major U.S. cities beginning in 2023, utilizing a scalable, automated mobility on demand vehicle platform developed in partnership with Hyundai and available to customers beginning in 2022. Last year, Motional also entered into a partnership with KIA to devoid self-driving vehicles on their network in a city to be announced soon. And in January, Motional announced a partnership to deploy Automotive Mobilities pivot as their premier fleet service provider. 
Beginning with Motional self-driving fleet in Las Vegas, this partnership lays the foundation to support the company as it expands the market for robotaxis and other major U.S. cities. These commercial developments are underpinned by rigorous third-party validation and safety assessments, which have allowed Motional to receive approval for testing of fully driverless systems on public roads in Nevada in early 2021. 
In summary, Motional made tremendous progress delivering on its commitments in 2020, paving the way for commercial success in the years to come. 
I'll now hand the call over to Joe Massaro for an overview of our financial results. Joe?"

Starting on Slide 9. The recovery momentum in the fourth quarter generated strong sales, income and cash performance in the quarter despite significant incremental safety, manufacturing and logistics costs associated with operating with COVID and the mounting supply chain constraints. 
Revenues of $4.2 billion were up 14% year-over-year, significantly ahead of vehicle production, which was up 1% in the quarter. The stronger-than-expected sales volumes resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $678 million, up 40 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting stronger volumes and disciplined cost management, partially offset by approximately $70 million of COVID and supply chain-related costs. 
Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.13, reflecting higher operating income, offset by the Motional JV and higher share count and tax expense. Operating cash flow was strong at $799 million, driven by higher EBITDA and lower year-over-year cash taxes. 
Lastly, capital expenditures were $95 million, bringing the total to $584 million for the year, just under our $600 million outlook. 
Looking at fourth quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 10. Globally, we benefited from stronger vehicle production as well as increased demand for high-voltage electrical architecture and engineered components, primarily in Europe and China. North America revenues grew 11% despite the market being flat, driven by new launch volume and favorable truck and SUV platform mix. 
In Europe, the trend of strong double-digit market outgrowth continued as the production rebound benefited active safety and high-voltage electrification programs. Lastly, our China growth was 9%, outpacing the market and expectations as a stronger recovery in sales led to production upside with our major customers, including high-voltage launch volumes. 
Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues increased 7% in the quarter, reflecting 6 points of growth over underlying vehicle production including double-digit active safety growth in all 3 major regions. Segment EBITDA declined 1%, excluding the impact of the Motional JV deconsolidation, primarily driven by the COVID and supply chain cost Kevin mentioned earlier. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenue were up 17%, reflecting 16 points of growth over market. We also saw a strong growth across all product lines and regions, including demand for high-voltage electrification products in Europe and China, favorable truck and SUV platform mix in North America and industrial end market recovery globally. EBITDA in the segment increased 17% as strong sales growth offset additional costs and FX and commodities in the quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 12 and the 2021 macro outlook. As Kevin mentioned earlier, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting the auto industry is limiting near-term production visibility. Based on our discussions with customers and suppliers, we expect the intermittent disruptions to continue during the first half of the year and assume the industry should recover the majority of lost production units tied to these shortages during the second half of the year. 
Accordingly, we will not be providing guidance for the first quarter as there is a high likelihood of vehicle production shifting between the first and second quarters. However, we believe we have adequately reflected the current situation and our guidance for full year 2021, which estimates global vehicle production of 84 million units, up 10%. 
Looking at the regions. In North America and Europe, improved levels of demand should support stronger production rates, while a more modest recovery is planned for China following a sharp bounce back in demand starting in the second quarter last year. While the supply chain remains extremely tight, we are doing everything we can for our customers to meet increased levels of demand. And we are confident our leading industry position in technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends will continue to yield strong growth above market, consistent with the framework we have previously provided. 
Turning to Slide 13. Despite the uncertainty that remains near term, we are confident in the guidance range for 2021. For the year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.7 billion, up 16% at the midpoint, with 6 points of growth over market, driven by our portfolio of relevant technologies. 
EBITDA and operating income are expected to be $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion at the midpoint, respectively, with margins approaching 2019 levels. Despite $100 million of COVID-related operating costs and given the volatility in customer schedules and supply chain disruptions, we are incurring additional manufacturing and logistics costs, which we have estimated at $80 million for the year.  
Lastly, benefits of our ongoing performance initiatives are more than offsetting the lapping of $150 million of austerity measures taken in 2020 during the pandemic-related shutdowns. We expect earnings per share in the range of $3.35 and $3.85 a share or $4.20 to $4.70 per share when excluding the impact of the equity losses of our Motional joint venture. 
High year-over-year noncash operating losses in the Motional JV reflect the finalization of purchase accounting, in addition to higher spending as Motional prepares to meet the commercial milestones Kevin highlighted earlier. Lastly, we expect operating cash flow of $1.85 billion. 
Turning to Slide 14 on the segments, beginning with Advanced Safety and User Experience. We expect growth over market of 13 points, translating into approximately $4.4 billion of revenue in 2021, driven by new launches and continued strong active safety growth. EBITDA margins approximately 13% reflect 5 points of expansion off 2020's depressed levels. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenues of approximately $11 billion, reflects 4 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, with content accretive growth in high-voltage electrification, up 50% year-over-year. Our CV and industrial end markets are also expected to outgrow the industrial market. We expect EBITDA margins approaching 17%, up 250 basis points year-over-year and reflect favorable volume growth, partially offset by the dilutive margin rate impact of higher copper prices. 
We thought it would be helpful to walk revenue and EBITDA compared to 2019 levels on Slide 15. Starting with revenue on the left, despite a 10% reduction in industry volumes, we expect 2021 revenues to be 7% higher than 2019 at the midpoint. The investments we've made to add scale in our fastest-growing product lines, like active safety, high-voltage electrification and engineered components, are generating sustained strong growth over market, and we expect a modest tailwind on FX and commodities, which combined more than offset our normal price downs. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide and adjusted EBITDA, the benefits of our flexible and scalable cost structure are driving strong volume flow through on higher revenues, and the benefits of our performance initiatives yielding EBITDA of $2.4 billion at the midpoint. As you can see, we are expected to recover to 2019 EBITDA margins in 2021, and despite the ongoing operational impact of COVID and the supply chain disruptions. This is a true testament to our relentless focus on disciplined and accretive revenue growth and cost structure optimization, creating an even more sustainable business with the ability to outperform in any environment. 
Turning to cash flow on the next slide. Our sustainable business model is enabling us to convert more income to cash, generating higher operating cash flow and free cash flow conversion. As we approach a more normalized business environment, we expect operating cash flows of $1.85 billion in 2021, above 2019 levels, with free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. This assumes approximately $160 million of restructuring cash outflows and CapEx of $750 million, consistent with our targeted funding levels of 5% of sales. 
With cash flow growing strong double digits, there is no shortage of attractive reinvestment opportunities. We will continue to maintain a consistent approach to capital deployment, aligned to our strategic framework. Our M&A strategy remains focused on transactions that enhance our scalability, accelerate speed to market and also provide access to new addressable markets. We believe highly disciplined capital deployment is a major differentiator for Aptiv and an important lever for shareholder value generation. 
With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."

I'll now wrap up on Slide 17 before we open it up for Q&A. As we navigate 2021 and the new challenges ahead, it goes without saying that we remain laser-focused on delivering on our commitments and continuing our track record of outperformance, while advancing our vision of the company in 2025 and beyond. This vision is the extension of our business strategy, which is enabled by our industry-leading competitive position and execution capabilities. 
Delivering our vision results in a more sustainable business, defined by an improved and more predictable growth profile, increased profitability, through global scale and accretive growth opportunities on the path to electrified smart vehicle architecture, the accelerated compounding of earnings and cash flow generation and additional value creation upside from the disciplined deployment of that cash. We're well positioned to continue moving forward, a company with a strong financial position, low cost of capital and the flexibility to reinvest in its people, processes and portfolio to create significant value for its customers, for its employees and for its shareholders.

My first thought is, if this thing really works, the Motional JV stake maybe you -- just your share of it could be worth more than all of Aptiv, okay? Now there's an arms race going on as these autonomous players, crews, et cetera, kind of get close to deployment. And even by your own gross and losses, it looks like you're keeping up with that. So what's the plan to add capital or to access capital for that unit? And could we see 2021 be a year where we see greater visibility in tapping different sources of capital?  That's my first question. And my follow-up is more specific on FPCB, or the kind of flexible printed circuit board technology, which I'm sure you're very familiar with. So maybe this is one for Glen, but we're starting to get questions about the role of this technology to really dramatically simplify electrical architecture. We understand Tesla wants to use it, too. But that is not really in production yet. There's issues. It's just not ready for prime time. So would love your color on, is it the kind of -- where is Aptiv on that development path? And when could you see that type of technology coming into production?"
59502420,701071986,2189633,"Aptiv PLC, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Okay, great. Those are 2 great questions. So on Motional, listen, we've made tremendous progress over the last couple of years, significant progress last year with our partner, Hyundai. And as I went through a list of announcements that were made during 2",519,"Okay, great. Those are 2 great questions. So on Motional, listen, we've made tremendous progress over the last couple of years, significant progress last year with our partner, Hyundai. And as I went through a list of announcements that were made during 2020, you'll see more announcements made as it relates to 2021 from a technology standpoint and from a commercial standpoint. Adam, the business is on track from a resource standpoint. There's been a significant investment in resources in and around technology, in and around areas that are accelerating the underlying technology. As you know, we have vehicles on the road today. We finished or completed our Gen 1 platform, which you'll see out on the road in Las Vegas soon, and we'll have our Gen 2 platform available for sale to customers commercially beginning in 2022. So a tremendous amount of progress. 
As it relates to capital, recall the transaction, HMG contributed $1.4 billion of cash back in March of 2020. We're using that cash to make the investments that we've talked about. Both of us as partners are focused on how do we develop the technology and how do we maximize value. So we're completely aligned on value creation and value creation within that business, if you know what I mean. So focused on how do we drive value through Motional. To the extent we -- to the extent we see opportunities where our view on value of the business aligns with one's willingness to contribute capital. That's something that we, as partners, will evaluate, and it's something that we'll continue to monitor. But at this point in time, we feel like, at this point in time, we have more than enough capital for the foreseeable future to continue to excel at our investment. But it's something again that we continue to watch and we watch closely. So I would not refer to capital as a constraint. 
On the flexible printed circuit boards, as you know, we've been very focused on vehicle architecture for the last several years. And how do we develop solutions for customers that reduce the constraints associated with traditional vehicle architecture. So how do we remove copper content? How do we replace that with real value-added content, like the flexible printed circuit board technology that you're talking about? Which overall is a part of our solution. So that's technology that actually is under development, it's actually technology that we're in discussions with multiple OEMs about. And as you know, we have relationships with several of the leading OEMs, even those who I would say are less traditional OEMs who've been evolving vehicle architecture and have been most aggressive as it relates to changing vehicle architectures so that we can separate software from hardware. And there's going to be more to come there. We feel like we're a leader given our position with the brain and nervous system. We feel like there's a number of opportunities for us. As I mentioned, we've been in discussions in development programs with a number of OEMS, and we'll keep you and others updated on our progress."

There's going to be other OEM customers who really don't have that capability, aren't interested in investing in it, and we'll do more of a full stack solution. And from our perspective, what's important is really to serve both so that we have that revenue opportunity and make sure that we're the driver of change versus reacting to the change. So that's why we made the comments in our prepared remarks about continuing to invest during 2020, which was a challenging year. We'll continue to invest during 2021 and beyond on all the solutions that we're developing, the platforming of our various technologies and cannibalizing some of our traditional product lines and replacing them with higher tech solutions that take out mass, the take out weight that provide OEM customers with more flexibility and really enable the technology that's going into the car. So it's a long-winded answer, but I hope I've addressed it?"

I think that's pretty exciting to think about the underlying progress here on margin as we've been waiting for ASV to come up for some years.

Now it's taking advantage of that investment opportunity to drive more scale and widening our competitive mode. 
Now there may be within quarters, periods where we decide we're going to invest a bit more, given the competitive dynamic or to drive technology advancement.

This year, we'll be evaluating north of 40 programs. So bookings activity and dollar value of bookings will certainly kick up in 2021 and beyond. 
It's important to note, the reason we're so successful is we are the only competitor, only player out there that has the ability to bring the vehicle architecture, the connector component, the cable management component, the electrical center component, in the wire harness component together and provide a fully optimized solution to an OEM that takes out mass, it takes out weight. I mean, a significant amount of mass reduction, Adam asked that question earlier with respect to flexible printed circuit board technology, but reducing mass by close to 40%, which takes out cost and gives the OEM space.

Gen 2 out on the road or available for customers in 2022. So we're a little over a year away on that. The team is making significant progress on that vehicle. It's an HMG battery electric vehicle platform. And then during calendar 2021, more commercial announcements related to partnerships whether it be the purchase of the underlying technology or plugging that technology into other networks. So there's a lot..."

Our 2020 results and our outlook for the year ahead underscores the work we've done to build a stronger and more sustainable business, one that grows faster and more profitably and generate more consistent earnings and cash flows. I'm proud of how well our teams performed during these difficult times, and it remains challenging to meet recovery demand while managing through the COVID-19 pandemic and the further tightening of the global supply chain. 
Our continued resiliency is a result of the passion and the commitment of our team members to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. And as a result, we experienced strong fourth quarter financial results. Revenue increased 14% to $4.2 billion, representing 13 points of growth over the underlying market. Operating income and earnings per share totaled $476 million and $1.13, respectively, resulting from strong volume growth, partially offset by incremental manufacturing and logistics expenses associated with ongoing supply chain challenges, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. 
Our 2020 results further validate our business strategy, including revenue growth of 10 points over market and $18 billion of new business awards, reflecting our unique position at the intersection of the safe, green and connected mega trends that are accelerating in our industry. 
Moving to Slide 4. As we enter the start of the economic recovery, we face a new set of supply chain challenges while also continuing to operate safely in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our outlook for 2021 reflects market share gains and content growth in our key product lines, including high-voltage electrification and active safety, driving 16% revenue growth, 6 points over underlying vehicle production and translating into strong margin expansion and earnings growth. 
We also are forecasting significant cash flow generation, and our ability to reinvest that cash to deliver incremental value creation is a key component of our investment thesis. At the same time, we're closely monitoring and adjusting to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our operating environment. And our industry is now facing increased pressure from a global shortage in semiconductor chips, impacting virtually all of our suppliers and customers around the world. 
As a result, we expect the environment to remain challenging for at least the first half of the year and have reflected the uncertainty associated with OEM production schedules and the timing of replenished inventory levels in our full year forecast for vehicle production, which we now expect to increase 10% in 2021. While our team is doing an excellent job minimizing these effects, as customers idle plants and look to prioritize certain vehicle platforms, the costs associated with the related labor and manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics expenses have been included in our financial outlook for the full year. 
Due to limited visibility to near-term production schedules, this precludes us from providing guidance for the first quarter. However, our confidence in the strength of the underlying economic recovery, combined with the planned second half increase in semiconductor capacity, does give us a reasonable level of confidence in our full year outlook which Joe will cover in more detail shortly. 
Turning to Slide 5. Despite the challenges we currently face, we remain focused on further enhancing our track record of outperformance and long-term value creation. While our business model has been tested over the last several months, our performance has validated our industry-leading position and through-cycle resiliency. As we look ahead, we've positioned Aptiv to continue to outperform with focused investments that have enhanced our business model and expanded the addressable markets we served, leveraging our unique brain and nervous system capabilities to deliver even more content on the electrified software-defined vehicles of the future, yielding accretive growth opportunities in our 2 business segments and presenting incremental value creation opportunities through smart capital deployment and delivering meaningful shareholder returns as the economic recovery unfolds. 
As shown on Slide 6, fourth quarter new business bookings totaled $7.5 billion, reflecting robust win rates and a ramp-up in consumer activity. Full year 2020 bookings reached $18 billion, roughly flat compared to 2019 levels when you adjust for the current outlook for global vehicle production. 
Our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment new business bookings totaled $4.7 billion for the year, including $3.7 billion in active safety awards. New business bookings for our Signal and Power Solutions segment totaled more than $13 billion, including another $2 billion of high-voltage electrification awards. 
We continue to see an acceleration of powertrain electrification, driven by both more stringent CO2 regulations, principally in Europe and China, and the increasing momentum of consumer acceptance in the U.S. 
Our complementary high-voltage distribution and connection systems as well as cable management solutions significantly reduced the weight and mass of the vehicle architecture through smarter, more efficient design, perfectly positioning Aptiv to benefit from the twofold increase in addressable content on a high-voltage electric vehicle. 
In summary, the cumulative amount of our new business bookings over the last few years gives us confidence in our ability to sustain strong above-market growth across both of our business segments, validating the strength of our portfolio of market relevant technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends. 
Turning to Slide 7. Aptiv is enabling our customers to accelerate their transition to an electrified software-defined vehicle by employing a more holistic engineering and development approach to optimize the software and system solutions that span the full vehicle stack. 
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to fully fund strategic growth initiatives. In last month, we unveiled the latest result of those investments in our Innovation and Motion Virtual event, which included Aptiv's Smart Vehicle Architecture, which represents Aptiv's vision for the full electrical and electronic architecture of the vehicle. 
SVA represents a scalable approach that lowers the total cost of ownership for our OEM customers, while unlocking more value in the vehicle at the point of aggregation, creating new hardware and software revenue opportunities for both Aptiv and our OEM customers. Our industry-leading position in domain controllers and expertise in advanced ADAS solutions provides a terrific launching pad as we work with our customers on their next-gen architecture solutions. 
For customers on the path to SVA, we unveiled our next-gen ADAS platform, leveraging our deep systems expertise and learning from deploying the industry's largest, most diverse safety installed base over the last 20 years, with active safety technology in use by 20 different global automakers. 
We also highlighted our new approach to zone controllers, which leverages insights from our unique position with both the brain and nervous system of the vehicle to safely and efficiently distribute power and up-integrate body functionality while simplifying the vehicle manufacturing process, thereby enhancing the scalability of advanced vehicle architecture systems. Aptiv will be the first to market with zone control with a European OEM in 2022, and we have a robust pipeline of commercial pursuits planned for 2021. 
Electrification is also an integral part of the SVA roadmap, and Aptiv has emerged as a partner of choice, capable of providing comprehensive and optimized high-voltage solutions to our customers. That agility has led to increased share of wallet with both leading and emerging electric vehicle manufacturers ramping up production globally, including a leading U.S. EV company, as well as companies such as Rivian, NIO and Volkswagen. 
Lastly, many of these same advancements apply inside the cabin, where we've developed a scalable user experience platform solution, enhancing performance while reducing total systems costs through seamless integration of multiple functional domains. As we look to 2021 and beyond, the innovation that we have in motion will further expand our competitive moat and take us closer to our mission of delivering a safer, greener and more connected future of mobility. 
Before turning it over to Joe, on Slide 8, I want to take a moment to highlight a number of commercial and technological milestones at Motional, our automated driving joint venture with the Hyundai Motor Group. In December, Motional announced an agreement with Lyft to launch a multi-market robotaxi service in major U.S. cities beginning in 2023, utilizing a scalable, automated mobility on demand vehicle platform developed in partnership with Hyundai and available to customers beginning in 2022. 
Last year, Motional also entered into a partnership with Via to deploy self-driving vehicles on their network in a city to be announced soon. And in January, Motional announced a partnership to deploy Cox Automotive Mobility's Pivet as their premier fleet service provider. Beginning with Motional self-driving fleet in Las Vegas, this partnership lays the foundation to support the company as it expands the market for robotaxis and other major U.S. cities. These commercial developments are underpinned by rigorous third-party validation and safety assessments, which have allowed Motional to receive approval for testing of fully driverless systems on public roads in Nevada in early 2021. 
In summary, Motional made tremendous progress delivering on its commitments in 2020, paving a way for commercial success in the years to come. 
I'll now hand the call over to Joe Massaro for an overview of our financial results. Joe?"

Starting on Slide 9, the recovery momentum in the fourth quarter generated strong sales, income and cash performance in the quarter despite significant incremental safety, manufacturing and logistics costs associ",1338,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 9, the recovery momentum in the fourth quarter generated strong sales, income and cash performance in the quarter despite significant incremental safety, manufacturing and logistics costs associated with operating with COVID and the mounting supply chain constraints. 
Revenues of $4.2 billion were up 14% year-over-year, significantly ahead of vehicle production, which was up 1% in the quarter. The stronger-than-expected sales volumes resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $678 million, up 40 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting stronger volumes and disciplined cost management, partially offset by approximately $70 million of COVID and supply chain-related costs. 
Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.13, reflecting higher operating income, offset by the Motional JV and higher share count and tax expense. Operating cash flow was strong at $799 million, driven by higher EBITDA and lower year-over-year cash taxes. 
Lastly, capital expenditures were $95 million, bringing the total to $584 million for the year, just under our $600 million outlook. Looking at fourth quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 10. Globally, we benefited from stronger vehicle production as well as increased demand for high-voltage electrical architecture and engineered components, primarily in Europe and China. North America revenues grew 11% despite the market being flat, driven by new launch volume and favorable truck and SUV platform mix. 
In Europe, the trend of strong double-digit market outgrowth continued as the production rebound benefited active safety and high-voltage electrification programs. 
Lastly, our China growth was 9%, outpacing the market and expectations as a stronger recovery in sales led to production upside with our major customers, including high-voltage launch volumes. 
Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues increased 7% in the quarter, reflecting 6 points of growth over underlying vehicle production including double-digit active safety growth in all 3 major regions. Segment EBITDA declined 1%, excluding the impact of the Motional JV deconsolidation, primarily driven by the COVID and supply chain cost Kevin mentioned earlier. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenue were up 17%, reflecting 16 points of growth over market. We also saw a strong growth across all product lines and regions, including demand for high-voltage electrification products in Europe and China, favorable truck and SUV platform mix in North America and industrial end market recovery globally. EBITDA in the segment increased 17% as strong sales growth offset additional costs and FX and commodities in the quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 12 and the 2021 macro outlook. As Kevin mentioned earlier, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting the auto industry is limiting near-term production visibility. Based on our discussions with customers and suppliers, we expect the intermittent disruptions to continue during the first half of the year and assume the industry should recover the majority of lost production units tied to these shortages during the second half of the year. 
Accordingly, we will not be providing guidance for the first quarter as there is a high likelihood of vehicle production shifting between the first and second quarters. However, we believe we have adequately reflected the current situation in our guidance for full year 2021, which estimates global vehicle production of 84 million units, up 10%. 
Looking at the regions. In North America and Europe, improved levels of demand should support stronger production rates, while a more modest recovery is planned for China following a sharp bounce back in demand starting in the second quarter last year. While the supply chain remains extremely tight, we are doing everything we can for our customers to meet increased levels of demand. And we are confident our leading industry position in technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends will continue to yield strong growth above market, consistent with the framework we have previously provided. 
Turning to Slide 13. Despite the uncertainty that remains near term, we are confident in the guidance range for 2021. For the year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.7 billion, up 16% at the midpoint, with 6 points of growth over market, driven by our portfolio of relevant technologies. 
EBITDA and operating income are expected to be $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion at the midpoint, respectively, with margins approaching 2019 levels. Despite $100 million of COVID-related operating costs and given the volatility in customer schedules and supply chain disruptions, we are incurring additional manufacturing and logistics costs, which we have estimated at $80 million for the year.  
Lastly, benefits of our ongoing performance initiatives are more than offsetting the lapping of $150 million of austerity measures taken in 2020 during the pandemic-related shutdowns. We expect earnings per share in the range of $3.35 and $3.85 a share or $4.20 to $4.70 per share when excluding the impact of the equity losses of our Motional joint venture. 
High year-over-year noncash operating losses in the Motional JV reflect the finalization of purchase accounting, in addition to higher spending as Motional prepares to meet the commercial milestones Kevin highlighted earlier. Lastly, we expect operating cash flow of $1.85 billion. 
Turning to Slide 14 on the segments, beginning with Advanced Safety and User Experience. We expect growth over market of 13 points, translating into approximately $4.4 billion of revenue in 2021, driven by new launches and continued strong active safety growth. EBITDA margins approximately 13% reflect 5 points of expansion off 2020's depressed levels. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenues of approximately $11 billion, reflects 4 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, with content accretive growth in high-voltage electrification, up 50% year-over-year. Our CV and industrial end markets are also expected to outgrow the industrial market. We expect EBITDA margins approaching 17%, up 250 basis points year-over-year and reflect favorable volume growth, partially offset by the dilutive margin rate impact of higher copper prices. 
We thought it would be helpful to watch revenue and EBITDA compared to 2019 levels on Slide 15. Starting with revenue on the left, despite a 10% reduction in industry volumes, we expect 2021 revenues to be 7% higher than 2019 at the midpoint. The investments we've made to add scale in our fastest-growing product lines, like active safety, high-voltage electrification and engineered components, are generating sustained strong growth over market, and we expect a modest tailwind on FX and commodities, which combined more than offset our normal price downs. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide and adjusted EBITDA, the benefits of our flexible and scalable cost structure are driving strong volume flow through on higher revenues, and the benefits of our performance initiatives yielding EBITDA of $2.4 billion at the midpoint. As you can see, we are expected to recover to 2019 EBITDA margins in 2021, and despite the ongoing operational impact of COVID and the supply chain disruptions. This is a true testament to our relentless focus on disciplined and accretive revenue growth and cost structure optimization, creating an even more sustainable business with the ability to outperform in any environment. 
Turning to cash flow on the next slide. Our sustainable business model is enabling us to convert more income to cash, generating higher operating cash flow and free cash flow conversion. As we approach a more normalized business environment, we expect operating cash flows of $1.85 billion in 2021, above 2019 levels, with free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. This assumes approximately $160 million of restructuring cash outflows and CapEx of $750 million, consistent with our targeted funding levels of 5% of sales. 
With cash flow growing strong double digits, there is no shortage of attractive reinvestment opportunities. We will continue to maintain a consistent approach to capital deployment, aligned to our strategic framework. Our M&A strategy remains focused on transactions that enhance our scalability, accelerate speed to market and also provide access to new addressable markets. We believe highly disciplined capital deployment is a major differentiator for Aptiv and an important lever for shareholder value generation. 
With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."

And even by your own gross in losses, it looks like you're keeping up with that. 
So what's the plan to add capital or to access capital for that unit? And could we see 2021 be a year where we see greater visibility in tapping different sources of capital?  That's my first question. 
And my follow-up is more specific on FPCB, or the kind of flexible printed circuit board technology, which I'm sure you're very familiar with. So maybe this is one for Glen, but we're starting to get questions about the role of this technology to really dramatically simplify electrical architecture. We understand Tesla wants to use it, too."

So on Motional, listen, we've made tremendous progress over the last couple of years, significant progress last year with our partner, Hyundai. And as I went through a list of announcements that were made during 2",519,"Okay, great. Those are 2 great questions. So on Motional, listen, we've made tremendous progress over the last couple of years, significant progress last year with our partner, Hyundai. And as I went through a list of announcements that were made during 2020, you'll see more announcements made as it relates to 2021 from a technology standpoint and from a commercial standpoint, Adam, the business is on track from a resource standpoint. There's been a significant investment in resources in and around technology, in and around areas that are accelerating the underlying technology. As you know, we have vehicles on the road today. We finished or completed our Gen 1 platform, which you'll see out on the road in Las Vegas soon, and we'll have our Gen 2 platform available for sale to customers commercially beginning in 2022. So a tremendous amount of progress. 
As it relates to capital, recall the transaction, HMG contributed $1.4 billion of cash back in March of 2020. We're using that cash to make the investments that we've talked about. Both of us as partners are focused on how do we develop the technology and how do we maximize value. So we're completely aligned on value creation and value creation within that business, if you know what I mean. So focused on how do we drive value through Motional. 
To the extent we -- to the extent we see opportunities where our view on value of the business aligns with one's willingness to contribute capital. That's something that we, as partners, will evaluate, and it's something that we'll continue to monitor. But at this point in time, we feel like, at this point in time, we have more than enough capital for the foreseeable future to continue to accelerate our investment. But it's something again that we continue to watch and we watch closely. So I would not refer to capital as a constraint. 
On the flexible printed circuit boards, as you know, we've been very focused on vehicle architecture for the last several years. And how do we develop solutions for customers that reduce the constraints associated with traditional vehicle architecture. So how do we remove copper content? How do we replace that with real value-added content, like the flexible printed circuit board technology that you're talking about? Which overall is a part of our SVA solution. So that's technology that actually is under development, it's actually technology that we're in discussions with multiple OEMs about. And as you know, we have relationships with several of the leading OEMs, even those who I would say are less traditional OEMs who've been evolving vehicle architecture and have been most aggressive as it relates to changing vehicle architectures so that we can separate software from hardware. And there's going to be more to come there. We feel like we're a leader given our position with the brain and nervous system. We feel like there's a number of opportunities for us. As I mentioned, we've been in discussions in development programs with a number of OEMs, and we'll keep you and others updated on our progress."

How do you view the role of a supplier like Aptiv, I mean I know you ship a lot of software to the OEMs, but to date they're really more takers and sort of integrating -- integration of software all over the place and you've mentioned a number of times, that changing the latest architecture and arranging maybe to more software-enabled platform. So it seems like there's an opportunity for a player like Aptiv, but you'd have to get involved even earlier in the work and work more closely with the OEMs. So there's a goal for you, is that a correct assessment and maybe you could just update us on what Aptiv's doing and the strategy there."

So I think given where we play, given where the industry is going, having a much more strategic relationship with the OEM customer is a must, right. What we deal with, where we operate is a cross section that's highly complex. 
And that's actually where we play. So we have the benefit of our legacy, kind of nervous system vehicle architecture, combined with our newer capabilities in and around software that to your point, started in areas like infotainment, user experience and active safety. All of those are coming together and merging in what we have been talking about, in terms of Smart Vehicle Architecture, all of them. And given our capabilities in both areas, we've been positioned to have strategic discussions and quite frankly, strategic development programs with several of the leading global OEMs. 
And I would say even strategic programs that we're on today, whether it's our Gen 1 ADAS solutions, or our Gen 1 Integrated Cockpit solutions that ultimately lead to -- that lead to the SVA solution. 
Clearly, there's an acceleration of the separation of software and hardware, it's happening as we speak. It presents a huge opportunity for us. We talked about our Gen 2 ADAS platform where we give -- where we can provide the full stack solution, but also provide OEM customers who want the ability to do more of the software on their own, the ability to do so. For those who don't have the capabilities, we can provide the whole solution. And we do that today. 
And there will be a universe of OEM customers who want to do more, and we're going to enable that and provide both hardware, software and integration services in those sort of scenarios. There's going to be other OEM customers who really don't have that capability, aren't interested in investing in it, and we'll do more of a full stack solution. And from our perspective, what's important is really to serve both so that we have that revenue opportunity and make sure that we're the driver of change versus reacting to the change. 
So that's why we made the comments in our prepared remarks about continuing to invest during 2020, which was a challenging year. We'll continue to invest during 2021 and beyond on all the solutions that we're developing, the platforming of our various technologies and cannibalizing some of our traditional product lines and replacing them with higher tech solutions that take out mass, that take out weight, that provide OEM customers with more flexibility and really enable the technology that's going into the car. 
So it's a long-winded answer, but I hope I've addressed it."

And I think you're right, if you take out what are -- a fair amount of investment around COVID and now these supply chain costs, and assume eventually, we work out of those over the coming couple of years, and we continue to see the strong accretive product line growth and things like active safety, high-voltage and engineered components.

A year or 2 ago, we were basically evaluating 15 programs on an annual basis. This year, we'll be evaluating north of 40 programs. So bookings activity and dollar value of bookings will certainly kick up in 2021 and beyond. 
It's important to note, the reason we're so successful is we are the only competitor, only player out there that has the ability to bring the vehicle architecture, the connector component, the cable management component, the electrical center component, and the wire harness component together and provide a fully optimized solution to an OEM that takes out mass, it takes out weight, I mean, a significant amount of mass reduction. 
Adam asked that question earlier with respect to flexible printed circuit board technology, but reducing mass by close to 40%, which takes out cost and gives the OEM space.

Presumably, there's more opportunity into 2021 as you get some of this post COVID catch bump bids. And we haven't really been seen anything related to SVA. But at the same time it's harder to maintain growth as products mature. 
So maybe you can give us a sense of what the bookings say about your ability to meet that 6 to 8 points of outgrowth beyond the 2022 time frame that you've talked about?  So how do you think about the bookings in 6 to 8 points beyond that 2022 time frame?"

So it gives us a high level of confidence beyond 2022 in the 6 to 8 points of growth over market. And that's what's reflected in our bookings. And quite frankly, that's what's reflected in our long-term outlook from a revenue standpoint. So management team is very confident in that level of outgrowth. Joe?"

Our 2020 results and our outlook for the year ahead underscores the work we've done to build a stronger and more sustainable business, one that grows faster and more profitably and generate more consistent earnings and cash flows. I'm proud of how well our teams performed during these difficult times, and it remains challenging to meet recovery demand while managing through the COVID-19 pandemic and the further tightening of the global supply chain. 
Our continued resiliency is a result of the passion and the commitment of our team members to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. And as a result, we experienced strong fourth quarter financial results. Revenue increased 14% to $4.2 billion, representing 13 points of growth over the underlying market. Operating income and earnings per share totaled $476 million and $1.13, respectively, resulting from strong volume growth, partially offset by incremental manufacturing and logistics expenses associated with ongoing supply chain challenges, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. 
Our 2020 results further validate our business strategy, including revenue growth of 10 points over market and $18 billion of new business awards, reflecting our unique position at the intersection of the safe, green and connected mega trends that are accelerating in our industry. 
Moving to Slide 4. As we enter the start of the economic recovery, we face a new set of supply chain challenges while also continuing to operate safely in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our outlook for 2021 reflects market share gains and content growth in our key product lines, including high-voltage electrification and active safety, driving 16% revenue growth, 6 points over underlying vehicle production and translating into strong margin expansion and earnings growth. 
We also are forecasting significant cash flow generation, and our ability to reinvest that cash to deliver incremental value creation is a key component of our investment thesis. At the same time, we're closely monitoring and adjusting to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our operating environment. And our industry is now facing increased pressure from a global shortage in semiconductor chips, impacting virtually all of our suppliers and customers around the world. 
As a result, we expect the environment to remain challenging for at least the first half of the year and have reflected the uncertainty associated with OEM production schedules and the timing of replenished inventory levels in our full year forecast for vehicle production, which we now expect to increase 10% in 2021. While our team is doing an excellent job minimizing these effects, as customers idle plants and look to prioritize certain vehicle platforms, the costs associated with the related labor and manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics expenses have been included in our financial outlook for the full year. 
Due to limited visibility to near-term production schedules, this precludes us from providing guidance for the first quarter. However, our confidence in the strength of the underlying economic recovery, combined with the planned second half increase in semiconductor capacity, does give us a reasonable level of confidence in our full year outlook which Joe will cover in more detail shortly. 
Turning to Slide 5. Despite the challenges we currently face, we remain focused on further enhancing our track record of outperformance and long-term value creation. While our business model has been tested over the last several months, our performance has validated our industry-leading position and through-cycle resiliency. As we look ahead, we've positioned Aptiv to continue to outperform with focused investments that have enhanced our business model and expanded the addressable markets we served, leveraging our unique brain and nervous system capabilities to deliver even more content on the electrified software-defined vehicles of the future, yielding accretive growth opportunities in our 2 business segments and presenting incremental value creation opportunities through smart capital deployment and delivering meaningful shareholder returns as the economic recovery unfolds. 
As shown on Slide 6, fourth quarter new business bookings totaled $7.5 billion, reflecting robust win rates and a ramp-up in consumer activity. Full year 2020 bookings reached $18 billion, roughly flat compared to 2019 levels when you adjust for the current outlook for global vehicle production. 
Our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment new business bookings totaled $4.7 billion for the year, including $3.7 billion in active safety awards. New business bookings for our Signal and Power Solutions segment totaled more than $13 billion, including another $2 billion of high-voltage electrification awards. 
We continue to see an acceleration of powertrain electrification, driven by both more stringent CO2 regulations, principally in Europe and China, and the increasing momentum of consumer acceptance in the U.S. 
Our complementary high-voltage distribution and connection systems as well as cable management solutions significantly reduced the weight and mass of the vehicle architecture through smarter, more efficient design, perfectly positioning Aptiv to benefit from the twofold increase in addressable content on a high-voltage electric vehicle. 
In summary, the cumulative amount of our new business bookings over the last few years gives us confidence in our ability to sustain strong above-market growth across both of our business segments, validating the strength of our portfolio of market relevant technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends. 
Turning to Slide 7. Aptiv is enabling our customers to accelerate their transition to an electrified software-defined vehicle by employing a more holistic engineering and development approach to optimize the software and system solutions that span the full vehicle stack. 
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to fully fund strategic growth initiatives. In last month, we unveiled the latest result of those investments in our Innovation and Motion Virtual event, which included Aptiv's Smart Vehicle Architecture, which represents Aptiv's vision for the full electrical and electronic architecture of the vehicle. 
SVA represents a scalable approach that lowers the total cost of ownership for our OEM customers, while unlocking more value in the vehicle at the point of aggregation, creating new hardware and software revenue opportunities for both Aptiv and our OEM customers. Our industry-leading position in domain controllers and expertise in advanced ADAS solutions provides a terrific launching pad as we work with our customers on their next-gen architecture solutions. 
For customers on the path to SVA, we unveiled our next-gen ADAS platform, leveraging our deep systems expertise and learning from deploying the industry's largest, most diverse safety installed base over the last 20 years, with active safety technology in use by 20 different global automakers. 
We also highlighted our new approach to zone controllers, which leverages insights from our unique position with both the brain and nervous system of the vehicle to safely and efficiently distribute power and up-integrate body functionality while simplifying the vehicle manufacturing process, thereby enhancing the scalability of advanced vehicle architecture systems. Aptiv will be the first to market with zone control with a European OEM in 2022, and we have a robust pipeline of commercial pursuits planned for 2021. 
Electrification is also an integral part of the SVA roadmap, and Aptiv has emerged as a partner of choice, capable of providing comprehensive and optimized high-voltage solutions to our customers. That agility has led to increased share of wallet with both leading and emerging electric vehicle manufacturers ramping up production globally, including a leading U.S. EV company, as well as companies such as Rivian, NIO and Volkswagen. 
Lastly, many of these same advancements apply inside the cabin, where we've developed a scalable user experience platform solution, enhancing performance while reducing total systems costs through seamless integration of multiple functional domains. As we look to 2021 and beyond, the innovation that we have in motion will further expand our competitive moat and take us closer to our mission of delivering a safer, greener and more connected future of mobility. 
Before turning it over to Joe, on Slide 8, I want to take a moment to highlight a number of commercial and technological milestones at Motional, our automated driving joint venture with the Hyundai Motor Group. In December, Motional announced an agreement with Lyft to launch a multi-market robotaxi service in major U.S. cities beginning in 2023, utilizing a scalable, automated mobility on demand vehicle platform developed in partnership with Hyundai and available to customers beginning in 2022. 
Last year, Motional also entered into a partnership with Via to deploy self-driving vehicles on their network in a city to be announced soon. And in January, Motional announced a partnership to deploy Cox Automotive Mobility's Pivet as their premier fleet service provider. Beginning with Motional self-driving fleet in Las Vegas, this partnership lays the foundation to support the company as it expands the market for robotaxis and other major U.S. cities. These commercial developments are underpinned by rigorous third-party validation and safety assessments, which have allowed Motional to receive approval for testing of fully driverless systems on public roads in Nevada in early 2021. 
In summary, Motional made tremendous progress delivering on its commitments in 2020, paving a way for commercial success in the years to come. 
I'll now hand the call over to Joe Massaro for an overview of our financial results. Joe?"

Starting on Slide 9, the recovery momentum in the fourth quarter generated strong sales, income and cash performance in the quarter despite significant incremental safety, manufacturing and logistics costs associ",1338,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 9, the recovery momentum in the fourth quarter generated strong sales, income and cash performance in the quarter despite significant incremental safety, manufacturing and logistics costs associated with operating with COVID and the mounting supply chain constraints. 
Revenues of $4.2 billion were up 14% year-over-year, significantly ahead of vehicle production, which was up 1% in the quarter. The stronger-than-expected sales volumes resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $678 million, up 40 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting stronger volumes and disciplined cost management, partially offset by approximately $70 million of COVID and supply chain-related costs. 
Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.13, reflecting higher operating income, offset by the Motional JV and higher share count and tax expense. Operating cash flow was strong at $799 million, driven by higher EBITDA and lower year-over-year cash taxes. 
Lastly, capital expenditures were $95 million, bringing the total to $584 million for the year, just under our $600 million outlook. Looking at fourth quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 10. Globally, we benefited from stronger vehicle production as well as increased demand for high-voltage electrical architecture and engineered components, primarily in Europe and China. North America revenues grew 11% despite the market being flat, driven by new launch volume and favorable truck and SUV platform mix. 
In Europe, the trend of strong double-digit market outgrowth continued as the production rebound benefited active safety and high-voltage electrification programs. 
Lastly, our China growth was 9%, outpacing the market and expectations as a stronger recovery in sales led to production upside with our major customers, including high-voltage launch volumes. 
Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues increased 7% in the quarter, reflecting 6 points of growth over underlying vehicle production including double-digit active safety growth in all 3 major regions. Segment EBITDA declined 1%, excluding the impact of the Motional JV deconsolidation, primarily driven by the COVID and supply chain cost Kevin mentioned earlier. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenue were up 17%, reflecting 16 points of growth over market. We also saw a strong growth across all product lines and regions, including demand for high-voltage electrification products in Europe and China, favorable truck and SUV platform mix in North America and industrial end market recovery globally. EBITDA in the segment increased 17% as strong sales growth offset additional costs and FX and commodities in the quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 12 and the 2021 macro outlook. As Kevin mentioned earlier, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting the auto industry is limiting near-term production visibility. Based on our discussions with customers and suppliers, we expect the intermittent disruptions to continue during the first half of the year and assume the industry should recover the majority of lost production units tied to these shortages during the second half of the year. 
Accordingly, we will not be providing guidance for the first quarter as there is a high likelihood of vehicle production shifting between the first and second quarters. However, we believe we have adequately reflected the current situation in our guidance for full year 2021, which estimates global vehicle production of 84 million units, up 10%. 
Looking at the regions. In North America and Europe, improved levels of demand should support stronger production rates, while a more modest recovery is planned for China following a sharp bounce back in demand starting in the second quarter last year. While the supply chain remains extremely tight, we are doing everything we can for our customers to meet increased levels of demand. And we are confident our leading industry position in technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends will continue to yield strong growth above market, consistent with the framework we have previously provided. 
Turning to Slide 13. Despite the uncertainty that remains near term, we are confident in the guidance range for 2021. For the year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.7 billion, up 16% at the midpoint, with 6 points of growth over market, driven by our portfolio of relevant technologies. 
EBITDA and operating income are expected to be $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion at the midpoint, respectively, with margins approaching 2019 levels. Despite $100 million of COVID-related operating costs and given the volatility in customer schedules and supply chain disruptions, we are incurring additional manufacturing and logistics costs, which we have estimated at $80 million for the year.  
Lastly, benefits of our ongoing performance initiatives are more than offsetting the lapping of $150 million of austerity measures taken in 2020 during the pandemic-related shutdowns. We expect earnings per share in the range of $3.35 and $3.85 a share or $4.20 to $4.70 per share when excluding the impact of the equity losses of our Motional joint venture. 
High year-over-year noncash operating losses in the Motional JV reflect the finalization of purchase accounting, in addition to higher spending as Motional prepares to meet the commercial milestones Kevin highlighted earlier. Lastly, we expect operating cash flow of $1.85 billion. 
Turning to Slide 14 on the segments, beginning with Advanced Safety and User Experience. We expect growth over market of 13 points, translating into approximately $4.4 billion of revenue in 2021, driven by new launches and continued strong active safety growth. EBITDA margins approximately 13% reflect 5 points of expansion off 2020's depressed levels. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenues of approximately $11 billion, reflects 4 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, with content accretive growth in high-voltage electrification, up 50% year-over-year. Our CV and industrial end markets are also expected to outgrow the industrial market. We expect EBITDA margins approaching 17%, up 250 basis points year-over-year and reflect favorable volume growth, partially offset by the dilutive margin rate impact of higher copper prices. 
We thought it would be helpful to watch revenue and EBITDA compared to 2019 levels on Slide 15. Starting with revenue on the left, despite a 10% reduction in industry volumes, we expect 2021 revenues to be 7% higher than 2019 at the midpoint. The investments we've made to add scale in our fastest-growing product lines, like active safety, high-voltage electrification and engineered components, are generating sustained strong growth over market, and we expect a modest tailwind on FX and commodities, which combined more than offset our normal price downs. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide and adjusted EBITDA, the benefits of our flexible and scalable cost structure are driving strong volume flow through on higher revenues, and the benefits of our performance initiatives yielding EBITDA of $2.4 billion at the midpoint. As you can see, we are expected to recover to 2019 EBITDA margins in 2021, and despite the ongoing operational impact of COVID and the supply chain disruptions. This is a true testament to our relentless focus on disciplined and accretive revenue growth and cost structure optimization, creating an even more sustainable business with the ability to outperform in any environment. 
Turning to cash flow on the next slide. Our sustainable business model is enabling us to convert more income to cash, generating higher operating cash flow and free cash flow conversion. As we approach a more normalized business environment, we expect operating cash flows of $1.85 billion in 2021, above 2019 levels, with free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. This assumes approximately $160 million of restructuring cash outflows and CapEx of $750 million, consistent with our targeted funding levels of 5% of sales. 
With cash flow growing strong double digits, there is no shortage of attractive reinvestment opportunities. We will continue to maintain a consistent approach to capital deployment, aligned to our strategic framework. Our M&A strategy remains focused on transactions that enhance our scalability, accelerate speed to market and also provide access to new addressable markets. We believe highly disciplined capital deployment is a major differentiator for Aptiv and an important lever for shareholder value generation. 
With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."

Now there's an arms race going on as these autonomous players, Vemo, [ Cruise ], et cetera, kind of get close to deployment. And even by your own gross in losses, it looks like you're keeping up with that. 
So what's the plan to add capital or to access capital for that unit? And could we see 2021 be a year where we see greater visibility in tapping different sources of capital?  That's my first question. 
And my follow-up is more specific on FPCB, or the kind of flexible printed circuit board technology, which I'm sure you're very familiar with. So maybe this is one for Glen, but we're starting to get questions about the role of this technology to really dramatically simplify electrical architecture. We understand Tesla wants to use it, too."

And as I went through a list of announcements that were made during 2",519,"Okay, great. Those are 2 great questions. So on Motional, listen, we've made tremendous progress over the last couple of years, significant progress last year with our partner, Hyundai. And as I went through a list of announcements that were made during 2020, you'll see more announcements made as it relates to 2021 from a technology standpoint and from a commercial standpoint, Adam, the business is on track from a resource standpoint. There's been a significant investment in resources in and around technology, in and around areas that are accelerating the underlying technology. As you know, we have vehicles on the road today. We finished or completed our Gen 1 platform, which you'll see out on the road in Las Vegas soon, and we'll have our Gen 2 platform available for sale to customers commercially beginning in 2022. So a tremendous amount of progress. 
As it relates to capital, recall the transaction, HMG contributed $1.4 billion of cash back in March of 2020. We're using that cash to make the investments that we've talked about. Both of us as partners are focused on how do we develop the technology and how do we maximize value. So we're completely aligned on value creation and value creation within that business, if you know what I mean. So focused on how do we drive value through Motional. 
To the extent we -- to the extent we see opportunities where our view on value of the business aligns with one's willingness to contribute capital. That's something that we, as partners, will evaluate, and it's something that we'll continue to monitor. But at this point in time, we feel like, at this point in time, we have more than enough capital for the foreseeable future to continue to accelerate our investment. But it's something again that we continue to watch and we watch closely. So I would not refer to capital as a constraint. 
On the flexible printed circuit boards, as you know, we've been very focused on vehicle architecture for the last several years. And how do we develop solutions for customers that reduce the constraints associated with traditional vehicle architecture. So how do we remove copper content? How do we replace that with real value-added content, like the flexible printed circuit board technology that you're talking about? Which overall is a part of our SVA solution. So that's technology that actually is under development, it's actually technology that we're in discussions with multiple OEMs about. And as you know, we have relationships with several of the leading OEMs, even those who I would say are less traditional OEMs who've been evolving vehicle architecture and have been most aggressive as it relates to changing vehicle architectures so that we can separate software from hardware. And there's going to be more to come there. We feel like we're a leader given our position with the brain and nervous system. We feel like there's a number of opportunities for us. As I mentioned, we've been in discussions in development programs with a number of OEMs, and we'll keep you and others updated on our progress."

So it seems like there's an opportunity for a player like Aptiv, but you'd have to get involved even earlier in the work and work more closely with the OEMs. So there's a goal for you, is that a correct assessment and maybe you could just update us on what Aptiv's doing and the strategy there."

So I think given where we play, given where the industry is going, having a much more strategic relationship with the OEM customer is a must, right. What we deal with, where we operate is a cross section that's highly complex. 
And that's actually where we play. So we have the benefit of our legacy, kind of nervous system vehicle architecture, combined with our newer capabilities in and around software that to your point, started in areas like infotainment, user experience and active safety. All of those are coming together and merging in what we have been talking about, in terms of Smart Vehicle Architecture, all of them. And given our capabilities in both areas, we've been positioned to have strategic discussions and quite frankly, strategic development programs with several of the leading global OEMs. 
And I would say even strategic programs that we're on today, whether it's our Gen 1 ADAS solutions, or our Gen 1 Integrated Cockpit solutions that ultimately lead to -- that lead to the SVA solution. 
Clearly, there's an acceleration of the separation of software and hardware, it's happening as we speak. It presents a huge opportunity for us. We talked about our Gen 2 ADAS platform where we give -- where we can provide the full stack solution, but also provide OEM customers who want the ability to do more of the software on their own, the ability to do so. For those who don't have the capabilities, we can provide the whole solution. And we do that today. 
And there will be a universe of OEM customers who want to do more, and we're going to enable that and provide both hardware, software and integration services in those sort of scenarios. There's going to be other OEM customers who really don't have that capability, aren't interested in investing in it, and we'll do more of a full stack solution. And from our perspective, what's important is really to serve both so that we have that revenue opportunity and make sure that we're the driver of change versus reacting to the change. 
So that's why we made the comments in our prepared remarks about continuing to invest during 2020, which was a challenging year. We'll continue to invest during 2021 and beyond on all the solutions that we're developing, the platforming of our various technologies and cannibalizing some of our traditional product lines and replacing them with higher tech solutions that take out mass, that take out weight, that provide OEM customers with more flexibility and really enable the technology that's going into the car. 
So it's a long-winded answer, but I hope I've addressed it."

I think that's pretty exciting to think about the underlying progress here on margin as we've been waiting for ASUX to come up for some years.

And I think you're right, if you take out what are -- a fair amount of investment around COVID and now these supply chain costs, and assume eventually, we work out of those over the coming couple of years, and we continue to see the strong accretive product line growth and things like active safety, high-voltage and engineered components.

So it's really about how do we drive more leverage.

Now it's taking advantage of that investment opportunity to drive more scale and widening our competitive mode. 
Now there may be within quarters, periods where we decide we're going to invest a bit more, given the competitive dynamic or to drive technology advancement.

And then related to that, I think last quarter, you were talking about this fairly high win rates that you have in high-voltage bookings, even 70% or so. Just wanted to see if this is something that you have seen or expect to see continuing?"

So yes, so from a win rate standpoint, our win rate continues to be north of 70%. I would say we have to reiterate, we've talked about it previously, a very focused strategy as it relates to high-voltage electrification. So we're very focused on a select group of OEMs, who have a strategy that brings high-voltage electrification across multiple platforms. So we get the benefit of -- we get the benefit, they get the benefit of significant volume. 
A year or 2 ago, we were basically evaluating 15 programs on an annual basis. This year, we'll be evaluating north of 40 programs. So bookings activity and dollar value of bookings will certainly kick up in 2021 and beyond. 
It's important to note, the reason we're so successful is we are the only competitor, only player out there that has the ability to bring the vehicle architecture, the connector component, the cable management component, the electrical center component, and the wire harness component together and provide a fully optimized solution to an OEM that takes out mass, it takes out weight, I mean, a significant amount of mass reduction. 
Adam asked that question earlier with respect to flexible printed circuit board technology, but reducing mass by close to 40%, which takes out cost and gives the OEM space. And the value of what we deliver, the packaging of that full systems has translated into significant win rates and a huge opportunity for Aptiv.  
Joe can walk through the numbers, but high-voltage electrication will be our fastest-growing product line for several years to come."

It continues to trend above segment margins, and it's accretive to the SPS segment. So I would say both within the bookings and the revenue trajectory, the trends you're talking about from an OE perspective, about greater levels of electrification we're seeing in the numbers as well."

Our 2020 results and our outlook for the year ahead underscore the work we've done to build a stronger and more sustainable business, one that grows faster and more profitably and generates more consistent earnings and cash flows. I'm proud of how well our teams performed during these difficult times, and it remains challenging to meet recovery demand while managing through the COVID-19 pandemic and the further tightening of the global supply chain. 
Our continued resiliency is a result of the passion and the commitment of our team members to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. And as a result, we experienced strong fourth quarter financial results. Revenue increased 14% to $4.2 billion, representing 13 points of growth over the underlying market. Operating income and earnings per share totaled $476 million and $1.13, respectively, resulting from strong volume growth, partially offset by incremental manufacturing and logistics expenses associated with ongoing supply chain challenges, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. 
Our 2020 results further validate our business strategy, including revenue growth of 10 points over market and $18 billion of new business awards, reflecting our unique position at the intersection of the safe, green and connected mega trends that are accelerating in our industry. 
Moving to Slide 4. As we enter the start of the economic recovery, we face a new set of supply chain challenges while also continuing to operate safely in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our outlook for 2021 reflects market share gains and content growth in our key product lines, including high-voltage electrification and active safety, driving 16% revenue growth, 6 points over underlying vehicle production and translating into strong margin expansion and earnings growth. 
We also are forecasting significant cash flow generation, and our ability to reinvest that cash to deliver incremental value creation is a key component of our investment thesis. At the same time, we're closely monitoring and adjusting to the impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our operating environment. And our industry is now facing increased pressure from a global shortage in semiconductor chips, impacting virtually all of our suppliers and customers around the world. 
As a result, we expect the environment to remain challenging for at least the first half of the year and have reflected the uncertainty associated with OEM production schedules and the timing of replenished inventory levels in our full year forecast for vehicle production, which we now expect to increase 10% in 2021. While our team is doing an excellent job minimizing these effects, as customers idle plants and look to prioritize certain vehicle platforms, the costs associated with the related labor and manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics expenses have been included in our financial outlook for the full year. 
Due to limited visibility to near-term production schedules, this precludes us from providing guidance for the first quarter. However, our confidence in the strength of the underlying economic recovery, combined with the planned second half increase in semiconductor capacity, does give us a reasonable level of confidence in our full year outlook which Joe will cover in more detail shortly. 
Turning to Slide 5. Despite the challenges we currently face, we remain focused on further enhancing our track record of outperformance and long-term value creation. While our business model has been tested over the last several months, our performance has validated our industry-leading position and through-cycle resiliency. As we look ahead, we've positioned Aptiv to continue to outperform with focused investments that have enhanced our business model and expanded the addressable markets we served, leveraging our unique brain and nervous system capabilities to deliver even more content on the electrified software-defined vehicles of the future, yielding accretive growth opportunities in our 2 business segments and presenting incremental value creation opportunities through smart capital deployment and delivering meaningful shareholder returns as the economic recovery unfolds. 
As shown on Slide 6, fourth quarter new business bookings totaled $7.5 billion, reflecting robust win rates and a ramp-up in consumer activity. Full year 2020 bookings reached $18 billion, roughly flat compared to 2019 levels when you adjust for the current outlook for global vehicle production. 
Our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment new business bookings totaled $4.7 billion for the year, including $3.7 billion in active safety awards. New business bookings for our Signal and Power Solutions segment totaled more than $13 billion, including another $2 billion of high-voltage electrification awards. 
We continue to see an acceleration of powertrain electrification, driven by both more stringent CO2 regulations, principally in Europe and China, and the increasing momentum of consumer acceptance in the U.S. 
Our complementary high-voltage distribution and connection systems as well as cable management solutions significantly reduced the weight and mass of the vehicle architecture through smarter, more efficient design, perfectly positioning Aptiv to benefit from the twofold increase in addressable content on a high-voltage electric vehicle. 
In summary, the cumulative amount of our new business bookings over the last few years gives us confidence in our ability to sustain strong above-market growth across both of our business segments, validating the strength of our portfolio of market relevant technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends. 
Turning to Slide 7. Aptiv is enabling our customers to accelerate their transition to an electrified software-defined vehicle by employing a more holistic engineering and development approach to optimize the software and system solutions that span the full vehicle stack. 
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to fully fund strategic growth initiatives. And last month, we unveiled the latest result of those investments in our Innovation in Motion virtual event, which included Aptiv's Smart Vehicle Architecture, which represents Aptiv's vision for the full electrical and electronic architecture of the vehicle. 
SVA represents a scalable approach that lowers the total cost of ownership for our OEM customers, while unlocking more value in the vehicle at the point of aggregation, creating new hardware and software revenue opportunities for both Aptiv and our OEM customers. Our industry-leading position in domain controllers and expertise in advanced ADAS solutions provides a terrific launching pad as we work with our customers on their next-gen architecture solutions. 
For customers on the path to SVA, we unveiled our next-gen ADAS platform, leveraging our deep systems expertise and learning from deploying the industry's largest, most diverse safety installed base over the last 20 years, with active safety technology in use by 20 different global automakers. 
We also highlighted our new approach to zone controllers, which leverages insights from our unique position with both the brain and nervous system of the vehicle to safely and efficiently distribute power and up-integrate body functionality while simplifying the vehicle manufacturing process, thereby enhancing the scalability of advanced vehicle architecture systems. Aptiv will be the first to market with zone control with a European OEM in 2022, and we have a robust pipeline of commercial pursuits planned for 2021. 
Electrification is also an integral part of the SVA roadmap, and Aptiv has emerged as a partner of choice, capable of providing comprehensive and optimized high-voltage solutions to our customers. That agility has led to increased share of wallet with both leading and emerging electric vehicle manufacturers ramping up production globally, including a leading U.S. EV company, as well as companies such as Rivian, NIO and Volkswagen. 
Lastly, many of these same advancements apply inside the cabin, where we've developed a scalable user experience platform solution, enhancing performance while reducing total systems costs through seamless integration of multiple functional domains. As we look to 2021 and beyond, the innovation that we have in motion will further expand our competitive moat and take us closer to our mission of delivering a safer, greener and more connected future of mobility. 
Before turning it over to Joe, on Slide 8, I want to take a moment to highlight a number of commercial and technological milestones at Motional, our automated driving joint venture with the Hyundai Motor Group. In December, Motional announced an agreement with Lyft to launch a multi-market robotaxi service in major U.S. cities beginning in 2023, utilizing a scalable, automated mobility on demand vehicle platform developed in partnership with Hyundai and available to customers beginning in 2022. 
Last year, Motional also entered into a partnership with Via to deploy self-driving vehicles on their network in a city to be announced soon. And in January, Motional announced a partnership to deploy Cox Automotive Mobility's Pivet as their premier fleet service provider. Beginning with Motional self-driving fleet in Las Vegas, this partnership lays the foundation to support the company as it expands the market for robotaxis in other major U.S. cities. These commercial developments are underpinned by rigorous third-party validation and safety assessments, which have allowed Motional to receive approval for testing of fully driverless systems on public roads in Nevada in early 2021. 
In summary, Motional made tremendous progress delivering on its commitments in 2020, paving a way for commercial success in the years to come. 
I'll now hand the call over to Joe Massaro for an overview of our financial results. Joe?"

Starting on Slide 9, the recovery momentum in the fourth quarter generated strong sales, income and cash performance in the quarter despite significant incremental safety, manufacturing and logistics costs associated with operating with COVID and the mounting supply chain constraints. 
Revenues of $4.2 billion were up 14% year-over-year, significantly ahead of vehicle production, which was up 1% in the quarter. The stronger-than-expected sales volumes resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $678 million, up 40 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting stronger volumes and disciplined cost management, partially offset by approximately $70 million of COVID and supply chain-related costs. 
Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.13, reflecting higher operating income, offset by the Motional JV and higher share count and tax expense. Operating cash flow was strong at $799 million, driven by higher EBITDA and lower year-over-year cash taxes. 
Lastly, capital expenditures were $95 million, bringing the total to $584 million for the year, just under our $600 million outlook. Looking at fourth quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 10. Globally, we benefited from stronger vehicle production as well as increased demand for high-voltage electrical architecture and engineered components, primarily in Europe and China. North America revenues grew 11% despite the market being flat, driven by new launch volume and favorable truck and SUV platform mix. 
In Europe, the trend of strong double-digit market outgrowth continued as the production rebound benefited active safety and high-voltage electrification programs. 
Lastly, our China growth was 9%, outpacing the market and expectations as a stronger recovery in sales led to production upside with our major customers, including high-voltage launch volumes. 
Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues increased 7% in the quarter, reflecting 6 points of growth over underlying vehicle production including double-digit active safety growth in all 3 major regions. Segment EBITDA declined 1%, excluding the impact of the Motional JV deconsolidation, primarily driven by the COVID and supply chain cost Kevin mentioned earlier. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenue were up 17%, reflecting 16 points of growth over market. We also saw strong growth across all product lines and regions, including demand for high-voltage electrification products in Europe and China, favorable truck and SUV platform mix in North America and industrial end market recovery globally. EBITDA in the segment increased 17% as strong sales growth offset additional costs and FX and commodities in the quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 12 and the 2021 macro outlook. As Kevin mentioned earlier, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting the auto industry is limiting near-term production visibility. Based on our discussions with customers and suppliers, we expect the intermittent disruptions to continue during the first half of the year and assume the industry should recover the majority of lost production units tied to these shortages during the second half of the year. 
Accordingly, we will not be providing guidance for the first quarter as there is a high likelihood of vehicle production shifting between the first and second quarters. However, we believe we have adequately reflected the current situation in our guidance for full year 2021, which estimates global vehicle production of 84 million units, up 10%. 
Looking at the regions. In North America and Europe, improved levels of demand should support stronger production rates, while a more modest recovery is planned for China following a sharp bounce back in demand starting in the second quarter last year. While the supply chain remains extremely tight, we are doing everything we can for our customers to meet increased levels of demand. And we are confident our leading industry position in technologies aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends will continue to yield strong growth above market, consistent with the framework we have previously provided. 
Turning to Slide 13. Despite the uncertainty that remains near term, we are confident in the guidance range for 2021. For the year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.7 billion, up 16% at the midpoint, with 6 points of growth over market, driven by our portfolio of relevant technologies. 
EBITDA and operating income are expected to be $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion at the midpoint, respectively, with margins approaching 2019 levels. Despite $100 million of COVID-related operating costs and given the volatility in customer schedules and supply chain disruptions, we are incurring additional manufacturing and logistics costs, which we have estimated at $80 million for the year.  
Lastly, benefits of our ongoing performance initiatives are more than offsetting the lapping of $150 million of austerity measures taken in 2020 during the pandemic-related shutdowns. We expect earnings per share in the range of $3.35 and $3.85 a share or $4.20 to $4.70 per share when excluding the impact of the equity losses of our Motional joint venture. 
High year-over-year noncash operating losses in the Motional JV reflect the finalization of purchase accounting, in addition to higher spending as Motional prepares to meet the commercial milestones Kevin highlighted earlier. Lastly, we expect operating cash flow of $1.85 billion. 
Turning to Slide 14 on the segments, beginning with Advanced Safety and User Experience. We expect growth over market of 13 points, translating into approximately $4.4 billion of revenue in 2021, driven by new launches and continued strong active safety growth. EBITDA margins approximately 13% reflect 5 points of expansion off 2020's depressed levels. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenues of approximately $11 billion, reflects 4 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, with content accretive growth in high-voltage electrification, up 50% year-over-year. Our CV and industrial end markets are also expected to outgrow the industrial market. We expect EBITDA margins approaching 17%, up 250 basis points year-over-year and reflect favorable volume growth, partially offset by the dilutive margin rate impact of higher copper prices. 
We thought it would be helpful to watch revenue and EBITDA compared to 2019 levels on Slide 15. Starting with revenue on the left, despite a 10% reduction in industry volumes, we expect 2021 revenues to be 7% higher than 2019 at the midpoint. The investments we've made to add scale in our fastest-growing product lines, like active safety, high-voltage electrification and engineered components, are generating sustained strong growth over market, and we expect a modest tailwind on FX and commodities, which combined more than offset our normal price downs. 
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide and adjusted EBITDA, the benefits of our flexible and scalable cost structure are driving strong volume flow through on higher revenues, and the benefits of our performance initiatives yielding EBITDA of $2.4 billion at the midpoint. As you can see, we are expected to recover to 2019 EBITDA margins in 2021, despite the ongoing operational impact of COVID and the supply chain disruptions. This is a true testament to our relentless focus on disciplined and accretive revenue growth and cost structure optimization, creating an even more sustainable business with the ability to outperform in any environment. 
Turning to cash flow on the next slide. Our sustainable business model is enabling us to convert more income to cash, generating higher operating cash flow and free cash flow conversion. As we approach a more normalized business environment, we expect operating cash flows of $1.85 billion in 2021, above 2019 levels, with free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. This assumes approximately $160 million of restructuring cash outflows and CapEx of $750 million, consistent with our targeted funding levels of 5% of sales. 
With cash flow growing strong double digits, there is no shortage of attractive reinvestment opportunities. We will continue to maintain a consistent approach to capital deployment, aligned to our strategic framework. Our M&A strategy remains focused on transactions that enhance our scalability, accelerate speed to market and also provide access to new addressable markets. We believe highly disciplined capital deployment is a major differentiator for Aptiv and an important lever for shareholder value generation. 
With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."

As we navigate 2021 and the new challenges ahead, it goes without saying that we remain laser-focused on delivering on our commitments and continuing our track record of outperformance, while advancing our vision of the company in 2025 and beyond. This vision is the extension of our business strategy, which is enabled by our industry-leading competitive position and execution capabilities. 
Delivering our vision results in a more sustainable business, defined by an improved and more predictable growth profile, increased profitability, through global scale and accretive growth opportunities on the path to electrified Smart Vehicle Architecture, the accelerated compounding of earnings and cash flow generation and additional value creation upside from the disciplined deployment of that cash. 
We're well positioned to continue moving forward, a company with a strong financial position, low cost of capital and the flexibility to reinvest in its people, processes and portfolio to create significant value for its customers, for its employees and for its shareholders.

And even by your own gross in losses, it looks like you're keeping up with that. 
So what's the plan to add capital or to access capital for that unit? And could we see 2021 be a year where we see greater visibility in tapping different sources of capital?  That's my first question. 
And my follow-up is more specific on FPCB, or the kind of flexible printed circuit board technology, which I'm sure you're very familiar with. So maybe this is one for Glen, but we're starting to get questions about the role of this technology to really dramatically simplify electrical architecture. We understand Tesla wants to use it, too."

And as I went through a list of announcements that were made during 2",519,"Okay, great. Those are 2 great questions. So on Motional, listen, we've made tremendous progress over the last couple of years, significant progress last year with our partner, Hyundai. And as I went through a list of announcements that were made during 2020, you'll see more announcements made as it relates to 2021 from a technology standpoint and from a commercial standpoint, Adam, the business is on track from a resource standpoint. There's been a significant investment in resources in and around technology, in and around areas that are accelerating the underlying technology. As you know, we have vehicles on the road today. We finished or completed our Gen 1 platform, which you'll see out on the road in Las Vegas soon, and we'll have our Gen 2 platform available for sale to customers commercially beginning in 2022. So a tremendous amount of progress. 
As it relates to capital, recall the transaction, HMG contributed $1.4 billion of cash back in March of 2020. We're using that cash to make the investments that we've talked about. Both of us as partners are focused on how do we develop the technology and how do we maximize value. So we're completely aligned on value creation and value creation within that business, if you know what I mean. So focused on how do we drive value through Motional. 
To the extent we -- to the extent we see opportunities where our view on value of the business aligns with one's willingness to contribute capital. That's something that we, as partners, will evaluate, and it's something that we'll continue to monitor. But at this point in time, we feel like, at this point in time, we have more than enough capital for the foreseeable future to continue to accelerate our investment. But it's something again that we continue to watch and we watch closely. So I would not refer to capital as a constraint. 
On the flexible printed circuit boards, as you know, we've been very focused on vehicle architecture for the last several years. And how do we develop solutions for customers that reduce the constraints associated with traditional vehicle architecture. So how do we remove copper content? How do we replace that with real value-added content, like the flexible printed circuit board technology that you're talking about? Which overall is a part of our SVA solution. So that's technology that actually is under development, it's actually technology that we're in discussions with multiple OEMs about. And as you know, we have relationships with several of the leading OEMs, even those who I would say are less traditional OEMs who've been evolving vehicle architecture and have been most aggressive as it relates to changing vehicle architectures so that we can separate software from hardware. And there's going to be more to come there. We feel like we're a leader given our position with the brain and nervous system. We feel like there's a number of opportunities for us. As I mentioned, we've been in discussions in development programs with a number of OEMs, and we'll keep you and others updated on our progress."

How do you view the role of a supplier like Aptiv, I mean I know you ship a lot of software to the OEMs, but to date they're really more takers and sort of integrating -- integration of software all over the place and you've mentioned a number of times, the change in electrical architecture and everyone's moving to more software-enabled platforms. So it seems like there's an opportunity for a player like Aptiv, but you'd have to get involved even earlier in the work and work more closely with the OEMs. So there's a role for you, is that a correct assessment and maybe you could just update us on what Aptiv's doing and the strategy there."

So I think given where we play, given where the industry is going, having a much more strategic relationship with the OEM customer is a must, right? What we deal with, where we operate is a cross section that's highly complex. 
And that's actually where we play. So we have the benefit of our legacy, kind of nervous system vehicle architecture, combined with our newer capabilities in and around software that to your point, started in areas like infotainment, user experience and active safety. All of those are coming together and merging in what we have been talking about, in terms of Smart Vehicle Architecture, all of them. And given our capabilities in both areas, we've been positioned to have strategic discussions and quite frankly, strategic development programs with several of the leading global OEMs. 
And I would say even strategic programs that we're on today, whether it's our Gen 1 ADAS solutions, or our Gen 1 Integrated Cockpit solutions that ultimately lead to -- that lead to the SVA solution. 
Clearly, there's an acceleration of the separation of software and hardware, it's happening as we speak. It presents a huge opportunity for us. We talked about our Gen 2 ADAS platform where we give -- where we can provide the full stack solution, but also provide OEM customers who want the ability to do more of the software on their own, the ability to do so. For those who don't have the capabilities, we can provide the full solution. And we do that today. 
And there will be a universe of OEM customers who want to do more, and we're going to enable that and provide both hardware, software and integration services in those sort of scenarios. There's going to be other OEM customers who really don't have that capability, aren't interested in investing in it, and we'll do more of a full stack solution. And from our perspective, what's important is really to serve both so that we have that revenue opportunity and make sure that we're the driver of change versus reacting to the change. 
So that's why we made the comments in our prepared remarks about continuing to invest during 2020, which was a challenging year. We'll continue to invest during 2021 and beyond on all the solutions that we're developing, the platforming of our various technologies and cannibalizing some of our traditional product lines and replacing them with higher tech solutions that take out mass, that take out weight, that provide OEM customers with more flexibility and really enable the technology that's going into the car. 
So it's a long-winded answer, but I hope I've addressed it."

Now it's taking advantage of that investment opportunity to drive more scale and widening our competitive mode. 
Now there may be within quarters, periods where we decide we're going to invest a bit more, given the competitive dynamic or to drive technology advancement.

Advanced Safety for OEM customers is a solution that sells. So the focus on driving Advanced Safety solutions from our customers is significant.

So we're very focused on a select group of OEMs, who have a strategy that brings high-voltage electrification across multiple platforms. So we get the benefit of -- we get the benefit, they get the benefit of significant volume. 
A year or 2 ago, we were basically evaluating 15 programs on an annual basis. This year, we'll be evaluating north of 40 programs. So bookings activity and dollar value of bookings will certainly kick up in 2021 and beyond. 
It's important to note, the reason we're so successful is we are the only competitor, only player out there that has the ability to bring the vehicle architecture, the connector component, the cable management component, the electrical center component, and the wire harness component together and provide a fully optimized solution to an OEM that takes out mass, it takes out weight, I mean, a significant amount of mass reduction. 
Adam asked that question earlier with respect to flexible printed circuit board technology, but reducing mass by close to 40%, which takes out cost and gives the OEM space.

Beginning with Slide 3, we had a strong start to the year reflecting our ability to outperform in a challenging environment. Our focus on execution translated into stronger revenues a",1186,"Thank you, Elena, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Beginning with Slide 3, we had a strong start to the year reflecting our ability to outperform in a challenging environment. Our focus on execution translated into stronger revenues and earnings in the quarter. Revenues totaled $4 billion, that's up 20% from the prior year, driven by our industry-leading portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies. Operating income reached $437 million reflecting margins of 10.9%, an increase of 370 basis points from the prior year, and earnings per share totaled $1.06 and an increase of 56%. The result of strong revenue growth, partially offset by labor inefficiencies and increased premium freight costs associated with a growing number of supply chain disruptions. 
The 5% growth in global vehicle production was principally driven by a 72% increase in China, lapping the impact of last year's pandemic-related shutdowns partially offset by a decline in vehicle production of 4% in North America and 1% in Europe as OEM customers idle plants in response to the tightening of the global supply chain. 
For the balance of the year, we expect the supply chain to remain stressed in the near-term volatility in production schedules to actually increase. However, the Aptiv team is doing an excellent job executing in this very fluid environment minimizing the effects of the supply chain disruptions and keeping our employees safe while delivering for our OEM customers. 
Turning to Slide 4. This year's supply chain disruptions have been further exacerbated by severe weather in the Southwestern United States and a facility fire of one of the industry's major chip suppliers in Japan. As a result, We continue to experience volatility in production schedules, elevated freight and logistics expenses and higher raw material input prices as the industry struggles to meet strong customer demand levels. As I mentioned, based on our daily discussions with customers and suppliers, we expect supply chain disruptions to actually increase over the next few months before the environment begins to improve in the second half of the year. However, given the puts and takes, we continue to expect global vehicle production to increase 10% for the full year, reflecting continued strong consumer demand. The absence of last year's pandemic-related production shutdowns and customer intentions to make up first half production shortfalls in the second half of the year. 
Moving to Slide 5. Despite the near-term economic uncertainty, we continue to remain confident in our initial financial outlook for the year. Our industry-leading cost structure provides the incremental flexibility to rapidly adjust to changes in customer production schedules and our portfolio of advanced technologies position us to benefit from the acceleration in safe, green and connected secular trends. which has led to increased share of wallet with both leading and emerging electric vehicle manufacturers ramping up production globally, including the leading U.S. EV company, Volkswagen, Volvo, Rivian and Neo. Our scalable satellite architecture ADAS platform is now being deployed across multiple OEMs and vehicle segments across the globe. And our connected services solutions are providing fleet owners with the information necessary to optimize vehicle uptime and lower operating costs as well as OEM customers with the vehicle level data to reduce product development and warranty expenses. 
We're very proud of the positive impact these technologies are having today and I want to recognize the tremendous dedication of the global Aptiv team, which has launched these complex and highly integrated solutions during these very challenging times. 
In summary, our flexible and sustainable business model is reinforced by a consistent and deliberate management approach to disciplined revenue growth, an industry-leading cost structure and sustained through-cycle resiliency, allowing us to compound earnings and cash flow and reinvest that cash to create long-term shareholder value. 
Moving to Slide 6. First quarter bookings totaled $5.2 billion reflecting a strong funnel of new business opportunities and robust customer win rates. Our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment booked approximately $1 billion reflecting the lumpiness of new business awards, further exacerbated by the semiconductor supply shortage, which has extended customer decision timelines as resources have been reallocated. As a result, a number of larger business pursuits are now slated for award in the second half of the year. 
New business bookings for our Signal and Power Solutions segment totaled $4.7 billion, including nearly $1 billion of high-voltage electrification awards driven by the increased demand for electrified vehicle platforms. Our strong track record of new business bookings is proof that our portfolio of advanced technologies is well aligned to the areas of growth within our industry and our position as the only provider of both the brain and the nervous system of the vehicle enables us to provide unique value to our customers. 
Moving to Slide 7. I We believe that our long-term success and ability to create value for our stakeholders are directly linked to building a more sustainable business that continuously delivers on our mission and strategy. Our mission to develop safer, greener and more connected solutions, which enable the future of mobility, is integral to both the products we create and the way we conduct business. Aptiv is committed to protecting human health, natural resources and the environment in which we live and operate. Our commitment to environmental stewardship is company-wide, and we aggressively pursue initiatives to minimize our environmental impact. 
In 2012, we set a long-term target to reduce our carbon output by 30% between 2011 and 2019, which we actually exceeded reducing emissions by over 40% during that period. In our 2020 sustainability report, we published new, more aggressive sustainability targets, that include a further 25% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2025. In addition, We committed to the science-based targets initiative, joining the effort to create a 0-carbon economy to help prevent the effects of climate change. And as a result, we're excited to announce Aptiv's path to carbon neutrality, which includes being carbon neutral across our global operations by 2030 and providing carbon-neutral products to our customers and achieving net neutrality by 2040. 
We remain committed to addressing some of mobility's toughest challenges, while at the same time, reducing CO2 emissions globally. We plan to showcase our industry-leading electrification portfolio and capabilities at our upcoming high-voltage technology teach-in, which is scheduled for early June. 
Turning to Slide 8. Despite the challenges we currently face, we remain focused on further strengthening our track record of outperformance and long-term value creation. While our industry continues to be tested, our operating performance has validated our business model and through-cycle resiliency. As we look ahead, we positioned Aptiv to continue to outperform with focused investments that have increased the resiliency of our business and expanded the markets we serve, leveraging our unique brain and nervous system capabilities to deliver even more content on the electrified, software-defined vehicles of the future, which together yield accretive growth opportunities and present incremental value creation opportunities through smart capital deployment, resulting in meaningful shareholder returns as the economic recovery continues to unfold. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Joe to take us through the first quarter results in more detail."

Revenues of $4 billion were up",941,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Slide 9. The recovery momentum in the first quarter generated strong sales, income and cash performance despite the supply chain constraints Kevin referenced earlier. Revenues of $4 billion were up 20%, 15% ahead of vehicle reduction, which was up 5% on our weighted market base. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $630 million and $437 million respectively, reflecting stronger volumes and disciplined cost management, partially offset by approximately $70 million of COVID and supply chain-related costs. Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.06, reflecting higher operating income, offset by the emotional JV results and higher share count and tax expense. 
Operating cash flow was strong at $252 million, driven by higher EBITDA while CapEx was $134 million. Looking at first quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 10, a Broad demand recovery and some inventory restocking in our Engineered Components businesses contributed a strong growth over market in every region. We also had favorable FX in commodities, partially offset by price downs of approximately 1% in the quarter. 
From a regional perspective, North America revenues were up 5% and representing 9 points of growth over market driven by new launch volume and favorable truck and SUV platform mix. 
In Europe, the trend of strong double-digit market outgrowth continued with further adoption of our high-voltage electrification and active safety solutions. 
Lastly in China, revenues grew by 94%, reflecting 22 points of growth over market as the volume recovery led to production upside and inventory replenishment with our major customers. As a reminder, China operations were shut down between late January and March of last year. 
Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues increased 11% in the quarter, reflecting 6 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, including double-digit active safety outgrowth despite semiconductor supply shortages. Segment EBITDA increased 31%, excluding the impact of the emotional JV deconsolidation, driven by higher sales and disciplined cost management, partially offset by supply chain disruption costs. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenues were up 23%, reflecting 18 points of market outgrowth. Record outgrowth was driven by continued strong demand for high-voltage electrification solutions in Europe and China, favorable truck and SUV platform mix in North America, and the benefits of inventory replenishment within the Engineered Components businesses. 
EBITDA in the segment increased 43% on strong sales conversion, driving meaningful margin expansion despite headwinds from supply chain costs and FX and commodities in the quarter. Both segments saw lower price downs in the quarter due to customer timing, which is expected to return to normalized levels over the course of the year. 
Turning now to Slide 12 and our 2021 macro outlook. As Kevin mentioned earlier, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting the auto industry continues to limit near-term production visibility. Based on discussions with our customers and suppliers, we expect supply chain disruptions to remain volatile in the second quarter given the additional impact of the Naka fire and the Texas weather events. And while we don't expect the supply/demand imbalance to fully recover to normalized levels until 2022, the situation is expected to improve in the second half of the year to allow for partial recovery of lost vehicle production from the first half. Accordingly, we will not be providing guidance for the second quarter as there remains a high likelihood of vehicle production shifting between the cores. However, we continue to believe we have adequately reflected the current situation on our original guidance for full year 2021, which estimates global vehicle production of 84 million units, up 10% with minor adjustments within the regions. Our assumption for North America has increased slightly, offset by a reduction in Europe as markets continue to face extended lockdown measures. 
While the supply chain remains extremely tight, we have taken swift action to mitigate these impacts to help customers prioritize certain platforms to meet increased levels of demand, which was reflected in the strong outgrowth we saw in the first quarter. Although we are not updating our full year guidance, we remain confident our industry-leading portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies will continue to yield market outgrowth in the range of 6% to 8% and consistent with the framework we previously provided. 
Turning to Slide 13. Despite the uncertainty that remains near term, we are confident in the original guidance range we provided for 2021. For the year, we continue to expect revenues to be in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.7 billion, up 16% with 6 points of growth over market at the midpoint and a modest tailwind from FX and commodities, which combined, more than offsets our normal price downs. EBITDA and operating income are expected to be $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion at the midpoint respectively, with strong year-over-year sales conversion. Despite operating with $100 million of COVID-related costs and incurring approximately $80 million to $100 million of manufacturing and logistics costs related to supply chain shortages this year. 
Lastly, benefits of our ongoing initiatives are more than offsetting the $150 million of austerity measures taken primarily during the pandemic-related shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020. 
We expect earnings per share in the range of $3.35 and $3.85 a share or $4.20 to $4.70 per share when excluding the impact of the equity income losses of our Motional joint venture. And lastly, operating cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. 
As a reminder, we will resume providing quarterly guidance when we have improved visibility on customer production schedules and global supply chain disruptions. With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."

Q1 was a strong quarter without a doubt, in a very, very volatile environment. And based on what we have visibility to today, Q2 will be even more volatile than Q1. And operating in that environment presents challenges. Now we're confident from an operational standpoint, we're buttoned down and we're operating well, but we're confident that we'll continue to operate at a high level as we head into Q2. But again, it will be choppy as we look at some of the challenges and disruptions in the supply chain. Our focus is on ensuring that our customers get the parts they need to produce the vehicles that they're trying to produce that consumers want. And based on our forward visibility as we look into Q3 and Q4, all of our customers are very committed to producing the vehicles that they were unable to produce in Q1 and Q2 in Q3 and Q4. And we're all working very actively across the supply chain from the semiconductor providers to the resin providers all the way through the supply chain to the customers. And in a tough environment, we're operating reasonably well. But again, it's challenging. It's requiring incremental resources, incremental costs from a day-to-day management standpoint in our factories as well as from a transportation and logistics standpoint. Incremental engineering resources to make sure that we provide our customers with options or incremental flexibility to the extent we see part shortages that we provide them with additional opportunities. And Q1, when you really look at Q1, a big portion of the outgrowth, and Joe talked about it, is some element of restocking of the overall supply chain in areas like cable management products as well as connectors, which certainly drives some benefit in the first half of the year. But that would be my voiceover in terms of how we view the environment as well as how we perform. Joe, you can provide more visibility."

No, obviously, I agree with everything Kevin said.

I think as we look at it right now, it is to your cadence comment coming -- certainly looks like it's coming in the first half of the year. That's going to be worth a few points of growth in the first half of the year versus versus the back half. Again, it's good business. It's the tiers replenishing, it's the distribution channels replenishing, and we had expected it in the year. So it's more of a sort of when it's happening. And then, listen, as Kevin mentioned, we're seeing increased volatility in Q2. The original chip disruption or supply chain constraints that were sort of what I'll call sort of COVID demand related, those are starting to ebb down in Q2 as we expected, but the the impact of the Naka fire and the Texas weather on Q2 unit production will -- at least based on what we're seeing right now, could certainly be as big from a number of units perspective for the industry as the original disruption. And obviously, all of that is coming in Q2. So we're just mindful of how much production the industry can get through in Q2, still confident to be made up in the back half of the year. But obviously have a fair amount of volatility we're managing through here over the next 3 to 4 months."

From an overall demand standpoint, consumer demand, as you know, is very, very strong, which certainly creates a significant amount of customer demand or customer pull for Aptiv. That demand is in and around the areas where we play, right? It's about accelerated electrification. Increased demand for products like ADAS or ADAS solutions, more demand for connectivity solutions, all of which are places that we play. a much -- a significant driver or increase from our customers on software-defined vehicle solutions, so pull for smart vehicle architecture. So as we take a step back and we look at consumer demands positive, customer pull strong, supply chain challenge, but we'll work through that.

So we think that's something that we'll manage through reasonably well. From a customer standpoint, on top of the strong consumer pull, all of our customers are focused on building their most profitable, most highly contented vehicles. So a portion of the benefit that we saw in Q1, and I expect we'd see in Q2, is pulled for more advanced ADAS solutions, more high-voltage electrification, all those things that consumers want, which is a very strong tailwind. I So as we sit here today like everyone, we struggle day-to-day to deal with the supply chain challenges. We're operating extremely well. We're dealing with them very well. We're putting in the processes or have the processes in place to offset that. But the underlying trend or demand for the areas that we play, we'd actually say is accelerated post COVID.

There was a recent BCG study that talks about 50% of vehicle production will be high voltage by 2026, which is a significant -- significantly higher percentage than what was predicted just a year ago. Certainly, there's a tremendous tailwind for high-voltage electrification. OEMs have reached a point where they've made the choice between internal combustion engine and high-voltage or battery electric vehicles. And they've chosen the latter. And there's a significant investment in that area. And it's a huge opportunity for us. I mentioned just a few years ago, we were pursuing 10 to 15 programs per year.

But qualitatively, we've got -- that business has 1 out of 3.5, content on 1 out of 3.5 vehicles manufactured today on the low voltage side, right? So we do play at very high levels from a capability and customer share perspective. And then when you add on top of that, I think 1 of the advantages we have for customers in high voltage is we're able to meet very high volume requirements very quickly just given the scale of signal and power solutions. So we can get off, get out of the gates very quickly. You're seeing volumes ramp. I mean we had our high-voltage business with some of the launches, it grew 125% in Q1. Now obviously, that's a very strong quarter. But you're really looking at the quality of the launches in Europe and China, the quantity and quality of the launches. And I think the other thing that's One of the read-throughs here is that when OEs have to make decisions around which vehicles to build given the supply chain constraints, they're focusing in North America on truck and SUVs, but certainly in Europe, they're continuing to focus on EVs. So again, we're at a -- we've got a very strong market position in low-voltage space, would expect that to certainly at least be the starting point for our high-voltage business over time and to be able to grow from there."

We had sort of assumed maybe back half, but as all things sort of bounced back related, they seem to be happening faster than original expectations. There's a bit of a couple of points in the first half that are from what I'll call the mix, the heavy content mix, as customers have to make choices around with vehicles to manufacture, they're leaning towards the trucks and SUVs, the EVs as I mentioned. Right now, the assumption is -- and again, we just don't have the updated schedules to refine these. I think as you work back to the to the full year 6%, you'd think through maybe those don't -- the mix goes back to a bit more of a normalized mix in the back half of the year.

So There is precedent for how our -- how it flows through the P&L and how our sort of offsetting mechanisms work We're about 80% pass-through on copper. So copper increases, changes in copper prices, both positive negative pass-through to customers. The remaining 20% we hedge. So we're fairly well insulated from copper. We've cited about this before. There will be a margin rate impact as higher copper prices flow through, right? Because they flow through the pass through, they flow through as revenue on sort of a pass-through basis. So you tend to get some margin rate impact. But again, as we get through the back half or end of the back half of the year and schedules start to straighten out, we'll obviously be updating for macros as well, but that's more margin rate than dollars. Seeing some inflation around things like resin. Obviously, we expect semiconductor prices will go up over the course of the back half of the year into next year. Semiconductor probably being more ASUX, I know your question was SBS, but At this point, the inflation that we're seeing and expecting, I would put it into the context of manageable relative to our sort of broader commercial discussions with customers over the coming year as well as just our mechanisms that we have in place to offset costs and find additional efficiencies. So Copper, by far, the largest, but structurally, we're very well positioned to mitigate or pass through those increases."

So you have unit growth and then you also have significant content growth. There are OEMs who historically have and some who -- it's an increased focus now, want to be more involved in that overall development of the active safety solution. It tends to be today in and around future development. So how does the vehicle respond to certain particular driving incidents so that they give it a feel of a particular brand, whether it be more aggressive or less aggressive. So most of what we've seen is in and around the feature side. We have some customers that were doing soup to nuts, the full platform for. We have other customers who were doing the platform and we're integrating some of the features that they would like to develop. And our Gen 2 ADAS platform, which is underdeveloped now, is going to give OEM customers the ability to do more or less of that and provide them with the tools necessary to actually develop features if that's, if that's something that they would like to do and make it easy for us to integrate those into the overall platform. Is there the areas that I think it would be more challenging for OEMs to take responsibility for is, to your point, on the controller side, one. Two, on the perception systems side. whether that be the radar solution, the vision solution, the LiDAR solution. On the sensor fusion side, so taking all of those inputs and fusing them and developing the software necessary to how does the vehicle perform and react to those various various inputs. I think those would likely be the most challenging areas, but we'll see. I mean some OEM customers may decide that's something that they want to try. I think there's -- as a company that's been in this particular area for a very long period of time, it's complex, as you know. It's a safety feature, so it needs to perform 100% of the time. And the benefit of history and experience, I think creates a bit of a headwind as it relates to in-sourcing all that activity.

Obviously, there's more semiconductor content going into the car, as you know, and having a good sense for the supply chain and capacity within various aspects of the semiconductor supply chain is extremely important. What you're referring to is You can see a scenario where that works for things like microcontrollers, where it's a more commodity-like semiconductor product. There's very little customization. It's a fairly standard solution that goes across multiple areas within the car. When you think about the higher-performing areas like active safety, like RADAR, light vision systems. Obviously, you're talking about a very different matter because the engineering activity and the relationship with the semiconductor partner is extremely important. So obviously, you need to know what capacity in the supply chain looks like. But that engineering technology quotient is significantly higher. Now as you look at the path towards smart vehicle architecture that we're headed down today, the reality is as we see upward integration is we see domain consolidation. The reality is the number of those microcontrollers that go into the car actually are significantly reduced, right? You go -- you basically cut that number in half. So I think there's an element of this activity that, quite frankly, takes care of itself. I do believe and very supportive that The OEMs will come with a much more focus on the supply chain to understand what does supply chain resilience look like. Where is there, not only dual validation but dual capacity available, and how do we continue to minimize risk."

Tailwinds are accelerating, in around safe, green and connected post COVID, the demand for the solutions that we provide, whether it's high voltage electrification, ADAS, vehicle connectivity, it's actually accelerating. So that's certainly a positive. As Joe mentioned, we're highly confident in our full year outlook. Again, near term, it's going to be a bit choppy. And as we look out beyond 2021, We think we believe we're on a path to multiyear growth, which is going to be both unit-based as well as content growth based as we see more demand for high-voltage electrification for active safety solutions and vehicle connectivity.

Beginning with Slide 3. We had a strong start to the year, reflecting our ability to outperform in a challenging environment. Our focus on execution translated into stronger revenues",1184,"Thank you, Elena, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Beginning with Slide 3. We had a strong start to the year, reflecting our ability to outperform in a challenging environment. Our focus on execution translated into stronger revenues and earnings in the quarter. 
Revenues totaled $4 billion. That's up 20% from the prior year, driven by our industry-leading portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies. Operating income reached $437 million, reflecting margins of 10.9%, an increase of 370 basis points from the prior year. And earnings per share totaled $1.06, an increase of 56%, the result of strong revenue growth partially offset by labor inefficiencies and increased premium freight costs associated with a growing number of supply chain disruptions.  
The 5% growth in global vehicle production was principally driven by a 72% increase in China, lapping the impact of last year's pandemic-related shutdowns, partially offset by a decline in vehicle production of 4% in North America and 1% in Europe as OEM customers idle plants in response to the tightening of the global supply chain. For the balance of the year, we expect the supply chain to remain stressed and the near-term volatility in production schedules to actually increase. However, the Aptiv team is doing an excellent job executing in this very fluid environment, minimizing the effects of the supply chain disruptions and keeping our employees safe while delivering for our OEM customers.  
Turning to Slide 4. This year's supply chain disruptions have been further exacerbated by severe weather in the southwestern United States and a facility fire at one of the industry's major chip suppliers in Japan. As a result, we continue to experience volatility in production schedules, elevated freight and logistics expenses and higher raw material input prices as the industry struggles to meet strong customer demand levels. 
As I mentioned, based on our daily discussions with customers and suppliers, we expect supply chain disruptions to actually increase over the next few months before the environment begins to improve in the second half of the year. However, given the puts and takes, we continue to expect global vehicle production to increase 10% for the full year, reflecting continued strong consumer demand. The absence of last year's pandemic-related production shutdowns and customer intentions to make up first half production shortfalls in the second half of the year.  
Moving to Slide 5. Despite the near-term economic uncertainty, we continue to remain confident in our initial financial outlook for the year. Our industry-leading cost structure provides the incremental flexibility to rapidly adjust to changes in customer production schedules, and our portfolio of advanced technologies position us to benefit from the acceleration in safe, green and connected secular trends, which has led to increased share of wallet with both leading and emerging electric vehicle manufacturers ramping up production globally, including the leading U.S. EV companies, Volkswagen, Volvo, Rivian and NIO. 
Our scalable satellite architecture ADAS platform is now being deployed across multiple OEMs and vehicle segments across the globe, and our connected services solutions are providing fleet owners with the information necessary to optimize vehicle uptime and lower operating costs as well as OEM customers with the vehicle-level data to reduce product development and warranty expenses. We're very proud of the positive impact these technologies are having today, and I want to recognize the tremendous dedication of the global Aptiv team, which has launched these complex and highly integrated solutions during these very challenging times. In summary, our flexible and sustainable business model is reinforced by a consistent and deliberate management approach to disciplined revenue growth, an industry-leading cost structure and sustained through-cycle resiliency, allowing us to compound earnings and cash flow and reinvest that cash to create long-term shareholder value.  
Moving to Slide 6. First quarter bookings totaled $5.2 billion, reflecting a strong funnel of new business opportunities and robust customer win rates. Our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment booked approximately $1 billion, reflecting the lumpiness of new business awards, further exacerbated by the semiconductor supply shortage which has extended customer decision time lines as resources have been reallocated. As a result, a number of larger business pursuits are now slated for award in the second half of the year.  
New business bookings for our Signal and Power Solutions segment totaled $4.7 billion, including nearly $1 billion of high-voltage electrification awards driven by the increased demand for electrified vehicle platforms. Our strong track record of new business bookings is proof that our portfolio of advanced technologies is well aligned to the areas of growth within our industry, and our position as the only provider of both the brain and the nervous system of the vehicle enables us to provide unique value to our customers.  
Moving to Slide 7. We believe that our long-term success and ability to create value for our stakeholders are directly linked to building a more sustainable business that continuously delivers on our mission and strategy. Our mission to develop safer, greener and more connected solutions which enable the future of mobility is integral to both the products we create and the way we conduct business. 
Aptiv is committed to protecting human health, natural resources and the environment in which we live and operate. Our commitment to environmental stewardship is company-wide, and we aggressively pursue initiatives to minimize our environmental impact. 
In 2012, we set a long-term target to reduce our carbon output by 30% between 2011 and 2019, which we actually exceeded, reducing emissions by over 40% during that period. In our 2020 sustainability report, we published new, more aggressive sustainability targets that include a further 25% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2025. 
In addition, we committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative, joining the effort to create a 0-carbon economy to help prevent the effects of climate change and as a result, we're excited to announce Aptiv's path to carbon neutrality, which includes being carbon neutral across our global operations by 2030 and providing carbon-neutral products to our customers and achieving net neutrality by 2040. We remain committed to addressing some of mobility's toughest challenges while, at the same time, reducing CO2 emissions globally. We plan to showcase our industry-leading electrification portfolio and capabilities at our upcoming high-voltage technology teach-in, which is scheduled for early June.  
Turning to Slide 8. Despite the challenges we currently face, we remain focused on further strengthening our track record of outperformance and long-term value creation. While our industry continues to be tested, our operating performance has validated our business model and through-cycle resiliency. As we look ahead, we positioned Aptiv to continue to outperform with focused investments that have increased the resiliency of our business and expanded the markets we serve, leveraging our unique brain and nervous system capabilities to deliver even more content on the electrified software-defined vehicles of the future, which together yield accretive growth opportunities and present incremental value-creation opportunities through smart capital deployment, resulting in meaningful shareholder returns as the economic recovery continues to unfold. 
So with that, I'll hand the call over to Joe to take us through the first quarter results in more detail."

The recovery momentum in the first quarter generated strong sales, income and cash performance despite the supply chain constraints Kevin referenced earlier. Revenues of $4 billion were up",938,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Slide 9. The recovery momentum in the first quarter generated strong sales, income and cash performance despite the supply chain constraints Kevin referenced earlier. Revenues of $4 billion were up 20%, 15% ahead of vehicle production, which was up 5% on our weighted market base. 
Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $630 million and $437 million, respectively, reflecting stronger volumes and disciplined cost management, partially offset by approximately $70 million of COVID- and supply chain-related costs. Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.06, reflecting higher operating income, offset by the Motional JV results and higher share count and tax expense. Operating cash flow was strong at $252 million, driven by higher EBITDA while CapEx was $134 million. 
Looking at first quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 10. Broad demand recovery and some inventory restocking in our engineered components businesses contributed a strong growth over market in every region. We also had favorable FX in commodities, partially offset by price downs of approximately 1% in the quarter.  
From a regional perspective, North America revenues were up 5%, representing 9 points of growth over market, driven by new launch volume and favorable truck and SUV platform mix. In Europe, the trend of strong double-digit market outgrowth continued with further adoption of our high-voltage electrification and active safety solutions. Lastly in China, revenues grew by 94%, reflecting 22 points of growth over market as the volume recovery led to production upside and inventory replenishment with our major customers. As a reminder, China operations were shut down between late January and March of last year.  
Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues increased 11% in the quarter, reflecting 6 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, including double-digit active safety outgrowth despite semiconductor supply shortages. Segment EBITDA increased 31% excluding the impact of the Motional JV deconsolidation, driven by higher sales and disciplined cost management, partially offset by supply chain disruption costs.  
Signal and Power Solutions revenues were up 23%, reflecting 18 points of market outgrowth. Record outgrowth was driven by continued strong demand for high-voltage electrification solutions in Europe and China, favorable truck and SUV platform mix in North America and the benefits of inventory replenishment within the engineered components businesses.  
EBITDA in the segment increased 43% on strong sales conversion, driving meaningful margin expansion despite headwinds from supply chain costs and FX and commodities in the quarter. Both segments saw lower price downs in the quarter due to customer timing, which is expected to return to normalized levels over the course of the year.  
Turning now to Slide 12 and our 2021 macro outlook. As Kevin mentioned earlier, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting the auto industry continues to limit near-term production visibility. Based on discussions with our customers and suppliers, we expect supply chain disruptions to remain volatile in the second quarter given the additional impact of the Naka fire and the Texas weather events. And while we don't expect the supply/demand imbalance to fully recover to normalized levels until 2022, the situation is expected to improve in the second half of the year to allow for partial recovery of lost vehicle production from the first half. 
Accordingly, we will not be providing guidance for the second quarter as there remains a high likelihood of vehicle production shifting between the quarters. However, we continue to believe we have adequately reflected the current situation on our original guidance for full year 2021, which estimates global vehicle production of 84 million units, up 10% with minor adjustments within the regions. Our assumption for North America has increased slightly, offset by a reduction in Europe as markets continue to face extended lockdown measures.  
While the supply chain remains extremely tight, we have taken swift action to mitigate these impacts to help customers prioritize certain platforms to meet increased levels of demand, which was reflected in the strong outgrowth we saw in the first quarter. Although we are not updating our full year guidance, we remain confident our industry-leading portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies will continue to yield market outgrowth in the range of 6% to 8%, consistent with the framework we previously provided.  
Turning to Slide 13. Despite the uncertainty that remains near term, we are confident in the original guidance range we provided for 2021. For the year, we continue to expect revenues to be in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.7 billion, up 16% with 6 points of growth over market at the midpoint and a modest tailwind from FX and commodities, which, combined, more than offsets our normal price downs. 
EBITDA and operating income are expected to be $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion at the midpoint, respectively, with strong year-over-year sales conversion despite operating with $100 million of COVID-related costs and incurring approximately $80 million to $100 million of manufacturing and logistics costs related to supply chain shortages this year. Lastly, benefits of our ongoing initiatives are more than offsetting the $150 million of austerity measures taken primarily during the pandemic-related shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020. We expect earnings per share in the range of $3.35 and $3.85 a share or $4.20 to $4.70 per share when excluding the impact of the equity income losses of our Motional joint venture; and lastly, operating cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion.  
As a reminder, we will resume providing quarterly guidance when we have improved visibility on customer production schedules and global supply chain disruptions. With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."

Q1 was a strong quarter, without a doubt, in a very, very volatile environment. And based on what we have visibility to today, Q2 will be even more volatile than Q1, and operating in that environment presents challenges. 
Now we're confident from an operational standpoint. We're buttoned down, and we're operating well. And we're confident that we'll continue to operate at a high level as we head into Q2. But again, it will be choppy as we look at some of the challenges and disruptions in the supply chain. 
Our focus is on ensuring that our customers get the parts they need to produce the vehicles that they're trying to produce that consumers want. And based on our forward visibility as we look into Q3 and Q4, all of our customers are very committed to producing the vehicles that they were unable to produce in Q1 and Q2 and Q3 and Q4, and we're all working very actively across the supply chain, from the semiconductor providers to the resin providers, all the way through the supply chain, to the customers. And in a tough environment, we're operating reasonably well. 
But again, it's challenging, and it's requiring incremental resources: incremental costs from a day-to-day management standpoint in our factories as well as from a transportation and logistics standpoint; incremental engineering resources to make sure that we provide our customers with options; or incremental flexibility, to the extent we see part shortages, that we provide them with additional opportunities. And Q1, when you really look at Q1, a big portion of the outgrowth, and Joe will talk about it, is some element of restocking of the overall supply chain in areas like cable management products as well as connectors, which certainly drives some benefit in the first half of the year. But that would be my voiceover in terms of how we view the environment as well as how we perform. 
Joe, you can provide more visibility."

We were expecting that over the course of the year. 
I think as we look at it right now, it's, to your cadence comment, coming -- certainly looks like it's coming in the first half of the year. That's going to be worth a few points of growth in the first half of the year versus the back half. Again, it's good business. It's the tiers replenishing, it's the distribution channels replenishing, and we had expected it in the year. So it's more of a sort of when it's happening. 
And then, listen, as Kevin mentioned, we're seeing increased volatility in Q2. The original chip disruption or supply chain constraints that were sort of -- what I'll call sort of COVID demand related, those are starting to ebb down in Q2 as we expected, but the the impact of the Naka fire and the Texas weather on Q2 unit production will -- at least based on what we're seeing right now, could certainly be as big from a number of units perspective for the industry as the original disruption. And obviously, all of that is coming in Q2. So we're just mindful of how much production the industry can get through in Q2. Still confident it could be made up in the back half of the year, but obviously have a fair amount of volatility we're managing through here over the next 3 to 4 months."

So there's tremendous opportunity for us to invest organically or via acquisition. And there are a number of areas that Joe and the M&A team are focused on in and around advancing technologies to support the growth in high-voltage electrification as well as to support increased needs for software in areas like ADAS, user experience and smart vehicle architecture.

We have a -- we'll start with a view that over the medium term, you're going to continue to see supply chain tightness, certainly from a semiconductor standpoint as well as in other areas like resin, that will continue through 2022. That will continue. 
From an overall demand standpoint, consumer demand, as you know, is very, very strong, which certainly creates a significant amount of customer demand or customer pull for Aptiv. That demand is in and around the areas where we play, right? It's about accelerated electrification, increased demand for products like ADAS or ADAS solutions, more demand for connectivity solutions, all of which are places that we play. A much -- a significant driver of increase from our customers on software-defined vehicle solutions, so pull for smart vehicle architecture. 
So as we take a step back and we look at consumer demand positive, customer pull strong, supply chain challenged, but we'll work through that. And today, we're operating -- I think we have 60 product redesign programs that we're going through, providing our customers with either alternative choices from a product availability standpoint or cost reduction opportunities that we review with the team on a daily basis. So we think that's something that we'll manage through reasonably well. From a customer standpoint, on top of the strong consumer pull, all of our customers are focused on building their most profitable, most highly contented vehicles. So a portion of the benefit that we saw in Q1 and I expect we'd see in Q2 is pulled for more advanced ADAS solutions, more high-voltage electrification, all those things that consumers want, which is a very strong tailwind.
So as we sit here today, like everyone, we struggle day to day to deal with the supply chain challenges. We're operating extremely well. We're dealing with them very well. We're putting in the processes or have the processes in place to offset that. But the underlying trend or demand for the areas that we play, we'd actually say has accelerated post COVID, and this whole semiconductor issue probably further accelerates the fact or the demand for the areas that we play."

So you have about $900 million in awards Q1. We don't know where that will end the full year, but maybe that $3 billion plus. You've been running in this $2 billion-plus range. And I calculate that on 2025, maybe the industry is something like $8 billion to $9 billion awards. Currently looking at 2025 EV numbers, $500 to $600 of content per vehicle. That would mean that you could have a share in the 40% range, which would be sort of above your traditional electrical architecture but not sort of out of the realm of possibility.

I think working backward at a high level, right, the industry's committed to spend about $300 billion investing, creating or developing high-voltage electrification platforms or vehicles, correct? I mean you've seen the announcements from GM, $20 billion to deliver 30 new EVs. There was a recent BCG study that talks about 50% of vehicle production will be high voltage by 2026, which is a significant -- significantly higher percentage than what was predicted just a year ago. 
Certainly, there's a tremendous tailwind for high-voltage electrification. OEMs have reached a point where they've made the choice between internal combustion engine and high-voltage or battery electric vehicles, and they've chosen the latter. And there's a significant investment in that area, and it's a huge opportunity for us. 
I've mentioned, just a few years ago, we were pursuing 10 to 15 programs per year. This year, we'll be pursuing somewhere between 75 and 100 programs. And when you look at our historic win rate, which is north of kind of 60%, 65%, and you look at our core capabilities and what we're able to bring in terms of a full system solution, the opportunity is significant."

So we do play at very high levels from a capability and customer share perspective. 
And then when you add on top of that -- I think one of the advantages we have for customers in high voltage is we're able to meet very high volume requirements very quickly just given the scale of Signal and Power Solutions. So we can get off -- get out of the gates very quickly. You're seeing volumes ramp. 
I mean we had -- our high-voltage business with some of the launches, it grew 125% in Q1. Now obviously, that's a very strong quarter. But you're really looking at the quality of the launches in Europe and China, the quantity and quality of the launches. And I think the other thing that's -- one of the read-throughs here is that when OEs have to make decisions around which vehicles to build given the supply chain constraints, they're focusing in North America on truck and SUVs, but certainly in Europe, they're continuing to focus on EVs. So again, we're at a -- we've got a very strong market position in low-voltage space, would expect that to certainly at least be the starting point for our high-voltage business over time and to be able to grow from there."

Regulations driving the requirement for ADAS, especially in places like Europe, NCAPs driving the demand for ADAS solutions in North America, Europe as well as China. It's a -- whether it's an option or it's standard, it's a product or a solution which helps OEMs sell cars, one. And two, it's typically a pretty profitable option so they get price and margin for it.  
Consumers demand it. If you're in a car with an advanced ADAS solution, there's no way you're going backwards. So rebuy rates, I think, are up north of 95% on ADAS. So demand continues to be strong. I think our outlook this year is ADAS will grow roughly 35% on a year-over-year basis. Market growth is about half of that.

To us, it's really -- we expected it to happen in the full year. We had sort of assumed maybe back half. But as all things sort of bounce back related, they seem to be happening faster than original expectations. 
There's a bit of -- a couple of points in the first half that are from what I'll call the mix, the heavy content mix. As customers have to make choices around what vehicles to manufacture, they're leaning towards the trucks and SUVs, the EVs, as I mentioned. Right now, the assumption is -- and again, we just don't have the updated schedules to refine these. I think as you work back to the full year 6%, you'd think through maybe those don't -- the mix goes back to a bit more of a normalized mix in the back half of the year.

We're about 80% pass-through on copper. So copper increases, changes in copper prices, both positive and negative, we pass through to customers. The remaining 20% we hedge. So we're fairly well insulated from copper. 
We've talked about this before. There will be a margin rate impact as higher copper prices flow through, right, because they flow through as a pass-through -- they flow through as revenue on sort of a pass-through basis, so you tend to get some margin rate impact. But again, as we get through the back half or into the back half of the year and schedules start to straighten out, we'll obviously be updating for macros as well, but that's more margin rate than dollars. 
Seeing some inflation around things like resin. Obviously, we expect semiconductor prices will go up over the course of the back half of the year into next year. Semiconductor probably being more ASUX. I know your question was SPS.

That's within SPS. So the HellermannTyton business as well as our connection systems business does push through distribution. 
But again, it's framed in the hundreds of millions of dollars type volume, but impactful in the first half of the year, just given the level of replenishment distribution.

As it relates to partial vehicle builds, that's -- obviously, we know they're happening. That's -- we get very little to no -- to really no visibility to that. And in most cases, because we're shipping and they're building and to the extent that's a part that we're contributing, obviously, that remains an order for us.

But clearly, it seems like you have more automakers trying to do a little more on the active safety side. 
And I recognize there's multiple ways you can work with a customer and bigger pie, roles may change, but maybe you could just give us a sense of how that dynamic is working out with automakers. Are they taking -- on the active safety side, are they taking more of an active role in forming their functionality versus relying on suppliers? And what's the piece that's always going to be with you regardless of whether the automakers themselves want to bring in more functionality in-house?"

Listen, again, it's all over the place, so it depends on the OEM. And I think you have to start with the first point in terms of the overall market and penetration rates of active safety is increasing significantly. In the fastest growing areas, it's really in and around that L2, L2+, right? So you have unit growth and then you also have significant content growth. 
There are OEMs who historically have and some who, it's an increased focus now, want to be more involved in that overall development of the active safety solution. It tends to be today in and around feature development, so how does the vehicle respond to certain -- particular driving incidents so that they give it a feel of a particular brand, whether it be more aggressive or less aggressive. So most of what we've seen is in and around the feature side. 
We have some customers that we're doing soup to nuts, the full platform for. We have other customers who we're doing the platform and we're integrating some of the features that they would like to develop. And our gen 2 ADAS platform, which is underdeveloped now, is going to give OEM customers the ability to do more or less of that and provide them with the tools necessary to actually develop features if that's something that they would like to do and make it easy for us to integrate those into the overall platform. 
Is there -- the areas that I think it would be more challenging for OEMs to take responsibility for is, to your point, on the controller side, one; two, on the perception system side, whether that be the radar solution, the vision solution, the LiDAR solution; on the sensor fusion side, so taking all of those inputs and fusing them and developing the software necessary to how does the vehicle perform and react to those various inputs. I think those would likely be the most challenging areas, but we'll see. I mean some OEM customers may decide that's something that they want to try. 
I think there's -- as a company that's been in this particular area for a very long period of time, it's complex, as you know. It's a safety feature so it needs to perform 100% of the time. And the benefit of history and experience, I think, creates a bit of a headwind as it relates to in-sourcing all that activity. But again, our focus is on providing our customers with what it is that they're looking for and driving profitable revenue growth in doing."

This one though is about the impact of the chip shortage and what it means for, call it, a high-performance procurement organization at the OEMs. We had a consultant on a webinar talking about how his firm would be encouraging OEMs to look deep into the supply chain to understand where the chips are coming from, that was clearly best practice after Fukushima,  but also to begin directed buy of many more chips, so -- and which raises the question of, if one is a build-to-print electronic black box manufacturer, directed buy would be detrimental to margin. 
So really 2 questions. One, do you see that trend as well? Is it something you would encourage? And B, kind of as you think about your product lines and especially how you've evolved them towards higher-margin software, how would Aptiv fare in that kind of environment?"

Obviously, there's more semiconductor content going into the car, as you know, and having a good sense for the supply chain and capacity within various aspects of the semiconductor supply chain is extremely important.",262,"Yes. That's a great question, Brian. Obviously, there's more semiconductor content going into the car, as you know, and having a good sense for the supply chain and capacity within various aspects of the semiconductor supply chain is extremely important. What you're referring to is -- you can see a scenario where that works for things like microcontrollers, where it's a more commodity-like semiconductor product. There's very little customization. It's a fairly standard solution that goes across multiple areas within the car. 
When you think about the higher-performing areas like active safety, like radar, like vision systems, obviously, you're talking about a very different matter because the engineering activity and the relationship with the semiconductor partner is extremely important. So obviously, you need to know what capacity in the supply chain looks like, but that engineering technology quotient is significantly higher. 
Now as you look at the path towards smart vehicle architecture that we're headed down today, the reality is -- as we see upward integration, as we see domain consolidation, the reality is the number of those microcontrollers that go into the car actually are significantly reduced, right? You go -- you basically cut that number in half. So I think there's an element of this activity that, quite frankly, takes care of itself. I do believe and very supportive that the OEMs will come with much more focus on the supply chain to understand what does supply chain resilience look like, where is there not only dual validation but dual capacity available and how do we continue to minimize risk."

Beginning with Slide 3. Aptiv's first half performance, which includes record growth over market and record new business awards, validates the strength of our portfolio of market-relevant technologies and our success keeping our customers running in a challenging environment. 
Revenues in the second quarter were $3.8 billion, an increase of 85%, lapping prior year shutdowns in North America and Europe, and representing 17 points of growth over underlying vehicle production. 
Operating income and earnings per share in the second quarter totaled $301 million and $0.60, respectively, meaningfully impacted by ongoing COVID-related expenses as well as the increased supply chain disruption and input costs resulting from material shortages. 
Despite these headwinds, which we expect to somewhat ease during the balance of the year, we're raising our outlook for the full year, driven by continued strong customer demand for our solutions, continuing our track record of outperformance and value creation for all stakeholders. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our updated 2021 outlook also reflects our flexible and sustainable business model, which positions us to support the record number of customer program launches that are driving incremental volume and market share gains this year, while mitigating the supply chain headwinds. 
As I mentioned, we expect the supply chain tightness to begin easing over the next few months, and we're happy with consumer demand levels, and our customers intend to make up as much of the first half production shortfalls as possible, which is the reason we've made no change to our outlook for growth in global vehicle production, which we still expect to be roughly 10% for the full year. 
At the same time, the demand for our portfolio of advanced technologies is benefiting from the acceleration of the safe, green and connected megatrends, which has led to an increase in our outlook for revenue growth and growth over market from 6% to approximately 10% for the year. 
Our team is diligently working to efficiently launch high-complexity programs in the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, while we also delivered on the launch of a record number of high-voltage electrification programs in our Signal and Power Solutions segment. 
That said, it will continue to be more expensive to operate in the current environment, as customers cancel production shifts in idle plants in response to supply chain constraints, creating temporary labor inefficiencies in our operations and input costs increase as a result of material shortages, both of which have been factored into our updated full year outlook. 
Our sourcing and commercial teams are actively pursuing recovery actions with suppliers and with customers, and our engineering teams are developing and validating product redesigns, providing access to incremental sources of supply and helping to offset the impact of increased input costs. 
Setting the near-term challenges aside, we're performing very well and continue to proactively position Aptiv for the future by investing in high-growth, high-margin technologies that further enhance the resiliency of our business, and by leveraging our unique brain and nervous system capabilities to deliver more content on the electrified software-defined vehicles of the future, which taken together yield accretive growth opportunities on the path to the software-defined vehicle enabled through smart vehicle architecture for as evidenced by our recent bookings and the size and quality of our new business pursuit pipeline. 
As shown on Slide 5, second quarter new business bookings reached $6 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to a record $11.2 billion. Our unique portfolio of advanced technologies, combined with our flawless operating execution, has positioned us as a partner of choice for our customers by enabling the transition to new architectures and software-defined features with our optimized solutions that enhance system's performance while also lowering the vehicle's total cost. 
Our brain and nervous system capabilities and holistic platform approach sets us apart. While global scale and execution capabilities have allowed us to increase our share of wallet with both traditional and emerging OEM customers, and strengthen our overall competitive position, which you'll hear more about in our upcoming segment discussions. 
Turning to the highlights from our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment on Slide 6. Second quarter revenues increased 83%, 15 points over market, reflecting the benefit of new program launches and content gains, which translated into strong growth over market in our active safety product line and continued growth in our user experience and connectivity and security product lines despite the supply chain constraints impacting the segment. 
Consumers are demanding more safety and connectivity features in their vehicles, which are increasingly delivered through software enabled by more advanced sensing and compute platforms. 
This presents us with additional opportunities to increase our customer share of wallet. The evolution of future-rich, more automated vehicles is playing out just as we planned. We anticipated our customers' needs and took the actions necessary to position Aptiv as a strong collaboration partner. 
As a result, we're experiencing firsthand the commercial validation of SVA with 9 advanced development programs underway or recently completed, which we're confident will lead to new customer awards during the next year. And a new business award during the second quarter from Great Wall Motors for the development of a central vehicle controller. 
This is a new high-performance compute platform that will first launch with Great Wall's Way brand in 2023, which up-integrates critical body functions and controls the flow of data in and out of the vehicle, making it a first-to-market solution globally and also representing a key SVA commercial milestone. 
Moving to Slide 7. We're at a pivotal point in our industry's transition as consumers want more advanced features for safety, comfort and convenience. More stringent regulations regarding CO2 emissions and lower battery costs are accelerating the industry's move to high-voltage electrification. 
And 5G technology and the cloud are creating opportunities to deliver vehicles that leverage connectivity and even more than they do today, all of which is being enabled through a significant increase in the amount of software going into the vehicle, providing us with increased software content and new business model opportunities. 
To put the opportunity into context, the total automotive software market, which includes integration, feature development and validation and verification services, totals an estimated $30 billion today and is expected to grow to roughly $80 billion by 2030. 
This represents a significant opportunity for Aptiv. We're confident that we have a right to play across the full software stack with over 5,000 software engineers who successfully deployed advanced software solution across literally millions of vehicles with multiple OEM customers across the globe, including our advanced ADAS systems currently launching on the Jeep Grand Cherokee which includes radar, camera, perception and feature software, enabling 360-degree sensing and ADAS functionality through L2+. 
And with the addition of in-cabin sensing technology, will also include hands-free active driving assist. We're also helping to enable L2+ ADAS system capabilities for Ford as well as other OEMs, with our skilled ADAS platform, which includes modular software building blocks and industry-leading perception systems. 
And lastly, Lowell's Polestar 2 was first to market with native android automotive running Google Automotive Services. Aptiv's android-based software and hardware platform powers this best-in-class infotainment system and enables real-time over-the-air updates. 
These examples underscore Aptiv's software and systems capabilities as well as our role as a partner of choice, delivering more advanced, higher-value margin-accretive solutions to our customers. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our Signal and Power Solutions segment is the industry leader in high-speed, high-fidelity data transmission, multi-voltage electrical distribution and automotive-grade cable management and connection systems. 
Revenues increased 86% during the quarter, 18 points over market, driven by OEMs prioritizing the production of more highly contented vehicles as well as the increased production of high-voltage electrified vehicles resulting in increased demand for both our low-voltage and high-voltage architecture solutions and continued very strong demand for engineered components for applications in the automotive, commercial vehicle and industrial markets. 
We're well positioned to support our customers globally with a comprehensive portfolio of vehicle architecture solutions that leverage a high degree of vertical integration, which has translated into a significant increase in new business awards for high-voltage electrified platforms, where we've been able to design and deliver fully optimized vehicle architecture that provide up to a 40% reduction in weight and mass, significantly lowering the total system cost of an electrified vehicle platform, positioning us to have content of more than 50% of the battery electric vehicles launching over the next few years. 
In addition, several OEMs have asked us to help define their next-generation electrified vehicle architecture with advanced development programs, including a multi-voltage predevelopment partnership with a major German OEM on their premium electrified vehicle platform and development of the next-generation electrical architecture for a future battery electric vehicle platform with a major high-volume global OEM. 
These customer awards validate our leadership position, optimizing power and data distribution for new vehicle architectures that delivers significant value for our customers. 
Turning to Slide 9. In June, we hosted our virtual electrification teach-in which showcased our industry-leading high- and low-voltage technology portfolio. The accelerated outlook for the EV market and how those translate into sustainable and profitable growth for Aptiv. The recent increased demand for electric vehicles has been encouraging, but it's nothing compared to what's on the horizon. As governments around the world feel a green recovery never Aptiv's value proposition has more meaning than it does today. 
The European Union recently proposed regulations calling for 0 CO2 emissions from vehicles by 2035, and the U.S. administration has recommended targets for significantly higher EV penetration, both of which are driving an increase in commercial activity. 
Every major global customer has announced an increase in pull forward of investment in the development of new electric vehicle platforms. And combined, OEMs are now targeting to launch over 400 vehicle programs between now and 2025, which has translated into a tenfold increase in business pursuit activity over the last few years. 
We've been quick to support our customers globally with high-voltage new business awards totaling $1.4 billion year-to-date and a clear line of sight to future awards. We now expect high-voltage bookings to exceed $2.5 billion for the year, that's an increase of 25% over our prior record of $2 billion, and we expect our high-voltage revenues to increase from just under $1 billion in '21 to over $2.5 billion in 2025, making high-voltage electrification our fastest-growing product segment. 
Our success has been driven by our end-to-end full system level capabilities, which enable a more efficient path to vehicle electrification. Our portfolio of advanced technologies enables faster charging, improved reliability, performance and packaging as well as increased safety and security, while optimization of the vehicle architecture design leads to reduce complexity, enables more flexible and scalable implementation and as I mentioned, results in significant weight and cost savings on the path to full SVA, all of which is developed and delivered to our customers flawlessly due to our global scale and manufacturing excellence. 
Our industry-leading position in high-voltage electrification solutions positions us to pursue additional opportunities and deliver incremental value to customers through a much broader system level design and software solution. 
Moving to Slide 10. We're proud of the progress we've made on our enterprise-wide commitment to corporate social responsibility, which can be further explored in our 2021 sustainability report that was published in July. This year's report includes our sustainability strategy and 2025 commitments for each of our foundational pillars, which include people, product, planet and platform, and enhanced disclosures specifically around our approach to diversity, inclusion and human capital development. 
Our path to carbon neutrality by 2040, our Lean 2.0 initiatives focused on product quality and execution and the governance and operating processes around our sustainability objectives. 
Our report also highlights the tremendous contributions made by our team during the pandemic and how each of us live the Aptiv values, thinking and acting like owners and always doing the right thing the right way. 
Through our team's resiliency and dedication, we've continued to deliver on our mission, creating product that helps transform society by saving lives, reducing carbon emissions and connecting people in new ways. We believe that our long-term success and ability to create value for our stakeholders are directly linked to building more sustainable business that continuously delivers on this mission and our strategy. 
As a result, we're proud to be an early adopter, linking our sustainability commitments with our bottom line and our recently credit facility, which Joe is going to cover in more detail shortly. And we fully understand that reaching our goals will take a comprehensive strategy, intense coordination and operating execution by all of our team members over a sustained period of time. 
So with that, I'll hand the call over to Joe to take us through the financials in more detail."

The recovery momentum in the second quarter generated strong results, despite the challenging environment Kevin referenced. 
Revenues of $3.8 billion were up 85%, 17% ahead of vehicle production, with strong market outgrowth in every region. 
Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $498 million and $301 million, respectively, reflecting headwinds of $55 million of COVID safety and supply chain disruption costs and $80 million from FX, commodities and other input costs. 
Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.60, and operating cash flow was strong at $297 million, driven by higher earnings despite increased inventory levels to support customer schedules. 
Looking at second quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 12. Broad demand recovery contributed to strong growth over market across regions. Favorable volumes and the impact of FX and commodities were partially offset by normal price downs in the quarter. 
From a regional perspective, North America revenues were up 154%, representing 24 points of growth over market, driven by the ramp in active safety launch volumes and favorable truck and SUV platform mix. 
In Europe, strong double-digit outgrowth of 37% was driven by robust customer launch activity and higher volumes in our high-voltage electrification and industrial product lines. 
Lastly, in China, revenues grew by 2% or 9 points over market, lapping last year's strong market recovery without growth driven by the Engineered Components product line. 
Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues increased 83% in the quarter, reflecting 15 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, despite the semiconductor supply constraints. 
Segment EBITDA increased by $113 million, driven by higher sales volumes, partially offset by supply chain distribution -- I'm sorry, supply chain disruption and higher input costs. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenue were up 86%. Record growth was driven by broad-based recovery across the auto, commercial vehicle and industrial end markets and the ramping of high-voltage vehicle production. EBITDA in this segment increased by $443 million in the quarter on higher sales volume, partially offset by FX and commodities, primarily copper and additional costs and inefficiencies from the supply chain constraints and resulting disruptions to customer production schedules. 
Turning now to Slide 14 and our 2021 macro outlook. We continue to plan for global vehicle production to be up 10% for the year. As expected, the semiconductor constraints were more impactful in the second quarter due to the impact of the fire and spring weather events. 
While ongoing challenges with semiconductor supply will continue to impact vehicle production, we believe we have adequately reflected these dynamics and our outlook for the second half, which estimates vehicle production to be down 4%, lapping last year's second half production snapback, which creates difficult comps in all regions. 
Accordingly, we expect second half production in North America to be flat, while Europe and China are expected to be down 5% and 10%, respectively. 
In summary, while the supply chain remains tight, we are working closely with customers and suppliers to optimize deliveries to meet customer demand. 
Given continued variability in customer production schedules, we are not in a position to provide third quarter financial guidance. However, we are confident in our updated 2021 outlook reflected on Slide 15. We now expect revenue in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion, up 20% with 10 points of growth over market at the midpoint, 4 points higher than our prior guide, demonstrating the relevance and diversity of our portfolio and product lines. 
EBITDA and operating income are now expected to be $2.42 billion and $1.63 billion at the midpoint, with strong year-over-year sales conversion despite COVID and supply chain disruption costs, which are now estimated to be $250 million for the year, up $110 million over last year and FX, commodity and other rising input costs. 
Lastly, we expect earnings per share of $3.75 at the midpoint and operating cash flow of $1.8 billion. Turning to Slide 16. We thought it would be helpful to provide more detail on the full year guidance update compared to the initial guidance we provided back in February. 
Starting with the revenue walk on the left. Our updated outlook reflects an increase of $455 million from growth above vehicle production as well as a $385 million tailwind from FX and commodities. EBITDA guidance has increased, driven by the $215 million benefit of higher growth and performance. 
However, the increase was offset by higher costs, approximately $70 million associated with managing through the supply chain disruptions and volatile customer production schedules. In addition, we are experiencing higher FX and commodity pricing, mainly copper, as well as increases in certain input costs, including semiconductors and pricing of $125 million versus our initial guidance. 
As it relates to these higher commodity price input costs, we have already started taking actions to offset and mitigate these headwinds. We believe it is prudent to assume that these costs are not transitory and will persist into future periods. 
In addition to passing along higher prices where possible, including copper price escalations, we have a number of other initiatives, including supplier recovery strategies, engineering redesign and alternative source evaluations as well as engaging in commercial discussions with our customers. 
Moving to Slide 17. Sustainability is core to our business from the products we make to the way in which we operate. We are proud to be one of the first companies to integrate our targets into a financing structure that underscores our commitment to cleaner air and safer work environments. In June, we entered into an amended and restated $2 billion revolving credit facility utilizing our existing sustainability metrics and commitments. 
The amendment extends the maturity of the credit facility to 2026 and utilizes a pricing mechanism that lowers the borrowing rate, which we maintain throughout the term of the facility as long as we meet our previously published sustainability commitments, which include a decrease in scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 25% by 2025 and maintaining an industry-best lost workday case rate. 
The amended facility includes a debt-to-EBITDA leverage covenant of 3.5x with up to $750 million cash netting and flexibility to increase the aggregate borrowing capacity and leverage in connection with any future M&A activity. 
Turning to Slide 18. As we have discussed, our business model enables us to convert more income to cash, generating higher operating cash flow and free cash flow conversion. We expect operating cash flow of $1.8 million in 2021, above 2019 levels, driven by higher earnings, partially offset by investments in inventory to support customer schedules.  
The decisive actions we've taken in the last few years to strengthen our capital structure has allowed us to maintain a strong balance sheet, while continuing our disciplined capital deployment track record, which is evidenced by the $12.6 billion deployed from 2015 through 2020, focused on value-enhancing investment opportunities. 
We continue to maintain a consistent approach aligned to our strategic framework that includes reinvesting in our growth businesses with high ROI CapEx investments largely to support new customer wins and the expansion of key growth product lines, enhancing our auto tech capabilities in software, artificial intelligence, machine learning and systems engineering as well as continuing to increase scale and diversification in our Signal and Power Solutions segment. 
The consistent execution of our strategy, even in the face of today's challenges, is a major differentiator for Aptiv and an important lever for shareholder value generation going forward. 
With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."

No, we've seen, I would say, post-COVID with the acceleration on battery electric vehicles and customer demand for an increased portfolio of battery electric vehicles and acceleration of the work in and around SVA. 
I think the simple way to think about SVA, and we've always talked about it as a journey, right, starting with domain centralization, then moving to vehicle architecture simplification and then ultimately to kind of end-case SVA, which is post 2025. 
We break that down into 3 big product areas and in the first zone controllers, and we've talked about the trend towards zone controllers, we've talked about our work and our actual commercial wins in and around zone controllers. The second is in and around advanced development programs for would relate to the CVC win with Great Wall Motors. 
And then the fourth is in and around the OSP. So we feel like we've checked the box on 3 of the first 4 stages as it relates to SVA. The 4 stages that OSP we're in discussions with several OEMs regarding advanced development programs in that particular area. 
And what's really important is all those ADP programs ultimately translate into real commercial opportunities. And to the extent you're working closely and strategically with your customer, you're doing advanced development programs, you're helping them frame design of the vehicle, design of the architecture, both hardware and software, it puts you in a really good position to effectively be awarded the follow-on business. 
So a long-winded way of -- we've always described this as a journey. Sitting here today, we'd tell you it's accelerated from where we thought it would be from a customer demand standpoint, a little over a year ago. It's being driven by the trend towards battery electric vehicles and the opportunity to rethink vehicle architecture as your trend towards battery electric vehicles. 
And we're well positioned just given our history in domain controllers, given our history in vehicle architecture and our capabilities in and around zone controllers and our activities with OEMs the ADP programs that we've had in and around PDCs, the award from Great Wall Motors on the CVC and the discussions we're now having with OEMs in and around the 
So we have wins today. We have revenue today if you were to think about the transition to SVA. But we think the real revenue opportunity is 2025 and beyond, as you see multiple OEMs rethinking vehicle architecture and a much bigger push towards battery electric vehicles."

When you look -- when you break down our current revenues and bookings, we've seen an acceleration of both bookings and revenue, and I'd characterize it in 2 areas. One, the newer battery electric vehicle manufacturers, some of which are more mature and have been around in North America, some that are a little less mature in our are launching vehicles now in North America. 
And then a significant swing and probably a bigger mix change, quite frankly, in China with our new battery electric vehicle customers that tend to be more domestic. So to put it in perspective, 5 years ago, 20% of our revenues and bookings in China were with local OEMs. Today, it's closer to 30%.

Previous periods last year was affected by -- we exited the display business. So we had a headwind there. 
But it's growing very strong. Integrated cockpit controllers and that whole digital experience is a huge aspect of what we're doing from an SVA standpoint, ICC gets up-integrated as a part of our SVA solution. 
The whole in-cabin sensing is a very important aspect as it relates to advanced ADAS solutions, Brian. So in addition to the experience in the car, the user experience in the car, the in-cabin sensing necessary to advance to L2+ to L3 becomes increasingly important. 
And I think as we speak today, I think we're about to launch over the next 12 months on 3 or 4 in-cabin sensing programs that are tied to effectively ADAS capabilities. And I think in my prepared remarks, I referenced 1 OEM that as we are launching their ADAS solution now, the next phase of it is actually that fully integrated in-cabin sensing that allows them to further advance their driver assist capabilities. 
So it's extremely important, and it's a very important aspect as it relates to SVA. As it relates to software, yes, we're trying to be really smart in terms of where we focus our resources and capital. I think Joe has mentioned in the past that acquisitions in and around the software space that are additive to what we do today that help us for the productize software or give us capabilities to develop incremental features, whether it's inside auto or outside auto is one of the areas that the team is very focused on.

I think structurally set aside semiconductor shortages, resin tightness, things like that, the reality is L2, L2+ category within active safety is the fastest-growing segment and was predicted to be pre the current supply chain situation. So that obviously drives growth. 
It's -- consumers want safety. They pay for safety and Joe's point, in a market like today's market where our customers need to be -- need to be, I think, need to make decisions about vehicle platforms they're building. They're focused on fully contented vehicle platform. So that's -- sure that's driving some benefit. But the underlying structural trend is towards more advanced ADAS systems, which an L2 system, for us goes to an OEM for $1,000, $1,200. So it's a significant amount of revenue. 
The other piece though is high-voltage electrification. Our high-voltage electrification revenues will increase 60% this year. And we talked about in our prepared remarks going from under $1 billion in revenues to $2.5 billion in revenues based on our current bookings trajectory. And if you if you follow what they're driving in Europe from a CO2 emissions standpoint, the discussion out of the current administration here in the U.S. in terms of of what they've liked commitments from North American OEMs to deliver from a battery electric vehicle standpoint, there will be a significant pull and demand for high voltage electrification, which we're perfectly positioned to benefit from."

I'd answer that. It's kind of a multilayered question. So when you separate or when you look at the current supply chain constraints, and if you want to say specific to semiconductors, but there are effects in other areas like resins, as an example. 
It's multilayered. One is just capacity versus demand. And in the semiconductor side and the resin side, we're seeing easing. We are seeing supply come in into the market being provided to IDMs. So -- and we're in daily contact with the semiconductor suppliers, the fab folks across the whole supply chain from a semiconductor standpoint. 
So that is improving. You have a situation where earlier in the year, you had bad weather in the Southwest, you'll reference that. It impacted supply availability late Q1 and into Q2. You had the fire in Japan in the first quarter that had implications for the second quarter, that situation is improving, production is coming online. Not as fast as we'd like, but it's certainly improving. 
However, you're running into situations like today, where you have COVID challenges in Southeast Asia, most specifically today in Malaysia, that's interrupted production with some of the semiconductor suppliers that is affecting availability of chips over the short term that will impact schedules. 
We're watching Indonesia. We're watching Philippines. We're watching Singapore, Taiwan very closely. Those areas seem to be under control. But the supply chain is tight and any sort of event you see like COVID in Malaysia has an outsized impact relative to what typically would occur. 
So we'd say structurally, the situation is improving, but there's going to be periodic headwinds that we potentially run into due to things like COVID."

And I see on your -- on Slide 15 here, $110 million, so you're outpacing that amount. So is that to say that you're expecting some recoveries or efficiencies into the back half? 
And then I realize it's way too early to give any sort of definitive color on '22, but as we're thinking about the supply chain in '22, how does this influence the type of profile you get on incremental margins on any volume recovery?"

It's Joe. -- it's been -- it's obviously a very fluid situation, right? And to some extent, we -- in this quarter, we're just sort of talking about the COVID and supply chain costs on a combined basis because to some extent, they're starting to blur. If you're incurring a lot of premium freight getting parts out of the -- getting semiconductors out of Malaysia because the plant has been shut down with COVID, so the way you want to -- which one do you want to call that. 
But we actually have seen or have in some cases where we talked about $100 million of COVID costs for the year, running at $25 million a quarter, that's coming down a little bit, and it's just in some places and it's about -- that's come down about $20 million for the rest -- for the back half of the year. 
Really there, we're still spending what we need to on the personal protection stuff, but some of the just inherent inefficiencies that came with, I'll say, the first take on social distancing and spacing out the plants and some of the inefficiencies that's created, the team has found better ways to manage through that. 
So some of those COVID costs have sort of eased a bit. Listen, it's -- we're obviously not going to speak to 2022, but we have made the comments before, though, I would expect COVID costs certainly to continue into '22. And as I said, we're now expecting about $80 million of that for the full year. 
I think that would continue. You're clearly seeing vaccinations matter. And it's a little hard to call vaccination rates in all of the places where we do business. So I think out of an abundance of caution, we're certainly going to leave the employee protection costs in and spend that money until we're really comfortable, we're not putting employees at risk. 
The supply chain disruption costs, those are directly tied to, in a lot of cases, premium freight, expedited manufacturing. There's obviously some inefficiencies now creeping into our plants as customers shut down for periods of time, and that's not -- we're not necessarily causing the shutdowns, but we're obviously impacted by them. 
And that impacts -- if you think about the indirect impact there, that impacts SPS as well because as customers shut down lines for 3 or 4 days, we're obviously shutting down that part of the business as well. So I think those costs needs to -- you need to sort of align those with how long you think the supply chain disruptions are going to continue."

There's an element to the extent supply comes in more normalized into the market, you see a pretty rapid reduction in premium freight and labor inefficiencies, right? Joe talked about them. 
We go through a really choppy production schedule now given what OEMs are doing from a production standpoint and very near-term announcements, which really don't allow us to flex labor as efficiently, and we're launching a number of programs in certain cases. 
To be honest, we're keeping extra labor to make sure as programs come back, we have trained hourly employees to actually launch those programs fastly. The second piece we're doing from an input standpoint, which Joe talked about, is something that we need to work through over a longer period of time. We have a supply chain operating committee that really does 2 things: one, supply chain and commercial specialists who are focused on both, one, day to day, how do we make sure that we keep customers connected with our suppliers; And then, two, longer term, what is it that we need to do strategically working with engineering? 
And we have a number of engineering initiatives underway, I'd say close to 100, where we're redesigning products, changing out input costs or inputs to, one, provide additional incremental availability or capacity; but, two, to reduce overall expenses. 
Now those tend to take a little bit longer to do: one, they're harder, they're more complex; two, they ultimately need to be validated by the customer. So that's an area that we're very much focused on. 
So although it's going to be a challenge to work through, it's something that we're certainly focused on reducing and ultimately eliminating."

So I think we know high voltage is probably going to be your highest growth product, that and SVA. So at a group level, to what extent are you reallocating resources, whether it's kind of sales staff or CapEx or engineering to high voltage in SVA away from other product areas?

I mean, fortunately, we feel like we have a portfolio that's perfectly positioned across our 2 segments to pursue and win very profitable growth, whether that's active safety, whether it's user experience, whether that's high-voltage electrification or engineered components. 
And in certain areas, obviously, we make decisions about where we allocate more or less. I'd say as a business, we're at a point now, given the portfolio actions we've taken historically, where it's not pulling out of others, it's out of 1 product area and allocating to others, is quite frankly, incremental investment in areas where we see more growth. 
So high-voltage electrification is a great example. Last year, as we saw demand increase within our SPS business reporting to our SPS leader, we created effectively a high-voltage electrification product line. that includes a combination of what we do in our EDS business, in our Engineered Components business as well as in our Hellerman Titan Cable Management business, with a complete go-to-market, and we're aggressively looking for opportunities in and around power electronics, battery management systems, software, other areas that customers are asking us if we can provide them a more additive full system solution. 
So that's an area where we're adding resources in around smart vehicle architecture, both within those that sit within AS & UX, those that sit within EDS, we're both adding and reconfiguring how we operate, right, so that we have a more coordinated team that can develop products whether they flow through AS & UX and it's an ADAS solution that ultimately fits into our -- an ADAS platform that sits in our SVA solution or it's something in around battery management systems that gets up-integrated into the -- into SVA. 
So there are areas we're making incremental investments. There aren't areas other than the normal efficiency drives that we're taking investments away from. And a lot of what we're doing, Dan, quite frankly, is reconfiguring how we make sure 2 separate organizations are cooperating and working together to drive a product or build a product that goes across historical business lines."

So in a quarter -- and we've had this in the past, you're going to have it going the other way, too.

Despite these headwinds, which we expect to somewhat ease during the balance of the year, we're raising our outlook for the full year, driven by continued strong customer demand for our solutions, continuing our track record of outperformance and value creation for all stakeholders.  
Turning to Slide 4. Our updated 2021 outlook also reflects our flexible and sustainable business model, which positions us to support the record number of customer program launches that are driving incremental volume and market share gains this year, while mitigating the supply chain headwinds. As I mentioned, we expect the supply chain tightness to begin easing over the next few months, and we're happy with consumer demand levels, and our customers intend to make up as much of the first half production shortfalls as possible, which is the reason we've made no change to our outlook for growth in global vehicle production, which we still expect to be roughly 10% for the full year.  
At the same time, the demand for our portfolio of advanced technologies is benefiting from the acceleration of the safe, green and connected megatrends, which has led to an increase in our outlook for revenue growth and growth over market from 6% to approximately 10% for the year. Our team is diligently working to efficiently launch high-complexity programs in the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, while we also delivered on the launch of a record number of high-voltage electrification programs in our Signal and Power Solutions segment.  
That said, it will continue to be more expensive to operate in the current environment, as customers cancel production shifts in idle plants in response to supply chain constraints, creating temporary labor inefficiencies in our operations and input costs increase as a result of material shortages, both of which have been factored into our updated full year outlook. Our sourcing and commercial teams are actively pursuing recovery actions with suppliers and with customers, and our engineering teams are developing and validating product redesigns, providing access to incremental sources of supply and helping to offset the impact of increased input costs.  
Setting the near-term challenges aside, we're performing very well and continue to proactively position Aptiv for the future by investing in high-growth, high-margin technologies that further enhance the resiliency of our business and by leveraging our unique brain and nervous system capabilities to deliver more content on the electrified software-defined vehicles of the future, which, taken together, yield accretive growth opportunities on the path to the software-defined vehicle enabled through Smart Vehicle Architecture or SVA, as evidenced by our recent bookings and the size and quality of our new business pursuit pipeline.  
As shown on Slide 5, second quarter new business bookings reached $6 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to a record $11.2 billion. Our unique portfolio of advanced technologies, combined with our flawless operating execution, has positioned us as a partner of choice for our customers by enabling the transition to new architectures and software-defined features with our optimized solutions that enhance system's performance while also lowering the vehicle's total cost. Our brain and nervous system capabilities and holistic platform approach sets us apart, while global scale and execution capabilities have allowed us to increase our share of wallet with both traditional and emerging OEM customers and strengthen our overall competitive position, which you'll hear more about in our upcoming segment discussions.  
Turning to the highlights from our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment on Slide 6. Second quarter revenues increased 83%, 15 points over market, reflecting the benefit of new program launches and content gains, which translated into strong growth over market in our active safety product line and continued growth in our user experience and connectivity and security product lines despite the supply chain constraints impacting the segment. 
Consumers are demanding more safety and connectivity features in their vehicles, which are increasingly delivered through software enabled by more advanced sensing and compute platforms. This presents us with additional opportunities to increase our customer share of wallet. The evolution of feature-rich, more automated vehicles is playing out just as we planned. We anticipated our customers' needs and took the actions necessary to position Aptiv as a strong collaboration partner. 
As a result, we're experiencing firsthand the commercial validation of SVA with 9 advanced development programs underway or recently completed, which we're confident will lead to new customer awards during the next year. And a new business award during the second quarter from Great Wall Motors for the development of a central vehicle controller. This is a new high-performance compute platform that will first launch with Great Wall's Wey brand in 2023, which up-integrates critical body functions and controls the flow of data in and out of the vehicle, making it a first-to-market solution globally and also representing a key SVA commercial milestone.  
Moving to Slide 7. We're in a pivotal point in our industry's transition as consumers want more advanced features for safety, comfort and convenience. More stringent regulations regarding CO2 emissions and lower battery costs are accelerating the industry's move to high-voltage electrification. And 5G technology and the cloud are creating opportunities to deliver vehicles that leverage connectivity, even more than they do today, all of which is being enabled through a significant increase in the amount of software going into the vehicle, providing us with increased software content and new business model opportunities.  
To put the opportunity into context, the total automotive software market, which includes integration, feature development and validation and verification services, totals an estimated $30 billion today and is expected to grow to roughly $80 billion by 2030. This represents a significant opportunity for Aptiv. We're confident that we have a right to play across the full software stack with over 5,000 software engineers who successfully deploy advanced software solution across literally millions of vehicles with multiple OEM customers across the globe, including our advanced ADAS systems currently launching on the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wagoneer, which includes radar, camera, perception and feature software, enabling 360-degree sensing and scalable ADAS functionality through L2+, and, with the addition of in-cabin sensing technology, will also include hands-free active driving assist. 
We're also helping to enable L2+ ADAS system capabilities for Ford as well as other OEMs, with our scalable ADAS platform, which includes modular software building blocks and industry-leading perception systems. And lastly, Volvo's Polestar 2 was first to market with native Android automotive running Google Automotive Services. Aptiv's Android-based software and hardware platform powers this best-in-class infotainment system and enables real-time over-the-air updates. These examples underscore Aptiv's software and systems capabilities as well as our role as a partner of choice, delivering more advanced, higher-value, margin-accretive solutions to our customers.  
Turning to Slide 8. Our Signal and Power Solutions segment is the industry leader in high-speed, high-fidelity data transmission, multi-voltage electrical distribution and automotive-grade cable management and connection systems. Revenues increased 86% during the quarter, 18 points over market, driven by OEMs prioritizing the production of more highly contented vehicles as well as the increased production of high-voltage electrified vehicles resulting in increased demand for both our low-voltage and high-voltage architecture solutions and continued very strong demand for engineered components for applications in the automotive, commercial vehicle and industrial markets.  
We're well positioned to support our customers globally with a comprehensive portfolio of vehicle architecture solutions that leverage a high degree of vertical integration, which has translated into a significant increase in new business awards for high-voltage electrified platforms, where we've been able to design and deliver fully optimized vehicle architecture that provide up to a 40% reduction in weight and mass, significantly lowering the total system cost of an electrified vehicle platform, positioning us to have content of more than 50% of the battery electric vehicles launching over the next few years.  
In addition, several OEMs have asked us to help define their next-generation electrified vehicle architecture with advanced development programs, including a multi-voltage predevelopment partnership with a major German OEM on their premium electrified vehicle platform and development of the next-generation electrical architecture for a future battery electric vehicle platform with a major high-volume global OEM. These customer awards validate our leadership position, optimizing power and data distribution for new vehicle architectures that delivers significant value for our customers.  
Turning to Slide 9. In June, we hosted our virtual electrification teach-in, which showcased our industry-leading high- and low-voltage technology portfolio, the accelerated outlook for the EV market and how those translate into sustainable and profitable growth for Aptiv. The recent increased demand for electric vehicles has been encouraging, but it's nothing compared to what's on the horizon. As governments around the world fuel a green recovery, never has Aptiv's value proposition had more meaning than it does today.  
The European Union recently proposed regulations calling for zero CO2 emissions from vehicles by 2035, and the U.S. administration has recommended targets for significantly higher EV penetration, both of which are driving an increase in commercial activity. Every major global customer has announced an increase in pull forward of investment in the development of new electric vehicle platforms. And combined, OEMs are now targeting to launch over 400 vehicle programs between now and 2025, which has translated into a tenfold increase in business pursuit activity over the last few years.  
We've been quick to support our customers globally with high-voltage new business awards totaling $1.4 billion year-to-date and a clear line of sight to future awards. We now expect high-voltage bookings to exceed $2.5 billion for the year. That's an increase of 25% over our prior record of $2 billion. And we expect our high-voltage revenues to increase from just under $1 billion in '21 to over $2.5 billion in 2025, making high-voltage electrification our fastest-growing product segment.  
Our success has been driven by our end-to-end full system level capabilities, which enable a more efficient path to vehicle electrification. Our portfolio of advanced technologies enables faster charging, improved reliability, performance and packaging as well as increased safety and security, while optimization of the vehicle architecture design leads to reduced complexity, enables more flexible and scalable implementation and, as I mentioned, results in significant weight and cost savings on the path to full SVA, all of which is developed and delivered to our customers flawlessly due to our global scale and manufacturing excellence.  
Our industry-leading position in high-voltage electrification solutions positions us to pursue additional opportunities and deliver incremental value to customers through a much broader system level design and software solution. Moving to Slide 10. We're proud of the progress we've made on our enterprise-wide commitment to corporate social responsibility, which can be further explored in our 2021 Sustainability Report that was published in July. This year's report includes our sustainability strategy and 2025 commitments for each of our foundational pillars, which include people, product, planet and platform, and enhanced disclosures specifically around our approach to diversity, inclusion and human capital development, our path to carbon neutrality by 2040, our Lean 2.0 initiatives focused on product quality and execution and the governance and operating processes around our sustainability objectives.  
Our report also highlights the tremendous contributions made by our team during the pandemic and how each of us live the Aptiv values, thinking and acting like owners and always doing the right thing the right way. Through our team's resiliency and dedication, we've continued to deliver on our mission, creating product that helps transform society by saving lives, reducing carbon emissions and connecting people in new ways. 
We believe that our long-term success and ability to create value for our stakeholders are directly linked to building more sustainable business that continuously delivers on this mission and our strategy. As a result, we're proud to be an early adopter, linking our sustainability commitments with our bottom line and our recently amended credit facility, which Joe is going to cover in more detail shortly. And we fully understand that reaching our goals will take a comprehensive strategy, intense coordination and operating execution by all of our team members over a sustained period of time.  
So with that, I'll hand the call over to Joe to take us through the financials in more detail."

Starting with Slide 11, the recovery momentum in the second quarter generated strong results, despite the challenging environment Kevin referenced. Revenues of $3.8 billion were up 85%, 17% ahead of vehicle production, with strong market outgrowth in every region. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $498 million and $301 million, respectively, reflecting headwinds of $55 million of COVID safety and supply chain disruption costs and $80 million from FX, commodities and other input costs. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.60 and operating cash flow was strong at $297 million, driven by higher earnings despite increased inventory levels to support customer schedules.  
Looking at second quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 12. Broad demand recovery contributed to strong growth over market across regions. Favorable volumes and the impact of FX and commodities were partially offset by normal price downs in the quarter. From a regional perspective, North America revenues were up 154%, representing 24 points of growth over market, driven by the ramp in active safety launch volumes and favorable truck and SUV platform mix. In Europe, strong double-digit outgrowth of 37% was driven by robust customer launch activity and higher volumes in our high-voltage electrification and industrial product lines. Lastly, in China, revenues grew by 2% or 9 points over market, lapping last year's strong market recovery with outgrowth driven by the Engineered Components product line.  
Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues increased 83% in the quarter, reflecting 15 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, despite the semiconductor supply constraints. Segment EBITDA increased by $113 million, driven by higher sales volumes, partially offset by supply chain distribution -- I'm sorry, supply chain disruption and higher input costs. Signal and Power Solutions revenue were up 86%. Record growth was driven by broad-based recovery across the auto, commercial vehicle and industrial end markets and the ramping of high-voltage vehicle production. EBITDA in this segment increased by $443 million in the quarter on higher sales volume, partially offset by FX and commodities, primarily copper and additional costs and inefficiencies from the supply chain constraints and resulting disruptions to customer production schedules.  
Turning now to Slide 14 and our 2021 macro outlook. We continue to plan for global vehicle production to be up 10% for the year. As expected, the semiconductor constraints were more impactful in the second quarter due to the impact of the Naka fire and spring weather events. While ongoing challenges with semiconductor supply will continue to impact vehicle production, we believe we have adequately reflected these dynamics in our outlook for the second half, which estimates vehicle production to be down 4%, lapping last year's second half production snapback, which creates difficult comps in all regions.  
Accordingly, we expect second half production in North America to be flat, while Europe and China are expected to be down 5% and 10%, respectively. In summary, while the supply chain remains tight, we are working closely with customers and suppliers to optimize deliveries to meet customer's demand. Given continued variability in customer production schedules, we are not in a position to provide third quarter financial guidance. However, we are confident in our updated 2021 outlook reflected on Slide 15. 
We now expect revenue in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion, up 20% with 10 points of growth over market at the midpoint, 4 points higher than our prior guide, demonstrating the relevance and diversity of our portfolio and product lines. EBITDA and operating income are now expected to be $2.42 billion and $1.63 billion at the midpoint, with strong year-over-year sales conversion despite COVID and supply chain disruption costs, which are now estimated to be $250 million for the year, up $110 million over last year and FX, commodity and other rising input costs. Lastly, we expect earnings per share of $3.75 at the midpoint and operating cash flow of $1.8 billion. 
Turning to Slide 16. We thought it would be helpful to provide more detail on the full year guidance update compared to the initial guidance we provided back in February. Starting with the revenue walk on the left, our updated outlook reflects an increase of $455 million from growth above vehicle production as well as a $385 million tailwind from FX and commodities. EBITDA guidance has increased, driven by the $215 million benefit of higher growth and performance.  
However, the increase is offset by higher costs, approximately $70 million associated with managing through the supply chain disruptions and volatile customer production schedules. In addition, we are experiencing higher FX and commodity pricing, mainly copper, as well as increases in certain input costs, including semiconductors and resins pricing of $125 million versus our initial guidance. As it relates to these higher commodity price input costs, we have already started taking actions to offset and mitigate these headwinds. We believe it is prudent to assume that these costs are not transitory and will persist into future periods.  
In addition to passing along higher prices, where possible, including copper price escalations, we have a number of other initiatives, including supplier recovery strategies, engineering redesign and alternative source evaluations as well as engaging in commercial discussions with our customers. Moving to Slide 17. Sustainability is core to our business from the products we make to the way in which we operate. We are proud to be one of the first companies to integrate our targets into a financing structure that underscores our commitment to cleaner air and safer work environments. In June, we entered into an amended and restated $2 billion revolving credit facility utilizing our existing sustainability metrics and commitments.  
The amendment extends the maturity of the credit facility to 2026 and utilizes a pricing mechanism that lowers the borrowing rate, which we maintain throughout the term of the facility as long as we meet our previously published sustainability commitments, which include a decrease in Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 25% by 2025 and maintaining an industry-best lost workday case rate. The amended facility includes a debt-to-EBITDA leverage covenant of 3.5x with up to $750 million cash netting and flexibility to increase the aggregate borrowing capacity and leverage in connection with any future M&A activity.  
Turning to Slide 18. As we have discussed, our business model enables us to convert more income to cash, generating higher operating cash flow and free cash flow conversion. We expect operating cash flow of $1.8 billion in 2021, above 2019 levels, driven by higher earnings, partially offset by investments in inventory to support customer schedules. The decisive actions we've taken in the last few years to strengthen our capital structure has allowed us to maintain a strong balance sheet, while continuing our disciplined capital deployment track record, which is evidenced by the $12.6 billion deployed from 2015 through 2020, focused on value-enhancing investment opportunities.  
We continue to maintain a consistent approach aligned to our strategic framework that includes reinvesting in our growth businesses with high ROI CapEx investments largely to support new customer wins and the expansion of key growth product lines; enhancing our auto tech capabilities in software, artificial intelligence, machine learning and systems engineering; as well as continuing to increase scale and diversification in our Signal and Power Solutions segment. The consistent execution of our strategy, even in the face of today's challenges, is a major differentiator for Aptiv and an important lever for shareholder value generation going forward.  
With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."

No, we've seen, I would say, post-COVID with the acceleration on battery electric vehicles and customer demand for an increased portfolio of battery electric vehicles and acceleration of the work in and around SVA. I think the simple way to think about SVA, and we've always talked about it as a journey, right, starting with domain centralization, then moving to vehicle architecture simplification and then ultimately to kind of end-case SVA, which is post 2025. We break that down into 3 big product areas. And the first is zone controllers, and we've talked about the trend towards zone controllers. We've talked about our work and our actual commercial wins in and around zone controllers. 
The second is in and around advanced development programs for PDCs. The third would relate to the CVC win with Great Wall Motors. And then the fourth is in and around the OSP. So we feel like we've checked the box on 3 of the first 4 stages as it relates to SVA. The 4 stages at OSP -- we're in discussions with several OEMs regarding advanced development programs in that particular area. And what's really important is all those ADP programs ultimately translate into real commercial opportunities. And to the extent you're working closely and strategically with your customer, you're doing advanced development programs, you're helping them frame design of the vehicle, design of the architecture, both hardware and software, it puts you in a really good position to effectively be awarded the follow-on business.  
So a long-winded way of -- we've always described this as a journey. Sitting here today, we'd tell you it's accelerated from where we thought it would be from a customer demand standpoint, a little over a year ago. It's being driven by the trend towards battery electric vehicles and the opportunity to rethink vehicle architecture as your trend towards battery electric vehicles. And we're well positioned just given our history in domain controllers, given our history in vehicle architecture and our capabilities in and around zone controllers and our activities with OEMs, the ADP programs that we've had in and around PDCs, the award from Great Wall Motors on the CVC and the discussions we're now having with OEMs in and around the OSP. So we have wins today. We have revenue today if you were to think about the transition to SVA. But we think the real revenue opportunity is 2025 and beyond, as you see multiple OEMs rethinking vehicle architecture and a much bigger push towards battery electric vehicles."

When you look -- when you break down our current revenues and bookings, we've seen an acceleration of both bookings and revenue, and I'd characterize it in 2 areas. One, the newer battery electric vehicle manufacturers, some of which are more mature and have been around in North America, some that are a little less mature and are launching vehicles now in North America. And then a significant swing and probably a bigger mix change, quite frankly, in China with our new battery electric vehicle customers that tend to be more domestic. So to put it in perspective, 5 years ago, 20% of our revenues and bookings in China were with local OEMs. Today, it's closer to 30%.

I'm just thinking at a high level could you tell us is this something that you have a -- are you devoting resource to this in the aviation -- electric aviation market at this point? Curious your thoughts there, even if it's 10, 20 years out, I don't care. I think it's in alignment with your products and what they can do, but just love your view on that because some of the scenarios we're running, the number of things in the air could exceed the number of vehicles on earth. So I just wanted to know your opinion on that."

We haven't heard a lot about your kind of advanced digital cockpit user experience side of ASUX. So kind of a couple of questions there. Given there's less competition at the low end, how do you think about that segment in general? Two, when you sit down with a OEM -- legacy OEM CEO, who wants to get it into the modern world with EVs, does that conversation naturally go over to SVA digital cockpit and Level 2+ and ADAS? And are there synergies there? And then kind of, three, related to the whole software overlay in the car. Are there acquisitions you might be looking at similar to, say, what other multi-industrials have done to add a software footprint to their business?"

So I mean to frame it up, remember, we have a user experience business within our ASUX business that does, I don't know, round numbers, $1.7 billion of revenues and is growing at a fairly healthy clip this year. Previous period last year was affected by -- we exited the display business. So we had a headwind there. But it's growing very strong. Integrated cockpit controllers and that whole digital experience is a huge aspect of what we're doing from an SVA standpoint. ICC gets up-integrated as a part of our SVA solution. 
The whole in-cabin sensing is a very important aspect as it relates to advanced ADAS solutions, Brian. So in addition to the experience in the car, the user experience in the car, the in-cabin sensing necessary to advance to L2+ to L3 becomes increasingly important. And I think as we speak today, I think we're about to launch over the next 12 months on 3 or 4 in-cabin sensing programs that are tied to effectively ADAS capabilities. And I think in my prepared remarks, I referenced 1 OEM that as we are launching their ADAS solution now, the next phase of it is actually that fully integrated in-cabin sensing that allows them to further advance their driver assist capabilities. 
So it's extremely important, and it's a very important aspect as it relates to SVA. As it relates to software, yes, we're trying to be really smart in terms of where we focus our resources and capital. I think Joe has mentioned in the past that acquisitions in and around the software space that are additive to what we do today that help us further productize software or give us capabilities to develop incremental features, whether it's inside auto or outside auto is one of the areas that the team is very focused on. It's something that, obviously, we'd like to do, but it needs to make strategic business and financial sense, obviously."

Not clear at this point, obviously, I don't want to get into next year, how much of that margin mix will carry in. So there's a couple of moving pieces there. But it is real. It's not some sort of lot hold that's driving up back half. And we obviously had a very strong first half of growth over market as well. So I do think, certainly, we've been confident in that 6% to 8% for a long time. But just given the strength we're seeing again with the addition of sort of this margin mix that's going on as OEs really decide how best to allocate the -- effectively the semiconductors to platforms, it's obviously been a really good tailwind for us this year."

I think structurally set aside semiconductor shortages, resin tightness, things like that, the reality is L2, L2+ category within active safety is the fastest-growing segment and was predicted to be pre the current supply chain situation. So that obviously drives growth. It's -- consumers want safety. They pay for safety. And Joe's point, in a market like today's market where our customers need to be -- need to be -- I think need to make decisions about vehicle platforms they're building, they're focused on fully contented vehicle platform. So that's -- sure that's driving some benefit. But the underlying structural trend is towards more advanced ADAS systems, which an L2 system, for us, goes to an OEM for $1,000, $1,200. So it's a significant amount of revenue. 
The other piece though is high-voltage electrification. Our high-voltage electrification revenues will increase 60% this year. And we talked about in our prepared remarks going from under $1 billion in revenues to $2.5 billion in revenues based on our current bookings trajectory. And if you follow what they're driving in Europe from a CO2 emissions standpoint, the discussion out of the current administration here in the U.S. in terms of what they've liked commitments from North American OEMs to deliver from a battery electric vehicle standpoint, there will be a significant pull and demand for high voltage electrification, which we're perfectly positioned to benefit from."

I'd answer that. It's kind of a multilayered question. So when you separate or when you look at the current supply chain constraints, and if you want to say specific to semiconductors, but there are effects in other areas like resins, as an example, it's multilayered. One is just capacity versus demand. And in the semiconductor side and the resin side, we're seeing easing. We are seeing supply come in into the market being provided to IDMs. So -- and we're in daily contact with the semiconductor suppliers, the fab folks across the whole supply chain from a semiconductor standpoint. So that is improving. 
You have a situation where earlier in the year, you had bad weather in the Southwest. Joe referenced that. It impacted supply availability late Q1 and into Q2. You had the Naka fire in Japan in the first quarter that had implications for the second quarter. That situation is improving. Production is coming online. Not as fast as we'd like, but it's certainly improving. However, you're running into situations like today, where you have COVID challenges in Southeast Asia, most specifically today in Malaysia, that's interrupted production with some of the semiconductor suppliers. That is affecting availability of chips over the short term. That will impact schedules. 
We're watching Indonesia. We're watching Philippines. We're watching Singapore, Taiwan very closely. Those areas seem to be under control. But the supply chain is tight and any sort of event you see like COVID in Malaysia has an outsized impact relative to what typically would occur. So we'd say structurally, the situation is improving, but there's going to be periodic headwinds that we potentially run into due to things like COVID."

So is that to say that you're expecting some recoveries or efficiencies into the back half? And then I realize it's way too early to give any sort of definitive color on '22, but as we're thinking about the supply chain in '22, how does this influence the type of profile you'd get on incremental margins on any volume recovery?"

Listen, it's been -- it's obviously a very fluid situation, right? And to some extent, we -- in this quarter, we're just sort of talking about the COVID and supply chain costs on a combined basis because to some extent, they're starting to blur. If you're incurring a lot of premium freight getting parts out of the -- getting semiconductors out of Malaysia because the plant has been shut down with COVID, so where do you want to -- which one do you want to call that. 
But we actually have seen or have in some cases where we talked about $100 million of COVID costs for the year, running at $25 million a quarter. That's coming down a little bit, and it's just in some places and it's about -- that's come down about $20 million for the rest -- for the back half of the year. Really there, we're still spending what we need to on the personnel protection stuff, but some of the just inherent inefficiencies that came with, I'll say, the first take on social distancing and spacing out the plants and some of the inefficiencies that's created, the team has found better ways to manage through that. 
So some of those COVID costs have sort of eased a bit. Listen, it's -- we're obviously not going to speak to 2022. We have made the comments before, though. I would expect COVID costs certainly to continue into '22. And as I said, we're now expecting about $80 million of that for the full year. I think that would continue. You're clearly seeing vaccinations matter. And it's a little hard to call vaccination rates in all of the places where we do business. So I think out of an abundance of caution, we're certainly going to leave the employee protection costs in and spend that money until we're really comfortable we're not putting employees at risk. 
The supply chain disruption costs, those are directly tied to, in a lot of cases, premium freight, expedited manufacturing. There's obviously some inefficiencies now creeping into our plants as customers shut down for periods of time. And that's not -- we're not necessarily causing the shutdowns, but we're obviously impacted by them. And that impacts -- if you think about the indirect impact there, that impact SPS as well because as customers shut down lines for 3 or 4 days, we're obviously shutting down that part of the business as well. So I think those costs need to -- you need to sort of align those with how long you think the supply chain disruptions are going to continue."

To the extent supply comes in more normalized into the market, you see a pretty rapid reduction in premium freight and labor inefficiencies, right? Joe talked about it. We go through a really choppy production schedule now given what OEMs are doing from a production standpoint and very near-term announcements, which really don't allow us to flex labor as efficiently, and we're launching a number of programs in certain cases. 
To be honest, we're keeping extra labor to make sure as programs come back, we have trained hourly employees to actually launch those programs fastly. The second piece we're doing from an input standpoint, which Joe talked about, is something that we need to work through over a longer period of time. We have a supply chain operating committee that really does 2 things. One, supply chain and commercial specialists who are focused on both, one, day to day, how do we make sure that we keep customers connected with our suppliers; and then, two, longer term, what is it that we need to do strategically working with engineering.
And we have a number of engineering initiatives underway, I'd say close to 100, where we're redesigning products, changing out input costs or inputs to, one, provide additional incremental availability or capacity; but, two, to reduce overall expenses. Now those tend to take a little bit longer to do: one, they're harder, they're more complex; two, they ultimately need to be validated by the customer. So that's an area that we're very much focused on. So although it's going to be a challenge to work through, it's something that we're certainly focused on reducing and ultimately eliminating."

I think what we've seen over the years, both when you -- in your time in Aptiv, but also back to the Delphi days is that you're constantly -- you seem to be making calls how to allocate resources between the different product areas. So I think we know high voltage is probably going to be your highest growth product, that and SVA.

I mean, fortunately, we feel like we have a portfolio that's perfectly positioned across our 2 segments to pursue and win very profitable growth, whether that's active safety, whether it's user experience, whether that's high-voltage electrification or engineered components. And in certain areas, obviously, we make decisions about where we allocate more or less. I'd say as a business, we're at a point now, given the portfolio actions we've taken historically, where it's not pulling out of others. It's out of 1 product area and allocating to others, is quite frankly incremental investment in areas where we see more growth. 
So high-voltage electrification is a great example. Last year, as we saw demand increase within our SPS business reporting to our SPS leader, we created effectively a high-voltage electrification product line. That includes a combination of what we do in our EDS business, in our Engineered Components business as well as in our HellermannTyton cable management business, with a complete go-to-market, and we're aggressively looking for opportunities in and around power electronics, battery management systems, software, other areas that customers are asking us if we can provide them a more additive full system solution. 
So that's an area where we're adding resources in around smart vehicle architecture, both within -- those that sit within ASUX, those that sit within EDS. We're both adding and reconfiguring how we operate, right, so that we have a more coordinated team that can develop products whether they flow through ASUX and is an ADAS solution that ultimately fits into our -- an ADAS platform that sits in our SVA solution or it's something in around battery management systems that gets up-integrated into the -- into SVA. So there are areas we're making incremental investments. There aren't areas other than the normal efficiency drives that we're taking investments away from. And a lot of what we're doing, Dan, quite frankly, is reconfiguring how we make sure 2 separate organizations are cooperating and working together to drive a product or build a product that goes across historical business lines."

Thank you, Vicky, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Beginning on Slide 3. We experienced continued strong demand across the portfolio in the third quarter despite continued supply chain constraints negatively impacting vehicle p",1272,"Sure. Thank you, Vicky, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. 
Beginning on Slide 3. 
We experienced continued strong demand across the portfolio in the third quarter despite continued supply chain constraints negatively impacting vehicle production. Revenues of $3.7 billion declined 5% versus the prior year, with a record 18 points of growth over market. New business awards of $5.8 billion bring the year-to-date total to a record $17 billion, reflecting the relevance of our product portfolio as well as the trust our customers have on Aptiv, given our success executing for them in this challenging environment. Operating income and earnings per share totaled $219 million and $0.38, respectively, negatively impacted by the significant headwinds from the ongoing supply chain tightness and the downstream impacts that Joe will cover in greater detail shortly. While we expect vehicle production to improve on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the headwinds related to supply chain constraints to persist well into 2022. 
Setting the near-term challenges aside, the team is executing well and continues to proactively position Aptiv for the future, optimizing our cost structure, while investing in high-growth, high-margin technologies that further enhance the resiliency of our business model, translating into greater value for both our customers and our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 4. 
The relentless execution of our strategy over the past decade has positioned Aptiv as a more sustainable business, creating over $40 billion of value since our IPO in 2011. This represents an average annual return to shareholders of over 25% and a total return of more than 950% to date. 
As we transformed Aptiv, we built an industry-leading portfolio of advanced solutions that make vehicles safe, green and more connected. To drive this transformation, we took several actions, including making smart portfolio moves to put further operating leverage in our business model. We exited low growth, low-margin product lines and spun off our Powertrain segment positioning Aptiv to focus on our unique capabilities around the brain and nervous system of the vehicle. At the same time, we completed a number of acquisitions which enabled our software and data management capabilities, increased our scale and leverage in engineered components and expanded our presence in adjacent markets. Last year, we established Motional, our autonomous driving joint venture with Hyundai, which will be operating fully driverless vehicles on the Lyft ridesharing network in 2023. 
These proactive actions perfectly position Aptiv to benefit from the transition to the software-defined vehicle, while further increasing the robustness of our business model, all of which translates into continued outperformance and long-term value creation. 
Turning to Slide 5. 
We continue to successfully navigate the current challenging environment while proactively enhancing the strength of our competitive position. Our supply chain resiliency team is leveraging technology data and analytics to stress test our integrated supply chain network under multiple scenarios, helping us to proactively identify and address potential bottlenecks. At the same time, we're working through daily constraints by leveraging our proven cross-functional crisis management process. Our planning process and manufacturing have enabled us to support a record number of customer program launches. And we continue the intelligent automation of our manufacturing facilities to lower operating costs and increase product quality. All of which improves customer service levels. 
Our engineering teams are proactively redesigning products to mitigate semiconductor supply risks, reduce material costs and increased functionality for our customers. And lastly, our culture of continuous improvement translates into the constant pursuit of opportunities to reduce costs and improve quality, enabling us to continue to strengthen our operating foundation and transform our business model despite the dynamic environment. 
As shown on Slide 6, third quarter new business bookings reached $5.8 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to $17 billion. As I already mentioned, it was a record. Our unique portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies, combined with our flawless operating execution, continues to position Aptiv as a partner of choice for our customers. Our capabilities around the vehicle brain and nervous system and collaborative approach to platform solutions sets us apart in the industry, enabling us to conceive, specify and deliver advanced architecture and software solutions that enhance systems performance while lowering the vehicle's total cost, positioning us to increase our share of wallet with both traditional and emerging OEM customers, and at the same time, strengthen our overall competitive position. 
Turning to highlights from our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment on Slide 7. 
Third quarter revenues declined 7%, which was 16 points better than the reduction in global vehicle production. New program launches, content increases and market share gains translated into continued market outgrowth despite the significant supply chain disruptions impacting the segment. 
Consumers continue to demand more active safety and connectivity features in their vehicles, which are delivered through more advanced software features, leveraging the latest sensing and compute solutions. This trend in strong consumer demand and our industry-leading capabilities presents us with additional market share opportunities and the ability to increase our customer share of wallet, and as evidenced by our third quarter Conquest business award with Mercedes Benz to provide our multipurpose interior sensing solutions on their next-gen electric vehicle platform. 
This business award builds on our recent in-cabin monitoring successes and advances our customers' roadmap of interior sensing features by further enhancing driver safety and improving the in-cabin user experience. The evolution of in-cabin sensing is playing out as expected. And our leadership position makes Aptiv a strong collaboration partner for our customers. 
Turning to Slide 8. 
Revenues in our Signal and Power Solutions segment declined 4% during the quarter, 19 points better than the reduction in global vehicle production, reflecting the continued benefit from the acceleration in the production of electrified vehicles, resulting in greater demand for our high-voltage solutions, and the continued strong demand for connector and cable management products for both automotive and non-automotive market applications. 
We are the industry leader in electrical distribution systems, with the engineering capabilities and global manufacturing scale necessary to rapidly build customer -- rapidly bring customers to market as they quickly adapt to the accelerating macro trends. A great example is our recent business awards for Stellantis, an extension to our existing business to support design changes and content increases on the Ram truck. It was another strong quarter for our Signal and Power Solutions segment in a very challenging environment. 
Slide 9 provides an overview of some of the specific areas where we're focusing our software development capabilities. 
As we've mentioned previously, our OEM customers are beginning to decouple software from the underlying hardware, both technically as they implement smart vehicle architecture and in how they source new programs. Our leading position in the design and development of high-performance, cost optimized, automotive-grade hardware as well as deep software development capabilities allows us to provide industry-leading interior and exterior perception solutions, modular software and features that lower system costs and accelerate speed to market through higher reuse; middleware solutions, which support up integration and the serverization of compute; vehicle life cycle management through data collection and data analytics; and full vehicle level integration, testing and validation services. These capabilities, along with extensive collaboration with our customers and our supplier partners, allows us to continue to be a partner of choice for our customers across literally all vehicle domains, enable our customers to offer greater flexibility for end-user differentiation and personalization, and further strengthen our competitive position as a leading provider of smart vehicle architecture that accelerates the transition to the fully electrified software-defined vehicle. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Joe to take us through the financials in more detail."

Starting on Slide 10. 
The business continued to outperform the market despite the challenging environment Kevin referenced. Revenues of $3.7 million were down 5%, with record 18% growth over market and market outgrowth in every region. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $412 million and $219 million, respectively, reflecting year-over-year headwinds, primarily COVID and supply chain disruption costs of $55 million and $40 million from FX, commodities and input costs. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.38 and operating cash flow was $4 million, reflecting higher inventory levels resulting from customer schedule reductions and longer lead time requirements from certain suppliers as well as the lower earnings level. 
Looking at the third quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 11. 
We continued to experience demand for higher contented vehicles driving strong growth over market across all regions despite lower vehicle production levels. Favorable FX and commodity movements were offset by lower production volumes in the quarter. 
From a regional perspective, North America revenues were down 7%, representing 16 points of growth over market, driven by the ramp in active safety launch volumes and a favorable truck and SUV platform mix. In Europe, strong double-digit outgrowth of 19% due to robust customer launch activity and higher volumes in our high-voltage electrification product line. Lastly, in China, revenues reflecting 17 points of growth over market, resulting from growth with leading local OEMs and strong high-voltage growth. 
Moving to the segments on the next slide. 
Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues fell 7% in the quarter, translating to 16 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, including strong growth in active safety and somewhat lower market outgrowth and user experience, driven by the timing of new program launches. Segment EBITDA was down $46 million, driven by supply chain disruption and higher input costs, primarily related to semiconductors. 
Signal and Power Solutions revenues were down 4%, representing 19% growth over market. The market outperformance was driven by a continued strength in our high-voltage product portfolio as well as strong outgrowth in commercial vehicle and industrial end markets. EBITDA in the segment was down $123 million in the quarter on lower sales volumes and additional costs from supply chain disruptions and higher FX commodities and input costs. 
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year on the next slide. 
Our revenues and operating margin remain unchanged from the outlook we provided in mid-October. We continue to expect revenue in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion, up over 10% compared to the prior year. We expect global vehicle production to be roughly flat for the full year, translating into over 10 points of growth above market, demonstrating the relevance and diversity of our portfolio and product lines. EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $2 billion and $1.2 billion at the midpoint, with strong year-over-year sales volume conversion. Despite further COVID and supply chain disruption costs, which are now estimated to be $310 million for the year, up $170 million over the prior year, and FX, commodity and other rising input costs of $195 million, mainly driven by semiconductor and resin pricing. Product line level margins continue to be aligned with our expectations, validating the strength of our market -- of our portfolio of market-relevant technologies. Lastly, we expect earnings per share of $2.55 at the midpoint and operating cash flow of $1.2 billion. 
Turning to Slide 14. 
As we have discussed, the combined benefits of our strong product portfolio and robust business model enable us to convert more income to cash, generating higher operating cash flow. We now expect operating cash flow of $1.2 billion in 2021, driven by increased earnings, offset by higher inventory investment and continued investments in growth. 
As you can see in the middle of the slide, we ended the third quarter with $2.7 billion in total cash, enabling us to manage through the current environment, while supporting record year-to-date new business awards and launch activity. Lastly, our investment in working capital helps ensure we are ready to keep our customers running in this challenging environment, making Aptiv a key partner of choice. 
Turning to Slide 15. 
Despite the variability and lack of forward visibility in customer production schedules, we wanted to provide some initial thoughts on the outlook for 2022. We continue to believe that the supply chain disruptions will impact overall vehicle production levels in the coming year, particularly in the first half of 2022. Despite these challenges, our strategy remains unchanged. And we believe we are very well positioned to lead the continued transition to higher contented, software-enabled vehicles, with increasing levels of active safety and powertrain electrification. Although it is still early in the planning process for 2022, we are confident in our ability to outgrow the market, driven by continued acceleration of the safe, green and connected megatrends. With that said, we do believe 2022 vehicle production will be impacted by supply chain constraints and that the industry will not return to pre-pandemic production levels until post 2022. As it relates to material input costs, we continue to make traction on our mitigation initiatives, including supplier recovery strategies, engineering redesign and alternative source evaluations, as well as engaging in commercial discussions with our customers. Although we will see some benefit from these initiatives, it is unlikely that the full impact of the elevated input costs are offset in the coming year. Additional costs related to supply chain disruptions, including elevated transportation and freight costs, as well as the costs associated with the intermittent production disruptions, will continue into next year. As we have discussed, these costs are not structural in nature and will ease as supply chains and material availability improve over the course of 2022. 
Finally, the actions we have taken over the prior years to drive underlying product line profitability and establish the company's strong financial position will allow us to continue to invest in new technologies, both organically and inorganically, while supporting our new business pursuit activities. As we have consistently demonstrated, these investments will ensure that we continue to deliver disciplined revenue growth well beyond 2022 and the current industry operating challenges. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."

While near-term headwinds are expected to persist into 2022, as Joe has mentioned, we remain confident in our product portfolio aligned to the safe, green and connected megatrends. 
As we reflect on our recent operating performance, it's clear to us that our relentless focus on innovation and flawless execution is allowing us to better support our customers and is resulting in increased momentum related to new business bookings and strong market outgrowth, a further widening of our competitive moat and a continued strong track record of delivering sustainable value creation. 
As I mentioned at the start of our presentation, Aptiv has been on an exciting journey these last 10 years, but the team is even more excited about what we'll deliver over the next decade.

Q3, I think, obviously, a very challenging quarter from a decremental perspective. Really, there's a couple of things driving that. And I'll start by -- obviously, this is very lumpy when you just look at a one-off quarter. I'd say there's 2 real drivers, right? We saw volume fall off significantly in the back half of Q3. Year-over-year, our view of vehicle production is will be flat to 2020, but the back half is going to be down by a little over 20%. So there's a lot of volume coming out quickly. Obviously, there's only so much you can do with the cost structure given such the short period of time that it's come down. But we have continued to incur the supply chain disruption costs. So you've got not only revenue coming down quickly, but you've got a fair amount of supply chain disruption costs that are hitting in the quarter and will hit in the back half of the year. So the quarter had a sharp decremental. I think if you took a step back and looked at the full year, I think we're much more in line with our typical ranges of where we think incrementals and decrementals are and what we've historically talked about, sort of that incremental of 18% to 22% and decrementals of sort of 25% to 30%, again, depending on how quickly volume comes down. So for the full year, I think the incrementals are generally in line with that. We're obviously picking up an impact from the overall supply chain-related disruptions, but much more in line with where we'd historically expect the business. But it's -- I think in a given quarter, particularly when you see the sharp moves in volume, and this isn't different from what we saw actually during COVID last year. We are going to run heavier on those decrementals. And again, it applies to -- it really applies to both segments."

I would break our activities to offset into 4, 4 or 5 buckets. So as we always do, we're constantly reassessing, reevaluating our cost structure and looking for opportunities, both within supply chain, outside of supply chain to further reduce costs. We're in active negotiations with the supply base. Situations like this, I guess one of the side benefits is becoming much more strategic with your customers as it relates to supply chain as well as more strategic with your supply base, which translates into, quite frankly, fewer supplier relationships, deeper supplier relationships, more strategic supplier relationships, which provide you with the opportunity to further optimize the supply chain and reduce costs. I think in the past, we've talked about over 100 program or product redesign activities that we have underway, where we're substituting alternative inputs to platform solutions that will further lower those costs. And lastly, but equally important, we're having active discussions with all of our customers with respect to the cost of doing business in today's environment and the support we've provided to ensure that they remain connected from a supply standpoint. So those would be the 4 major buckets I would categorize things in. I would say as it relates to cost and cost structure, and it's important, consistent with past, we continue to invest in growth opportunities, technologies that support growth opportunities in areas like software, in areas like active safety, in areas like high-voltage electrification. And I think it's important to continue to do so, even in light of the decremental margins that you talk about due to production interruptions."

And a bigger push for greater visibility from customer to supplier, a better understanding or visibility to sub-suppliers in capacity, more committed volumes from the OEM down to the supply base so that capital is more effectively deployed, and then a trade-off of the -- with that increased visibility, the reality is there will be areas where there will be more investment in inventory, but there'll be other areas where there'll be less. So how that offsets is probably a little difficult to estimate at this point in time. But near term, it likely translates into more inventory. And I think the question is just how much in a conclusion that on certain parts or certain products, without committed volumes, JIT inventory management doesn't work for certain parts. 
Joe?"

So Joe, I mean on CapEx, there was a small push into next year. I think we're -- I think that 5% as an overall range is still good. There's been years where we've been a little under. There'll be years where we're a little over by -- but not more than 0.5 percentage point. So I still think 5% is a good proxy. There has been a little movement around just as we work through some of the disruptions in the volume come back, but I wouldn't say that's a material change. 
On inventory, to Kevin's point, I think we're learning a lot. There is a fair amount -- if you just looked at sort of normalized our inventory, about half of the increased balance is -- I would sort of describe as really transactional. Production came down really fast in the back half of Q3. We were obviously -- given the lead times, we were -- we had inventory on hand to produce to the original schedules. So that half, I would describe, as more transactional, right? Volume came down. We have higher inventory levels. We tend to be -- we tend to use the same inventory. If you think about what we make, resins for connectors, the electric distribution business, the chips we'll use to the extent we have them. So it's more of a timing related to the production slowdowns for about half that balance. 
To Kevin's point on the remaining balance, there is inventory on hand. Because lead times have extended, we're focused on making sure we have stock. In some cases, you're -- if you got a product that has 350 parts and you're waiting for one chip, you tend to have the other 349 in stocks, so you're ready to go once you get that chip. So there's that type. But certainly, the full investment that you see on the balance sheet now, I would not think is a -- is representative of the investment that needs to be made going forward. To Kevin's point, there probably will be some, but it's not going to be at that level. That was -- half of that was really the production disruptions."

I think, by and large, every participant in the supply chain is reevaluating their role and potentially what they can do differently. Having spoken now several times to the leaders of all the semiconductor companies, one of the critical items that needs to be addressed is committed volumes, right? When you look at an industry that is highly capital intensive, predictability of production is extremely important. And it gets compounded in an industry with long lead times that's currently constrained. So however, we transition to more of a committed volume model, at least for the medium term, whether that's operating the way we historically operated, with tiers being the primary face to the semiconductor players, or it's OEMs working with the semiconductor players as well as the tiers, either can solve that problem. I think for us, for Aptiv, we'll be flexible to operate in either scenario. I would say the one thing that will be different as we move forward is, certainly, more strategic relationships on the semiconductor side, which likely translates into deeper relationships, fewer semiconductor relationships that drive more volume and a more strategic relationship, both from a technology and a supply chain standpoint."

As I said in my comments, we're really -- it's very early days to be doing that. But from our perspective, and we've talked about this, the -- certainly, the COVID and the supply chain-related disruption costs, we do not view as structural. We think those are very much driven by the events of the day. And as I said in my prepared comments, as supply chain and material flow returns to normal, we'd expect those costs to go -- to start to go away as well. 
If you look at 2021, I think it's a good proxy. We've historically talked about incremental margins on the OI line between 18% and 22%. This year, we'll be at 16%, carrying $300-plus million of supply chain and COVID-related costs. So if you backed out that $300 million, we'd be closer to 24%. So very much within the historical range and the expected range when you adjust for the COVID and the supply chain-related disruption costs. Now we -- as we said even last quarter, we're not treating the inflation as transitory, the $195 million. So I wouldn't -- I'm not going to add that back. But I'd really focus on -- we get back into that 18% to 22% range with -- we're just adjusting for those COVID costs. 
The other thing I'd mention, we've got about $600 million. Again, we backed this out of the adjusted growth rate. But there's about $600 million of incremental volume from commodity and FX that has a negative flow on it, right? So we've often talked about copper impacting margin rate, but it also obviously impacts the incremental rate. So again, just something to think about as you're working through the math. 
Right now, we see full year material inflation of about $195 million. A lot of that is come in the back half of the year. I think the back half run rate is probably at least indicative of what we're managing for 2022. Again, I'm not going to speak to how much we're able to offset. But certainly start with that $195 million we're talking about, that full year number is certainly what we're working on at the moment."

I think we would tell you, based on our discussion with all those players, the reality is there are certain areas that are growing rapidly in a car from a content standpoint, like software. And I think both in the software area and the hardware area, OEMs, whether they're new OEMs or legacy OEMs, in reality, you're going to be dealing with fewer suppliers. And a couple of the newer -- the battery electric vehicle companies that we have a relationship with, what they'll actually say is more of the activity is actually outsourced from a dollar standpoint today, but they're actually dealing with doing that with fewer suppliers.

So as you know, we have Motional, which is our joint venture with the Hyundai Motor Group, which is doing extremely well, has driverless vehicles being tested on roads today in Las Vegas and elsewhere. And we'll have fully driverless vehicles as a part of the Lyft network in 2023. So from a business standpoint, they're doing -- and technology advancement standpoint, the team there is doing extremely well. 
A couple of comments broadly on AV. As you know, we've always viewed autonomous driving as the further spectrum of full ADAS solutions. And we use our partnership with Motional as an opportunity to continue to test, to validate, to future-proof technology that we can pull into our current ADAS solutions. And that's what we continue to do. We feel like at Aptiv, this is Aptiv, there's a lot of opportunity that remains in the L0 to L3 sort of ADAS framework. 60% of -- less than 60% of vehicles today have an ADAS solution on them. If you believe IHS, they forecast, that increases to 70% by 2025. We actually believe it will be more than that. And the fastest-growing area will be on L2 and L2+ I would tell you, that's our biggest focus area. Having said that -- and we're using Motional as a resource to enhance the solutions that we use in the L2, L2+ sort of space. And then concurrently, we're working with Motional as well as have internal resources focused on L3 and beyond. Our view is that's -- from a cost or commercial standpoint, that's likely beyond 2025, but it's certainly technology that we're focused on, and it's a capability we want to make sure that we're positioned to have."

Thank you, Vicky, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.  Beginning on Slide 3.  We experienced continued strong demand across the portfolio in the third quarter despite continued supply chain constraints negatively impacting vehicle p",1272,"Sure. Thank you, Vicky, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.  
Beginning on Slide 3.  We experienced continued strong demand across the portfolio in the third quarter despite continued supply chain constraints negatively impacting vehicle production. Revenues of $3.7 billion declined 5% versus the prior year, with a record 18 points of growth over market. 
New business awards of $5.8 billion bringing the year-to-date total to a record $17 billion, reflecting the relevance of our product portfolio as well as the trust our customers have on Aptiv, given our success executing for them in this challenging environment. 
Operating income and earnings per share totaled $219 million and $0.38, respectively, negatively impacted by the significant headwinds from the ongoing supply chain tightness and the downstream impacts that Joe will cover in greater detail shortly.  
While we expect vehicle production to improve on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the headwinds related to supply chain constraints to persist well into 2022.  
Setting the near-term challenges aside, the team is executing well and continues to proactively position Aptiv for the future, optimizing our cost structure, while investing in high-growth, high-margin technologies that further enhance the resiliency of our business model, translating into greater value for both our customers and our shareholders.  
Moving to Slide 4.  The relentless execution of our strategy over the past decade has positioned Aptiv as a more sustainable business, creating over $40 billion of value since our IPO in 2011. This represents an average annual return to shareholders of over 25% and a total return of more than 950% to date.  
As we transformed Aptiv, we built an industry-leading portfolio of advanced solutions that make vehicles safe, green and more connected. To drive this transformation, we took several actions, including making smart portfolio moves to put further operating leverage in our business model. We exited low growth, low-margin product lines and spun off our Powertrain segment positioning Aptiv to focus on our unique capabilities around the brain and nervous system of the vehicle. 
At the same time, we completed a number of acquisitions which enabled our software and data management capabilities, increased our scale and leverage in engineered components and expanded our presence in adjacent markets. 
Last year, we established Motional, our autonomous driving joint venture with Hyundai, which will be operating fully driverless vehicles on the Lyft ridesharing network in 2023. 
These proactive actions perfectly position Aptiv to benefit from the transition to the software-defined vehicle, while further increasing the robustness of our business model, all of which translates into continued outperformance and long-term value creation.  
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to successfully navigate the current challenging environment while proactively enhancing the strength of our competitive position. Our supply chain resiliency team is leveraging technology data and analytics to stress test our integrated supply chain network under multiple scenarios, helping us to proactively identify and address potential bottlenecks. At the same time, we're working through daily constraints by leveraging our proven cross-functional crisis management process. 
Our planning process and manufacturing have enabled us to support a record number of customer program launches. And we continue the intelligent automation of our manufacturing facilities to lower operating costs and increase product quality. All of which improves customer service levels.  
Our engineering teams are proactively redesigning products to mitigate semiconductor supply risks, reduce material costs and increased functionality for our customers. And lastly, our culture of continuous improvement translates into the constant pursuit of opportunities to reduce costs and improve quality, enabling us to continue to strengthen our operating foundation and transform our business model despite the dynamic environment.  
As shown on Slide 6, third quarter new business bookings reached $5.8 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to $17 billion. As I already mentioned, it was a record. Our unique portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies, combined with our flawless operating execution, continues to position Aptiv as a partner of choice for our customers. 
Our capabilities around the vehicle brain and nervous system and collaborative approach to platform solutions sets us apart in the industry, enabling us to conceive, specify and deliver advanced architecture and software solutions that enhance systems performance while lowering the vehicle's total cost, positioning us to increase our share of wallet with both traditional and emerging OEM customers, and at the same time, strengthen our overall competitive position.  
Turning to highlights from our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment on Slide 7.  Third quarter revenues declined 7%, which was 16 points better than the reduction in global vehicle production. New program launches, content increases and market share gains translated into continued market outgrowth despite the significant supply chain disruptions impacting the segment.  
Consumers continue to demand more active safety and connectivity features in their vehicles, which are delivered through more advanced software features, leveraging the latest sensing and compute solutions. This trend in strong consumer demand and our industry-leading capabilities presents us with additional market share opportunities and the ability to increase our customer share of wallet, and as evidenced by our third quarter conquest business award with Mercedes Benz to provide our multipurpose interior sensing solutions on their next-gen electric vehicle platform.  
This business award builds on our recent in-cabin monitoring successes and advances our customers' roadmap of interior sensing features by further enhancing driver safety and improving the in-cabin user experience. The evolution of in-cabin sensing is playing out as expected. And our leadership position makes Aptiv a strong collaboration partner for our customers.  
Turning to Slide 8.  Revenues in our Signal and Power Solutions segment declined 4% during the quarter, 19 points better than the reduction in global vehicle production, reflecting the continued benefit from the acceleration in the production of electrified vehicles, resulting in greater demand for our high-voltage solutions, and the continued strong demand for connector and cable management products for both automotive and non-automotive market applications.  
We are the industry leader in electrical distribution systems, with the engineering capabilities and global manufacturing scale necessary to rapidly build customer -- rapidly bring customers to market as they quickly adapt to the accelerating macro trends. A great example is our recent business awards for Stellantis, an extension to our existing business to support design changes and content increases on the Ram truck. It was another strong quarter for our Signal and Power Solutions segment in a very challenging environment.  
Slide 9 provides an overview of some of the specific areas where we're focusing our software development capabilities.  
As we've mentioned previously, our OEM customers are beginning to decouple software from the underlying hardware, both technically as they implement smart vehicle architecture and in how they source new programs. Our leading position in the design and development of high-performance, cost optimized, automotive-grade hardware as well as deep software development capabilities allows us to provide industry-leading interior and exterior perception solutions. 
Modular software and features that lower system costs and accelerate speed to market through higher reuse; middleware solutions, which support up integration and the serverization of compute; vehicle life cycle management through data collection and data analytics; and full vehicle level integration, testing and validation services. 
These capabilities, along with extensive collaboration with our customers and our supplier partners, allows us to continue to be a partner of choice for our customers across literally all vehicle domains, enable our customers to offer greater flexibility for end-user differentiation and personalization, and further strengthen our competitive position as a leading provider of smart vehicle architecture that accelerates the transition to the fully electrified software-defined vehicle.  
With that, I'll hand the call over to Joe to take us through the financials in more detail."

Starting on Slide 10.  The business continued to outperform the market despite the challenging environment Kevin referenced. Revenues of $3.7 million were down 5%, with record 18% growth over market and market outgrowth in every region. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $412 million and $219 million, respectively, reflecting year-over-year headwinds, primarily COVID and supply chain disruption costs of $55 million and $40 million from FX, commodities and input costs. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.38 and operating cash flow was $4 million, reflecting higher inventory levels resulting from customer schedule reductions and longer lead time requirements from certain suppliers as well as the lower earnings level.  
Looking at the third quarter revenues in more detail on Slide 11.  We continued to experience demand for higher contented vehicles driving strong growth over market across all regions despite lower vehicle production levels. Favorable FX and commodity movements were offset by lower production volumes in the quarter.  
From a regional perspective, North America revenues were down 7%, representing 16 points of growth over market, driven by the ramp in active safety launch volumes and a favorable truck and SUV platform mix. In Europe, strong double-digit outgrowth of 19% due to robust customer launch activity and higher volumes in our high-voltage electrification product line. Lastly, in China, revenues reflecting 17 points of growth over market, resulting from growth with leading local OEMs and strong on high-voltage growth.  
Moving to the segments on the next slide.  Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues fell 7% in the quarter, translating to 16 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, including strong growth in active safety and somewhat lower market outgrowth and user experience, driven by the timing of new program launches. Segment EBITDA was down $46 million, driven by supply chain disruption and higher input costs, primarily related to semiconductors.  
Signal and Power Solutions revenues were down 4%, representing 19% growth over market. The market outperformance was driven by a continued strength in our high-voltage product portfolio as well as strong outgrowth in commercial vehicle and industrial end markets. EBITDA in the segment was down $123 million in the quarter on lower sales volumes and additional costs from supply chain disruptions and higher FX commodities and input costs.  
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year on the next slide.  Our revenues and operating margin remain unchanged from the outlook we provided in mid-October. We continue to expect revenue in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion, up over 10% compared to the prior year. We expect global vehicle production to be roughly flat for the full year, translating into over 10 points of growth above market, demonstrating the relevance and diversity of our portfolio and product lines. EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $2 billion and $1.2 billion at the midpoint, with strong year-over-year sales volume conversion.  
Despite further COVID and supply chain disruption costs, which are now estimated to be $310 million for the year, up $170 million over the prior year, and FX, commodity and other rising input costs of $195 million, mainly driven by semiconductor and resin pricing. Product line level margins continue to be aligned with our expectations, validating the strength of our market -- of our portfolio of market-relevant technologies. Lastly, we expect earnings per share of $2.55 at the midpoint and operating cash flow of $1.2 billion.  
Turning to Slide 14.  As we have discussed, the combined benefits of our strong product portfolio and robust business model enable us to convert more income to cash, generating higher operating cash flow. We now expect operating cash flow of $1.2 billion in 2021, driven by increased earnings, offset by higher inventory investment and continued investments in growth.  
As you can see in the middle of the slide, we ended the third quarter with $2.7 billion in total cash, enabling us to manage through the current environment, while supporting record year-to-date new business awards and launch activity. Lastly, our investment in working capital helps ensure we are ready to keep our customers running in this challenging environment, making Aptiv a key partner of choice.  
Turning to Slide 15. Despite the variability and lack of forward visibility in customer production schedules, we wanted to provide some initial thoughts on the outlook for 2022. We continue to believe that the supply chain disruptions will impact overall vehicle production levels in the coming year, particularly in the first half of 2022. Despite these challenges, our strategy remains unchanged. 
And we believe we are very well positioned to lead the continued transition to higher contented, software-enabled vehicles, with increasing levels of active safety and Powertrain electrification. Although it is still early in the planning process for 2022, we are confident in our ability to outgrow the market, driven by continued acceleration of the safe, green and connected megatrends. 
With that said, we do believe 2022 vehicle production will be impacted by supply chain constraints and that the industry will not return to pre-pandemic production levels until post 2022. As it relates to material input costs, we continue to make traction on our mitigation initiatives, including supplier recovery strategies, engineering redesign and alternative source evaluations, as well as engaging in commercial discussions with our customers. Although we will see some benefit from these initiatives, it is unlikely that the full impact of the elevated input costs are offset in the coming year. 
Additional costs related to supply chain disruptions, including elevated transportation and freight costs, as well as the costs associated with the intermittent production disruptions, will continue into next year. As we have discussed, these costs are not structural in nature and will ease as supply chains and material availability improve over the course of 2022.  
Finally, the actions we have taken over the prior years to drive underlying product line profitability and establish the company's strong financial position will allow us to continue to invest in new technologies, both organically and inorganically, while supporting our new business pursuit activities. As we have consistently demonstrated, these investments will ensure that we continue to deliver disciplined revenue growth well beyond 2022 and the current industry operating challenges.  
With that, I'll turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."

Q3, I think, obviously, a very challenging quarter from a decremental perspective. Really, there's a couple of things driving that. And I'll start by -- obviously, this is very lumpy when you just look at a one-off quarter. I'd say there's 2 real drivers, right? We saw volume fall off significantly in the back half of Q3. 
Year-over-year, our view of vehicle production is will be flat to 2020, but the back half is going to be down by a little over 20%. So there's a lot of volume coming out quickly. Obviously, there's only so much you can do with the cost structure given such the short period of time that it's come down. 
But we have continued to incur the supply chain disruption costs. So you've got not only revenue coming down quickly, but you've got a fair amount of supply chain disruption costs that are hitting in the quarter and will hit in the back half of the year. So the quarter had a sharp decremental. 
I think if you took a step back and looked at the full year, I think we're much more in line with our typical ranges of where we think incrementals and decrementals are and what we've historically talked about, sort of that incremental of 18% to 22% and decrementals of sort of 25% to 30%, again, depending on how quickly volume comes down. 
So for the full year, I think the incrementals are generally in line with that. We're obviously picking up an impact from the overall supply chain-related disruptions, but much more in line with where we'd historically expect the business. But it's -- I think in a given quarter, particularly when you see the sharp moves in volume, and this isn't different from what we saw actually during COVID last year. We are going to run heavier on those decrementals. And again, it applies to -- it really applies to both segments."

I would break our activities to offset into 4 -- 4 or 5 buckets. So as we always do, we're constantly reassessing, reevaluating our cost structure and looking for opportunities, both within supply chain, outside of supply chain to further reduce costs. 
We're in active negotiations with the supply base. Situations like this, I guess one of the side benefits is becoming much more strategic with your customers as it relates to supply chain as well as more strategic with your supply base, which translates into, quite frankly, fewer supplier relationships, deeper supplier relationships, more strategic supplier relationships, which provide you with the opportunity to further optimize the supply chain and reduce costs. 
I think in the past, we've talked about over 100 program or product redesign activities that we have underway, where we're substituting alternative inputs to platform solutions that will further lower those costs. 
And lastly, but equally important, we're having active discussions with all of our customers with respect to the cost of doing business in today's environment and the support we've provided to ensure that they remain connected from a supply standpoint. 
So those would be the 4 major buckets I would categorize things in. I would say as it relates to cost and cost structure, and it's important, consistent with past, we continue to invest in growth opportunities, technologies that support growth opportunities in areas like software, in areas like active safety, in areas like high-voltage electrification. And I think it's important to continue to do so, even in light of the decremental margins that you talk about due to production interruptions."

And a bigger push for greater visibility from customer to supplier, a better understanding or visibility to sub-suppliers in capacity, more committed volumes from the OEM down to the supply base so that capital is more effectively deployed. 
And then a trade-off of the -- with that increased visibility, the reality is there will be areas where there will be more investment in inventory, but there'll be other areas where there'll be less. So how that offsets is probably a little difficult to estimate at this point in time. But near term, it likely translates into more inventory. And I think the question is just how much in a conclusion that on certain parts or certain products, without committed volumes, JIT inventory management doesn't work for certain parts. Joe?"

I think we're -- I think that 5% as an overall range is still good. There's been years where we've been a little under. There'll be years where we're a little over by -- but not more than 0.5 percentage point. So I still think 5% is a good proxy. There has been a little movement around just as we work through some of the disruptions in the volume come back, but I wouldn't say that's a material change. 
On inventory, to Kevin's point, I think we're learning a lot. There is a fair amount -- if you just looked at sort of normalized our inventory, about half of the increased balance is -- I would sort of describe as really transactional. Production came down really fast in the back half of Q3. We were obviously -- given the lead times, we were -- we had inventory on hand to produce to the original schedules. 
So that half, I would describe, as more transactional, right? Volume came down. We have higher inventory levels. We tend to be -- we tend to use the same inventory. If you think about what we make, resins for connectors, the electric distribution business, the chips we'll use to the extent we have them. So it's more of a timing related to the production slowdowns for about half that balance. 
To Kevin's point on the remaining balance, there is inventory on hand. Because lead times have extended, we're focused on making sure we have stock. In some cases, you're -- if you got a product that has 350 parts and you're waiting for one chip, you tend to have the other 349 in stocks, so you're ready to go once you get that chip. So there's that type. 
But certainly, the full investment that you see on the balance sheet now, I would not think is a -- is representative of the investment that needs to be made going forward. To Kevin's point, there probably will be some, but it's not going to be at that level. That was -- half of that was really the production disruptions."

I think, by and large, every participant in the supply chain is reevaluating their role and potentially what they can do differently. Having spoken now several times to the leaders of all the semiconductor companies, one of the critical items that needs to be addressed is committed volumes, right? When you look at an industry that is highly capital intensive, predictability of production is extremely important. 
And it gets compounded in an industry with long lead times that's currently constrained. So however, we transition to more of a committed volume model, at least for the medium term, whether that's operating the way we historically operated, with tiers being the primary face to the semiconductor players, or it's OEMs working with the semiconductor players as well as the tiers, either can solve that problem. I think for us, for Aptiv, we'll be flexible to operate in either scenario. 
I would say the one thing that will be different as we move forward is, certainly, more strategic relationships on the semiconductor side, which likely translates into deeper relationships, fewer semiconductor relationships that drive more volume and a more strategic relationship, both from a technology and a supply chain standpoint."

As I said in my comments, we're really -- it's very early days to be doing that. But from our perspective, and we've talked about this, the -- certainly, the COVID and the supply chain-related disruption costs, we do not view as structural. 
We think those are very much driven by the events of the day. And as I said in my prepared comments, as supply chain and material flow returns to normal, we'd expect those costs to go -- to start to go away as well. 
If you look at 2021, I think it's a good proxy. We've historically talked about incremental margins on the OI line between 18% and 22%. This year, we'll be at 16%, carrying $300-plus million of supply chain and COVID-related costs.  So if you backed out that $300 million, we'd be closer to 24%. 
So very much within the historical range and the expected range when you adjust for the COVID and the supply chain-related disruption costs. Now we -- as we said even last quarter, we're not treating the inflation as transitory, the $195 million. So I wouldn't -- I'm not going to add that back. But I'd really focus on -- we get back into that 18% to 22% range with -- we're just adjusting for those COVID costs. 
The other thing I'd mention, we've got about $600 million. Again, we backed this out of the adjusted growth rate. But there's about $600 million of incremental volume from commodity and FX that has a negative flow on it, right? So we've often talked about copper impacting margin rate, but it also obviously impacts the incremental rate. So again, just something to think about as you're working through the math. 
Right now, we see full year material inflation of about $195 million. A lot of that is come in the back half of the year. I think the back half run rate is probably at least indicative of what we're managing for 2022. Again, I'm not going to speak to how much we're able to offset. But certainly start with that $195 million we're talking about, that full year number is certainly what we're working on at the moment."

And when you look at our guidance as it relates to full year EBITDA dollars and EBITDA margins, and you factor in the cost headwinds that Joe's walked through for 2021, be it supply chain or COVID, and you look at the transition from where we were in '18 and where we are today, in light of all these effectively macro challenges with incremental investment in advanced technologies, it just underscores the strength of the business model we've built. 
And the fact that, hey, there may be quarters or short periods of time we go through macro disruption. But the underlying robustness of the business model, the cash conversion is extremely strong, if not better than what it was historically."

And I know there's a number of things that are moving that it's been low. Obviously, the volumes are quite weak, and you have your semi cost inflation. 
I guess I'm wondering though, just broadly on the go forward, this is a segment where you have your software exposure. Theoretically, this is a segment where margins should sharply benefit as that software type revenue starts to come in on ADAS. You've obviously gotten half, but you'll get more. 
But you're talking about continued investment. It just feels like there could be more of a period of mid-single-digit or high single-digit type AS & UX margins. And I guess I'm wondering what are the things that need to happen for the margins to really break out in this segment? I know volume is a big one, but what else needs to happen?"

And I guess the ongoing demand for the active safety, for the user experience, for the data and connectivity solutions that the segment provides.  So there's all sorts of tailwind there. 
Now having said that, Dan, we've talked about some of the areas of opportunity in the future, like SVA, like high-performance compute areas, like software, areas where we feel like there's tremendous opportunity. And if it makes sense, there are areas that we'll continue to invest in, and in some areas, potentially increase investment in."

I know it's hard. Kevin, you kind of mentioned one of the -- whether the solutions to the issues that are going on right now is that automakers sort of give more committed volumes and there's greater visibility through the supply chain. 
I'm just curious how you think that mechanically could work in an industry that is a slave to some degree to macroeconomic cycles and you have normal 20 to trough volumes. It's just hard to understand how an automaker could sit there and give a committed volume number because they are at the whim of what's happening in the macro, then also now finding out that they're sort of at the whim of what could happen deep in the supply chain. I mean how would you envision that committed volume from an automaker working?"

But it's an issue everyone across the supply chain, right, has to deal with, from the OEM all the way through to the wafer manufacturers. 
So it affects every aspect of the supply chain. And if there isn't some level of baseline commitment on some level of products for some period of time, there's an amount of estimating that everybody in the supply chain is doing, and ultimately, you end up in a situation like we find ourselves in today. 
So I think on -- I think, again -- I think we're -- from a supply chain standpoint, will be more strategic with customers and then through to Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 suppliers. The supply chain will be more integrated with more visibility. In exchange for that, there'll be more commitments at least on certain products for some agreed period of time. And that's the way the -- that's how we'll start to dig ourselves out of this or more permanently address some of the structural issues."

So when we hear -- when people hear vertical integration, they're like, oh, c***, outsourcing is going to reverse, and there's going to be in-sourcing. But it doesn't -- it seems like it's a question of semantics because it really sounds like a lot of your technology is landing in some of these platforms. 
So how should we generally think about it? Because it really seems like there's a semantics issue here about what ""vertical integration"" really is."

Vertical integration tends to be an economic trade-off. To your point, we feel like we're well positioned with both software and hardware capabilities, vehicle architecture capabilities. I think we would tell you, based on our discussion with all those players, the reality is, there are certain areas that are growing rapidly in a car from a content standpoint, like software. 
And I think both in the software area and the hardware area, OEMs, whether they're new OEMs or legacy OEMs, in reality, you're going to be dealing with fewer suppliers. And a couple of the newer -- the battery electric vehicle companies that we have a relationship with, what they'll actually say is more of the activity is actually outsourced from a dollar standpoint today, but they're actually dealing with doing that with fewer suppliers. 
And that's, in our view, likely the trend that takes place. And that's where we're working really hard to make sure that we're in front of that trend and we're able to benefit from it."

So as you know, we have Motional, which is our joint venture with the Hyundai Motor Group, which is doing extremely well, has driverless vehicles being tested on roads today in Las Vegas and elsewhere. 
And we'll have fully driverless vehicles as a part of the Lyft network in 2023. So from a business standpoint, they're doing -- and technology advancement standpoint, the team there is doing extremely well. 
A couple of comments broadly on AV. As you know, we've always viewed autonomous driving as the further spectrum of full ADAS solutions. And we use our partnership with Motional as an opportunity to continue to test, to validate, to future-proof technology that we can pull into our current ADAS solutions. 
And that's what we continue to do. We feel like at Aptiv, this is Aptiv, there's a lot of opportunity that remains in the L0 to L3 sort of ADAS framework. 60% of -- less than 60% of vehicles today have an ADAS solution on them. If you believe IHS, they forecast, that increases to 70% by 2025.  We actually believe it will be more than that. And the fastest-growing area will be on L2 and L2+ I would tell you, that's our biggest focus area. 
Having said that -- and we're using Motional as a resource to enhance the solutions that we use in the L2, L2+ sort of space. And then concurrently, we're working with Motional as well as have internal resources focused on L3 and beyond. Our view is that's -- from a cost or commercial standpoint, that's likely beyond 2025, but it's certainly technology that we're focused on, and it's a capability we want to make sure that we're positioned to have."
