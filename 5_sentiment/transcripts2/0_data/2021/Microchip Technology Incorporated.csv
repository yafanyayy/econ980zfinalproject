During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
We had an unintentional posting of our earnings release on our website shortly before the normally scheduled timing today. Once we determined this occurred, we moved quickly to get the releases sent out over our normal distribution processes. 
We are including information in our press release and our conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. 
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. 
Net sales in the December quarter were $1.352 billion, which was up 3.3% sequentially and above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record of 63%. Operating expenses were 23.2%, and operating income was a record 39.8%. Our factory underutilization charges decreased from $12.2 million to $3.7 million sequentially as we continue to ramp our factories to respond to the strong business conditions. We expect the continued ramp of our factories to lead to no underutilization charges in the March quarter. 
Non-GAAP net income was $444.9 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.62, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the December quarter, gross margins were a record at 62.6% and include the impact of $6.4 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $600.2 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of 231.6 million, special charges of $4.3 million, $5.4 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $44.8 million. The GAAP net income was $36.2 million or $0.13 per diluted share and was adversely impacted by $142.1 million loss on debt settlement associated with debt refinancing activities in the quarter. 
Our December quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax benefit recorded on the convertible debt exchange transactions occurring during the period. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 4.25% in the December quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '21 to be about 4.8%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash taxes low in the future. 
Our inventory balance at December 31, 2020, was $666.1 million. We had 120 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was flat to the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were 26 days, which is a record low level and down from 30 days at the end of the prior quarter. In the current environment, it is quite challenging for Microchip or its distributors to increase days of inventory. 
In the December quarter, we exchanged $1.086 billion of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash, shares of our common stock and a new convertible bond that matures in 2024. While these transactions did not impact the overall level of debt on our balance sheet, we believe that these convertible exchanges will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time, which Steve will comment on further in his prepared remarks. 
In calendar year 2020, we reduced the amount of convertible bonds on Microchip's balance sheet by approximately $2.9 billion. In the December quarter, we also issued a $1.4 billion senior secured bond with a maturity date of February 15, 2024, and an interest rate of 0.972% and used the proceeds from that transaction to pay off our term loan B which we were paying an interest rate of about 2.15% on. 
Our cash flow from operating activities was $509.7 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $372.7 million. We paid down $289.7 million of total debt in the December quarter, but please remember that this is inclusive of the cash paid for our various debt financing activities in the quarter, including putting a cap call in place for our newly issued convertible bonds. 
Over the last 10 4 quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $3.24 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as the ongoing operating discipline we have. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. 
Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was a record $593.4 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $2.271 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 3.93 at December 31, 2020, down from 4.04 at September 30, 2020. But please note that the amount of the 2037 bonds were reduced by $407.7 million during the December quarter as part of the financing transactions, which has impacted this metric. 
Our dividend payment in the December quarter was $96 million. 
Capital expenditures were $21.4 million in the December 2020 quarter. We expect between $50 million and $60 million in capital spending in the March quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal '21 to be between $87 million and $97 million. In last quarter's conference call, we explained that our capital expenditure plan for fiscal '21 had increased as we more rapidly prepared for growth in our business as well as actions we were taking to increase our internal capacity in the face of constraints our outsourcing partners are experiencing. Our fiscal '21 capital expenditures are coming in lower than we indicated last quarter due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out due to overall industry conditions. We continue to add capital to maintain and operate our internal manufacturing operations, support the production capabilities for our new products and technologies as well to selectively bring in-house some of the wafer fabrication, assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our destiny during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $40.3 million. 
I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

Our microcontroller revenue performed well with revenue sequentially up 3.3% as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our microcontroller revenue was up 5.9%. 
We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontroller solutions, including the first safety-certified capacitive touchscreen controllers for the home appliance market; the first Trust&GO WiFi module, delivering powerful 32-bit microcontroller functionality and verifiable identity; the industry's highest density secured Ethernet switching solution for hyperscale data centers and telecom service providers; and last but not least, 3 new broad markets, 8-bit microcontroller families to extend our leadership in this product line. Microcontrollers overall represented 53.7% of our revenue in the December quarter. 
Moving to analog. Our analog revenue also performed well and were sequentially up 3.1% as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our analog revenue was up 2.6%. During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, too, including the first cryptographic companion device supporting in-vehicle network security solutions; a new family of configurable 12-bit digital-to-analog converters; the first highly integrated radiation-hardened motor controller; and finally, a family of low latency PCI Express 5.0 and Compute Express Link retimers. Analog represented 27.6% of our revenue in the December quarter. 
Our FPGA revenue was down 8.5% sequentially as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our FPGA revenue was up 7.1%. As we cautioned on our prior conference call, FPGA revenue does have some lumpiness associated with it because of the large exposure to the aerospace and defense market and the associated purchasing patterns. During the quarter, we announced a radiation-hardened fourth generation FPGA family and a low-power radiation tolerant fifth-generation PolarFire FPGA family. FPGA represented 7.3% of our revenue in the December quarter. 
Our licensing, memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO, was up 13% in revenue as compared to the September quarter, with strength in licensing revenue driving this growth. LMO represented 11.4% of our revenue in the [ September ] quarter. 
A quick note about our product line reporting. Given the relatively smaller size of our FPGA product line, at about 7% of our revenue as compared to our microcontroller and analog product lines, we have decided that starting in calendar year 2021, we will no longer break out the FPGA product line separately. Our FPGA products remain important to our overall total system solutions goals. We continue to make significant investments in our FPGA products and expect those investments will help drive our long-term growth and total system solutions initiatives. Going forward, we will combine our FPGA revenue with our LMO, licensing, memory and other, revenues into a new category that we just call other. 
From an end market standpoint, we continue to see the automotive, industrial and consumer markets strengthened further in the December quarter, approximating a V-shaped recovery in the second half of calendar year 2020 as compared to the first half. The end markets have benefited earlier in the year from the work-from-home-related demand search, namely computing, communications and data center remained at more normal demand patterns as the surge we saw in the June quarter dissipated. 
The Huawei ban, which was in effect for all of the December quarter and represented 1% to 2% of our overall revenue, had a more pronounced negative impact on our data center business where it was a more meaningful percentage of that business. 
Finally, demand for our products that go into the office environment, which we refer to as enterprise demand remained weak as most businesses remain predominantly with the work-from-home policies that's deferring enterprise spending for the office environment. 
The supply chain constraints that started in the September quarter continued to grow through the December quarter, a robust overall business environment, accentuated by rising demand from the automotive, industrial and consumer markets, combined with low levels of inventory in the distribution channel, resulted in constraints in practically all of our internal and external factories. Since September, we have been ramping our internal factories as well as investing in capital additions to further expand our internal capacity. We have also worked with our supply chain partners to increase our fab, assembly and test capacity allocation. However, based on the current strength of the business environment, we expect that the constraints we are currently seeing are likely to continue through much of calendar year 2021 and possibly into calendar year 2022. As a result, we have seen our lead time stretch out for many of our products where the constraints are most acute. We have also experienced increases in material and subcontracted manufacturing costs, and have taken steps to secure capacity for 2021. Steve will discuss more in his prepared remarks about our actions to address the current environment of increasing manufacturing cost and seemingly insatiable demand. 
Let me now pass it to Steve for comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?"
31500,702231659,2192641,"Microchip Technology Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2021. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021. The December quarter represented the shift of t",1525,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2021. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021. 
The December quarter represented the shift of the business cycle back to revenue growth with a 3.3% sequential growth in a quarter where ordinarily, we would see a 3% sequential decline from typical seasonal factors. December quarter revenue also grew over prior year's December quarter by 5%. We started ramping our internal factories in September as well as investing in capital additions to expand our internal capacity. We also started working with our supply chain partners to receive more allocation from wafer foundries and assembly test subcontractors. These efforts improved product availability in the December quarter, but still constrained some of the revenue upside. 
We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin of 63%, helped by significant reduction in factory underutilization and better overhead utilization from revenue growth. We also achieved non-GAAP operating margin of 39.8%, an all-time record and getting very close to an [ emotional ] 40% mark. We also hit a record EBITDA of $593.4 million despite revenue not at a record yet showing the robust strength of our business model. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance. This was also our 121st consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. 
Now I will discuss our guidance for the March quarter. Our bookings were exceptionally strong in the December quarter and were an all-time record. We received bookings both for short term as well as into the future quarters. The backlog is also an all-time record. Please remember that bookings as well as the backlog is what is shippable in the next 12 months. The backlog for the March quarter is the strongest starting backlog I have ever seen. Our bookings have remained strong in January. 
On the operational side, the December quarter was constrained by product availability. We will have more internal and external capacity in the March quarter since we have had multiple months to ramp, although I believe that wafer fab as well as back-end constraints are here to stay with us through calendar year 2021. 
In response to the business environment, we have taken 3 actions. First, in the middle of December, we changed our cancellation and pushout terms with our customers and distributors. The standard terms used to be that an order cannot be canceled or pushed out once it is within 45 days of shipment. We changed our standard terms so that an order cannot be canceled or pushed out within 90 days of shipment effective January 1, 2021. We gave customers a couple of weeks to adjust their backlog before it went firm for 90 days. In response to our change in terms, we did not see any unusual cancellations or pushouts which indicates to us that the backlog was firm and needed by our customers. That gave us a solid backlog for the March quarter, which cannot be canceled or pushed out. Therefore, we can batch process the orders and use our manufacturing assets most efficiently, knowing that what we build will get shipped. 
The second action we took was that we sent a letter to our customers on January 4, 2021, informing them of the business environment. We also informed them that we are seeing broad-based cost increases and some aggressive commercial terms from our supplier base, and we must pass these cost increases to our customers through a broad-based price increase. 
The third action we took just this morning. We posted a letter on our website and sent it to our customers and distributors, announcing a new program called the Microchip Preferred Supply Program, or PSP. This program offers our customers the ability to receive prioritized capacity in the second half 2021 and first half 2022. The program has the following elements: The customers participating in this program will have to place 12 months of orders, which will be noncancelable and non reschedule. The capacity priority will begin for shipments in July 2021. The program will not be a guarantee of supply. However, it will provide the highest priority for those orders which are under this PSP program. And the capacity priority will be on a first come, first served basis until the available capacity is booked. We will, of course, reserve a portion of our capacity for new customers, small long-tail customers and new designs. We expect that a significant portion of our capacity will be booked under this new program with a large committed noncancelable backlog for 12 months, Microchip will be in a stronger position to make capacity and raw material commitments to our suppliers, buy capital equipment with confidence, hire employees and ramp up manufacturing and manufactured products more efficiently. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect our net sales for March quarter to be up between 5% to 10% sequentially. The March quarter guidance at the midpoint would represent record GAAP net sales with the prior record being in the September quarter of 2018. The September quarter of 2018 based on GAAP sell-in revenue recognition was $1.432 billion. Some of you may still carry a sell-through base number of $1.513 billion for September 2018 in your historical financial model spreadsheets. The March quarter will also be limited by product availability on many product lines. Our guidance assumes working through a myriad of capacity constraints qualifying incremental equipment installed, qualifying alternate subcontractors in some cases and still dealing with the risk of production constraints with a new wave of COVID cases plaguing the planet and at the same time, ramping up vaccinations. 
For the March quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 63.3% and 63.7% of sales, which would be a new all-time record. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.2% and 23.6% of sales. And we expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 39.7% and 40.5% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.67 per share to $1.79 per share. We also expect to pay down another approximately $350 million of our debt in the March quarter. 
Finally, I want to cover one other area, which is our future cash return strategy. At the rate we're paying down debt, we expect to break a net leverage of 3 within a year and continue to decrease from there. At that time, we expect to begin distributing more of a substantial amount of free cash flow to the investors in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. 
Regarding buybacks. Through multiple tranches of convertible debt buyback, we have essentially bought a substantial amount of stock back from the future. This is because as the stock price rises and exceeds the conversion price of the debt, convertible debt dilutes the share count. [ When it ] converts back prevents future dilution as the stock price rises. Our first convert buyback was in March 2020 when Microchip's stock price was about $71. Since then, we have done 4 other buyback transactions at various stock prices. By doing these various buyback transactions, we have purchased a total of $3.525 billion in face value of our convertible bonds. For the transactions from March 2020 to September 2020, we issued a total of about 20.4 million shares of our common stock to the investors for in-the-money value of their bonds. If these bonds have remained outstanding until an assumed stock price of $140 per share with the stock price about now, the dilution would have been about 26.4 million shares. Thus, our repurchases had the impact of creating a savings of about 6 million shares worth $840 million savings to our investors at $140 per share. This calculation does not include our November 2020 transaction, which was very recent and executed at $133.47 per share, so it is not yet accretive. Therefore, while we have not done an open market stock buyback in the last year, our convert transactions have had the impact of a buyback of approximately 6 million shares. At some point in the future, we expect to start pure stock buyback from the open market. 
We are also initiating a path to higher dividends and not waiting until our leverage reaches a given number before the dividend starts to increase. In this regard, we announced today that the Board of Directors have approved a dividend increase of 5.8% sequentially to $0.39 per share, up from $0.3685 previously. We expect to continue to increase dividends quarterly as part of our cash return strategy. 
Given all of the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we expect that the analysts -- and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. 
With this, Pauline, will you please pool for questions."

I have not ever implemented it in my 42 years of career, and I've never seen anybody else do that, too. The program is largely a response to the current environment because bookings level is just so strong and people are booking parts out in time. The industry seems to be 30% plus short to really what the capacity requirement is. And many of our customers have been asking what can they do if they give us longer-term demand, longer-term orders, will that give them parts, would they give them better support. 
Now customers can give us longer-term orders, but if the orders are cancelable or reschedule-able after 90 days, which was the case prior to the program, then that could have a lot of orders for September and December and could buy capital hire people to ramp. But just before I get there, people could cancel. If there was a double ordering, people were asking more than they need and they cancel part of the orders. So that is often the problem always, and you guys asked the question, is there any double ordering or whatever. And this program basically eliminates all that. It asks the customers to place 12 months of backlog, which will be noncancelable, nonscheduled -- reschedule-able, so I can take that one to the bank, buy raw material, do batch processing, grow the capacity and give them preferential supply. So this is the first time we have implemented it. That's just the need of the times."

So after writing that letter, then we need to really develop that program, and we've got several hundred thousand SKUs, and going through the price increase on which part and how much and passing on to the customers, working through their contracts and long-term prices and stuff like that. So all that really has been implemented at this point in time. We aren't breaking out what portion of the guidance is price increase, that's kind of relatively difficult. But the price increases have already been made effective. 
As far as the economics of the PSP program, the economics of the PSP programs really are in having a committed, noncancelable,  nonreschedulable backlog on the books that we can build it in batches by raw material they had if we wanted, increase our inventory if we wanted to serve that and build it whenever we have a lull, essentially, that's where the economics are to be able to serve the customers better who joined the program and Microchip not be subject to ordering more than they need and double ordering, because they're not going to double order and order more than they need if they cannot reschedule or cancel. 
So that's where the economics are. There's no price change with that. Price program is totally separate. I hope that answers your question."

Do you expect something higher than that? And my answer was yes. So whatever anybody interpreted, I don't know what significant means. And I can't really give you a number for the growth for the year, although I think the revenue is more constrained by capacity than the demand, at least now and for the next several quarters. 
Which leads to your second question, what can -- what kind of growth the supply chain support. I think one of the problems that we're dealing with is that the supply chain is not as stable. We're finding that the assembly test subcontractor will commit, that they can do x number of parts per week. And as we get there, they would change that number, they would lower that number or push it out by a couple of weeks. 
Well, what happened? What happened was they got a recommitment from their suppliers. They didn't get some bonders they were expecting. They couldn't hire some people. Somebody tested positive for COVID so they had to send 50 people home who had come in contact with it. So there's no slack in the system. Everything that gets built gets shipped. There's absolutely no slack in the system. So any perturbation, there was an earthquake in Taiwan. We had a car that hit our substation in a fab in Oregon that knocked out about 3 or 4 days, partial knockout, not complete. None of those things are amicable because all factories are working 7 days a week, full board. So any delay in equipment just leads to a recommitment . 
So I think those are all the myriad of problems we are dealing with in adding equipment, adding people, qualifying additional subcontractors, getting our customers to waive qualification. Automotive are the hardest customers to qualify production in a different plan or to approve a change. And in the last 6 months, we have been so successful in getting even all the automotive customers that they would buy the product from this alternative assembly site or test site or all that. So we're getting help in that area, but it's still a very, very complicated process to put it all together. And therefore, we're not willing to dollarize the number or what percentage we could grow, not yet."

There is not enough product available to grow the inventory because the product keeps getting shipped out. 
Another point I would like to make is that our inventory as well as distributor inventory is calculated based on last 90 days of sales. So it's based on the prior quarter. So essentially, if you -- the real value of the inventories to support the future. So if you take our guidance and take the midpoint of that guidance, let's say, and calculate the days of distributor inventory or Microchip inventory based on that guidance, then the inventory numbers are extremely low. But they're calculated as we report, which is a standard convention, based on the prior 90 days. In a very stable environment, flat sales, it doesn't matter. But in a significant growth, the real inventory is actually much lower than the numbers we're reporting. And we don't think it's going to grow. I think our internal inventory will drop this quarter. We expect by several days. And distribution may do the same."

Depending on what the process and products are, it's a much longer effort. So a lot of the capacity growth is really coming out of growing capacity where the processes are already installed. We got some processes that are installed outside as well as inside. And most of the other majority of our processes either run outside or run inside. And when they run outside, they usually only either run in 1 foundry or the other foundry. So there's really no process that runs in 3 or 4 different foundries. They may run in 3 or 4 different fabs of the same foundry. Like Tech TSMC could run in 3 different fabs of TSMC, but it doesn't run in TSMC as well as global as well as UMC or something. So the capacity growth is largely coming from where the processes are already installed from a fab standpoint. 
From an assembly test standpoint, yes, we're qualifying additional alternate assembly subcontractors, which could give additional capacity. But there also, majority of the growth in assembly as well as test is coming from buying capital and installing in 3 of Microchip's large facilities, 2 in Thailand and 1 in Philippines. They are basically doing a record amount of assembly and test every day. And capacity is rising every week, every month, every quarter for the rest of the year."

So as of January 1, then whatever was on our books for the March quarter became firm, but no changes could be made. And that backlog position for the March quarter was very strong, strongest we have ever seen in our careers. Now as Ganesh answered earlier and Eric answered, that doesn't mean the March quarter was fully booked because you always have products where there's product available and customers and distributors can continue to come and buy those products where the lead time is still fairly short and shippable within the quarter. But a very large number of products were also completely booked, and nothing available for March on some products, even nothing available for June. 
So the impact of that 90 days was effective on January 1. And then as you go -- as you finish the month of January, then the backlog is now hard for February, March, April. By the end of February, the backlog will be hard for March, April and May. So that was a 90-day program. 
The PSP program is an entirely new program. The 90-day program was applicable to all customers worldwide, direct or distribution. The PSP program is a customer's option. It's not -- we can't force them to give us 1 year of backlog. So that was an option given to the customer that they can have an ability to get preferred supply support if they would give us 12 months of noncancelable backlog, which helps us in bringing capacity online and buy capital and hire people with confidence and it gives them preferential capacity.

That's what I wanted to understand because there's a concern about double booking, that sounds like the way you have framed it and the way you're running the business at this point. It seems like you have quite a lot of visibility on that. 
My longer-term question, Steve, and thanks for addressing that. Your business model is transforming and you've been talking about M&A being less of a priority given where the valuations are and focus on organic. So the question -- and you addressed it by saying the buyback, even though not directly, you have been bringing down dilution. What was the point you made on dividend? I missed that. What's the formula that you have in place for dividend growth?"

We just -- Board will meet every quarter and decide the dividend for every quarter. In the current quarter, we grew the dividend by 5.8%. And you could expect that Board will grow the dividend every quarter. And that's really our commitment. 
We -- I told in the last couple of quarters that we will build a glide path towards higher dividend, and this is a glide path towards a higher dividend. So if you accumulate the increase in dividend for 4, 5, 6 quarters, then by middle of 2022, you already would have a significantly higher dividend after seeing 6 increases of the time we just did. That's really what we're trying to do to get to higher dividends. And by that time, the leverage would have come down and such that higher dividend really be supportable at that point in time from the cash flow and still have enough cash available to keep bringing the debt down further."

I call it a Black Swan event, although that's more meant for negative. We -- I don't really know what other competitors are seeing what, but our capacity for automotive products and industrial products and consumer products is really common. We run out of same fabs, the same processes, sometimes they are the same parts that we can ship into an automotive or ship into an industrial. So the capacity constraints would really be shared by all markets. 
Now the largest increase in demand has been in automotive, where in the June quarter, automotive demand went to 20% of normal because all the factories shut down, And as that demand has gone back to 95% of normal or 100% of normal, that's a 5x increase in auto demand. So they are seeing sort of the worst shortages because they didn't place their orders, they really guide towards having this strong V-shape recovery. So they're part a little worse than that, but the capacity is common. 
There's also a fact that in automotive, a $1 part can prevent a $40,000 car from shipping. In industrial, a $1 part could just prevent a 1999 power drill from that shipping. So the [ heart ] factor is quite different. So therefore, the noise from automotive, the escalations of the management team and the pressure and all that is really at a different level."

Or how can you think about linearity from here?

Lots and lots of customers take up on that offer. And then we can build the product more efficiently. It could help a little bit on the cost side of the equation. But PSP program wasn't launched to drive margins. It was launched to get a firm customer backlog that we can be confident of growing our capacity and not have any double ordering or excess ordering in that backlog, which could go away when we get there. That's why it was launched. It was not launched for margin. And I don't think it's going to have a lot of impact on margin. 
Now as we are growing through this growth period, you have 3 or 4 things happening. Number one, all the underutilization is going away. Most of it is going away in March, but some could be going away in June. Number two, as the incremental capacity is being added, the [indiscernible] capacity usually is more productive because you're not adding the entire every machine, you're adding bottlenecks here and there. So when you add that capacity, the incremental margin thrown for every dollar of revenue tends to be better. And you could go back in the price cycles and calculate incremental margin to get some idea. The third being, we are bringing some products, both in fab and assembly and test, from outside to inside, and those moves are accretive. There could be something else. The impact of price increase, I think, is going to be relatively benign because we largely launched that to offset the cost increases, but you can't always increase the price on a product where you have seen the cost increase. You got to look at the product, whether there's a competitive element there or it's a proprietary product. So the price increase and cost increase don't completely match product by product. But overall, we might get some benefit certainly in revenue, probably not in margin."

And so we came up with this program and saying, ""If you commit that your orders for the next 12 months are noncancelable, nonreschedulable, then we will go with confidence, build the product and give you preferential support."" So we do not know what the uptake would be. And I'm just purely guessing, we just launched it this morning, and I've got 3 or 4 inputs since then, one from a major distributor and few from customers. One customer I talked to personally. So I think this is hot off the press. So that's that. 
The other part of your question was the 300-millimeter. There is no plan to do any 300-millimeter inside.

We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
We had an unintentional posting of our earnings release on our website shortly before the normally scheduled timing today. Once we determined this occurred, we moved quickly to get the releases sent out over our normal distribution processes.
We are including information in our press release and our conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.
Net sales in the December quarter were $1.352 billion, which was up 3.3% sequentially and above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record of 63%, operating expenses were 23.2% and operating income was a record 39.8%. Our factory underutilization charges decreased from $12.2 million to $3.7 million sequentially as we continue to ramp our factories to respond to the strong business conditions. We expect the continued ramp of our factories to lead to no underutilization charges in the March quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $444.9 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.62, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance.
On a GAAP basis in the December quarter, gross margins were a record at 62.6% and include the impact of $6.4 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $600.2 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $231.6 million, special charges of $4.3 million, $5.4 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $44.8 million. The GAAP net income was $36.2 million or $0.13 per diluted share and was adversely impacted by $142.1 million loss on debt settlement associated with debt refinancing activities in the quarter.
Our December quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably, the tax benefit recorded on the convertible debt exchange transactions occurring during the period. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 4.25% in the December quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '21 to be about 4.8%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash taxes low in the future.
Our inventory balance at December 31, 2020, was $666.1 million. We had 120 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was flat to the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were 26 days, which is a record low level and down from 30 days at the end of the prior quarter. In the current environment, it is quite challenging for Microchip or its distributors to increase days of inventory.
In the December quarter, we exchanged $1.086 billion of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash, shares of our common stock and a new convertible bond that matures in 2024. While these transactions did not impact the overall level of debt on our balance sheet, we believe that these convertible exchanges will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time, which Steve will comment on further in his prepared remarks.
In calendar year 2020, we reduced the amount of convertible bonds on Microchip's balance sheet by approximately $2.9 billion. In the December quarter, we also issued a $1.4 billion senior secured bond with a maturity date of February 15, 2024, and an interest rate of 0.972% and used the proceeds from that transaction to pay off our Term Loan B which we were paying an interest rate of about 2.15% on.
Our cash flow from operating activities was $509.7 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $372.7 million. We paid down $289.7 million of total debt in the December quarter, but please remember that this is inclusive of the cash paid for our various debt financing activities in the quarter, including putting a capped call in place for our newly issued convertible bonds.
Over the last 10 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $3.24 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as the ongoing operating discipline we have. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years.
Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was a record $593.4 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $2.271 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 3.93 at December 31, 2020, down from 4.04 at September 30, 2020. But please note that the amount of the 2037 bonds were reduced by $407.7 million during the December quarter as part of the financing transactions, which has impacted this metric. Our dividend payment in the December quarter was $96 million.
Capital expenditures were $21.4 million in the December 2020 quarter. We expect between $50 million and $60 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal '21 to be between $87 million and $97 million. In the last quarter's conference call, we explained that our capital expenditure plan for fiscal '21 had increased as we more rapidly prepared for growth in our business as well as actions we were taking to increase our internal capacity in the face of constraints our outsourcing partners are experiencing.
Our fiscal '21 capital expenditures are coming in lower than we indicated last quarter due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out due to overall industry conditions. We continue to add capital to maintain and operate our internal manufacturing operations, support the production capabilities for our new products and technologies as well to selectively bring in-house some of the wafer fabrication, assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our destiny during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $40.3 million.
I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

Our microcontroller revenue performed well with revenue sequentially up 3.3% as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our microcontroller revenue was up 5.9%.
We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontroller solutions, including: the first safety-certified capacitive touchscreen controllers for the home appliance market; the first Trust&GO WiFi module, delivering powerful 32-bit microcontroller functionality and verifiable identity; the industry's highest density secured Ethernet switching solution for hyperscale data centers and telecom service providers; and last but not least, 3 new broad market 8-bit microcontroller families to extend our leadership in this product line. Microcontrollers overall represented 53.7% of our revenue in the December quarter.
Moving to analog. Our analog revenue also performed well and was sequentially up 3.1% as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our analog revenue was up 2.6%. During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, too, including the first cryptographic companion device supporting in-vehicle network security solutions; a new family of configurable 12-bit digital-to-analog converters; the first highly integrated radiation-hardened motor controller; and finally, a family of low-latency PCI Express 5.0 and Compute Express Link retimers. Analog represented 27.6% of our revenue in the December quarter.
Our FPGA revenue was down 8.5% sequentially as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our FPGA revenue was up 7.1%. As we cautioned on our prior conference calls, FPGA revenue does have some lumpiness associated with it because of the large exposure to the aerospace and defense market and the associated purchasing patterns. During the quarter, we announced a radiation-hardened fourth-generation FPGA family and a low-power radiation-tolerant fifth-generation PolarFire FPGA family. FPGA represented 7.3% of our revenue in the December quarter.
Our licensing, memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO, was up 13% in revenue as compared to the September quarter with strength in licensing revenue driving this growth. LMO represented 11.4% of our revenue in the September quarter.
A quick note about our product line reporting. Given the relatively smaller size of our FPGA product line at about 7% of our revenue as compared to our microcontroller and analog product lines, we have decided that starting in calendar year 2021, we will no longer break out the FPGA product line separately. Our FPGA products remain important to our overall total system solutions goals. We continue to make significant investments in our FPGA products and expect those investments will help drive our long-term growth and total system solutions initiatives. Going forward, we will combine our FPGA revenue with our LMO, or licensing, memory and other, revenues into a new category that we'll just call Other.
From an end market standpoint, we continue to see the automotive, industrial and consumer markets strengthened further in the December quarter, approximating a V-shaped recovery in the second half of calendar year 2020 as compared to the first half. The end markets have benefited earlier in the year from the work-from-home-related demand search. Namely, computing, communications and data center remained at more normal demand patterns as the surge we saw in the June quarter dissipated.
The Huawei ban, which was in effect for all of the December quarter and represented 1% to 2% of our overall revenue, had a more pronounced negative impact on our data center business where it was a more meaningful percentage of that business. Finally, demand for our products that go into the office environment, which we refer to as enterprise demand, remained weak as most businesses remain predominantly with the work-from-home policies that's deferring enterprise spending for the office environment.
The supply chain constraints that started in the September quarter continued to grow through the December quarter. A robust overall business environment, accentuated by rising demand from the automotive, industrial and consumer markets combined with low levels of inventory in the distribution channel resulted in constraints in practically all of our internal and external factories. Since September, we have been ramping our internal factories as well as investing in capital additions to further expand our internal capacity. We have also worked with our supply chain partners to increase our fab, assembly and test capacity allocation.
However, based on the current strength of the business environment, we expect that the constraints we are currently seeing are likely to continue through much of calendar year 2021 and possibly into calendar year 2022. As a result, we have seen our lead time stretch out for many of our products where the constraints are most acute. We have also experienced increases in material and subcontracted manufacturing costs and have taken steps to secure capacity for 2021. Steve will discuss more in his prepared remarks about our actions to address the current environment of increasing manufacturing cost and seemingly insatiable demand.
Let me now pass it to Steve for comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2021. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021.
The December quarter represented the shift of the business cycle back to revenue growth with a 3.3% sequential growth in a quarter where ordinarily, we would see a 3% sequential decline from typical seasonal factors. December quarter revenue also grew over prior year's December quarter by 5%. We started ramping our internal factories in September as well as investing in capital additions to expand our internal capacity. We also started working with our supply chain partners to receive more allocation from wafer foundries and assembly test subcontractors. These efforts improved product availability in the December quarter but still constrained some of the revenue upside.
We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin of 63% helped by significant reduction in factory underutilization and better overhead utilization from revenue growth. We also achieved non-GAAP operating margin of 39.8%, an all-time record and getting very close to an emotional 40% mark. We also hit a record EBITDA of $593.4 million despite revenue not at a record yet showing the robust strength of our business model. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance. This was also our 121st consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability.
Now I will discuss our guidance for the March quarter. Our bookings were exceptionally strong in the December quarter and were an all-time record. We received bookings both for short term as well as into the future quarters. The backlog is also an all-time record. Please remember that bookings as well as the backlog is what is shippable in the next 12 months. The backlog for the March quarter is the strongest starting backlog I have ever seen. Our bookings have remained strong in January. On the operational side, the December quarter was constrained by product availability. We will have more internal and external capacity in the March quarter since we have had multiple months to ramp, although I believe that wafer fab as well as back-end constraints are here to stay with us through calendar year 2021.
In response to the business environment, we have taken 3 actions. First, in the middle of December, we changed our cancellation and pushout terms with our customers and distributors. The standard terms used to be that an order cannot be canceled or pushed out once it is within 45 days of shipment. We changed our standard terms so that an order cannot be canceled or pushed out within 90 days of shipment effective January 1, 2021. We gave customers a couple of weeks to adjust their backlog before it went firm for 90 days. In response to our change in terms, we did not see any unusual cancellations or pushouts, which indicates to us that the backlog was firm and needed by our customers. That gave us a solid backlog for the March quarter, which cannot be canceled or pushed out. Therefore, we can batch process the orders and use our manufacturing assets most efficiently knowing that what we build will get shipped.
The second action we took was that we sent a letter to our customers on January 4, 2021, informing them of the business environment. We also informed them that we are seeing broad-based cost increases and some aggressive commercial terms from our supplier base, and we must pass these cost increases to our customers through a broad-based price increase.
The third action we took just this morning. We posted a letter on our website and sent it to our customers and distributors announcing a new program called the Microchip Preferred Supply Program, or PSP. This program offers our customers the ability to receive prioritized capacity in the second half 2021 and first half 2022.
The program has the following elements: the customers participating in this program will have to place 12 months of orders, which will be noncancelable and non-reschedulable. The capacity priority will begin for shipments in July 2021. The program will not be a guarantee of supply. However, it will provide the highest priority for those orders which are under this PSP program. And the capacity priority will be on a first-come, first-served basis until the available capacity is booked. We will, of course, reserve a portion of our capacity for new customers, small long-tail customers and new designs.
We expect that a significant portion of our capacity will be booked under this new program. With a large, committed, noncancelable backlog for 12 months, Microchip will be in a stronger position to make capacity and raw material commitments to our suppliers, buy capital equipment with confidence, hire employees and ramp up manufacturing and manufacture products more efficiently.
Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect our net sales for March quarter to be up between 5% to 10% sequentially. The March quarter guidance at the midpoint would represent record GAAP net sales with the prior record being in the September quarter of 2018. The September quarter of 2018, based on GAAP sell-in revenue recognition, was $1.432 billion.
Some of you may still carry a sell-through-based number of $1.513 billion for September 2018 in your historical financial model spreadsheets. The March quarter will also be limited by product availability on many product lines. Our guidance assumes working through a myriad of capacity constraints qualifying incremental equipment installed, qualifying alternate subcontractors in some cases and still dealing with the risk of production constraints with a new wave of COVID cases plaguing the planet and at the same time, ramping up vaccinations.
For the March quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 63.3% and 63.7% of sales, which would be a new all-time record. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.2% and 23.6% of sales, and we expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 39.7% and 40.5% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.67 per share to $1.79 per share. We also expect to pay down another approximately $350 million of our debt in the March quarter.
Finally, I want to cover one other area, which is our future cash return strategy. At the rate we're paying down debt, we expect to break a net leverage of 3 within a year and continue to decrease from there. At that time, we expect to begin distributing more of a substantial amount of free cash flow to the investors in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.
Regarding buybacks, through multiple tranches of convertible debt buyback, we have essentially bought a substantial amount of stock back from the future. This is because as the stock price rises and exceeds the conversion price of the debt, convertible debt dilutes the share count. [ Trying to ] convert back prevents future dilution as the stock price rises. Our first convert buyback was in March 2020 when Microchip's stock price was about $71. Since then, we have done 4 other buyback transactions at various stock prices.
By doing these various buyback transactions, we have purchased a total of $3.525 billion in face value of our convertible bonds. For the transactions from March 2020 to September 2020, we issued a total of about 20.4 million shares of our common stock to the investors for in-the-money value of their bonds. If these bonds have remained outstanding until an assumed stock price of $140 per share with the stock price about now, the dilution would have been about 26.4 million shares.
Thus, our repurchases had the impact of creating a savings of about 6 million shares worth $840 million savings to our investors at $140 per share. This calculation does not include our November 2020 transaction, which was very recent and executed at $133.47 per share, so it is not yet accretive. Therefore, while we have not done an open market stock buyback in the last year, our convert transactions have had the impact of a buyback of approximately 6 million shares. At some point in the future, we expect to start pure stock buyback from the open market.
We are also initiating a path to higher dividends and not waiting until our leverage reaches a given number before the dividend starts to increase. In this regard, we announced today that the Board of Directors have approved a dividend increase of 5.8% sequentially to $0.39 per share, up from $0.3685 previously. We expect to continue to increase dividends quarterly as part of our cash return strategy.
Given all of the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we expect that the analysts -- and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.
With this, Pauline, will you please pool for questions?"

I have not ever implemented it in my 42 years of career, and I have never seen anybody else do that, too. The program is largely a response to the current environment because bookings level is just so strong and people are booking parts out in time. The industry seems to be 30% plus short to really what the capacity requirement is. And many of our customers have been asking what can they do if they give us longer-term demand, longer-term orders. Will that give them parts? Will that give them better support?
Now customers can give us longer-term orders. But if the orders are cancelable or reschedulable after 90 days, which was the case prior to the program, then I could have a lot of orders for September and December and could buy capital, hire people to ramp. But just before I get there, people could cancel if there was a double ordering, people were asking more than they need and they cancel part of the orders. So that is often the problem always, and you guys ask the question, is there any double ordering or whatever. And this program basically eliminates all that. It asks the customers to place 12 months of backlog, which will be noncancelable, non-reschedulable so I can take that one to the bank, buy raw material, do batch processing, grow the capacity and give them preferential supply. So this is the first time we have implemented it. It's just the need of the times."

So after writing that letter, then we need to really develop that program, and we've got several hundred thousand SKUs and going through the price increase on which part and how much and passing on to the customers, working through their contracts and long-term prices and stuff like that. So all that really has been implemented at this point in time. We aren't breaking out what portion of the guidance is price increase. That's kind of relatively difficult. But the price increases have already been made effective.
As far as the economics of the PSP program, the economics of the PSP program really are in having a committed noncancelable,  non-reschedulable backlog on the books that we can build it in batches, buy raw material ahead if we wanted, increase our inventory if we wanted to serve that and build it whenever we have a lull. Essentially, that's where the economics are to be able to serve the customers better who joined the program and Microchip not be subject to ordering more than they need and double ordering because they're not going to double order and order more than they need if they cannot reschedule or cancel. So that's where the economics are. There's no price change with that price program. It's totally separate. I don't know if that answers your question."

And I can't really give you a number for the growth for the year, although I think the revenue is more constrained by capacity than the demand, at least now and for the next several quarters.
Which leads to your second question, what can -- what kind of growth the supply chain support. I think one of the problems that we're dealing with is that the supply chain is not as stable. We're finding that the assembly test subcontractor will commit that they can do x number of parts per week, and as we get there, they would change that number. They would lower that number or push it out by a couple of weeks. Well, what happened? What happened was they got a de-commitment from their suppliers. They didn't get some bonders they were expecting. They couldn't hire some people. Somebody tested positive for COVID, so they had to send 50 people home who had come in contact with it.
So there's no slack in the system. Everything that gets built gets shipped. There's absolutely no slack in the system. So any perturbation, there was an earthquake in Taiwan, we had a car that hit our substation in a fab in Oregon that knocked out about 3 or 4 days, partial knockout, not complete, none of those things are [ amicable ] because all factories are working 7 days a week, full board. So any delay in equipment just leads to a de-commitment. So I think those are all the myriad of problems we are dealing with in adding equipment, adding people, qualifying additional subcontractors, getting our customers to waive qualification.
Automotive are the hardest customers to qualify production in a different plan or to approve a change. And in the last 6 months, we have been so successful in getting even all the automotive customers that they would buy the product from this alternative assembly site or test site and all that. So we're getting help in that area, but it's still a very, very complicated process to put it all together. And therefore, we're not willing to dollarize the number or what percentage we could grow, not yet."

So essentially, if you -- the real value of the inventory is to support the future.
So if you take our guidance and take the midpoint of that guidance, let's say, and calculate the days of distributor inventory or Microchip inventory based on that guidance, then the inventory numbers are extremely low. But they're calculated as we report, which is a standard convention based on the prior 90 days. In a very stable environment, flat sales, it doesn't matter. But in a significant growth, the real inventory is actually much lower than the numbers we're reporting. And we don't think it's going to grow. I think our internal inventory will drop this quarter, we expect, by several days, and distribution will do the same."

Depending on what the process and products are, it's a much longer effort. So a lot of the capacity growth is really coming out of growing capacity where the processes are already installed. We got some processes that are installed outside as well as inside. And most of the other -- the majority of our processes either run outside or run inside. And when they run outside, they usually only either run in one foundry or the other foundry.
So there's really no process that runs in 3 or 4 different foundries. They may run in 3 or 4 different fabs of the same foundry. Like -- take TSMC. It could run in 3 different fabs of TSMC, but it doesn't run in TSMC as well as Global as well as UMC or something. So the capacity growth is largely coming from where the processes are already installed from a fab standpoint.
From an assembly test standpoint, yes, we're qualifying additional alternate assembly subcontractors which could give additional capacity. But there also, majority of the growth in assembly as well as test is coming from buying capital and installing in 3 of Microchip's large facilities: 2 in Thailand and 1 in the Philippines. They're basically doing a record amount of assembly and test every day, and capacity is rising every week, every month, every quarter for the rest of the year."

So as of January 1 then, whatever was on our books for the March quarter became firm, so no changes could be made. And that backlog position for the March quarter was very strong, strongest we have ever seen in our careers.
Now as Ganesh answered earlier and Eric answered, that doesn't mean the March quarter was fully booked because you always have products where there's product available and customers and distributors can continue to come and buy those products where the lead time is still fairly short and shippable within the quarter. But a very large number of products were also completely booked and nothing available for March. On some products, even nothing available for June. So the impact of that 90 days was effective on January 1. And then as you go -- as you finish the month of January, then the backlog is now hard for February, March, April. By the end of February, the backlog will be hard for March, April and May. So that was a 90-day program.
The PSP program is an entirely new program. The 90-day program was applicable to all customers worldwide, direct or distribution. The PSP program is a customer's option. It's not -- we can't force them to give us 1 year of backlog. So that was an option given to the customer that they can have an ability to get preferred supply support if they would give us 12 months of noncancelable backlog, which helps us in bringing capacity online and buy capital and hire people with confidence and it gives them preferential capacity. So there is something in it for both."

So this is just like a -- this is a Six Sigma event in terms of shortages, call it, a Black Swan event, although that's more meant for negative. We -- I don't really know what other competitors are seeing what, but our capacity for automotive products and industrial products and consumer products is really common. It runs out of same fabs, the same processes. Sometimes they are the same parts that we can ship into an automotive or ship into an industrial. So the capacity constraints would really be shared by all markets.
Now the largest increase in demand has been in automotive where in the June quarter, automotive demand went to 20% of normal because all the factories shut down. And as that demand has gone back to 95% of normal or 100% of normal, that's a 5x increase in auto demand. So they are seeing sort of the worst shortages because they didn't place their orders. They didn't really guide towards having this strong V-shape recovery. So they're [ partly ] a little worse than that, but the capacity is common.
There's also a fact that in automotive, a $1 part can prevent a $40,000 car from shipping. In industrial, a $1 part could just prevent a [ 1999 ] power drill from that shipping. So the hard factor is quite different. So therefore, the noise from automotive, the escalations of the management team and the pressure and all that is really at a different level."

[ Anecdotally ], it could make us more efficient if we get a large amount of backlog, lots and lots of customers take up on that offer and then we can build the product more efficiently. It could help a little bit on the cost side of the equation. But PSP program wasn't launched to drive margins. It was launched to get a firm customer backlog that we can be confident of growing our capacity and not have any double ordering or excess ordering in that backlog which could go away when we get there. That's why it was launched. It was not launched for margin, and I don't think it's going to have a lot of impact on margin.
Now as we are growing through this growth period, you have 3 or 4 things happening. Number one, all the underutilization is going away. Most of it is going away in March, but some could be going away in June. Number two, as the incremental capacity is being added, the incremental capacity usually is more productive because you're not adding the entire -- every machine. You're adding bottlenecks here and there. So when you add that capacity, the incremental margin thrown for every dollar of revenue tends to be better. And you could go back in the price cycles and calculate incremental margin to get some idea.
The third being we are bringing some products, both in fab and assembly and test, from outside to inside and those moves are accretive. There could be something else. The impact of price increase, I think, is going to be relatively benign because we largely launched that to offset the cost increases, but you can't always increase the price on a product where you have seen the cost increase. You got to look at the product, whether there's a competitive element there or it's a proprietary product. So the price increase and cost increase don't completely match product-by-product. But overall, we might get some benefit certainly in revenue, probably not in margin."

We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual results and events may differ materially. We refer you to our press release today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; and Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chairman. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 financial performance. Ganesh will then give commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page for our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. 
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. 
Net sales in the March quarter were $1.467 billion, which were up 8.5% sequentially and above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 64.1%. Operating expenses were at 23.4% and operating income was a record 40.7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $521.4 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.85, $0.12 above the midpoint of our guidance. 
On a GAAP basis in the March quarter, gross margins were a record at 63.2%. Total operating expenses were $618.8 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $232.4 million, special income of $7.2 million, $2.9 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $47.2 million. 
The GAAP net income was $116 million or $0.41 per diluted share and was adversely impacted by a $85.6 million loss on debt settlement associated with our convertible debt refinancing activities. Our March quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax benefit recorded on the convertible debt exchange transactions occurring during the period. 
For fiscal year 2021, net sales were a record $5.438 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 62.8%. Operating expenses were 23.2% of sales and operating income was a record 39.6% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record $1.784 billion, and EPS was a record of $6.59 per diluted share. 
On a GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 62.1%. Operating expenses were 43.7% of sales, and operating income was 18.4% of sales. Net income was $349.4 million and EPS was $1.29 per diluted share. 
Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 1.8% in the March quarter, and 4.1% for fiscal year 2021. The non-GAAP cash tax rate in the March quarter was lower than [indiscernible] due to a variety of factors, including the receipt of a tax refund that had not been forecasted to be received until a later date. 
We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '22 to be about 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. 
Our inventory balance at March 31, 2021, was $665 million. We had 112 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter, which was down 8 days from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors at the end of the March quarter were at 22 days, which is a record low level and down from 26 days at the end of the prior quarter. 
We are ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. 
In the March quarter, we exchanged $359.2 million of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. While these transactions did not impact the overall level of debt on our balance sheet, we believe that these convertible exchanges will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. 
The principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at the end of fiscal year 2021 is $1.263 billion compared to $4.481 billion at the beginning of calendar year 2020, putting our overall capital structure in a much better long-term position. 
Our cash flow from operating activities was $449.2 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $282 million. We paid down $369.2 million of total debt in the March quarter over the last 11 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $3.61 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. 
We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. 
We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was a record $652.3 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.375 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 3.71 at March 31, 2021, down from 3.93 at December 31, 2020. 
Please note that the amount of the outstanding 2037 bonds were reduced by $156 million during the March quarter as part of our financing transaction. And without this transaction, our net debt-to-EBITDA would have been lower. Our dividend payment in the March quarter was $106.6 million. 
Capital expenditures were $55.4 million in the March '21 quarter and $92.6 million for fiscal year 2021. Our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment leads and deliveries pushing out due to overall industry conditions. 
Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be between $225 million and $275 million. Or cash for the June 2021 quarter's capital expenditures is between $70 million and $90 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the growth of our business. 
We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business, and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $40.2 million. 
I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter as well as our June quarter guidance. Ganesh?"

Our March quarter results were strong by every key metric, closing a tumultuous fiscal year on a very positive note, which was otherwise dominated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
March quarter revenue was an all-time record at $1.467 billion, growing by 8.5% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margins were another record at 64.1%, up 110 basis points from the December quarter as we benefited from improved factory utilization and product mix. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 40.7%, the first time we have broken through the 40% mark. Our journey towards our long-term business model of 65% gross margin and 42% operating margin is off to a good start but still has a lot of hard work ahead of us to achieve. Our consolidated 
non-GAAP EPS was above the high end of our guidance at a record $1.85. EBITDA was very strong and achieved another record at $62.3 million, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business through the business cycles. 
The March quarter also marked 122nd consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to take this occasion to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the March quarter. And especially thank the worldwide Microchip team, whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult environment and who work constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in a hyper constrained environment. 
Reflecting on our fiscal year 2021 results, we achieved a number of highlights and records in the last year. Revenue was a record $5.438 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record at 62.8%. Non-GAAP operating margin was a record at 39.6%, and non-GAAP EPS was a record at $6.59 . 
All in all, the record March quarter results and the record March ending fiscal year 2021 results marks a seamless transition between Steve and I as we each embarked on our new roles to build the next phase of Microchip's long-term success. I'm truly fortunate to be the beneficiary of Steve's years of managing Microchip for the long term. 
Taking a look at our business. From a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 12.2% as compared to the December quarter and set new quarterly and fiscal year records. On a year-over-year basis, our March quarter microcontroller revenue was up 12.3%. Microcontrollers represented 55.6% of our revenue in the March quarter. 
Our analog revenue was sequentially up 11.3% as compared to the December quarter. Analog represented 28.3% of our revenue in the March quarter. Our revenue was sequentially down 6.4% for other as compared to the December quarter and represented 16.1% of our revenue in the March quarter.

Gartner continues to have a large discrepancy versus our publicly reported microcontroller revenue to the tune of $428 million of revenue understatement for all of 2020, predominantly in the 32-bit microcontroller revenue category. 
Adjusting the Gartner number to use our actual microcontroller revenue, we are pleased to report that for microcontrollers overall, we remain the #3 spot. However, in 2020, we substantially closed the gap between us and the 2 players ahead of us. We are now within striking distance of each of the 2 players who were just 3.6% ahead of us in revenue as we continue our relentless march towards the #1 spot. 
We gained market share in each of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller markets. While our 8-bit and 16-bit microcontroller businesses continue to do well, our 32-bit microcontroller business was our fastest-growing microcontroller business. Our microcontroller portfolio and road map has never been stronger. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain share in 2021 as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. 
Taking a look at our business from a geographic perspective. Americas was up 0.8% sequentially. Europe was up 30.4% sequentially, stronger than what is normally the seasonally strongest quarter. Asia was up 5% sequentially in a quarter when business is normally down due to the Lunar New Year holidays. 
Taking a look at our business from an end market perspective. The automotive, industrial and consumer markets remain the strongest markets. The computing end market was strong while the data center and communications end markets were flat to up a little. The aerospace and defense markets, which tend to be lumpy, was the only end market that was weak. 
Business conditions remain exceptionally strong through the quarter with record bookings and backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters. Demand outpaced the capacity improvements we were able to implement, resulting in lead times continuing to extend out. 
In my 40 years in the semiconductor industry, I cannot recall a time when the imbalance between the supply and demand has been more acute. In response, we launched our Preferred Supply Program, or PSP, to provide customers with supply priority beginning 6 months after their order in exchange for at least 12 months of noncancelable orders. Customer response to the program has exceeded our expectations with direct customers and distributors alike. About 44% of our backlog is now in the PSP category, although it is almost 100% of our backlog in some of the most constrained capacity corridors. 
Additional PSP backlog continues to come in every week. This gives us a solid foundation to enable us to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps. 
With the strong demand, we're experiencing constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We started ramping our internal factories in September as well as investing in capital additions to expand our internal capacity. We are making incremental capacity decisions for our internal factories where possible, based on the strength of our backlog especially our noncancelable PSP backlog, which is reflected in our fiscal year '22 capital forecast of $225 million to $275 million. 
We also work closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry, assembly, test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Through the combination of internal and external capacity actions we have taken, we expect our overall capacity will continue to grow every quarter in calendar year 2021. 
While our capacity will continue to grow every quarter, we also believe that wafer fab as well as assembly and test constraints will persist through 2021 and quite likely into 2022. 
Now let's get into the guidance for the June quarter. Our backlog for the June quarter is very strong. In addition, we have considerable backlog requested by customers in the June quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from the last quarter. This is because the entire semiconductor supply chain remains constrained. 
Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the June quarter to be up between 3.5% and 7.5% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes continued operational constraints, some of which we will work through during the quarter and others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. 
For the June quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 64.1% and 64.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.1% and 23.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 40.6% and 41.4% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.85 and $1.95. 
Please keep in mind that our non-GAAP EPS forecast for the June quarter includes a 420 basis point higher tax rate assumption than the March quarter. We also expect to pay down another approximately $325 million of our debt in the June quarter. 
Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization and intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. 
We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. 
Finally, as we announced on our February conference call, based on the strong cash generation characteristics of our business in up cycles and down cycles, we have modified our capital allocation thought process to pivot to a cash return strategy, which has received very positive investor feedback. 
Steve will now provide more details on this strategy as well as the long-term thinking that informs our actions in this regard. Steve?"

But before I do that, I would like to say how I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered a",561,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. But before I do that, I would like to say how I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered a flawless quarter and making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage and record EBITDA. 
Now I will turn to updating you on the cash return strategy. We completed the March quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of 3.71, excluding the long-dated 2037 maturity converts that are more equity-like in nature. 
At the rate we are paying down debt, we expect to break a net debt leverage ratio of 3 within a year and continue to decrease from there. Around that time, we would also expect to achieve an investment-grade rating, but the exact timing will depend on the analysis of the rating agencies. At that time, we expect to begin distributing more of our substantial amount of free cash flow to our investors in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. 
Regarding buybacks, through our various convertible debt exchanges, we have essentially bought a substantial amount of stock back from the future. This is because as the stock price rises and exceeds the conversion price of the debt, convertible debt dilutes the share count. Buying converts back, prevents future dilution as the stock price rises. 
Our first convert buyback was in March of 2020 when Microchip's stock price was about $71. Since then, we have done 5 other buyback transactions at various stock prices. By doing these various buyback transactions, we have purchased a total of $3.884 billion in face value of our convertible bonds. 
For the transactions from March 2020 to December 2020, we issued a total of about 27.5 million shares of our common stock to the investors for in-the-money value of their bonds. If these bonds had remained outstanding until an assumed stock price of $160 per share, the dilution would have been about 36.4 million shares. Thus, our repurchases had the impact of creating a savings of about 8.9 million shares worth $1.424 billion savings to our investors at that assumed price of $160 per share. 
This calculation does not include our February 2021 transaction, which was very recent and executed at $163.25 per share, so it is not yet accretive. While we have not done any open market stock buybacks in the last year, our convert transactions had the impact of a buyback of approximately 8.9 million shares or about 3% of our outstanding shares. 
We expect to start stock buybacks from the open market after we have achieved an investment-grade rating which we expect within a year, depending on the rating agencies. 
Meanwhile, we did not want to wait for starting higher dividends until our leverage ratio reaches a given number. So we initiated a path to higher dividends in our February 2021 dividend announcement with a 5% dividend increase. We are continuing on this path as we announced today that the Board of Directors have approved a dividend increase of 5.9% sequentially to $0.413 per share up from $0.39 previously. We expect to continue to increase dividends quarterly as part of our cash return strategy. 
With that, operator, will you please pool for questions?"

The backlog was so strong and constraints were so widespread, as Ganesh mentioned in his 40-year career and mine, 42 plus year care",468,"Well, going back to as we implemented the program and why we implemented the program, let's kind of revisit that history. 
The backlog was so strong and constraints were so widespread, as Ganesh mentioned in his 40-year career and mine, 42 plus year careers, we have never seen this kind of shortage in constraints in the semiconductor industry. 
So the question really became, how do we take our customers in various segments, not only automotive but industrial and communications and data centers and PCs and all and allow them some mechanism where they can get preferred supply of parts, and it's something in it for them and something in it for us. And the design of that program became the Preferred Supply Program in which we asked that if you could give us 12 months of noncancelable nonreschedulable backlog. 
And there is a tremendous benefit to Microchip. We could buy supplies ahead, we could hire people, we could make capital investment. We could do all these things with the assurity of a very, very large, solid, noncancelable, nonreschedulable backlog, that's a benefit to us. 
And what the customer gets is after a 6-month period, and we did that 6 months period because we don't want to create a lot of churn in the first 6 months, and there was more availability of capacity after 6 months. So at that point in time, we said anybody who gives a PSP backlog, they will get the preferred supply. And if there is any shortage at that time, it will be spread among the non PSP customers. 
So long answer, but that's really how the program came about, not knowing what the acceptance would be and the results just have been absolutely tremendous. We have billions of dollars of PSP backlog, 44% of the total backlog. On some of the most constrained supply corridors, the PSP backlog is almost equal to 100% of capacity. 
So you can see the advantage where we could go ahead make those investments or buy additional equipment. 
Now leading then to your question, could this become a permanent landscape. I think it will depend largely on the experience of our customers and Microchip together in the year as we progress. When the cycle ends on the other cycle, when there is a lot of capacity available, customers may not be willing to make a year-long commitment that is nonchangeable. So that's what the customers would be thinking, but the environments go come back and forth. So our intent would be to show the customers how well we serve them because they had PSP and what the benefits are if they continue with that program going forward. 
And I think I'll let Ganesh comment on that. It's really going to be how we manage it going forward."

As I mentioned, the gap between demand and supply grew in the March quarter and continues to be quite large. But we have taken a number of steps to get ahead of when -- whatever change in cycle will come to soften how that landing will take place. 
So we just discussed the PSP in quite a bit of detail. And that gives us 12 months of continuous noncancelable backlog, and that will enable us to spot and plan for whenever that change becomes apparent to us on longer-term backlog. 
The capacity additions we're making. We're not trying to solve the entire gap all in 1 quarter. We're making measured steps every quarter and improvements over multiple quarters. And to the extent we see a change, we will taper off the build plans and capacity additions consistent with that. 
Third is if you look at where our inventory is and where you look at our channel inventories are, at historic lows from the channel perspective and pretty low for us as well. And that gives us time and ability to continue to replenish that inventory. It will help to minimize any underabsorption that might have happened otherwise. And it positions us well to capitalize on whatever the subsequent upcycle will be. There is going to be an up cycle to whatever next down cycle there's going to be. And when that happens, we actually push out capital requirements because we will have replenished some of that inventory. 
And finally, on that, if and when there is that next hard landing or soft landing, for us, what we are doing is our bonus programs and other variable compensation programs, as you've seen in prior cycles, give us a fair amount of liability to mitigate which way our expenses go as we go through the cycles. And that flexibility in operating expenses is one more item that helps us in terms of getting to a soft landing."

So we have -- internally had discussions with the Board what happens now until we get investment-grade rating and what happens after as we bring the stock buyback into the mix. But we're not prepared to dollarize that for you well into the future regarding how much stock buyback and how much dividend and when does it start and all that. So I think it's directionally The Board is committed to continue to increase dividend every quarter. And then as we get to the investment-grade rating, then add the stock buyback into the mix. 
And what that mix would be could also change from time to time, depending on market conditions and stock price and all that. So it's really not all figured out for the next 5 years.

I'm wondering, Steve or Ganesh, if you can comment on how that's impacting both yours and the industry's ability to actually grow supply. 
And then on the demand side, I'm just kind of curious, typically, when demand -- when your demand is this strong, we're usually in an economy that's firing on all cylinders. And yet we're still -- have an economic backdrop, which is probably best described as under potential. And so if we go into the back half of the year, Steve, when we start to see a macro recovery, is there a real risk that supply shortages actually accelerate even further? And why not get ahead of that with even more CapEx?"

If you look at our 8, 10 years of acquisitions that we have done and the consolidations from our perspective, the percentage of what we build, particularly from a fab standpoint, internal versus external, has changed. W",398,"So let me start on the supply side. If you look at our 8, 10 years of acquisitions that we have done and the consolidations from our perspective, the percentage of what we build, particularly from a fab standpoint, internal versus external, has changed. We used to have a higher percentage of it in our in-house fabs. We're now down to about 39% of it is in-house. The balance is down to the foundries. 
We obviously have a higher degree of control and ability to influence in a shorter period of time. the foundry -- the capacity that we built in-house than we do from a foundry standpoint. And so in that sense, that is something that has changed over this period of time. It has never been an issue until this cycle where the imbalance has been so large that the instantaneous response from foundry has been difficult. 
And a high percentage of what Microchip does through foundry is what foundry would consider to be the trailing edge of capacity they have. And that has also been not where all their investments have gone. They're making some but the majority of the investments have been in leading edge, which is where not a lot of our capacity requirements are into. 
Packaging and testing. We've been able to do more in-house, and we've reported on the increases. We're now into the mid-50s as a percentage of our packaging that had been as low as in the high 30s and low 40s as a percentage. So there, as and when we can, we're going as fast as we can. 
We are looking at our capital investments and what do we need to be doing and how -- and a bit of this is finding the right mix between stepping on the accelerator where we have high confidence. PSP backlog, for example, gives us high confidence. And being a little more thoughtful where we have risk of putting a lot of capital in place and then perhaps having under-absorbed capacity. And that's always a judgment call. We make that every month, every quarter with what should our capital posture be. And we could yet change and have increased capital posture as we go into the second half of this year if that demand imbalance continues and persists at the level that it is. Steve, you want to add some more?"

So John, what happened last year was that the biggest destruction of demand really was on the service side, the hospitality, hotels, the airlines, travel, restaurants, golf courses. Basical",340,"Well, let me add to a little economic macro side of his question. So John, what happened last year was that the biggest destruction of demand really was on the service side, the hospitality, hotels, the airlines, travel, restaurants, golf courses. Basically, the  service side of the industry got decimated last year because of social distancing and all that. 
The manufacturing side didn't do that bad. I mean, there was really not a single quarter where our revenue even went down 10%. Most companies in the technology industry and manufacturing industry did reasonably well. Automotive was really bad for 1 quarter, but overall, not too bad. 
So now when you get to the recovery side of it, a fair amount of recovery is likely to take place on the service side, which got so decimated, restaurants and hotels and airlines and travel and vacationers and cruise lines and all that coming back. 
Now as they come back, And people have more money in their pocket with more jobs, certainly some of that money will flow to the hardware, electronics and cars and other things where our product goes, and we will benefit from it. But the big part of the upcoming surge is really going to be on the service side. 
Having said all that, I think demand is very strong now. And as you mentioned, when the economy picks up further steam with all these people coming back on the job, could it really even get more heated. The answer to that is it's definitely possible. 
But the other part of your question was, why not add more capital now. Well, we can't get it. I mean, we have so much capital on order and lead time is long. And some of the scheduled capital gets delayed by a month with a short notice because the supplier is also constrained. So it's not a question of what you can order. We're willing to order more. It's a question of what you can get. We can't get everything we want."

So I think what inventory people need to carry is going to have to be determined by the ultimate market equipment manufacturers, the OEMs. And I think it can be very different in different product lines, right? When you build an $80,000 car and you're constrained by $10 of semiconductor content, the decision you arrive there could be different from when you're building $200 consumer product that you have. 
So each industry, depending on the value of the product they're creating, the profitability of that industry has to decide based on their experience, what is the inventory level that they need to assure themselves of the value of the product that they're trying to ship. And those answers are going to be different. I think some got burned quite badly. I suspect they will be the ones that want to do the most here. 
But there is not a single answer that comes with it. And as far as who foots the bill, ultimately, the manufacturer, the original equipment manufacturer, will foot the bill and more than likely have to pass that on in terms of what they're building to their end customer to the extent that they can. But if the choice is to invest in inventory, that is 2, 3 orders of magnitude less than the value of the product that they're creating, many of them will have to rethink that equation of what kind of just-in-time makes sense for us. Steve, do you want to add to that?"

But I would say that if you look at some of the Japanese car manufacturers did much better this time around because they learned their lesson during the tsunami. And when a lot of the renaissance and other factories were shut down due to earthquake and radiations and all that. So they learned from that time and built a structure where they were not as much relying on JIT and reach the current time with a level of inventory on the semiconductor parts, and they did a lot better. 
And that's really the lesson the U.S. and European auto manufacturers need to learn. And time would tell when the cycle goes the other way, is it all lost and it's just the same standoff, we don't really know. But they have to start thinking that building semiconductors is different than getting a bent metal for doorknob or something. 
Right now, we get some comments that are sometimes laughable, what's the big deal of a lead frame, just bend the metal and make my parts. And it's just not that simple, building semiconductors. So I think a lot of learning needs to happen. And we don't directly ship the parts to the car manufacturers. We have the people in between like the Contis and [ GenTech ] and [ Actives ] and [ Hella ] and all these people. They're in between. So it's really -- so we have a buffer, but the car manufacturers really need to really take the bull by the horn and drive the process to get out of JIT.

In prior cycles, the semiconductor companies put in the additional capacity in place and began to get closer in their self-interest to be able to grow. And the players in the market began to adjust with what they were building and how they were building. 
I would say in my time, probably the sharpest rebound was probably 2008, 2009. And again, we were extremely fortunate in that time because we did not shut down our factories and we kept things running and we grew our inventory. But not all people did that. And we know it did create dislocations as a result of doing that. Steve, do you want to add to that?"

And then we entered the up cycle with a very good amount of inventory position. And through that, we grew a lot, and we did very well. We didn't repeat that this time because this time, we had a very, very substantial debt leverage, which was very high, and therefore, we didn't choose to really put the money into inventory and kept the factories running and all that. 
At that time, I recall, investor concern was what happens if your demand goes down 35%, do you miss the covenant? So sometimes, your memories can be short, but This environment presented different challenges, so we were not able to repeat the experience of 2009 and did not reach this time with a high inventory internally. So -- and we're trying to build it now but unsuccessful because we're shipping as we build. 
The other point I wanted to make is people use this word double ordering. We don't really get double ordering because our parts are all proprietary. You cannot buy from us and from another company for the same socket nor can 2 distributors ship the product into the same socket in the way we register and make it economically impossible for the nondesigning distributor to shift the part into that socket. 
So the only other remaining avenue is a customer orders a little more than what they need, which we never know and we cannot detect. If you want to call it double ordering, there could be some excess ordering by the customers we can't be sure of. But one thing we are sure of is there's no double fulfillment. We are in daily phone calls, escalation meetings with a number of customers, threatened line downs and actual lines down for many of the car manufacturers and others. There is no double fulfillment. People are -- everybody is getting a fraction of what they need. So therefore, there is a fair amount of runway ahead with such a large amount of demand. I think it's going to be the rest of the fiscal year, we're just trying to get our head above the water."

We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual results and events may differ materially. We refer you to our press release today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; and Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chairman. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 financial performance. Ganesh will then give commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.
Net sales in the March quarter were $1.467 billion, which were up 8.5% sequentially and above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 64.1%. Operating expenses were at 23.4% and operating income was a record 40.7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $521.4 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.85, $0.12 above the midpoint of our guidance.
On a GAAP basis in the March quarter, gross margins were a record at 63.2%. Total operating expenses were $618.8 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $232.4 million, special income of $7.2 million, $2.9 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $47.2 million.
The GAAP net income was $116 million or $0.41 per diluted share and was adversely impacted by an $85.6 million loss on debt settlement associated with our convertible debt refinancing activities. Our March quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax benefit recorded on the convertible debt exchange transactions occurring during the period.
For fiscal year 2021, net sales were a record $5.438 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 62.8%. Operating expenses were 23.2% of sales and operating income was a record 39.6% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record $1.784 billion, and EPS was a record of $6.59 per diluted share.
On a GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 62.1%. Operating expenses were 43.7% of sales, and operating income was 18.4% of sales. Net income was $349.4 million and EPS was $1.29 per diluted share.
Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 1.8% in the March quarter and 4.1% for fiscal year 2021. The non-GAAP cash tax rate in the March quarter was lower than originally forecasted due to a variety of factors, including the receipt of a tax refund that had not been forecasted to be received until a later date. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '22 to be about 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.
Our inventory balance at March 31, 2021, was $665 million. We had 112 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter, which was down 8 days from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors at the end of the March quarter were at 22 days, which is a record low level and down from 26 days at the end of the prior quarter. We are ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements.
In the March quarter, we exchanged $359.2 million of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. While these transactions did not impact the overall level of debt on our balance sheet, we believe that these convertible exchanges will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at the end of fiscal year 2021 is $1.263 billion compared to $4.481 billion at the beginning of calendar year 2020, putting our overall capital structure in a much better long-term position.
Our cash flow from operating activities was $449.2 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $282 million. We paid down $369.2 million of total debt in the March quarter. Over the last 11 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition, and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $3.61 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. 
We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. 
Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was a record $652.3 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.375 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 3.71 at March 31, 2021, down from 3.93 at December 31, 2020.
Please note that the amount of the outstanding 2037 bonds were reduced by $156 million during the March quarter as part of our financing transaction. And without this transaction, our net debt-to-EBITDA would have been lower. Our dividend payment in the March quarter was $106.6 million.
Capital expenditures were $55.4 million in the March '21 quarter and $92.6 million for fiscal year 2021. Our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out due to overall industry conditions.
Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be between $225 million and $275 million. Our forecast for the June 2021 quarter's capital expenditures is between $70 million and $90 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $40.2 million.
I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter as well as our June quarter guidance. Ganesh?"

Our March quarter results were strong by every key metric, closing out a tumultuous fiscal year on a very positive note, which was otherwise dominated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
March quarter revenue was an all-time record at $1.467 billion, growing by 8.5% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margins were another record at 64.1%, up 110 basis points from the December quarter as we benefited from improved factory utilization and product mix. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 40.7%, the first time we have broken through the 40% mark. Our journey towards our long-term business model of 65% gross margin and 42% operating margin is off to a good start but still has a lot of hard work ahead of us to achieve. 
Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was above the high end of our guidance at a record $1.85. EBITDA was very strong and achieved another record at $652.3 million, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business through the business cycles. The March quarter also marked 122nd consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. 
I would like to take this occasion to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the March quarter and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team, whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult environment and who work constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in a hyper constrained environment.
Reflecting on our fiscal year 2021 results. We achieved a number of highlights and records in the last year. Revenue was a record $5.438 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record at 62.8%. Non-GAAP operating margin was a record at 39.6%, and non-GAAP EPS was a record at $6.59. 
All in all, the record March quarter results and the record March ending fiscal year 2021 results marks a seamless transition between Steve and I as we each embarked on our new roles to build the next phase of Microchip's long-term success. I'm truly fortunate to be the beneficiary of Steve's years of managing Microchip for the long term.
Taking a look at our business. From a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 12.2% as compared to the December quarter and set new quarterly and fiscal year records. On a year-over-year basis, our March quarter microcontroller revenue was up 12.3%. Microcontrollers represented 55.6% of our revenue in the March quarter. Our analog revenue was sequentially up 11.3% as compared to the December quarter. Analog represented 28.3% of our revenue in the March quarter. Our revenue was sequentially down 6.4% for other as compared to the December quarter and represented 16.1% of our revenue in the March quarter.
Last month, Gartner released their microcontroller market share report for calendar year 2020. Gartner continues to have a large discrepancy versus our publicly reported microcontroller revenue to the tune of $428 million of revenue understatement for all of 2020, predominantly in the 32-bit microcontroller revenue category. Adjusting the Gartner number to use our actual microcontroller revenue, we are pleased to report that for microcontrollers overall, we remain in the #3 spot. However, in 2020, we substantially closed the gap between us and the 2 players ahead of us. We are now within striking distance of each of the 2 players who were just 3.6% ahead of us in revenue as we continue our relentless march towards the #1 spot.
We gained market share in each of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller markets. While our 8-bit and 16-bit microcontroller businesses continue to do well, our 32-bit microcontroller business was our fastest-growing microcontroller business. Our microcontroller portfolio and road map has never been stronger. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain share in 2021 as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Taking a look at our business from a geographic perspective. Americas was up 0.8% sequentially. Europe was up 30.4% sequentially, stronger than what is normally the seasonally strongest quarter. Asia was up 5% sequentially in a quarter when business is normally down due to the Lunar New Year holidays.
Taking a look at our business from an end market perspective. The automotive, industrial and consumer markets remain the strongest markets. The computing end market was strong, while the data center and communications end markets were flat to up a little. The aerospace and defense markets, which tend to be lumpy, was the only end market that was weak.
Business conditions remain exceptionally strong through the quarter with record bookings and backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters. Demand outpaced the capacity improvements we were able to implement, resulting in lead times continuing to extend out.
In my 40 years in the semiconductor industry, I cannot recall a time when the imbalance between the supply and demand has been more acute. In response, we launched our Preferred Supply Program, or PSP, to provide customers with supply priority beginning 6 months after their order in exchange for at least 12 months of noncancelable orders. Customer response to the program has exceeded our expectations with direct customers and distributors alike. About 44% of our backlog is now in the PSP category, although it is almost 100% of our backlog in some of the most constrained capacity corridors. 
Additional PSP backlog continues to come in every week. This gives us a solid foundation to enable us to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps.
With the strong demand, we're experiencing constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We started ramping our internal factories in September as well as investing in capital additions to expand our internal capacity. We are making incremental capacity decisions for our internal factories where possible based on the strength of our backlog, especially our noncancelable PSP backlog, which is reflected in our fiscal year '22 capital forecast of $225 million to $275 million.
We also work closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry, assembly, test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Through the combination of internal and external capacity actions we have taken, we expect our overall capacity will continue to grow every quarter in calendar year 2021. While our capacity will continue to grow every quarter, we also believe that wafer fab as well as assembly and test constraints will persist through 2021 and quite likely into 2022.
Now let's get into the guidance for the June quarter. Our backlog for the June quarter is very strong. In addition, we have considerable backlog requested by customers in the June quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from the last quarter. This is because the entire semiconductor supply chain remains constrained.
Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the June quarter to be up between 3.5% and 7.5% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes continued operational constraints, some of which we will work through during the quarter and others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters.
For the June quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 64.1% and 64.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.1% and 23.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 40.6% and 41.4% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.85 and $1.95.
Please keep in mind that our non-GAAP EPS forecast for the June quarter includes a 420 basis point higher tax rate assumption than the March quarter. We also expect to pay down another approximately $325 million of our debt in the June quarter.
Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization and intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.
Finally, as we announced on our February conference call, based on the strong cash generation characteristics of our business in upcycles and downcycles, we have modified our capital allocation thought process to pivot to a cash return strategy, which has received very positive investor feedback.
Steve will now provide more details on this strategy as well as the long-term thinking that informs our actions in this regard. Steve?"

Today, I would like to provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. But before I do that, I would like to say how I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered a",561,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. But before I do that, I would like to say how I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered a flawless quarter and making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage and record EBITDA. 
Now I will turn to updating you on the cash return strategy. We completed the March quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of 3.71, excluding the long-dated 2037 maturity converts that are more equity-like in nature. At the rate we are paying down debt, we expect to break a net debt leverage ratio of 3 within a year and continue to decrease from there. Around that time, we would also expect to achieve an investment-grade rating, but the exact timing will depend on the analysis of the rating agencies. At that time, we expect to begin distributing more of our substantial amount of free cash flow to our investors in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.
Regarding buybacks, through our various convertible debt exchanges, we have essentially bought a substantial amount of stock back from the future. This is because as the stock price rises and exceeds the conversion price of the debt, convertible debt dilutes the share count. Buying converts back prevents future dilution as the stock price rises.
Our first convert buyback was in March of 2020 when Microchip's stock price was about $71. Since then, we have done 5 other buyback transactions at various stock prices. By doing these various buyback transactions, we have purchased a total of $3.884 billion in face value of our convertible bonds.
For the transactions from March 2020 to December 2020, we issued a total of about 27.5 million shares of our common stock to the investors for in-the-money value of their bonds. If these bonds had remained outstanding until an assumed stock price of $160 per share, the dilution would have been about 36.4 million shares. Thus, our repurchases had the impact of creating a savings of about 8.9 million shares worth $1.424 billion savings to our investors at that assumed price of $160 per share.
This calculation does not include our February 2021 transaction, which was very recent and executed at $163.25 per share, so it is not yet accretive. While we have not done any open market stock buybacks in the last year, our convert transactions had the impact of a buyback of approximately 8.9 million shares or about 3% of our outstanding shares. We expect to start stock buybacks from the open market after we have achieved an investment-grade rating, which we expect within a year depending on the rating agencies.
Meanwhile, we did not want to wait for starting higher dividends until our leverage ratio reaches a given number. So we initiated a path to higher dividends in our February 2021 dividend announcement with a 5% dividend increase. We are continuing on this path as we announced today that the Board of Directors have approved a dividend increase of 5.9% sequentially to $0.413 per share up from $0.39 previously. We expect to continue to increase dividends quarterly as part of our cash return strategy.
With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

The backlog was so strong and constraints were so widespread. As Ganesh mentioned, in his 40-year career and mine, 42 plus year careers, we have never seen this kind of shortage and constraints in the semiconductor industry. 
So the question really became how do we take our key customers in various segments, not only automotive but industrial and communications and data centers and PCs and all, and allow them some mechanism where they can get preferred supply of parts and it's something in it for them and something in it for us. And the design of that program became this Preferred Supply Program in which we asked that if you could give us 12 months of noncancelable, nonreschedulable backlog, and there is a tremendous benefit to Microchip, we could buy supplies ahead, we could hire people, we could make capital investment, we could do all these things with the surety of a very, very large, solid, noncancelable, nonscheduleable backlog, that's a benefit to us.
And what the customer gets is after a 6-month period, and we did that 6-month period because we don't want to create a lot of churn in the first 6 months and there was more availability of capacity after 6 months, so at that point in time, we said anybody who gives PSP backlog, they will get the preferred supply. And if there is any shortage at that time, it will be spread among the non-PSP customers. 
So long answer, but that's really how the program came about, not knowing what the acceptance would be, and the results just have been absolutely tremendous. We have billions of dollars of PSP backlog, 44% of the total backlog. On some of the most constrained supply corridors, the PSP backlog is almost equal to 100% of capacity. So you can see the advantage where we could go ahead, make those investments or buy additional equipment.
Now leading then to your question. Could this become a permanent landscape? I think it will depend largely on the experience of our customers and Microchip together in the year as we progress. When the cycle ends on the other cycle, when there is a lot of capacity available, customers may not be willing to make a year-long commitment that is nonchangeable. So that's what the customers would be thinking, but the environments go -- come back and forth. So our intent would be to show the customers how well we serve them because they had PSP and what the benefits are if they continue with that program going forward.
And I think I'll let Ganesh comment on that. It's really going to be how we manage it going forward."

As I mentioned, the gap between demand and supply grew in the March quarter and continues to be quite large. But we have taken a number of steps to get ahead of when whatever change in the cycle will come to soften how that landing will take place. So we just discussed the PSP in quite a bit of detail. And that gives us 12 months of continuous noncancelable backlog, and that will enable us to spot and plan for whenever that change becomes apparent to us on longer-term backlog.
The capacity additions we're making. We're not trying to solve the entire gap all in 1 quarter. We're making measured steps every quarter and improvements over multiple quarters. And to the extent we see a change, we will taper off the build plans and capacity additions consistent with that.
Third is if you look at where our inventory is and where you look at our channel inventories are, they're at historic lows from the channel perspective and pretty low for us as well. And that gives us time and ability to continue to replenish that inventory. It will help to minimize any underabsorption that might have happened otherwise. And it positions us well to capitalize on whatever the subsequent upcycle will be. There is going to be an upcycle to whatever next downcycle there's going to be. And when that happens, we actually push out capital requirements because we will have replenished some of that inventory.
And finally, on that, if and when there is that next hard landing or soft landing, for us, what we are doing is our bonus programs and other variable compensation programs, as you've seen in prior cycles, give us a fair amount of ability to mitigate which way our expenses go as we go through the cycles. And that flexibility in operating expenses is one more item that helps us in terms of getting to a soft landing."

I'm wondering, Steve or Ganesh, if you can comment on how that's impacting both yours and the industry's ability to actually grow supply. 
And then on the demand side, I'm just kind of curious. Typically, when demand -- when your demand is this strong, we're usually in an economy that's firing on all cylinders. And yet we're still -- have an economic backdrop which is probably best described as under potential. And so if we go into the back half of the year, Steve, when we start to see a macro recovery, is there a real risk that supply shortages actually accelerate even further? And why not get ahead of that with even more CapEx?"
31500,711405184,2273886,"Microchip Technology Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","So let me start on the supply side. If you look at our 8, 10 years of acquisitions that we have done and the consolidations from our perspective, the percentage of what we build, particularly from a fab standpoint, internal versus external, has changed. W",397,"So let me start on the supply side. If you look at our 8, 10 years of acquisitions that we have done and the consolidations from our perspective, the percentage of what we build, particularly from a fab standpoint, internal versus external, has changed. We used to have a higher percentage of it in our in-house fabs. We're now down to about 39% of it is in-house. The balance is down to the foundries.
We obviously have a higher degree of control and ability to influence in a shorter period of time, the foundry -- capacity that we built in-house than we do from a foundry standpoint. And so in that sense, that is something that has changed over this period of time. It has never been an issue until this cycle where the imbalance has been so large that the instantaneous response from foundry has been difficult.
And a high percentage of what Microchip does through foundry is what foundry would consider to be the trailing edge of capacity they have. And that has also been not where all their investments have gone. They're making some, but the majority of the investments have been in leading edge, which is where not a lot of our capacity requirements are into.
Packaging and testing. We've been able to do more in-house, and we've reported on the increases. We're now into the mid-50s as a percentage of our packaging that had been as low as in the high 30s and low 40s as a percentage. So there, as and when we can, we're going as fast as we can.
We are looking at our capital investments and what do we need to be doing and how -- and a bit of this is finding the right mix between stepping on the accelerator where we have high confidence, PSP backlog, for example, gives us high confidence, And being a little more thoughtful where we have risk of putting a lot of capital in place and then perhaps having under-absorbed capacity. And that's always a judgment call. We make that every month, every quarter with what should our capital posture be. And we could yet change and have increased capital posture as we go into the second half of this year if that demand imbalance continues and persists at the level that it is. 
Steve, you want to add some more?"

So John, what happened last year was that the biggest destruction of demand really was on the service side, the hospitality, hotels, the airlines, travel, restaurants, golf courses. Basical",340,"Well, let me add to a little economic macro side of his question. So John, what happened last year was that the biggest destruction of demand really was on the service side, the hospitality, hotels, the airlines, travel, restaurants, golf courses. Basically, the service side of the industry got decimated last year because of social distancing and all that. The manufacturing side didn't do that bad. I mean there was really not a single quarter where our revenue even went down 10%. Most companies in the technology industry and manufacturing industry did reasonably well. Automotive was really bad for 1 quarter, but overall, not too bad.
So now when you get to the recovery side of it, a fair amount of recovery is likely to take place on the service side, which got so decimated, restaurants and hotels and airlines and travel and vacationers and cruise lines and all that coming back. Now as they come back and people have more money in their pocket with more jobs, certainly some of that money will flow to the hardware, electronics and cars and other things where our product goes, and we will benefit from it. But the big part of the upcoming surge is really going to be on the service side.
Having said all that, I think demand is very strong now. And as you mentioned, when the economy picks up further steam with all these people coming back on the job, could it really even get more heated? The answer to that is it's definitely possible.
But the other part of your question was, why not add more capital now? Well, we can't get it. I mean we have so much capital on order and lead time is long. And some of the scheduled capital gets delayed by a month with a short notice because the supplier is also constrained. So it's not a question of what you can order. We're willing to order more. It's a question of what you can get. We can't get everything we want."

So each industry, depending on the value of the product they're creating, the profitability of that industry has to decide based on their experience what is the inventory level that they need to assure themselves of the value of the product that they're trying to ship. And those answers are going to be different. I think some got burned quite badly. I suspect they will be the ones that want to do the most here.
But there is not a single answer that comes with it. And as far as who foots the bill, ultimately, the manufacturer -- the original equipment manufacturer will foot the bill and more than likely have to pass that on in terms of what they're building to their end customer to the extent that they can. But if the choice is to invest in inventory that is 2, 3 orders of magnitude less than the value of the product that they're creating, many of them will have to rethink that equation of what kind of just-in-time makes sense for them. 
Steve, do you want to add to that?"

But I would say that if you look at some of the Japanese car manufacturers did much better this time around because they learned their lesson during the tsunami and when a lot of the renaissance and other factories",278,"I don't really have a whole lot to add. But I would say that if you look at some of the Japanese car manufacturers did much better this time around because they learned their lesson during the tsunami and when a lot of the renaissance and other factories were shut down due to earthquake and radiations and all that. So they learned from that time and built a structure where they were not as much relying on JIT and reach the current time with a level of inventory on the semiconductor parts, and they did a lot better.
And that's really the lesson the U.S. and European auto manufacturers need to learn. And time would tell. When the cycle goes the other way, is it all lost and it's just the same standoff, we don't really know. But they have to start thinking that building semiconductors is different than getting a bent metal for doorknob or something.
Right now, we get some comments that are sometimes laughable. What's the big deal about the lead frame? Just bend the metal and make my parts. And it's just not that simple, building semiconductors. So I think a lot of learning needs to happen. And we don't directly ship the parts to the car manufacturers. We have the people in between like the Contis and Gentex and Aptivs and Hella and all these people. They're in between. So it's really -- so we have a buffer, but the car manufacturers really need to really take the bull by the horn and drive the process to get out of JIT. And I don't know whether they will. I don't know that."

In prior cycles, the semiconductor companies put in the additional capacity in place and began to get closer in their self-interest to be able to grow. And the players in the market began to adjust with what they were building and how they were building.
I would say in my time frame, probably the sharpest rebound was probably 2008, 2009. And again, we were extremely fortunate in that time because we did not shut down our factories and we kept things running and we grew our inventory. But not all people did that. And we know it did create dislocations as a result of doing that. 
Steve, do you want to add to that?"

And then we entered the upcycle with a very good amount of inventory position. And through that, we grew a lot and we did very well. We didn't repeat that this time because this time, we had a very, very substantial debt leverage, which was very high. And therefore, we didn't choose to really put the money into inventory and kept the factories running and all that.
At that time, I recall, investor concern was what happens if your demand goes down 35%? Do you miss the covenant? So sometimes, your memories can be short, but this environment presented different challenges. So we were not able to repeat the experience of 2009 and did not reach this time with a high inventory internally. And we're trying to build it now but unsuccessful because we're shipping as we build.
The other point I wanted to make is people use this word double ordering. We don't really get double ordering because our parts are all proprietary. You cannot buy from us and from another company for the same socket nor can 2 distributors ship the product into the same socket in the way we register and make it economically impossible for the nondesigning distributor to ship the part into that socket.
So the only other remaining avenue is a customer orders a little more than what they need, which we never know and we cannot detect. If you want to call it double ordering, there could be some excess ordering by the customers we can't be sure of. But one thing we are sure of is there's no double fulfillment. We are in daily phone calls, escalation meetings with a number of customers, threatened line downs and actual lines down for many of the car manufacturers and others. 
There is no double fulfillment. People are -- everybody is getting a fraction of what they need. So therefore, there is a fair amount of runway ahead. With such a large amount of demand, I think it's going to be the rest of the fiscal year. We're just trying to get our head above the water."

We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; and Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide a financial business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website. We will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margins and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I was referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. 
Net sales in the June quarter were $1.569 billion, which was up 7% sequentially and about 150 basis points above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance given on May 6. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 64.8% and operating income was a record 41.7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $558.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record of $1.98 and $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter gross margin [Technical Difficulty] Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '22 to be about 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. 
Our inventory balance at June 30, 2021, was $683.8 million. We had 111 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was down 1 day from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 20 days which is a record low level and down from 22 days at the end of the prior quarter. We are ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. 
In the June quarter, we issued a $1 billion senior secured note maturing on September 1, 2024, and bearing interest at 0.983%. We used the proceeds from this bond offering to repay a $1 billion senior secured note that matured on June 1, 2021, that had an interest rate of 3.922%. We believe this was another excellent transaction for us as we continue to enhance our capital structure on our path to becoming an investment-grade rated company. 
Our cash flow from operating activities was a record at $629.9 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $279.7 million. We paid down $388 million of total debt in the June quarter. Over the last 12 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $4 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. 
We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this time period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. 
Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record $711.7 million and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.524 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 3.34% at June 30, 2021, down from 3.71% at March 31. 
Our dividend payment in the June quarter was $113.1 million. Capital expenditures were $86.3 million in the June quarter. Our forecast for the September 2021 quarter's capital expenditures is between $75 million and $95 million. Our capital expenditures for all of fiscal year '22 are expected to be between $300 million and $350 million. 
As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out due to overall industry conditions. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $41.2 million. 
I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh?"

Our June quarter results continue to be strong, leading off our fiscal year '22 on a positive note. June quarter revenue was an all-time record of $1.57 billion, growing 7% sequentially and was 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our guidance provided on May 5. 
On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter revenue was up 19.8%. Non-GAAP gross margins were another record at 64.8%, up 70 basis points from the March quarter as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved fixed cost absorption. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 41.7%, up 100 basis points from the March quarter. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was above the high end of our guidance at a record $1.98 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the June quarter was again very strong and achieved another record at $701.7 million, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business through the business cycles. 
The June quarter marked 123rd consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to take this occasion to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the June quarter and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team, whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult environment and who worked constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in an extremely constrained and challenging environment. 
Taking a look at our business from a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 10.7% as compared to the March quarter and set a new quarterly record. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter microcontroller revenue was up 26%. Each of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller product lines established new all-time revenue records. 
As we have told you many times in the past, rumors of the death of 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers have been greatly exaggerated. The customers and applications served by microcontrollers are highly fragmented and require a wide range of solutions that span the breadth of our microcontroller product lines. 
Microcontrollers represented 57.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. Our analog revenue was sequentially up 4.1% as compared to the March quarter, also setting a record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter analog revenue was up 16.7%. Analog represented 27.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. 
Other revenue was sequentially up 5.1% in the June quarter, bouncing back from a 6.4% sequential decline in the March quarter. Other revenue represented 15% of our revenue in the June quarter. 
Taking a look at our business from a geographic perspective, Americas was up 6.1% sequentially. Europe was down 2.3% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonal performance and came off of a very strong 30.4% sequential growth in the March quarter. Asia was up a strong 11.1% sequentially, reflecting better than typical seasonal growth. 
From an end market perspective, all end markets were strong in the June quarter. Business conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter with record bookings and backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters accentuated by our Preferred Supply Program or PSP, which continues to be over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. 
Demand outpaced the capacity improvements we were able to make -- we were able to implement in the quarter. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which customers want to ship in the June quarter continued to climb significantly, resulting in lead time for many line items continuing to stretch out. 
We experienced constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry, assembly test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Through the combination of internal and external actions that we have taken, we expect we will be in a position to support revenue growth for at least each of the next 4 quarters. 
Despite that, we also expect that wafer fab as well as assembly and test constraints will persist through at least the middle of 2022. We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps. 
Our capital spending plans are rising in response to growth opportunities in our business as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments by our outsourced fab assembly and test partners in technologies that they may consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. 
The increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share and give us more control over our destiny for trailing edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners but our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities, which may not align with ours. 
We also expect that while our capital intensity may be slightly higher in any given year, and the 3% to 4% of revenue guidance we have provided in the past. When looked at in the context of a rolling 3-year view, we believe we will very much be in the range of our capital spending guidance. 
Now let me get into the guidance for the September quarter. Our backlog for the September quarter is very strong. In addition, we have considerable backlog requested by customers in the September quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from last quarter. This is because the entire semiconductor supply chain remains very constrained. 
Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially. 
Our guidance range assumes continued operational constraints, some of which we will work through during the quarter others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be 25.8%. We believe achievement of this revenue level will be remarkable in and of itself, but even more so, given how resilient our business was 1 year ago during the pandemic because of the diversity of our end market exposure, thus making the year-over-year comparisons that much tougher and meaningful. 
For the September quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be between 64.8% and 65.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.8% and 23.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 41.6% and 42.4% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $2.05 per share and $2.17 per share. We also expect to pay down another approximately $350 million of our debt in the September quarter. 
Now we recognize that our gross and operating margin percentage guidance effectively gets us to the long-term targets we shared with you just 9 months ago. We will be working to update our business model for annual growth gross margin and operating margin percentage, and we'll share our conclusions with you later this year. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. 
We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call. 
Now let me pass the baton to Steve to talk about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?"

Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all",490,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. 
Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter and making new records in many respects. Namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, a record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record cash flow from operation and record adjusted EBITDA. Also, each of our strategic product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers and analog individually achieved all-time new records in net sales. 
Reflecting on our journey since the acquisition of Microsemi 3 years ago, I note the following: number one, at the time of the acquisition, we provided a long-term operating model target of 40.5% non-GAAP operating margin, which we exceeded for the first time in the March 2021 quarter and we're significantly above that in the June 2021 quarter at 41.7%. 
At the time of the acquisition, we also indicated that we anticipated achieving an $8 non-GAAP EPS run rate by the end of the third year after the acquisition. Between the $1.98 EPS for the June quarter we just announced, and $2.11 EPS we guided to for the September quarter at the midpoint of our guidance, we have effectively delivered on this expectation. These exceptional results were achieved despite the numerous headwinds we faced from international trade tensions and tariffs as well as the global pandemic which matters were not predictable 3 years ago. 
Number two, we financed the Microsemi acquisition by adding $8.1 billion of debt, driving up our net leverage ratio in the June 2018 quarter to 4.95%, which we know was a concern for many of you. In the last 3 years, we have paid down a cumulative of debt and brought our net leverage ratio down to 3.34%. 
We continue to allocate substantially all of our cash generation beyond what we paid to shareholders in dividends to pay down significant debt every quarter. Number three, within the last quarter, based on the debt paydown we had achieved and the continued strong cash and adjusted EBITDA generation of our business, both Moody's and Fitch changed their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook. 
At the rate we expect to pay down our debt and bring our net leverage further down, we believe we are on target to achieve an investment-grade rating sometime by the end of fiscal year 2022. Regarding our cash return strategy, we are continuing to provide more cash return to the shareholders. Just today, we announced a dividend of $0.437 per share our third largest dividend increase by increasing the dividend by 5.8% sequentially and 18.75% over a year ago quarter. And in the coming quarters, we expect to continue with more actions to increase the cash return to shareholders. 
With that, operator, will you please poll for questions."

Or was there something else behind the beat. 
And Ganesh you talked about you guys performing already in line with your long-term model.

So distributors continue to service customers but we are not able to help them grow that inventory. At some point, we will be able to as we get our production up, to be able to ship them more for them to help build that. 
But for the moment, neither their customers nor distribution has the ability to grow inventory in any meaningful form. When we look at where are the number of customer requests we're getting either direct or indirect through distribution on shortages, lines downs and all that. It's pretty well represented across the spectrum. It isn't that 1 group of customers is doing better than the other. There are a large number of customers who are unable to get what they want and are in the short or medium term, trying to get more product, in some cases, trying to get product through more than 1 source if they can. 
But the constraints are all over the place. And so I'm not seeing channel inventory or customer inventory building in a way that you can read something into the distribution days of inventory."

So I think we'll give you the quarter-by-quarter growth as we get to the guidance for the December and March and June quarters and all that.

Our PSP backlog exiting the June quarter was over 50%, and it grew throughout the quarter. And we have customers continuing to enroll in the program as well as extend the time that they're providing as the backlog. 
But the metric is really something that was important to us to convey during the early stages of launching the PSP program. And so at this point in time rather than trying to provide a month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter update. It's a part of our normal business that we're doing. Certain capacity corridors, as I've explained are 100% booked already. And we will just manage it. It gives us visibility. It gives us a better ability to service those customers who have long-term backlog that take in place that are -- that's noncancelable. 
That was the whole objective of what we did. And then to your second question, in many ways, PSP is 1 element of what we have that helps us to make sure that the other side of the cycle whenever it is, can be managed well. We're also bringing capacity on in measured steps. We're not trying to get all of the unsupported done in a short period of time. 
So every quarter, we're increasing capacity.

And we were -- I think we were probably about only $700 million, $750 million company, and we were trying to scale the business 10x so that we don't have a competitive disadvantage against a larger competitor. 
So TI is still larger, but many of the others, Infineons and STs and and ADIs and we've really caught up to all of them in the last 12, 13 years by scaling the business, almost 10x at the current quarter guidance, we're running somewhere in the excess of $6.5 billion. And we wanted to do that while building a portfolio of products around the microcontroller so that we can provide the entire total system solution to the customers. 
Having analog, some memory, some connectivity, USB, Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth and all that, power management and everything else. So those 2 things we accomplished we scale the business almost 10x, and we acquired organically built all these products to be able to complete customers' solution. So at this point in time, and I think we have said a couple of times that we don't find the next acquisition to be necessary. 
Given small acquisitions here and there, tuck-in type if the opportunity arises, we would, but we're not really working on or looking at any large acquisition because that's strategically not needed today. We have enough product portfolio, and we're working very hard to train our sales force and customers to be able to use the entire total system solution from Microchip and show the organic growth. And as we adopt that strategy and as we pay down a substantial amount of debt already and continue to pay it further, then you have a large somewhere around $1.5 billion burning hole in your pocket. And what do you do with that? You are saying, why don't we acquire? And I'm saying, we do not find that strategically needed today. So what we're planning to do is as we achieve the investment-grade rating and as the debt level comes down further, then we start giving larger and larger amount of cash back to the shareholders some in the form of dividend and some starting a buyback program.

And more importantly, what would be the causes of the next cycle. And I think to a large extent, those will determine what the responses will be in it. I certainly don't think government help is going to be the answer to any of these cycles. And from usually when a government begins to think of something, the cycle is long passed before they can even act with respect to that.

First, what happened within the industry that is kind of causing shortage in foundry and recognizing that the industry really didn't -- the foundry industry didn't really expand capacity and lagging edge nodes in the past.

And then following that, if you are going to increase your reliance on internal capacity, how is it that you stay within the same 3% to 4% of revenue CapEx model? How does that work going forward?"

Well, the normal reaction you would say, well, why aren't they building more? Well, the economics of that for the foundries and the opportunity cost versus other capital objectives that they have, don't always lend themselves as saying that trailing edge capacity is where they want to be invested. It's not that they're making no investments. They are, but they're not fast enough and they're not at a rate for products that we consider to be important for us. 
And we're not doing it across the board. We're just picking and choosing places where we think there is significant constraint for us or opportunity for us to make that investment. And that is true not only in the fabs it's true in assembly and test as well as to why we're doing it and what we're seeing. It will mean that we will continue to use all of the capacity available from our foundry and assembly test partners plus we will try to make sure that we have where we can additional capacity to be able to not be constrained by what is available only from our outside partners itself. 
In terms of the CapEx itself, I mean, you've seen -- if you go back and look at our history, last 5, 10 years, you'll find that we have gone above and below that 3% to 5% -- 3% to 4% number. I think the 2 years previous to this, we were at about 1%, and that's where the cycle was. That's what we needed in that. So I think a 3-year look gives you a better sense. And we could spend more than 3% to 4% in any given year as we look at investing at a time when that need is there and then we'll breathe with that capacity and let it all build out over that time. 
But at this point in time, that's what we feel comfortable with. If that changes in time, we'll keep you posted. But all this capital that we're investing, all the capacity we're bringing on, all of it, we think, will be accretive to our gross margins and will enable growth that we could otherwise not have had if not only choice was to take it outside."

Ordinarily, when the industry has a normal kind of growth rate, whatever it was over the last 10, 15 years, usually, a movement to the faster node by the leading-edge guys kept freeing up enough trailing",289,"I'd like to clarify the foundry part of the answer. Ordinarily, when the industry has a normal kind of growth rate, whatever it was over the last 10, 15 years, usually, a movement to the faster node by the leading-edge guys kept freeing up enough trailing as a capacity so that the trailing edge guys didn't get constrained. Because the leading edge capacity of today is a trailing edge capacity of 5, 6 years down the line. 
And that's how trailing edge capacity became available because it was originally built for people who wanted more leading edge. And then many years later, that was available for the trailing edge. But when the industry grew, this year at the rate it has grown, most companies have announced year-over-year growth rates of 20% plus. Our September guidance is, I think, about 25% up versus the same quarter a year ago, then that is the growth rate on the trailing edge technology is much, much higher than really what would become available through an ordinary process of nodes moving up. 
And so therefore, the leading-edge capacity is constrained also today. It's not like there's all the capacity available at 14-nanometer and 28-nanometer they're all constrained also. But foundries are willing to add capacity on the more leading-edge nodes than they are on the trailing edge, given the choice of their capital allocation and their priorities, they are working on more relieving the leading-edge capacity, leaving the trailing edge, much more constrained because of the -- such an aggressive growth. 
If the growth of the industry returns back to a much more normal over the 10 years, and it's quite possible that the trailing edge capacity will not be as constrained again."

PSP customers are coming to us as much from distribution as well. So I would not take PSP and say it's direct customers only.

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. 
We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; and Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and financial business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website. We will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margins and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I was referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. 
Net sales in the June quarter were $1.569 billion, which was up 7% sequentially and about 150 basis points above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance given on May 6. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 64.8% and operating income was a record 41.7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $558.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record of $1.98, $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were a record at 64.2% and include the impact of $8.8 million of share based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $638.8 million and include acquisition, intangible amortization of $215.6 million, special charges of $10.5 million, $3.6 million of acquisition related and other costs, and share based compensation of $47.8 million. GAAP net income was $252.8 million or $0.89 per diluted share. 
Our June quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably tax reserve releases associated with statute limitations expiring. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '22 to be about 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. 
Our inventory balance at June 30, 2021, was $683.8 million. We had 111 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was down 1 day from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 20 days which is a record low level and down from 22 days at the end of the prior quarter. We are ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. 
In the June quarter, we issued a $1 billion senior secured note maturing on September 1, 2024, and bearing interest at 0.983%. We used the proceeds from this bond offering to repay a $1 billion senior secured note that matured on June 1, 2021, that had an interest rate of 3.922%. We believe this was another excellent transaction for us as we continue to enhance our capital structure on our path to becoming an investment-grade rated company. 
Our cash flow from operating activities was a record at $629.9 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $279.7 million. We paid down $388 million of total debt in the June quarter. Over the last 12 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $4 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. 
We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this time period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. 
Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record $711.7 million and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.524 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature was 3.34% at June 30, 2021, down from 3.71% at March 31. 
Our dividend payment in the June quarter was $113.1 million. Capital expenditures were $86.3 million in the June quarter. Our forecast for the September 2021 quarter's capital expenditures is between $75 million and $95 million. Our capital expenditures for all of fiscal year '22 are expected to be between $300 million and $350 million. 
As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out due to overall industry conditions. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $41.2 million. 
I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh?"

Our June quarter results continue to be strong, leading off our fiscal year '22 on a positive note. June quarter revenue was an all-time record of $1.57 billion, growing 7% sequentially and was 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our guidance provided on May 5.
On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter revenue was up 19.8%. Non-GAAP gross margins were another record at 64.8%, up 70 basis points from the March quarter as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved fixed cost absorption. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 41.7%, up 100 basis points from the March quarter. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was above the high end of our guidance at a record $1.98 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the June quarter was again very strong and achieved another record at $701.7 million, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business through the business cycles. 
The June quarter marked 123rd consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to take this occasion to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the June quarter and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team, whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult environment and who worked constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in an extremely constrained and challenging environment. 
Taking a look at our business from a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 10.7% as compared to the March quarter and set a new quarterly record. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter microcontroller revenue was up 26%. Each of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller product lines established new all-time revenue records. 
As we have told you many times in the past, rumors of the death of 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers have been greatly exaggerated. The customers and applications served by microcontrollers are highly fragmented and require a wide range of solutions that span the breadth of our microcontroller product lines. 
Microcontrollers represented 57.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. Our analog revenue was sequentially up 4.1% as compared to the March quarter, also setting a record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter analog revenue was up 16.7%. Analog represented 27.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. 
Other revenue was sequentially up 5.1% in the June quarter, bouncing back from a 6.4% sequential decline in the March quarter. Other revenue represented 15% of our revenue in the June quarter. 
Taking a look at our business from a geographic perspective. Americas was up 6.1% sequentially. Europe was down 2.3% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonal performance and came off of a very strong 30.4% sequential growth in the March quarter. Asia was up a strong 11.1% sequentially, reflecting better than typical seasonal growth. 
From an end market perspective, all end markets were strong in the June quarter. Business conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter with record bookings and backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters accentuated by our Preferred Supply Program, or PSP, which continues to be over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. 
Demand outpaced the capacity improvements we were able to make -- we were able to implement in the quarter. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which customers want to ship in the June quarter continued to climb significantly, resulting in lead time for many line items continuing to stretch out. 
We experienced constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry assembly test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Through the combination of internal and external actions that we have taken, we expect -- we will be in a position to support revenue growth for at least each of the next 4 quarters. 
Despite that, we also expect that wafer fab as well as assembly and test constraints will persist through at least the middle of 2022. We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps. 
Our capital spending plans are rising in response to growth opportunities in our business as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments by our outsourced fab, assembly and test partners in technologies that they may consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. 
The increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share and give us more control over our destiny for trailing edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners but our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities, which may not align with ours. 
We also expect that while our capital intensity may be slightly higher in any given year, and the 3% to 4% of revenue guidance we have provided in the past, when looked at in the context of a rolling 3-year view, we believe we will very much be in the range of our capital spending guidance. 
Now let me get into the guidance for the September quarter. Our backlog for the September quarter is very strong. In addition, we have considerable backlog requested by customers in the September quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from last quarter. This is because the entire semiconductor supply chain remains very constrained. 
Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes continued operational constraints, some of which we will work through during the quarter, others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be 25.8%. We believe achievement of this revenue level will be remarkable in and of itself, but even more so, given how resilient our business was 1 year ago during the pandemic because of the diversity of our end market exposure, thus making the year-over-year comparisons that much tougher and meaningful. 
For the September quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be between 64.8% and 65.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.8% and 23.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 41.6% and 42.4% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $2.05 per share and $2.17 per share. We also expect to pay down another approximately $350 million of our debt in the September quarter. 
Now we recognize that our gross and operating margin percentage guidance effectively gets us to the long-term targets we shared with you just 9 months ago. We will be working to update our business model for annual growth, gross margin and operating margin percentage, and we'll share our conclusions with you later this year. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. 
We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call. 
Now let me pass the baton to Steve to talk about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?"

Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all",492,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. 
Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter and making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, a record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record cash flow from operation and record adjusted EBITDA. Also, each of our strategic product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers and analog individually achieved all-time new records in net sales. 
Reflecting on our journey since the acquisition of Microsemi 3 years ago, I note the following: number one, at the time of the acquisition, we provided a long-term operating model target of 40.5% non-GAAP operating margin, which we exceeded for the first time in the March 2021 quarter and we're significantly above that in the June 2021 quarter at 41.7%. 
At the time of the acquisition, we also indicated that we anticipated achieving an $8 non-GAAP EPS run rate by the end of the third year after the acquisition. Between the $1.98 EPS for the June quarter we just announced, and $2.11 EPS we guided to for the September quarter at the midpoint of our guidance, we have effectively delivered on this expectation. These exceptional results were achieved despite the numerous headwinds we faced from international trade tensions and tariffs as well as the global pandemic which matters were not predictable 3 years ago.
Number two, we financed the Microsemi acquisition by adding $8.1 billion of debt, driving up our net leverage ratio in the June 2018 quarter to 4.95%, which we know was a concern for many of you. In the last 3 years, we have paid down a cumulative $4 billion of debt and brought our net leverage ratio down to 3.34%. 
We continue to allocate substantially all of our cash generation beyond what we paid to shareholders in dividends to pay down significant debt every quarter. Number three, within the last quarter, based on the debt paydown we had achieved and the continued strong cash and adjusted EBITDA generation of our business, both Moody's and Fitch changed their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook. 
At the rate we expect to pay down our debt and bring our net leverage further down, we believe we are on target to achieve an investment-grade rating sometime by the end of fiscal year 2022. Regarding our cash return strategy, we are continuing to provide more cash return to the shareholders. Just today, we announced a dividend of $0.437 per share, our third largest dividend increase, by increasing the dividend by 5.8% sequentially and 18.75% over a year ago quarter. And in the coming quarters, we expect to continue with more actions to increase the cash return to shareholders. 
With that, operator, will you please poll for questions."

So distributors continue to service customers but we are not able to help them grow that inventory. At some point, we will be able to as we get our production up, to be able to ship them more for them to help build that. 
But for the moment, neither their customers nor distribution has the ability to grow inventory in any meaningful form. When we look at where are the number of customer requests we're getting either direct or indirect through distribution on shortages, lines downs and all that. It's pretty well represented across the spectrum. It isn't that 1 group of customers is doing better than the other. There are a large number of customers who are unable to get what they want and are in the short or medium term, trying to get more product, in some cases, trying to get product through more than 1 source if they can. 
But the constraints are all over the place. And so I'm not seeing channel inventory or customer inventory building in a way that you can read something into the distribution days of inventory."

Our PSP backlog exiting the June quarter was over 50%, and it grew throughout the quarter. And we have customers continuing to enroll in the program as well as extend the time that they're providing as the backlog. 
But the metric is really something that was important to us to convey during the early stages of launching the PSP program. And so at this point in time rather than trying to provide a month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter update, it's a part of our normal business that we're doing. Certain capacity corridors, as I've explained, are 100% booked already. And we will just manage it. It gives us visibility. It gives us a better ability to service those customers who have long-term backlog that take in place that are -- that's noncancelable. 
That was the whole objective of what we did. And then to your second question, in many ways, PSP is 1 element of what we have that helps us to make sure that the other side of the cycle whenever it is, can be managed well. We're also bringing capacity on in measured steps. We're not trying to get all of the unsupported done in a short period of time. 
So every quarter, we're increasing capacity.

And we were -- I think we were probably about only $700 million, $750 million company, and we were trying to scale the business 10x so that we don't have a competitive disadvantage against a larger competitor. 
So TI is still larger, but many of the others, Infineons and STs and Maxims and ADIs and we've really caught up to all of them in the last 12, 13 years by scaling the business almost 10x. At the current quarter guidance, we're running somewhere in the excess of $6.5 billion. And we wanted to do that while building a portfolio of products around the microcontroller so that we can provide the entire total system solution to the customers. 
Having analog, some memory, some connectivity, USB, Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth and all that, power management and everything else. So those 2 things we accomplished. We scale the business almost 10x, and we acquired organically built all these products to be able to complete customers' solution. So at this point in time, and I think we have said a couple of times that we don't find the next acquisition to be necessary. 
Given small acquisitions here and there, tuck-in type, if the opportunity arises, we would, but we're not really working on or looking at any large acquisition because that's strategically not needed today. We have enough product portfolio, and we're working very hard to train our sales force and customers to be able to use the entire total system solution from Microchip and show the organic growth. 
And as we adopt that strategy and as we pay down a substantial amount of debt already and continue to pay it further, then you have a large, somewhere around $1.5 billion burning hole in your pocket. And what do you do with that? You are saying, why don't we acquire? And I'm saying, we do not find that strategically needed today. So what we're planning to do is as we achieve the investment-grade rating and as the debt level comes down further, then we start giving larger and larger amount of cash back to the shareholders, some in the form of dividend and some starting a buyback program.

But we've made it very clear that we're focused on achieving an investment-grade rating and believe that, that's something that we can achieve in this fiscal year, independent decision, obviously, by the rating agencies, but we're making good progress on that. 
And even once we get there, you shouldn't assume that we stop paying down debt. We will continue to pay down debt, but we'll have more flexibility to increase dividends more, have a stock buyback program and flex that as it's appropriate for our business. So Steve, what would you like to add to that?"

The trade and tariff issues the year before that was another part of that. Pandemic not only created demand side -- sorry, supply side issues, but created a lot of money that consumers had and they wanted to spend it, and they spent it on things that required electronics for it. They required things to work out of the home. 
So I think there are all kinds of factors that came into where we are. And of course, many customers uncertainty in the pandemic took their demand down and then realized that they have taken it down too far. I don't know what the future brings. Clearly, many of our customers are thinking through how should they, from an inventory standpoint, be preparing themselves so that they're able to run more stable through these cycles, et cetera, and where they go. 
I think there is a continued strong demand where people are building and selling through what they're doing. I don't know what the shape of the next cycle would be, and more importantly, what would be the causes of the next cycle. And I think to a large extent, those will determine what the responses will be in it. I certainly don't think government help is going to be the answer to any of these cycles. And from usually when a government begins to think of something, the cycle is long passed before they can even act with respect to that. 
So I am very confident that the industry through many, many, many cycles has figured out how to make adjustments and how to build in such a way that is consistent with where the market is at, and we'll do the same in this cycle. I don't know, Steve, you've got longer years on this than I do."

First, what happened within the industry that is kind of causing shortage in foundry and recognizing that the industry really didn't -- the foundry industry didn't really expand capacity and lagging edge nodes in the past.

It's so far ahead of any normal planning that they have done that it's overwhelming what the capacity available is. 
Well, the normal reaction you would say is, well, why aren't they building more? Well, the economics of that for the foundries and the opportunity cost versus other capital objectives that they have don't always lend themselves to saying that trailing edge capacity is where they want to be invested. It's not that they're making no investments. They are, but they're not fast enough and they're not at a rate for products that we consider to be important for us. 
And we're not doing it across the board. We're just picking and choosing places where we think there is significant constraint for us or opportunity for us to make that investment. And that is true not only in the fabs, it's true in assembly and test as well as to why we're doing it and what we're seeing. It will mean that we will continue to use all of the capacity available from our foundry and assembly test partners plus we will try to make sure that we have, where we can, additional capacity to be able to not be constrained by what is available only from our outside partners itself. 
In terms of the CapEx itself, I mean, you've seen -- if you go back and look at our history, last 5, 10 years, you'll find that we have gone above and below that 3% to 5% -- 3% to 4% number. I think the 2 years previous to this, we were at about 1%, and that's where the cycle was. That's what we needed in that. So I think a 3-year look gives you a better sense. And we could spend more than 3% to 4% in any given year as we look at investing at a time when that need is there and then we'll breathe with that capacity and let it all build out over that time. 
But at this point in time, that's what we feel comfortable with. If that changes in time, we'll keep you posted. But all this capital that we're investing, all the capacity we're bringing on, all of it we think will be accretive to our gross margins and will enable growth that we could otherwise not have had if our only choice was to take it outside."

Ordinarily, when the industry has a normal kind of growth rate, whatever it was over the last 10, 15 years, usually, a movement to the faster node by the leading-edge guys kept freeing up enough trailing as a capacity so that the trailing edge guys didn't get constrained. Because the leading edge capacity of today is a trailing edge capacity of 5, 6 years down the line. 
And that's how trailing edge capacity became available because it was originally built for people who wanted more leading edge. And then many years later, that was available for the trailing edge. But when the industry grew this year at the rate it has grown, most companies have announced year-over-year growth rates of 20% plus. Our September guidance is, I think, about 25% up versus the same quarter a year ago, then that is the growth rate on the trailing edge technology is much, much higher than really what would become available through an ordinary process of nodes moving up. 
And so therefore, the leading-edge capacity is constrained also today. It's not like there's all the capacity available at 14-nanometer and 28-nanometer, they're all constrained also. But foundries are willing to add capacity on the more leading-edge nodes than they are on the trailing edge. Given the choice of their capital allocation and their priorities, they are working on more relieving the leading-edge capacity, leaving the trailing edge, much more constrained because of the -- such an aggressive growth. 
If the growth of the industry returns back to a much more normal over the 10 years, and it's quite possible that the trailing edge capacity will not be as constrained again."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. 
We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; and Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and financial business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website. We will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margins and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. 
Net sales in the June quarter were $1.569 billion, which was up 7% sequentially and about 150 basis points above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance given on May 6. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 64.8% and operating income was a record 41.7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $558.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record of $1.98, $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were a record at 64.2% and include the impact of $8.8 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $638.8 million and include acquisition, intangible amortization of $215.6 million, special charges of $10.5 million, $3.6 million of acquisition related and other costs, and share based compensation of $47.8 million. GAAP net income was $252.8 million or $0.89 per diluted share. 
Our June quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably tax reserve releases associated with the statute of limitations expiring. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '22 to be about 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. 
Our inventory balance at June 30, 2021, was $683.8 million. We had 111 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was down 1 day from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 20 days which is a record low level and down from 22 days at the end of the prior quarter. We are ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. 
In the June quarter, we issued a $1 billion senior secured note maturing on September 1, 2024, and bearing interest at 0.983%. We used the proceeds from this bond offering to repay a $1 billion senior secured note that matured on June 1, 2021, that had an interest rate of 3.922%. We believe this was another excellent transaction for us as we continue to enhance our capital structure on our path to becoming an investment-grade rated company. 
Our cash flow from operating activities was a record at $629.9 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $279.7 million. We paid down $388 million of total debt in the June quarter. Over the last 12 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $4 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. 
We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this time period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. 
Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record $711.7 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.524 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature was 3.34% at June 30, 2021, down from 3.71% at March 31. 
Our dividend payment in the June quarter was $113.1 million. Capital expenditures were $86.3 million in the June quarter. Our forecast for the September 2021 quarter's capital expenditures is between $75 million and $95 million. Our capital expenditures for all of fiscal year '22 are expected to be between $300 million and $350 million. 
As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out due to overall industry conditions. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $41.2 million. 
I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh?"

Our June quarter results continue to be strong, leading off our fiscal year '22 on a positive note. June quarter revenue was an all-time record of $1.57 billion, growing 7% sequentially and was 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our guidance provided on May 5.
On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter revenue was up 19.8%. Non-GAAP gross margins were another record at 64.8%, up 70 basis points from the March quarter as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved fixed cost absorption. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 41.7%, up 100 basis points from the March quarter. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was above the high end of our guidance at a record $1.98 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the June quarter was again very strong and achieved another record at $701.7 million, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business through the business cycles. 
The June quarter marked our 123rd consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to take this occasion to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the June quarter and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team, whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult environment and who worked constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in an extremely constrained and challenging environment. 
Taking a look at our business from a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 10.7% as compared to the March quarter and set a new quarterly record. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter microcontroller revenue was up 26%. Each of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller product lines established new all-time revenue records. 
As we have told you many times in the past, rumors of the death of 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers have been greatly exaggerated. The customers and applications served by microcontrollers are highly fragmented and require a wide range of solutions that span the breadth of our microcontroller product lines. 
Microcontrollers represented 57.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. Our analog revenue was sequentially up 4.1% as compared to the March quarter, also setting a record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter analog revenue was up 16.7%. Analog represented 27.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. 
Other revenue was sequentially up 5.1% in the June quarter, bouncing back from a 6.4% sequential decline in the March quarter. Other revenue represented 15% of our revenue in the June quarter. 
Taking a look at our business from a geographic perspective. Americas was up 6.1% sequentially. Europe was down 2.3% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonal performance and came off of a very strong 30.4% sequential growth in the March quarter. Asia was up a strong 11.1% sequentially, reflecting better than typical seasonal growth. 
From an end market perspective, all end markets were strong in the June quarter. Business conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter with record bookings and backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters accentuated by our Preferred Supply Program, or PSP, which continues to be over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. 
Demand outpaced the capacity improvements we were able to make -- we were able to implement in the quarter. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which customers want to [ shift ] into June quarter continued to climb significantly, resulting in lead time for many line items continuing to stretch out. 
We experienced constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry assembly test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Through the combination of internal and external actions that we have taken, we expect -- we will be in a position to support revenue growth for at least each of the next 4 quarters. 
Despite that, we also expect that wafer fab as well as assembly and test constraints will persist through at least the middle of 2022. We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps. 
Our capital spending plans are rising in response to growth opportunities in our business as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments by our outsourced fab, assembly and test partners in technologies that they may consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. 
The increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share and give us more control over our destiny for trailing edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners but our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities, which may not align with ours. 
We also expect that while our capital intensity may be slightly higher in any given year, and the 3% to 4% of revenue guidance we have provided in the past, when looked at in the context of a rolling 3-year view, we believe we will very much be in the range of our capital spending guidance. 
Now let me get into the guidance for the September quarter. Our backlog for the September quarter is very strong. In addition, we have considerable backlog requested by customers in the September quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from last quarter. This is because the entire semiconductor supply chain remains very constrained. 
Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes continued operational constraints, some of which we will work through during the quarter, others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be 25.8%. We believe achievement of this revenue level will be remarkable in and of itself, but even more so, given how resilient our business was 1 year ago during the pandemic because of the diversity of our end market exposure, thus making the year-over-year comparisons that much tougher and meaningful. 
For the September quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be between 64.8% and 65.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.8% and 23.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 41.6% and 42.4% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $2.05 per share and $2.17 per share. We also expect to pay down another approximately $350 million of our debt in the September quarter. 
Now we recognize that our gross and operating margin percentage guidance effectively gets us to the long-term targets we shared with you just 9 months ago. We will be working to update our business model for annual growth, gross margin and operating margin percentage, and we'll share our conclusions with you later this year. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. 
We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call. 
Now let me pass the baton to Steve to talk about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?"

Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all",492,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. 
Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter and making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, a record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record cash flow from operation and record adjusted EBITDA. Also, each of our strategic product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers and analog individually achieved all-time new records in net sales. 
Reflecting on our journey since the acquisition of Microsemi 3 years ago, I note the following: number one, at the time of the acquisition, we provided a long-term operating model target of 40.5% non-GAAP operating margin, which we exceeded for the first time in the March 2021 quarter and were significantly above that in the June 2021 quarter at 41.7%. 
At the time of the acquisition, we also indicated that we anticipated achieving an $8 non-GAAP EPS run rate by the end of the third year after the acquisition. Between the $1.98 EPS for the June quarter we just announced, and $2.11 EPS we guided to for the September quarter at the midpoint of our guidance, we have effectively delivered on this expectation. These exceptional results were achieved despite the numerous headwinds we faced from international trade tensions and tariffs as well as the global pandemic which matters were not predictable 3 years ago.
Number two, we financed the Microsemi acquisition by adding $8.1 billion of debt, driving up our net leverage ratio in the June 2018 quarter to 4.95%, which we know was a concern for many of you. In the last 3 years, we have paid down a cumulative $4 billion of debt and brought our net leverage ratio down to 3.34%. 
We continue to allocate substantially all of our cash generation beyond what we paid to shareholders in dividends to pay down significant debt every quarter. Number three, within the last quarter, based on the debt paydown we had achieved and the continued strong cash and adjusted EBITDA generation of our business, both Moody's and Fitch changed their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook. 
At the rate we expect to pay down our debt and bring our net leverage further down, we believe we are on target to achieve an investment-grade rating sometime by the end of fiscal year 2022. Regarding our cash return strategy, we are continuing to provide more cash return to the shareholders. Just today, we announced a dividend of $0.437 per share, our third largest dividend increase, by increasing the dividend by 5.8% sequentially and 18.75% over a year ago quarter. And in the coming quarters, we expect to continue with more actions to increase the cash return to shareholders. 
With that, operator, will you please poll for questions."

But for the moment, neither their customers nor distribution has the ability to grow inventory in any meaningful form. When we look at where are the number of customer requests we're getting either direct or indirect through distribution on shortages, lines downs and all that. It's pretty well represented across the spectrum. It isn't that 1 group of customers is doing better than the other.

But we continue to serve customers through the channel that they find to be the most effective for them. And if that is someone who wants to move direct, so be it, if it's somebody who wants to stay with channels, so be it. But we're relatively channel-agnostic in what we're doing.

We're working with our supply chain partners who bring us materials and all of that. And we are working on capacity improvements with our partners that we do outside -- outsourced work through. 
So I think we'll give you the quarter-by-quarter growth as we get to the guidance for the December and March and June quarters and all that. But I think what we do see is enough capacity coming on in the subsequent quarters.

Our PSP backlog exiting the June quarter was over 50%, and it grew throughout the quarter. And we have customers continuing to enroll in the program as well as extend the time that they're providing as the backlog. 
But the metric is really something that was important to us to convey during the early stages of launching the PSP program. And so at this point in time rather than trying to provide a month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter update, it's a part of our normal business that we're doing. Certain capacity corridors, as I've explained, are 100% booked already. And we will just manage it. It gives us visibility. It gives us a better ability to service those customers who have long-term backlog that they can place that are -- that's noncancelable. 
That was the whole objective of what we did. And then to your second question, in many ways, PSP is 1 element of what we have that helps us to make sure that the other side of the cycle whenever it is, can be managed well. We're also bringing capacity on in measured steps. We're not trying to get all of the unsupported done in a short period of time. 
So every quarter, we're increasing capacity. And so a combination of what we're doing with measured steps in capacity, what we're doing with the PSP program and all of that gives us reasonable confidence to be able to manage the cycle in such a way that we don't get overcommitted on the capacity side."

And we were -- I think we were probably about only $700 million, $750 million company, and we were trying to scale the business 10x so that we don't have a competitive disadvantage against our larger competitors. 
So TI is still larger, but many of the others, Infineons and STs and Maxims and ADIs and we've really caught up to all of them in the last 12, 13 years by scaling the business almost 10x. At the current quarter guidance, we're running somewhere in the excess of $6.5 billion. And we wanted to do that while building a portfolio of products around the microcontroller so that we can provide the entire total system solution to the customers. 
Having analog, some memory, some connectivity, USB, Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth and all that, power management and everything else. So those 2 things we accomplished. We scaled the business almost 10x, and we acquired or organically built all these products to be able to complete customers' solution. So at this point in time, and I think we have said a couple of times that we don't find the next acquisition to be necessary.
Given small acquisitions here and there, tuck-in type, if the opportunity arises, we would, but we're not really working on or looking at any large acquisition because that's strategically not needed today. We have enough product portfolio, and we're working very hard to train our sales force and customers to be able to use the entire total system solution from Microchip and show the organic growth. 
And as we adopt that strategy and as we pay down a substantial amount of debt already and continue to pay it further, then you have a large, somewhere around $1.5 billion burning hole in your pocket. And what do you do with that? You are saying, why don't we acquire? And I'm saying, we do not find that strategically needed today. So what we're planning to do is as we achieve the investment-grade rating and as the debt level comes down further, then we start giving larger and larger amount of cash back to the shareholders, some in the form of dividend and some starting a buyback program.

The trade and tariff issues the year before that was another part of that. Pandemic not only created demand side -- sorry, supply side issues, but created a lot of money that consumers had and they wanted to spend it, and they spent it on things that required electronics for it. They required things to work out of the home. 
So I think there are all kinds of factors that came into where we are. And of course, many customers uncertainty in the pandemic took their demand down and then realized that they had taken it down too far. I don't know what the future brings. Clearly, many of our customers are thinking through how should they, from an inventory standpoint, be preparing themselves so that they're able to run more stable through these cycles, et cetera, and where they go. 
I think there is a continued strong demand where people are building and selling through what they're doing. I don't know what the shape of the next cycle will be, and more importantly, what will be the causes of the next cycle. And I think to a large extent, those will determine what the responses will be in it. I certainly don't think government help is going to be the answer to any of these cycles. And from usually when a government begins to think of something, the cycle is long passed before they can even act with respect to that. 
So I am very confident that the industry through many, many, many cycles has figured out how to make adjustments and how to build in such a way that is consistent with where the market is at, and we'll do the same in this cycle. I don't know, Steve, you've got longer years on this than I do."

Similar other situations were to come in 5 years from now, 10 years from now, it will create a cycle again. So those cycles have really not been repealed.

Some people are trying to get long-term agreements for supply but it's not predictable how much supply is needed 5 years from now. And many of those agreements, you will see will have a bad ending.

First, what happened within the industry that is kind of causing this shortage in foundry and recognizing that the industry really didn't -- the foundry industry didn't really expand capacity and lagging edge nodes in the past. But why are we at the point now where there's just none left and no willingness to extend that? 
And then following that, if you are going to increase your reliance on internal capacity, how is it that you stay within the same 3% to 4% of revenue CapEx model? How does that work going forward?"

Well, the normal reaction you would say is, well, why aren't they building more? Well, the economics of that for the foundries and the opportunity cost versus other capital objectives that they have don't always lend themselves to saying that trailing edge capacity is where they want to be invested. It's not that they're making no investments. They are, but they're not fast enough and they're not at a rate for products that we consider to be important for us. 
And we're not doing it across the board. We're just picking and choosing places where we think there is significant constraint for us or opportunity for us to make that investment. And that is true not only in the fabs, it's true in assembly and test as well as to why we're doing it and what we're seeing. It will mean that we will continue to use all of the capacity available from our foundry and assembly test partners plus we will try to make sure that we have, where we can, additional capacity to be able to not be constrained by what is available only from our outside partners itself. 
In terms of the CapEx itself, I mean, you've seen -- if you go back and look at our history, last 5, 10 years, you'll find that we have gone above and below that 3% to 5% -- 3% to 4% number. I think the 2 years previous to this, we were at about 1%, and that's where the cycle was. That's what we needed in that. So I think a 3-year look gives you a better sense. And we could spend more than 3% to 4% in any given year as we look at investing at a time when that need is there and then we'll breathe with that capacity and let it all build out over that time. 
But at this point in time, that's what we feel comfortable with. If that changes in time, we'll keep you posted. But all this capital that we're investing, all the capacity we're bringing on, all of it we think will be accretive to our gross margins and will enable growth that we could otherwise not have had if our only choice was to take it outside."

Ordinarily, when the industry has a normal kind of growth rate, whatever it was over the last 10, 15 years, usually, a movement to the faster node by the leading-edge guys kept freeing up enough trailing as a capacity so that the trailing edge guys didn't get constrained. Because the leading-edge capacity of today is a trailing edge capacity of 5, 6 years down the line. 
And that's how trailing edge capacity became available because it was originally built for people who wanted more leading edge. And then many years later, that was available for the trailing edge. But when the industry grew this year at the rate it has grown, most companies have announced year-over-year growth rates of 20% plus. Our September guidance is, I think, about 25% up versus the same quarter a year ago, then that is the growth rate on the trailing edge technology is much, much higher than really what would become available through an ordinary process of nodes moving up. 
And so therefore, the leading-edge capacity is constrained also today. It's not like there's all the capacity available at 14-nanometer and 28-nanometer, they're all constrained also. But foundries are willing to add capacity on the more leading-edge nodes than they are on the trailing edge. Given the choice of their capital allocation and their priorities, they are working on more relieving the leading-edge capacity, leaving the trailing edge, much more constrained because of the -- such an aggressive growth. 
If the growth of the industry returns back to a much more normal over the 10 years, and it's quite possible that the trailing edge capacity will not be as constrained again."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. 
We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. 
In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; and Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and financial business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website. We will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margins and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. 
Net sales in the June quarter were $1.569 billion, which was up 7% sequentially and about 150 basis points above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance given on May 6. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 64.8% and operating income was a record 41.7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $558.8 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record of $1.98, $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were a record at 64.2% and include the impact of $8.8 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $638.8 million and include acquisition, intangible amortization of $215.6 million, special charges of $10.5 million, $3.6 million of acquisition related and other costs, and share based compensation of $47.8 million. GAAP net income was $252.8 million or $0.89 per diluted share. 
Our June quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably tax reserve releases associated with the statute of limitations expiring. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '22 to be about 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. 
Our inventory balance at June 30, 2021, was $683.8 million. We had 111 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was down 1 day from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were at 20 days which is a record low level and down from 22 days at the end of the prior quarter. We are ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. 
In the June quarter, we issued a $1 billion senior secured note maturing on September 1, 2024, and bearing interest at 0.983%. We used the proceeds from this bond offering to repay a $1 billion senior secured note that matured on June 1, 2021, that had an interest rate of 3.922%. We believe this was another excellent transaction for us as we continue to enhance our capital structure on our path to becoming an investment-grade rated company. 
Our cash flow from operating activities was a record at $629.9 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $279.7 million. We paid down $388 million of total debt in the June quarter. Over the last 12 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $4 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. 
We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this time period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. 
Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record $711.7 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.524 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature was 3.34% at June 30, 2021, down from 3.71% at March 31. 
Our dividend payment in the June quarter was $113.1 million. Capital expenditures were $86.3 million in the June quarter. Our forecast for the September 2021 quarter's capital expenditures is between $75 million and $95 million. Our capital expenditures for all of fiscal year '22 are expected to be between $300 million and $350 million. 
As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out due to overall industry conditions. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $41.2 million. 
I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh?"

Our June quarter results continue to be strong, leading off our fiscal year '22 on a positive note. June quarter revenue was an all-time record of $1.57 billion, growing 7% sequentially and was 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our guidance provided on May 5.
On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter revenue was up 19.8%. Non-GAAP gross margins were another record at 64.8%, up 70 basis points from the March quarter as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved fixed cost absorption. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 41.7%, up 100 basis points from the March quarter. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was above the high end of our guidance at a record $1.98 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the June quarter was again very strong and achieved another record at $701.7 million, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business through the business cycles. 
The June quarter marked our 123rd consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to take this occasion to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the June quarter and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team, whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult environment and who worked constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in an extremely constrained and challenging environment. 
Taking a look at our business from a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 10.7% as compared to the March quarter and set a new quarterly record. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter microcontroller revenue was up 26%. Each of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller product lines established new all-time revenue records. 
As we have told you many times in the past, rumors of the death of 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers have been greatly exaggerated. The customers and applications served by microcontrollers are highly fragmented and require a wide range of solutions that span the breadth of our microcontroller product lines. 
Microcontrollers represented 57.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. Our analog revenue was sequentially up 4.1% as compared to the March quarter, also setting a record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter analog revenue was up 16.7%. Analog represented 27.5% of our revenue in the June quarter. 
Other revenue was sequentially up 5.1% in the June quarter, bouncing back from a 6.4% sequential decline in the March quarter. Other revenue represented 15% of our revenue in the June quarter. 
Taking a look at our business from a geographic perspective. Americas was up 6.1% sequentially. Europe was down 2.3% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonal performance and came off of a very strong 30.4% sequential growth in the March quarter. Asia was up a strong 11.1% sequentially, reflecting better than typical seasonal growth. 
From an end market perspective, all end markets were strong in the June quarter. Business conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter with record bookings and backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters accentuated by our Preferred Supply Program, or PSP, which continues to be over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. 
Demand outpaced the capacity improvements we were able to make -- we were able to implement in the quarter. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which customers want to [ shift ] into June quarter continued to climb significantly, resulting in lead time for many line items continuing to stretch out. 
We experienced constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry assembly test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Through the combination of internal and external actions that we have taken, we expect -- we will be in a position to support revenue growth for at least each of the next 4 quarters. 
Despite that, we also expect that wafer fab as well as assembly and test constraints will persist through at least the middle of 2022. We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps. 
Our capital spending plans are rising in response to growth opportunities in our business as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments by our outsourced fab, assembly and test partners in technologies that they may consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. 
The increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share and give us more control over our destiny for trailing edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners but our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities, which may not align with ours. 
We also expect that while our capital intensity may be slightly higher in any given year, and the 3% to 4% of revenue guidance we have provided in the past, when looked at in the context of a rolling 3-year view, we believe we will very much be in the range of our capital spending guidance. 
Now let me get into the guidance for the September quarter. Our backlog for the September quarter is very strong. In addition, we have considerable backlog requested by customers in the September quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from last quarter. This is because the entire semiconductor supply chain remains very constrained. 
Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes continued operational constraints, some of which we will work through during the quarter, others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be 25.8%. We believe achievement of this revenue level will be remarkable in and of itself, but even more so, given how resilient our business was 1 year ago during the pandemic because of the diversity of our end market exposure, thus making the year-over-year comparisons that much tougher and meaningful. 
For the September quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be between 64.8% and 65.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.8% and 23.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 41.6% and 42.4% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $2.05 per share and $2.17 per share. We also expect to pay down another approximately $350 million of our debt in the September quarter. 
Now we recognize that our gross and operating margin percentage guidance effectively gets us to the long-term targets we shared with you just 9 months ago. We will be working to update our business model for annual growth, gross margin and operating margin percentage, and we'll share our conclusions with you later this year. Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. 
We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates to first call. 
Now let me pass the baton to Steve to talk about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?"

Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all",492,"Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. 
Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter and making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, a record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record cash flow from operation and record adjusted EBITDA. Also, each of our strategic product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers and analog individually achieved all-time new records in net sales. 
Reflecting on our journey since the acquisition of Microsemi 3 years ago, I note the following: number one, at the time of the acquisition, we provided a long-term operating model target of 40.5% non-GAAP operating margin, which we exceeded for the first time in the March 2021 quarter and were significantly above that in the June 2021 quarter at 41.7%. 
At the time of the acquisition, we also indicated that we anticipated achieving an $8 non-GAAP EPS run rate by the end of the third year after the acquisition. Between the $1.98 EPS for the June quarter we just announced, and $2.11 EPS we guided to for the September quarter at the midpoint of our guidance, we have effectively delivered on this expectation. These exceptional results were achieved despite the numerous headwinds we faced from international trade tensions and tariffs as well as the global pandemic which matters were not predictable 3 years ago.
Number two, we financed the Microsemi acquisition by adding $8.1 billion of debt, driving up our net leverage ratio in the June 2018 quarter to 4.95%, which we know was a concern for many of you. In the last 3 years, we have paid down a cumulative $4 billion of debt and brought our net leverage ratio down to 3.34%. 
We continue to allocate substantially all of our cash generation beyond what we paid to shareholders in dividends to pay down significant debt every quarter. Number three, within the last quarter, based on the debt paydown we had achieved and the continued strong cash and adjusted EBITDA generation of our business, both Moody's and Fitch changed their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook. 
At the rate we expect to pay down our debt and bring our net leverage further down, we believe we are on target to achieve an investment-grade rating sometime by the end of fiscal year 2022. Regarding our cash return strategy, we are continuing to provide more cash return to the shareholders. Just today, we announced a dividend of $0.437 per share, our third largest dividend increase, by increasing the dividend by 5.8% sequentially and 18.75% over a year ago quarter. And in the coming quarters, we expect to continue with more actions to increase the cash return to shareholders. 
With that, operator, will you please poll for questions."

So distributors continue to service customers but we are not able to help them grow that inventory. At some point, we will be able to as we get our production up, to be able to ship them more for them to help build that. 
But for the moment, neither their customers nor distribution has the ability to grow inventory in any meaningful form. When we look at where are the number of customer requests we're getting either direct or indirect through distribution on shortages, lines downs and all that. It's pretty well represented across the spectrum. It isn't that 1 group of customers is doing better than the other. There are a large number of customers who are unable to get what they want and are in the short or medium term, trying to get more product, in some cases, trying to get product through more than 1 source if they can. 
But the constraints are all over the place. And so I'm not seeing channel inventory or customer inventory building in a way that you can read something into the distribution days of inventory."

And today, all of our growth is constrained not by demand, but by supply. 
There are supply improvements we're making that are in our control, which is what runs through our manufacturing internally, what we are doing there to increase capacity in each of our fabs, our assembly, our test. We're working with our supply chain partners who bring us materials and all of that. And we are working on capacity improvements with our partners that we do outside -- outsourced work through. 
So I think we'll give you the quarter-by-quarter growth as we get to the guidance for the December and March and June quarters and all that. But I think what we do see is enough capacity coming on in the subsequent quarters. And the timing is a bit hard to call because we don't have a stable environment in which we know exactly what equipment will come on, when will it bring on the capacity and all that. But we're confident enough in how we see capacity coming on that we do expect that each of the next 4 quarters will have growth in them."

Our PSP backlog exiting the June quarter was over 50%, and it grew throughout the quarter. And we have customers continuing to enroll in the program as well as extend the time that they're providing as the backlog. 
But the metric is really something that was important to us to convey during the early stages of launching the PSP program. And so at this point in time rather than trying to provide a month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter update, it's a part of our normal business that we're doing. Certain capacity corridors, as I've explained, are 100% booked already. And we will just manage it. It gives us visibility. It gives us a better ability to service those customers who have long-term backlog that they can place that are -- that's noncancelable. 
That was the whole objective of what we did. And then to your second question, in many ways, PSP is 1 element of what we have that helps us to make sure that the other side of the cycle whenever it is, can be managed well. We're also bringing capacity on in measured steps. We're not trying to get all of the unsupported done in a short period of time. 
So every quarter, we're increasing capacity. And so a combination of what we're doing with measured steps in capacity, what we're doing with the PSP program and all of that gives us reasonable confidence to be able to manage the cycle in such a way that we don't get overcommitted on the capacity side."

And we were -- I think we were probably about only $700 million, $750 million company, and we were trying to scale the business 10x so that we don't have a competitive disadvantage against our larger competitors. 
So TI is still larger, but many of the others, Infineons and STs and Maxims and ADIs and we've really caught up to all of them in the last 12, 13 years by scaling the business almost 10x. At the current quarter guidance, we're running somewhere in the excess of $6.5 billion. And we wanted to do that while building a portfolio of products around the microcontroller so that we can provide the entire total system solution to the customers. 
Having analog, some memory, some connectivity, USB, Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth and all that, power management and everything else. So those 2 things we accomplished. We scaled the business almost 10x, and we acquired or organically built all these products to be able to complete customers' solution. So at this point in time, and I think we have said a couple of times that we don't find the next acquisition to be necessary.
Given small acquisitions here and there, tuck-in type, if the opportunity arises, we would, but we're not really working on or looking at any large acquisition because that's strategically not needed today. We have enough product portfolio, and we're working very hard to train our sales force and customers to be able to use the entire total system solution from Microchip and show the organic growth. 
And as we adopt that strategy and as we pay down a substantial amount of debt already and continue to pay it further, then you have a large, somewhere around $1.5 billion burning hole in your pocket. And what do you do with that? You are saying, why don't we acquire? And I'm saying, we do not find that strategically needed today. So what we're planning to do is as we achieve the investment-grade rating and as the debt level comes down further, then we start giving larger and larger amount of cash back to the shareholders, some in the form of dividend and some starting a buyback program.

The trade and tariff issues the year before that was another part of that. Pandemic not only created demand side -- sorry, supply side issues, but created a lot of money that consumers had and they wanted to spend it, and they spent it on things that required electronics for it. They required things to work out of the home. 
So I think there are all kinds of factors that came into where we are. And of course, many customers uncertainty in the pandemic took their demand down and then realized that they had taken it down too far. I don't know what the future brings. Clearly, many of our customers are thinking through how should they, from an inventory standpoint, be preparing themselves so that they're able to run more stable through these cycles, et cetera, and where they go. 
I think there is a continued strong demand where people are building and selling through what they're doing. I don't know what the shape of the next cycle will be, and more importantly, what will be the causes of the next cycle. And I think to a large extent, those will determine what the responses will be in it. I certainly don't think government help is going to be the answer to any of these cycles. And from usually when a government begins to think of something, the cycle is long passed before they can even act with respect to that. 
So I am very confident that the industry through many, many, many cycles has figured out how to make adjustments and how to build in such a way that is consistent with where the market is at, and we'll do the same in this cycle. I don't know, Steve, you've got longer years on this than I do."

There will be no more cycles. I think all that is wrong. Like Ganesh said, the events that precipitated this cycle could not have been forecasted 2 years ago. So when that happens, and it put a major pressure on the industry from both sides, decreasing the supply line and increasing the demand in certain cases, driven by work from home and medical and others. It created this super cycle that we haven't seen in 40 years. 
Similar other situations were to come in 5 years from now, 10 years from now, it will create a cycle again. So those cycles have really not been repealed. People will make some adjustments, maybe keep larger inventory and do some other things. Some people are trying to get long-term agreements for supply but it's not predictable how much supply is needed 5 years from now. And many of those agreements, you will see will have a bad ending. If there is a recession, people are not going to need that product, there'll be their excess inventory. Pay-for-play agreements don't work out very well usually."

First, what happened within the industry that is kind of causing this shortage in foundry and recognizing that the industry really didn't -- the foundry industry didn't really expand capacity and lagging edge nodes in the past. But why are we at the point now where there's just none left and no willingness to extend that? 
And then following that, if you are going to increase your reliance on internal capacity, how is it that you stay within the same 3% to 4% of revenue CapEx model? How does that work going forward?"

Well, the normal reaction you would say is, well, why aren't they building more? Well, the economics of that for the foundries and the opportunity cost versus other capital objectives that they have don't always lend themselves to saying that trailing edge capacity is where they want to be invested. It's not that they're making no investments. They are, but they're not fast enough and they're not at a rate for products that we consider to be important for us. 
And we're not doing it across the board. We're just picking and choosing places where we think there is significant constraint for us or opportunity for us to make that investment. And that is true not only in the fabs, it's true in assembly and test as well as to why we're doing it and what we're seeing. It will mean that we will continue to use all of the capacity available from our foundry and assembly test partners plus we will try to make sure that we have, where we can, additional capacity to be able to not be constrained by what is available only from our outside partners itself. 
In terms of the CapEx itself, I mean, you've seen -- if you go back and look at our history, last 5, 10 years, you'll find that we have gone above and below that 3% to 5% -- 3% to 4% number. I think the 2 years previous to this, we were at about 1%, and that's where the cycle was. That's what we needed in that. So I think a 3-year look gives you a better sense. And we could spend more than 3% to 4% in any given year as we look at investing at a time when that need is there and then we'll breathe with that capacity and let it all build out over that time. 
But at this point in time, that's what we feel comfortable with. If that changes in time, we'll keep you posted. But all this capital that we're investing, all the capacity we're bringing on, all of it we think will be accretive to our gross margins and will enable growth that we could otherwise not have had if our only choice was to take it outside."

Ordinarily, when the industry has a normal kind of growth rate, whatever it was over the last 10, 15 years, usually, a movement to the faster node by the leading-edge guys kept freeing up enough trailing as a capacity so that the trailing edge guys didn't get constrained. Because the leading-edge capacity of today is a trailing edge capacity of 5, 6 years down the line. 
And that's how trailing edge capacity became available because it was originally built for people who wanted more leading edge. And then many years later, that was available for the trailing edge. But when the industry grew this year at the rate it has grown, most companies have announced year-over-year growth rates of 20% plus. Our September guidance is, I think, about 25% up versus the same quarter a year ago, then that is the growth rate on the trailing edge technology is much, much higher than really what would become available through an ordinary process of nodes moving up. 
And so therefore, the leading-edge capacity is constrained also today. It's not like there's all the capacity available at 14-nanometer and 28-nanometer, they're all constrained also. But foundries are willing to add capacity on the more leading-edge nodes than they are on the trailing edge. Given the choice of their capital allocation and their priorities, they are working on more relieving the leading-edge capacity, leaving the trailing edge, much more constrained because of the -- such an aggressive growth. 
If the growth of the industry returns back to a much more normal over the 10 years, and it's quite possible that the trailing edge capacity will not be as constrained again."

We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. 
I will now go through some of our operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. 
Net sales in the September quarter were $1.65 billion, which was up 5.1% sequentially and up 26% compared to the September quarter of 2020. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 65.3% and operating income was a record 42.5%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $605.6 million. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate in the quarter was 6%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share on a split-adjusted basis exceeded the midpoint of our guidance and was a record $1.07. This reflects our recent 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record on October 4, 2021. 
On a GAAP basis in the September quarter, gross margins were a record at 64.8% and include the impact of $9.1 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $652 million and include acquisition, intangible amortization of $215.7 million, special charges of $10.2 million, $2.8 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $46.6 million. GAAP net income was $242 million or $0.43 per diluted share and was negatively impacted by the GAAP loss on the convertible debt exchanges that we executed in the quarter, which were not included in our guidance. 
Our September quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, most notably the tax benefit recorded on the convertible debt exchange transactions that I just mentioned. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2021, was $713.6 million. We had 112 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was up 1 day from the prior quarter's level. Our levels of raw materials and work in progress increased in the quarter, which helps position us for the increased production we are expecting from our internal factories. We are ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much as possible to support customer requirements. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter was at 19 days, which is a record low level and down from 20 days as of the end of the prior quarter. 
In the September quarter, we exchanged a total of $263.6 million of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges, and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on the balance sheet at September 30 was $999.2 million compared to $4.481 billion at the beginning of calendar year 2020, putting our overall capital structure in a much better long-term position. 
Our cash flow from operating activities was $611.7 million in the September quarter. Our free cash flow was $533.2 million and 32.3% of net sales. As of September 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $255.3 million. We paid down $415.6 million of total debt in the September quarter. And over the last 13 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down over $4.4 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during much of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. 
We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was a record at $762.5 million or 46.2% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.72 billion and 45% of net sales. 
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 2.99 at September 30, 2021, down from 3.34 at June 30, 2021. Our dividend payment in the September quarter was $121.2 million. Capital expenditures were $78.5 million in the September quarter. Our expectation for the December 2021 quarter's capital expenditures is between $70 million and $90 million. Our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 are now expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing as a result of overall industry conditions. 
We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $43.7 million. 
I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance on the business in the September quarter as well as our guidance for the December quarter. Ganesh?"
31500,1685697867,2426440,"Microchip Technology Incorporated, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone.

Our September quarter results continue to be strong with revenue growing 5.1% sequentially to achieve another all-time record at $1.65 billion. September quarter revenue would have been even stronger, but for constraints due to some of our capacity improvements coming in later than we wanted. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter revenue was up 26%. Non-GAAP gross margin was another record at 65.3%, up 50 basis points from 64.8% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved fixed cost absorption as well as product mix changes. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 42.5%, up 80 basis points from 41.7% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance. 
Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS and was a split adjusted record $1.07 per share and was up 37.6% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at 46.2% of revenue, and free cash flow at 32.3% of revenue were both very strong, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business. This, in turn, enabled us to pay down another $415.6 million in debt and bring our net leverage ratio down to 2.99% in the September quarter. 
With the progress we have already made, and progress we expect to continue making in bringing down our debt and leverage ratio, we believe we are well positioned to achieve an investment-grade rating in the coming months. The September quarter marked our 124th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the September quarter, and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team, whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult supply environment, and who work constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in an extremely constrained and challenging environment. 
Taking a look at our revenue from a product line perspective. Our microcontroller revenue was sequentially down 0.9% as compared to the June quarter, in part due to the very strong shipments in the June quarter, when this business was sequentially up 10.7% and in part due to supply constraints in the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter microcontroller revenue was up 27.1% and microcontrollers represented 54.2% of our revenue in the September quarter. Our analog revenue was sequentially up a strong 13.6% as compared to the June quarter, setting another record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter analog revenue was up 35.8%. Analog represented 29.8% of our revenue in the September quarter. 
During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of Iconic RF, a Belfast, Northern Ireland-based, small, early-stage private company. Iconic RF makes innovative high-performance gallium nitride and gallium arsenide, monolithic microwave integrated circuits, focused on the aerospace and defense market, and we believe will further strengthen our position in this market. Revenue contribution from Iconic RF is not material. The purchase price was in the mid-single-digit million range with possible future performance-based earn-outs. This acquisition is akin to acquiring intellectual property along with domain experts to help us accelerate our business agenda in specific laser-focused areas. 
Taking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end market perspective, Americas was up 12.5% sequentially. Europe was up 4.8% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonal performance for a September quarter. Asia was up 2.1% sequentially. All end markets were strong and supply constrained. Business conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter with record bookings and backlog for products to be shipped over multiple quarters. Our preferred supply program, or PSP, continues to grow and be over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. Demand for -- outpaced the capacity improvements and increased shipments we achieved in the quarter. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which customers want to ship in the September quarter, but which we could not deliver in the September quarter, continued to climb significantly as compared to the prior quarter's level. 
This is the fifth consecutive quarter that our unsupported backlog of product requested in a given quarter has grown despite our quarterly revenue having grown 26% in the September '21 quarter as compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to experience constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. During the September quarter, we experienced and were adversely impacted by COVID-related disruptions in our packaging and testing operations in Asia, as the Delta variant adversely impacted many of these countries. We took additional steps to protect our employees in these countries and work with our partners as they took mitigation steps. 
We also work closely with our supply chain partners who provided wafer foundry, assembly, test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. It is a challenging environment for our factories and our partners' factories to hire, train and retain employees to support the planned manufacturing ramps. 
Despite all this, through all the actions we have taken to increase capacity, we expect we will be in a position to support revenue growth for at least each of the next 4 quarters. This extends by one more quarter what we stated in our August conference call as the September quarter results are now behind us. We now expect that manufacturing constraints will persist through much of 2022 and possibly beyond that. We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding our factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps. 
Our capital spending plans are rising in response to growth opportunities in our business as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments being made by our outsourced manufacturing partners in technologies they may consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come. 
In the September quarter, we were able to secure a license from one of our wafer manufacturing partners for a key trailing edge technology that runs on 8-inch wafers, which we expect to have qualified and in production by 2023. This licensed technology is still growing for us, and we expect it will be a workhorse technology for at least 10 to 15 more years. 
We believe our increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share and give us more control over our destiny for trailing edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsource partners. But our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities in areas where they don't align with our business needs. 
Now let's get into the guidance for the December quarter. Our backlog for the December quarter is very strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be up between 4% and 8% sequentially, much stronger than normal seasonality, which is usually down 2% for the December quarter. Our guidance range assumes capacity additions as well as continued capacity constraints, some of which we expect to work through during the quarter and others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. 
At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the December quarter will be a strong 29.3%, accelerating from the 26% year-over-year growth in the September quarter, 19.8% year-over-year growth in the June quarter and 10.6% year-over-year growth in the March quarter. For the December quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 65.8% and 66.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.3% and 22.7% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 43.1% and 43.9% of sales. And we expect our split adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.14 per share and $1.20 per share. 
Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call. 
Finally, as previously announced, we will be holding our Investor and Analyst Day on November 8 in New York, which will also be simultaneously webcast for those who cannot attend in person. At the event, we will be providing details about our long-term expected growth rate, updated gross and operating margin targets as well as more specifics about our strategy for capital return, revenue growth and manufacturing. We hope you will be able to join us for this important and informative event. Let me now pass baton to Steve to talk about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?"

Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. 
Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip, that have delivered another exceptional quarter and making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record cash flow from operations and record adjusted EBITDA. 
Reflecting on our journey of debt and leverage ratio since the acquisition of Microsemi 3-plus years ago, I note the following. First, we financed the Microsemi acquisition by adding $8.1 billion of debt, which increased our net leverage ratio in the June 2018 quarter to 4.95%, which we know was a concern for many of you. In the last 3-plus years, we have paid down a cumulative $4.4 billion of debt and brought our net leverage ratio down to 2.99. We allocated substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond what we pay to shareholders and dividends to pay down significant debt every quarter. 
Number two, within the last 6 months, based on the debt paydown and the continued strong cash and adjusted EBITDA generation of our business, both Moody's and Fitch changed their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook. And now last quarter, with very strong debt paydown and getting to a leverage ratio of below 3.0, we believe we will receive an investment-grade rating in the coming months. 
Regarding our capital return strategy, we are continuing to provide more cash return to the shareholders. Just today, we announced a dividend of $0.232 per share. Our dividend is reflective of Microchip's 2-for-1 stock split that was effective last month. This is our fourth consecutive quarter with a large dividend increase, increasing the dividend by 6.2% sequentially and 25.9% over a year ago quarter. And in the coming quarters, we expect to continue with more actions to increase the cash return to shareholders. We plan to give you more information about our capital return strategy next week at our Investor and Analyst Day. We hope to see you all there. 
With that, operator, will you please poll for questions."

If you look a year ago where we were to where we are today, despite having brought significant supply online, we are further behind in terms of the constraint or the unsupported that we have. And that's because demand grew even faster than the supply then. I don't know how 2022 is demand picture. We have a good sense of our own supply and what we're doing, but how the demand picture will change and when that will change, I don't know. But at this point in time, if you judge by how much unsupported did we have every quarter exiting each quarter. We've had 5 quarters in a row where we produced more, but had more unsupported, exiting the quarter.

It's hard to break out exactly what is from price and what is from capacity. We do have, clearly, what we're doing on the capacity side of adding more wafers to be able to run either in our fabs or our partner's fabs, adding more assembly and test capacity. And so there is a significant amount of unit growth that we're expecting going into 2022 and into 2023. The pricing for us is largely to be able to pass along cost increases that we have seen and to make sure that -- and we usually will bunch them rather than try to do it on a regular basis. And so we wait to see how cost increases are coming into us, bunch it together at some point in time and then pass on the price increase. But the exact mix of price increase versus unit thing, I don't have. There is a significant amount of unit growth going into next year. 
As far as what happens further out in time, I don't get the sense that input costs are going down, and that pricing has to come down out in time. Things like the labor costs that have been going up, I mean, those are in -- they're not coming back down. A lot of the costs for material and equipment is requiring companies, not just us, but even our supply chain to have significant capital spending to be able to not just expand factories, but build brand-new factories and the cost structures many involved there are quite significant as well. So it is my belief that these price increases are here to stay and at least is to stay for a fair amount of time into '22 and '23."

Pricing is what we would need to make adjustments to when there are reasons to make those adjustments based on input costs going up. So there is no guarantee of fixed pricing being part of the PSP program. 
On your second question with respect to input costs, there are certain input costs, which are structurally in for example, labor costs that go in. Now perhaps in time, as factories scale and size, they would get amortized over more units. But right now, labor cost is going up and you don't take labor cost down when the cycle begins to change. Not a material cost and maybe some of the material costs could be more driven by what the cost of the commodity involves, copper, et cetera, are going to be, and we don't know how those will change. 
And then there are equipment costs as we buy them where we have in the past, to grow our capacity, typically been buying used equipment at discounted prices. In the current environment where all fabs are full, all capacity is full, that is not an available option to us. So we are paying more expensive -- or buying more expensive equipment to be able to outfit the capacity growth that we need and that will, of course, stay in structurally as well. But scale will help with some of that cost and how it gets amortized. But I don't fundamentally think pricing is going to change, given all these moving parts. And that's the general sense I get from all of our supply chain partners and how they're thinking about it and what the input variables are to them as they look at what pricing they're going to be doing."

So if we have a price increase, a customer has 5 days once that price increase goes out to make the decision, do they want to accept that price increase or not. And if they don't accept the price increase, it comes back to Microchip and it does Microchip choose to ship it at the lower price or do we reallocate that capacity when there's so much capacity on the books when customers are screaming for product to another customer. And what we've seen when we've had price increases is that there has been hardly any customers that cancel their orders or choose not to accept the price increase because they understand the situation on the supply side."

And some of this is input costs, but some of this is also opportunistic. So I guess my first question is how you guys feel about that and whether you have a plan around pricing moving forward. 
And then, Steve, I always love your big picture thoughts. So as it relates to pricing, the more pricing power that's enacted here when this all ends, does this pricing revert? Or is there something structural and you think it might be more sticky this cycle versus other cycles, just given that there are fewer competitors out there than in past decades."

And so we do the changes this year -- we did the changes this year only because of the significant increase in input costs. But on an ongoing basis, we do not view pricing as something to tactically go change. It's not a commodity product like memory products might be. These are proprietary, products with strategic engagements and long-term relationships with customers, and their trust that we expect to be able to maintain. I'll let Steve answer the second half."

On some of the commodity products, if there's a lot of supply becomes available and there's a competition who's able to ship a DRAM or flash or NAND, those pricing may come down. But I don't see pricing on our microcontroller products, our analog products, connectivity products, 98% of what we make is largely proprietary those prices to come down. Because when you look at the components of the pricing, the -- I don't see that fabs are going to lower the wafer cost outside fabs because they're making huge investments, because of shortage and that equipment is being placed in now and what would be the reason to lower the price later. 
The -- if the commodity prices come down, there's a small component of the overall cost where that will come down. And as Ganesh mentioned earlier, the label cross-sell are not likely to come down, the assembly test costs are not likely to come down, our internal fabrication and other costs are not going to come down. We're paying more for the equipment and that structurally stays in the cost structure. So I don't really see that the price increases that we're passing on to the customers are temporary in nature, nor are we giving that kind of impression to our customers. I think they're largely there to stay. Could there be a minor adjustment here and there if there was a significant cost downwards from the input cost perspective, then it's possible, but I don't really see it."

Remember, we also shipped first in, first out. So even when the factory becomes full, underutilization goes away, you're still shipping product, which you built earlier when they utilize the increasing capital wasn't added. So now we're adding incremental capital to grow the capacity and that depreciation comes in, so therefore, the incremental gross margin still -- incremental gross margin is better than the average because you're utilizing the factory better, the management, fixed infrastructure, the ecosystem, the water, the air, everything else, you're using it more efficiently. So there is incremental gross margin, which is higher than corporate. But your metric of what it has been in the last 4 quarters may not stay."

So it's already backlog we have and people would like to get it sooner than what we can provide it to them. 
And so a lot of factors that go into that unsupported. But the bottom line is that whatever we are able to produce and the growth that we're able to deliver. Despite it being 26% year-over-year is far from what is required to meet what customers are telling us they want in a given quarter.

In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and   Sajid Daudi  , Microchip's Head of Investor Relations, who just joined us over the course of the last month. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. 
We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. 
I will now go through some of our operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. 
Net sales in the September quarter were $1.65 billion, which was up 5.1% sequentially and up 26% compared to the September quarter of 2020. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 65.3%, and operating income was a record 42.5%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $605.6 million. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate in the quarter was 6%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are on a split adjusted basis exceeded the midpoint of our guidance and was a record $1.07. This reflects our recent 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record on October 4, 2021. 
On a GAAP basis, in the September quarter, gross margins were a record at 64.8% and include the impact of $9.1 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $652 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $215.7 million, special charges of $10.2 million, $2.8 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $46.6 million. GAAP net income was $242 million or $0.43 per diluted share and was negatively impacted by the GAAP loss on the convertible debt exchanges that we executed in the quarter, which were not included in our guidance. Our September quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, most notably the tax benefit recorded on the convertible debt exchange transactions that I just mentioned. 
Our inventory balance at September 30, 2021, was $713.6 million. We had 112 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was up 1 day from the prior quarter's level. Our levels of raw materials and work in progress increased in the quarter, which helps position us for the increased production we are expecting from our internal factories. We are ramping capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much as possible to support customer requirements. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter was at 19 days, which is a record low level and down from 20 days as of the end of the prior quarter. 
In the September quarter, we exchanged a total of $263.6 million of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges, and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. The principal amount of convertible debt on the balance sheet at September 30 was $999.2 million compared to $4.481 billion at the beginning of calendar year 2020, putting our overall capital structure in a much better long-term position. 
Our cash flow from operating activities was $611.7 million in the September quarter. Our free cash flow was $533.2 million and 32.3% of net sales. As of September 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $255.3 million. We paid down $415.6 million of total debt in the September quarter. And over the last 13 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down over $4.4 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during much of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. 
Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was a record at $762.5 million or 46.2% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $2.72 billion and 45% of net sales. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 2.99% at September 30, 2021, down from 3.34% at June 30, 2021. Our dividend payment in the September quarter was $121.2 million. 
Capital expenditures were $78.5 million in the September quarter. Our expectation for the December 2021 quarter's capital expenditures is between $70 million and $90 million. Our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 are now expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing as a result of overall industry conditions. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. 
Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $43.7 million. I now -- I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter as well as our guidance for the December quarter. Ganesh?"

Our September quarter results continue to be strong, with the revenue growing 5.1% sequentially to achieve another all-time record at $1.65 billion. September quarter revenue would have been even stronger but",1544,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our September quarter results continue to be strong, with the revenue growing 5.1% sequentially to achieve another all-time record at $1.65 billion. September quarter revenue would have been even stronger but for constraints due to some of our capacity improvements coming in later than we wanted. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter revenue was up 26%. Non-GAAP gross margin was another record of 65.3%, up 50 basis points from 64.8% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved fixed cost absorption as well as product mix changes. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 42.5%, up 80 basis points from 41.7% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was a split adjusted record $1.07 per share and was up 37.6% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at 46.2% of revenue and free cash flow at 32.3% of revenue were both very strong, continuing to demonstrate the robust profitability and cash generation capabilities of our business. This, in turn, enabled us to pay down another $415.6 million in debt and bring our net leverage ratio down to 2.99 in the September quarter. With the progress we have already made and progress we expect to continue making in bringing down our debt and leverage ratio, we believe we are well positioned to achieve an investment-grade rating in the coming months. 
The September quarter marked our 124th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. I would like to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results in the September quarter, and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts not only delivered our strong financial results, but also supported our customers to navigate a difficult supply environment and who work constructively with our supply chain partners to find creative solutions in an extremely constrained and challenging environment. 
Taking a look at our revenue from a product line perspective. Our microcontroller revenue was sequentially down 0.9% as compared to the June quarter, in part due to the very strong shipments in the June quarter, when this business was sequentially up 10.7% and in part due to supply constraints in the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter microcontroller revenue was up 27.1%, and microcontrollers represented 54.2% of our revenue in the September quarter. 
Our analog revenue was sequentially up a strong 13.6% as compared to the June quarter, setting another record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter analog revenue was up 35.8%. Analog represented 29.8% of our revenue in the September quarter. During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of Iconic RF, a Belfast, Northern Island-based small, early stage private company. Iconic RF makes innovative high-performance gallium nitride and gallium arsenide, monolithic microwave integrated circuits, focused on the aerospace and defense market and we believe will further strengthen our position in this market. Revenue contribution from Iconic RF is not material. The purchase price was in the mid-single-digit million range, with possible future performance-based earnouts. This acquisition is akin to acquiring intellectual property along with domain experts to help us accelerate our business agenda in specific laser-focused areas. 
Taking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end market perspective. Americas was up 12.5% sequentially. Europe was up 4.8% sequentially, which is better than typical seasonal performance for the September quarter. Asia was up 2.1% sequentially. All end markets were strong and supply constrained. Business conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter with record bookings and backlog for products to be shipped over multiple quarters. Our Preferred Supply Program, or PSP, continues to grow and be over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. 
Demand far outpaced the capacity improvements and increased shipments we achieved in the quarter. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which customers want to ship in the September quarter, which we could not deliver in the September quarter continued to climb significantly as compared to the prior quarter's level. This is the fifth consecutive quarter that our unsupported backlog for product requested in a given quarter has grown despite our quarterly revenue having grown 26% in the September '20 first quarter as compared to the year ago quarter. 
We continue to experience constraints in all of our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. During the September quarter, we experienced and were adversely impacted by COVID-related disruptions in our packaging and testing operations in Asia as the Delta variant adversely impacted many of these countries. We took additional steps to protect our employees in these countries and work with our partners as they took mitigation steps. We also work closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry, assembly, test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible. It is a challenging environment for our factories and our partners' factories to hire, train and retain employees to support the planned manufacturing ramps. Despite all this, through all the actions we have taken to increase capacity, we expect we will be in a position to support revenue growth for at least each of the next 4 quarters. This extends by one more quarter, which we stated in our August conference call as the September quarter results are now behind us. 
We now expect that manufacturing constraints will persist through much of 2022 and possibly beyond that. We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding our factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps.  
Our capital spending plans are rising in response to growth opportunities in our business as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments being made by our outsourced manufacturing partners in technologies they may consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come.  
In the September quarter, we were able to secure a license from one of our wafer manufacturing partners for a key trailing edge technology that runs on 8-inch wafers, which we expect to have qualified and in production by 2023. This licensed technology is still growing for us, and we expect it will be a workhorse technology for at least 10 to 15 more years. We believe our increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share and give us more control over our destiny for trailing edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsource partners but our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities in areas where they don't align with our business needs.  
Now let's get into the guidance for the December quarter. Our backlog for the December quarter is very strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be up between 4% and 8% sequentially, much stronger than normal seasonality, which is usually down 2% for the December quarter. 
Our guidance range assumes capacity additions as well as continued capacity constraints, some of which we expect to work through during the quarter and others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the December quarter will be a strong 29.3%, accelerating from the 26% year-over-year growth in the September quarter, 19.8% year-over-year growth in the June quarter and 10.6% year-over-year growth in the March quarter. For the December quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 65.8% and 66.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.3% and  22.7% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 43.1% and 43.9% of sales. And we expect our split adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.14 per share and $1.20 per share.  
Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.  
Finally, as previously announced, we will be holding our Investor and Analyst Day on November 8 in New York, which will also be simultaneously webcast for those who cannot attend in person. At the event, we will be providing details about our long-term expected growth rate, updated gross and operating margin targets as well as more specifics about our strategy for capital return, revenue growth and manufacturing. We hope you will be able to join us for this important and informative event. Let me now pass the baton to Steve to talk about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?"

Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy.  
Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter and making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record cash flow from operations and record adjusted EBITDA.  
Reflecting on our journey of debt and leverage ratio since the acquisition of Microsemi 3-plus years ago, I note the following. First, we financed the Microsemi acquisition by adding $8.1 billion of debt, which increased our net leverage ratio in the June 2018 quarter to 4.95%, which we know was a concern for many of you. In the last 3-plus years, we have paid down a cumulative $4.4 billion of debt and brought our net leverage ratio down to 2.99%. We allocated substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond what we pay to shareholders and dividends to pay down significant debt every quarter.  
Number two, within the last 6 months, based on the debt paydown and the continued strong cash and adjusted EBITDA generation of our business, both Moody's and Fitch changed their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook. And now last quarter, with very strong debt paydown and getting to a leverage ratio of below 3.0, we believe we will receive an investment-grade rating in the coming months.  
Regarding our capital return strategy, we are continuing to provide more cash return to the shareholders. Just today, we announced a dividend of $0.232 per share. Our dividend is reflective of Microchip's 2-for-1 stock split that was effective last month. This is our fourth consecutive quarter with a large dividend increase, increasing the dividend by 6.2% sequentially and 25.9% over a year ago quarter. And in the coming quarters, we expect to continue with more actions to increase the cash return to shareholders. We plan to give you more information about our capital return strategy next week at our Investor and Analyst Day. We hope to see you all there.  
With that, operator, will you please poll for questions."

I don't know how 2022's demand picture. We have a good sense of our own supply and what we're doing, but how the demand picture will change and when that will change, I don't know. But at this point in time, if you judge by how much unsupported did we have every quarter exiting each quarter, we've had 5 quarters in a row where we produced more, but had more unsupported, exiting the quarter. And I'm fully expecting that exiting December, it will be the sixth consecutive quarter where that's going to happen."

Ganesh, maybe you could talk a little bit about the comments that you made about having support for growth over the next 4 quarters from here, how much of that is based on supply coming online?

It's hard to break out exactly what is from price and what is from capacity. We do have -- clearly, what we're doing on the capacity side of adding more wafer is to be able to run either in our fabs or our partner's fabs, adding more assembly and test capacity. And so there is a significant amount of unit growth that we're expecting going into 2022 and into 2023. 
The pricing for us is largely to be able to pass along cost increases that we have seen and to make sure that -- and we usually will bunch them rather than try to do it on a regular basis. And so we wait to see how cost increases are coming into us, bunch it together at some point in time and then pass on the price increase. But the exact mix of price increase versus unit thing, I don't have. There is a significant amount of unit growth going into next year.  
As far as what happens further out in time, I don't get the sense that input costs are going down, and that pricing has to come down out in time. Things like the labor costs that have been going up. I mean, those are in -- they're not coming back down. A lot of the costs for material and equipment is requiring companies, not just us, but even our supply chain to have significant capital spending to be able to not just expand factories, but build brand-new factories and the cost structures many involved there are quite significant as well. So it is my belief that these price increases are here to stay and at least is to stay for a fair amount of time into '22 and '23."

Pricing is what we would need to make adjustments to when there are reasons to make those adjustments based on input costs going up. So there is no guarantee of fixed pricing being part of the PSP program.  
On your second question with respect to input costs, there are certain input costs, which are structurally in for example, labor costs that go in. Now perhaps in time, as factories scale and size, they would get amortized over more units. But right now, labor cost is going up and you don't take labor cost down when the cycle begins to change. Now a material cost and maybe some of the material costs could be more driven by what the cost of the commodity involves   popper  , et cetera, are going to be, and we don't know how those will change.  
And then there are equipment costs as we buy them where we have in the past, to grow our capacity, typically been buying used equipment at discounted prices. In the current environment where all fabs are full, all capacity is full, that is not an available option to us. So we are paying more expensive -- or buying more expensive equipment to be able to outfit the capacity growth that we need and that will, of course, stay in structurally as well. 
But scale will help with some of that cost and how it gets amortized. But I don't fundamentally think pricing is going to change given all these moving parts. And that's the general sense I get from all of our supply chain partners and how they're thinking about it and what the input variables are to them as they look at what pricing they're going to be doing."

So if we have a price increase, a customer has 5 days once that price increase goes out to make the decision, do they want to accept that price increase or not. And if they don't accept the price increase, it comes back to Microchip and it -- does Microchip choose to ship it at the lower price or do we reallocate that capacity when there's so much capacity on the books when customers are screaming for product to another customer. And what we've seen when we've had price increases is that there has been hardly any customers that cancel their orders or choose not to accept the price increase because they understand the situation on the supply side."

And then, Steve, I always love your big picture thoughts. So as it relates to pricing, the more pricing power that's enacted here when this all ends, does this pricing revert? Or is there something structural and you think it might be more sticky this cycle versus other cycles, just given that there are fewer competitors out there than in past decades."

And so we do the changes this year -- we did the changes this year only because of the significant increase in input costs. But on an ongoing basis, we do not view pricing as something to tactically go change. It's not a commodity product like memory products might be. These are proprietary products with strategic engagements and long-term relationships with customers, and their trust that we expect to be able to maintain. I'll let Steve answer the second half."

On some of the commodity products, if there's a lot of supply becomes available and there's a competition who's able to ship a DRAM or flash or NAND, those pricing may come down. 
But I don't see pricing on our microcontroller products, analog products, connectivity products, 98% of what we make is largely proprietary. Those prices will come down. Because when you look at the components of the pricing, the -- I don't see that fabs are going to lower the wafer cost outside fabs because they're making huge investments because of shortage, and that equipment is being placed in now and what would be the reason to lower the price later.  
The -- if the commodity prices come down, there's a small component of the overall cost where that will come down. And as Ganesh mentioned earlier, the labor costs are not likely to come down, the assembly test costs are not likely to come down, our internal fabrication and other costs are not going to come down. We're paying more for the equipment and that structurally stays in the cost structure. So I don't really see that the price increases that we're passing on to the customers are temporary in nature, nor are we giving that kind of impression to our customers. I think they're largely there to stay. Could there be a minor adjustment here and there if there was a significant cost downwards from the input cost perspective, then it's possible, but I don't really see it."

Once you're at full utilization and you're adding capital, which you're adding depreciation, then you're shipping that product, the incremental gross margin is not as high as you would think.  
Remember, we also ship first in, first out. So even when the factory becomes full, underutilization goes away, you're still shipping product, which you built earlier when they utilize -- the increasing capital wasn't added. So now we're adding incremental capital to grow the capacity and that depreciation comes in, so therefore, the incremental gross margin still -- incremental gross margin is better than the average because you're utilizing the factory better, the management, fixed infrastructure, the ecosystem, the water, the air, everything else, you're using it more efficiently. So there is incremental gross margin, which is higher than corporate. But your metric of what it has been in the last 4 quarters may not stay."

So first of all, bookings have been strong, remains strong, but we also have so much backlog in front of us that bookings are not necessarily the best indicator for where strength of the business is. Unsupported can come both from a business that is something which is booked inside of the quarter. But more often than not, what is happening is that people are pulling in their requirements. So it's already backlog we have and people would like to get it sooner than what we can provide it to them.  
And so a lot of factors that go into that unsupported. But the bottom line is that whatever we are able to produce and the growth that we're able to deliver, despite it being 26% year-over-year is far from what is required to meet what customers are telling us they want in a given quarter. And that keeps squeezing out and we keep shipping more every quarter, and we'll squeeze some more out in the subsequent quarters that we can't ship into this quarter. And it just reflects how demand is continuing to outstrip -- or the demand growth is continuing to outstrip the supply growth for multiple quarters, and we do not see a bending of that curve through much of 2022."
