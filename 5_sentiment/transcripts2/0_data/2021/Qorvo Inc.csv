Qorvo exceeded our third fiscal quarter guidance on revenue, gross margin and EPS. Our performance was supported by multiyear technology upgrade cycles and was broad-based across markets and customers. The Qorvo team is executing very well and we are pleased with our operating performance. 
The growth drivers in Qorvo's markets are supported by durable long-term trends. In smartphones, 5G units are set to approximately double year-over-year. 5G also presents opportunities beyond smartphones, with advanced network capabilities for more data, lower latency and machine-to-machine communications. We expect our technologies will be increasingly critical to cloud gaming, connected car, industrial IoT, remote medicine, smart homes and other growth categories. 
In WiFi, we are early in the rollout of WiFi 6 and industry analysts expect rapid adoption to continue. Our next-generation front-end modules and BAW-based filtering products are optimized for higher frequency and wider bandwidths of WiFi 6 and 6E, enabling faster upload and download speeds, increasing capacity and improving efficiency. Across our markets, complexity is increasing as functionality is added within shrinking form factors while more demanding next-generation specifications must be met. This is favoring higher performance, more densely integrated system solutions from proven suppliers with large-scale manufacturing expertise. 
Take, for example, the migration to dual-transmit architectures beginning in the premium tier of smartphones for 5G. Dual-transmit architectures require integrated transmit and receive filtering in the traditional receive-only diversity path. This requires better performing, more functionally dense solutions, making high-performance BAW multiplexing a proven differentiator. Industry analysts estimate there were over 250 million 5G phones sold in 2020. For 2021, we forecast approximately 500 million 5G phones. Within these phones, the front-end content is increasing $5 to $7 versus 4G, including in the mid-tier, where content can approximately double. 
The addition of 5G is driving a shift from discrete products to higher-value content, including our highly integrated solutions. For the 5G reference designs ramping now, Qorvo was the first to integrate filters, switching, power amps, LNAs and CMOS control in fully shielded compact solutions. In doing so, we address customer size, performance and time-to-market challenges. Demand has been strong for these complete main pad solutions, and customers are increasingly sourcing all 3, including the low, mid-high and ultra-high band placements. 
When combined with our PMICs, tuners, antennaplexers and dual connectivity modules, Qorvo offers customers a compact front-end solution with minimal placements delivering world-class performance. As a result, we enjoy increasingly collaborative relationships with our customers. During the quarter, we were recognized by 2 leading Android manufacturers with highly selective annual awards. Qorvo was the sole RF supplier to win vivo's Excellent Quality Award for 2020. And we were the sole electronics supplier to win OPPO's esteemed Joint Development Award. We're extremely proud of both honors. 
As I referenced earlier, during the quarter, we increased shipments of our complete main path solutions across the leading 5G basebands. We also secured new design wins for our next-generation complete main path solutions in support of upcoming Android 5G launches. For the diversity path, we launched our first generation of dual connectivity module for the mid- and high bands and commenced shipments to the leading Android smartphone manufacturer. 
We also released a next-generation BAW process, which reduces insertion loss, increases bandwidth in ultra-high band and WiFi 6E applications. In mobile WiFi, we began production shipments of our WiFi 6E solutions to top Android OEMs, increasing capacity and lowering latency in a range of smartphones and mobile devices. 
In Ultra-Wideband, we extended our capabilities to include open, fully supported system solutions, enabling ultra-precision location applications in mobile, IoT and automotive markets. During the quarter, we increased our Ultra-Wideband customer engagements in a broadening range of consumer applications, including tracker tags, smart speakers, smart TVs and other smart home appliances. 
Customers and channel partners are evaluating a broad range of applications, and we continue to believe Ultra-Wideband adoption in smartphones will be the catalyst for a growing ecosystem of connected devices. We see Ultra-Wideband proliferating quickly and representing an exciting opportunity for Qorvo. 
In IDP, we're very proud to have been selected by the National Institutes of Health for its Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics initiative, or RADx, to add COVID-19 testing capacity. In this program, we will use our Omnia test platform, a complete test solution enabled by Qorvo's high-frequency BAW. This platform is currently pending Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Qorvo's antigen testing has demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and specificity in clinical studies. That means it's capable of producing accurate results with very low levels of false readings. We believe this BAW sensor technology may be able to deliver a new approach to diagnostic testing, ultimately providing central lab testing accuracy at the point of care. 
Elsewhere in IDP, we continue to support a broad range of multiyear trends, including 5G, WiFi 6 and 6E, GaN defense, radar and comms, programmable power management, C-V2X, automotive WiFi and Ultra-Wideband. Our team has done an outstanding job developing products and ramping production to support initial 5G base station deployments in Asia. Today, we are in the early stages of multiyear rollouts and we have strong momentum as 5G continues to deploy. 
We've been selected by multiple OEMs to supply GaN PAs in addition to our small signal components and modules, and we see the focus on power consumption, bandwidth and higher frequencies supporting the continued migration to GaN PAs. During the quarter, Qorvo secured design wins with multiple base station OEMs to support 5GC band in the U.S. for which the spectrum auctions are in the process and initial deployments are expected later this year. We also received the Best Comprehensive Performance Award from ZTE, recognizing our 5G portfolio and customer support during the initial rollout of 5G base stations. 
In defense, we achieved strong growth in domestic radar and communications applications and game defense products for international radar programs. In connectivity, we ramped shipments of our 5-gigahertz WiFi 6 BAW filters and sampled our 6-gigahertz WiFi 6E front-end modules for routers and gateways, maximizing throughput and range for high-bandwidth applications such as video conferencing and online gaming. Demand for our WiFi 6 solutions has been strong across MSOs and retail segments. And we see continued strength as WiFi 6 deployments are still in the early phases. 
In the connected car, we were selected to supply 5G LTE, C-V2X and WiFi automotive qualified products to multiple OEMs, including Audi, BMW and Volvo. In low-power wireless, Qorvo was selected to supply the leading television manufacturer our low-power multi-protocol SoC and custom software, enabling a solar charging remote control. 
Before handing the call over to Mark, I want to say a word about Qorvo's workforce. The team delivered an outstanding performance in the December quarter. They adapted quickly in a dynamic environment and helped support exceptional results. I'm extremely proud of their responsiveness and dedication to our customers' success. As 5G, WiFi 6 and 6E, Ultra-Wideband and other connectivity protocols are rolled out globally, Qorvo is well positioned to delight customers and expand our technology reach. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."
33821,701726294,2190325,"Qorvo, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Qorvo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 third quarter was $1.095 billion, $35 million above the midpoint of our guidance, up 26% or $226 million versus last year and up approximately 11% sequentially, adjusting for th",841,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 third quarter was $1.095 billion, $35 million above the midpoint of our guidance, up 26% or $226 million versus last year and up approximately 11% sequentially, adjusting for the 14-week September quarter. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week fiscal year, and the September quarter was a 14-week quarter versus a typical 13-week quarter. 
In the December quarter, Mobile Products drove the sequential growth, with revenue of $826 million on seasonal demand effects and the ramp of higher content 5G smartphones. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of $269 million was up 30% versus last year on robust WiFi demand and double-digit growth from defense, Programmable Power Management and IoT markets. 
Non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 54.4%, which was above our guidance due to better-than-expected volumes, price and mix and lower-than-expected manufacturing and inventory costs. The combination of strong end market demand and our ongoing efforts to improve the portfolio, drive productivity and carefully manage inventories yielded record results. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were better than expected at $194 million and 17.7% of sales, largely due to timing on development programs. As a result, we forecast OpEx to pick up in the March quarter to levels previously guided. Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter was $357 million, and diluted earnings per share of $3.08 was $0.43 above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $404 million and CapEx was $36 million, yielding free cash flow of $368 million and free cash flow margin of 33.6%. We repurchased $160 million of shares during the quarter. 
As discussed on the last earnings call, we retired our 2026 notes during the quarter. We also called the remaining 2025 notes. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of debt and $1.2 billion of cash. Our leverage remains low, our revolver is untapped. The weighted average maturity of our debt is late 2029 and we have no material near-term maturities. 
With our financial flexibility, we can focus on developing technology, supporting customers and making prudent organic and inorganic investments that support long-term earnings and free cash flow growth. To that end, we continue to advance our BAW, SAW, GaN, GaAs, packaging and other core technologies and fund UWB, Programmable Power Management, biotechnologies, MEMS and other promising areas. 
Turning to our current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.025 billion and $1.055 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 50.5% to 51% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 at the midpoint of guidance. Our March quarter outlook reflects sustained broad customer demand stemming from multiyear technology upgrade cycles. In mobile, demand for 5G is adding RF complexity and driving higher content. The breadth of our customer base and firm demand signals provide confidence and stability in our outlook. We forecast mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $770 million at the midpoint or up over 35% year-over-year. 
In IDP, we project revenue of approximately $270 million in the current quarter, sustaining strong double-digit growth driven by WiFi 6 demand and other markets, even as 5G infrastructure build-outs remain uneven. Our March quarter gross margin guide is in line with the gross margin outlook discussed on our last earnings call and up over 100 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the March quarter to around $207 million. At the midpoint of our March quarter guidance, operating margin is forecasted to be over 30.5% for the third consecutive quarter. Our operating margin outlook for the year is 31.5% at the midpoint, clearing the lower end of the margin model we laid out previously. 
Qorvo was built for the integration of advanced technology trends critical to customer success in 5G and other growth markets. With broad and robust end market growth, we're now leveraging a more focused footprint. Our product portfolio is better matched to customer needs and our culture of continuous improvement is thriving. 
We project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be below 7.9%. With our year-to-date earnings and March quarter EPS guide, our fiscal '21 EPS estimate is over $9.40 per share at the midpoint or up nearly 50% year-over-year. Capital expenditures will step up in the March quarter as we work to intersect near-term demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. We still forecast CapEx to remain below $200 million or less than 5% of sales in fiscal '21. 
Currently, we project free cash flow of approximately $1 billion this fiscal year. As the December quarter results and our March quarter outlook show, Qorvo continues to operate well through a challenging period while delivering premium technology to a broad spectrum of customers in 5G, WiFi, IoT, defense and other growth markets. 
In closing, I'd like to join Bob in thanking Qorvo employees again for their continued efforts during this time. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And as you can see, our inventory levels are very good. 
We spend a lot of time -- fortunately for us, we've got a very broad customer base. So -- and given our position in the market, so we see the space across customers and products and -- have very good visibility. So it's -- it explains why very early last year, we called 250 million 5G handsets and that's about where the number ended up. 
Further, we not only use our rigorous internal assessments but we use external views to balance that and we make the best call we can. We were about 3% off on this particular quarter but we're generally close. And so we feel good about the guide we have in the March quarter, [ 10 40 ].

It's playing out at least as good or better than we had hoped. They're the pioneers of the technology and just a fantastic organization for design and development. We're bringing the scale and the customer relationships to really take it to the top tier. 
So we've got -- and then of course, the acquisition of 7Hugs to give the entire software stack has been a huge addition as well that's helping us. So all that's working really well. We're continuing to invest and hire more and critical resources that are enablers to cover all the opportunities. But one of the things that has happened since we closed the acquisition nearly a year ago now is just much more interaction with the mobile handset providers. Of course, that's the channel that we bring. 
Everyone is looking to put this UWB into the next generations of handsets so we're seeing the uptake we're expecting. And then a lot of people are lining up with devices that are going to talk to those handsets as well, right? So a lot of consumer electronics, smart home and so forth devices that we're talking to. 
And then the base of the revenue today is industrial IoT basically, and that's continuing to grow and perform at least as well as what we had expected. And then we'll have auto coming in on top of all of that so we're engaged as well with all the leading auto manufacturers. So it's a lot. We've got a lot going on, but the design activity, the reception is strong and really, I think, adding the software stack to the equation just really takes it to another level in terms of what we're going to be able to do for the industry."

So we've become pretty good at being able to forecast where we're going to be. Now I think we got to acknowledge that we missed by quite a margin this December quarter. So I think you need to understand that in order to understand the March quarter. So the March quarter really isn't a surprise where it's landing. It's more of the December quarter was much stronger than we expected. 
And we're really pleased about the December quarter. I want that to be clear. We've talked about our approach over the years and what we're striving to do about investing in technology, actively working the portfolio, driving productivity, exercising capital discipline. And the December quarter shows what's possible with the business. And it's years of hard work. It's just excellent execution by the team. And it's those things intersecting with favorable market conditions. 
So just about a lot went right in the December quarter and the result is that 54.4%. So volumes were stronger and more importantly, stronger than we expected and the outlook stayed strong, so that helps us sustain loadings and the associated fixed cost absorption. Spend control remains excellent, which is especially noteworthy, given the tough operating environment that our operations team has to work with. 
I mentioned earlier, the pricing environment is a bit, I guess, more favorable than normal. The market's tight. We're doing the best we can to serve customers and the time that they're expecting us to get them product. And then mix, we continue to move towards integrated modules and that's helping us greatly. And our particular advantage in mid, high-band and BAW-related integrated products is pulling in some other integrated modules into wins. So we're benefiting greatly there. And then we've got, of course, other highly differentiated products that are helping. 
And then there are another -- a number of other favorable items in the quarter, favorable yields. We had lower inventory charges than we expected and a number of other items. Again, generally, things went the right way. As we look forward to the March quarter, we do expect gross margin to drop to about where I said. We guided to 50.5% to 51% today. That's up 100 basis points year-over-year, which is what we've been striving to do is show margin expansion but we're down sequentially due to a number of factors. 
We're trying to keep inventories low so that will keep a check on absorption. We're ramping some lower-margin products We're just still working down the cost curve on those. They're important longer term. But that -- some of those products are coming into the March quarter, and then that actually continues on into the June quarter. And there are some other mix dynamics as well, including some less defense in the March quarter and some other things. 
And then we just can't assume that all these other things go our way as they did in the December quarter. We had -- the pricing environment may probably turn to a more normal state. The inventories write-offs will probably be more normal and we've assumed that. So we feel good about the -- about what we did, comfortable with the guide we have and I'll leave it at that."

I'll do my best to answer your question because as usual, it's not as simple as what many people from externally believe when you're working in the business. Number one, yes, there is tightness in the supply chain. I think it's quite well-known in the industry that silicon is constrained, whether that's in the communications industry or automotive. So in many ways, that is a governor on what's going on in this situation. 
We've been very fortunate that our team has excellent relationships and agreements with our suppliers externally and feel pretty good about how we've done that. And I'm quite confident we left some revenue on the -- out there for us still to get. But Mark mentioned in his opening comments that we've been getting long-term agreements with our customers, so that they feel pretty confident in their demand. And when we do our market model, which Mark also talked about, and we feel we have a pretty good handle on the market based on our comments all the way through last year, that many people believed that it was not going to be turning out the way we projected in just the number of 5G handsets. 
So when we look at our market models, the orders we already have, the migration, as you've already commented on 5G more than doubling, looking in at WiFi, looking at WiFi 6, pod in every room going from 2 streams to 3 streams, that being [ 2.45 ] for communicating to the client and then for the backhaul using a third stream, which adds a lot of content, if it's 8 channels feeding it back to the main access point. So when we integrate all this and look at our customer orders, we feel pretty good about the commitments they're making to us. 
And I want to remind everyone, the sudden change at Huawei who was not using best-in-class components. As you guys remember, we talked a lot about how that they've started to -- and rightfully so, because of the U.S. government tried to use local sources while the people that are picking up their share are using best-in-class components, which is what we said Huawei would have done if it was available to them. 
So when we look at everything that's going on, as Mark said, we feel good. We can already comment on June, which he did. So I think as we lay out the year, we'll see how sell-throughs and Chinese New Year and all those conditions in a pandemic and the vaccination, but we feel good about what we're communicating today, very good about it."

And as you say, it's a bit early so we expect to provide more details on our next earnings call, when we'll wrap up fiscal '21 and start fiscal '22. 
But maybe before I get into gross margin or margins overall, maybe just talk a little bit about fiscal '22. As we sit here today, for the most part, demand's firm, as Bob and Eric have talked about. Our business is broad and you see that reflected in the December results, March quarter guide. And then we all know that the markets that we serve, 5G, WiFi, defense, IoT, other markets, we obviously expect those to grow multiyear. 
We believe that Qorvo's technology and products and our ongoing customer engagement positions us really well in those markets. So we've talked about feeling very comfortable about the June quarter, as Eric just mentioned, kind of more of a supply constraint situation than demand constraints we see at this point. We're reasonably confident for a near $1 billion quarter. And again, we'll see what happens on the other side of Lunar New Year and keep watching the channels but keeping an eye on it.
On the rest of the P&L, as you can imagine, while the rest of the year and certainly, the rest of the P&L, it's just a lot more difficult to give anything. We're in our planning cycle now. There's just a number of factors. What happens to the outlook, the effect on loadings and absorption, mix effects in the business yields, inventory, so forth. 
And then just on the OpEx side, investments we want to make in the future. So any number of factors are going to impact the results and we just need to finish the planning. We've given a March guide and we've given a June revenue guide or revenue indication, supply constrained. I think on the June quarter, we actually see margins going down a bit. We actually see the June quarter gross margin below 50%. We see operating margin below 30%. And again, that's price, mix, cost factors. 
But I would say for the year, we still expect, clearly, operating margins to be above 30%. We cleared that this year. We're committed to continue to work to expand operating margins. And I think we'll say that for this call and provide more detail on the next call."

So we're going to be focusing on places where we can take that BAW technology and leverage it into larger modules to a large extent, and then continuing to really leverage our franchise around the antenna. 
We are clear leaders at helping our customers manage their antenna networks, whether it's tuning or we've got impedance tuning, we have aperture tuning. We have the antennaplexing that we've talked about.

And I guess within that, should we still think of GaN as outgrowing that trend based on what you're seeing as infrastructure and defense kind of returns to growth as we move through the year?"

Certainly, as Bob talked about, defense will be off a bit. But our WiFi business is growing very nicely. Our Power Management business is also growing very nicely, and several of the other markets like our broadband business as well. So quite a few of the underlying markets driving the business. 
And if you kind of look history for the first 3 months of the year compared to those same 3 months of last year, we're up almost 47%, I think. And almost all of those underlying businesses are up double digits. So we've got a lot of strengths. We ebb and flow a bit as we go for quarters -- through each quarter. But I would say, pretty significant strength in our WiFi business as WiFi 6 continues to roll out. 
As far as long term, I'm still very confident of the underlying trends in the business, and we'll have some unevenness as we go quarter-to-quarter. But the things like the adoption of GaN and the proliferation of massive MIMO, the rollout of 5G and WiFi 6, all those are great trends that I think will continue to allow the business to grow."

Qorvo exceeded our third fiscal quarter guidance on revenue, gross margin and EPS. Our performance was supported by multiyear technology upgrade cycles and was broad-based across markets and",1191,"Thank you, Doug, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. 
Qorvo exceeded our third fiscal quarter guidance on revenue, gross margin and EPS. Our performance was supported by multiyear technology upgrade cycles and was broad-based across markets and customers. The Qorvo team is executing very well and we are pleased with our operating performance. 
The growth drivers in Qorvo's markets are supported by durable long-term trends. In smartphones, 5G units are set to approximately double year-over-year. 5G also presents opportunities beyond smartphones, with advanced network capabilities for more data, lower latency and machine-to-machine communications. We expect our technologies will be increasingly critical to cloud gaming, connected car, industrial IoT, remote medicine, smart homes and other growth categories. 
In WiFi, we are early in the rollout of WiFi 6 and industry analysts expect rapid adoption to continue. Our next-generation front-end modules and BAW-based filtering products are optimized for higher frequency and wider bandwidths of WiFi 6 and 6E, enabling faster upload and download speeds, increasing capacity and improving efficiency. Across our markets, complexity is increasing as functionality is added within shrinking form factors while more demanding next-generation specifications must be met. This is favoring higher performance, more densely integrated system solutions from proven suppliers with large-scale manufacturing expertise. 
Take, for example, the migration to dual-transmit architectures beginning in the premium tier of smartphones for 5G. Dual-transmit architectures require integrated transmit and receive filtering in the traditional receive-only diversity path. This requires better performing, more functionally dense solutions, making high-performance BAW multiplexing a proven differentiator. Industry analysts estimate there were over 250 million 5G phones sold in 2020. For 2021, we forecast approximately 500 million 5G phones. Within these phones, the front-end content is increasing $5 to $7 versus 4G, including in the mid-tier, where content can approximately double. 
The addition of 5G is driving a shift from discrete products to higher-value content, including our highly integrated solutions. For the 5G reference designs ramping now, Qorvo was the first to integrate filters, switching, power amps, LNAs and CMOS control in fully shielded compact solutions. In doing so, we address customer size, performance and time-to-market challenges. Demand has been strong for these complete main pad solutions, and customers are increasingly sourcing all 3, including the low, mid-high and ultra-high band placements. 
When combined with our PMICs, tuners, antennaplexers and dual connectivity modules, Qorvo offers customers a compact front-end solution with minimal placements delivering world-class performance. As a result, we enjoy increasingly collaborative relationships with our customers. During the quarter, we were recognized by 2 leading Android manufacturers with highly selective annual awards. Qorvo was the sole RF supplier to win vivo's Excellent Quality Award for 2020. And we were the sole electronics supplier to win OPPO's esteemed Joint Development Award. We're extremely proud of both honors. 
As I referenced earlier, during the quarter, we increased shipments of our complete main path solutions across the leading 5G basebands. We also secured new design wins for our next-generation complete main path solutions in support of upcoming Android 5G launches. For the diversity path, we launched our first generation of dual connectivity module for the mid- and high bands and commenced shipments to the leading Android smartphone manufacturer. 
We also released a next-generation BAW process, which reduces insertion loss, increases bandwidth in ultra-high band and WiFi 6E applications. In mobile WiFi, we began production shipments of our WiFi 6E solutions to top Android OEMs, increasing capacity and lowering latency in a range of smartphones and mobile devices. 
In Ultra-Wideband, we extended our capabilities to include open, fully supported system solutions, enabling ultra-precision location applications in mobile, IoT and automotive markets. During the quarter, we increased our Ultra-Wideband customer engagements in a broadening range of consumer applications, including tracker tags, smart speakers, smart TVs and other smart home appliances. 
Customers and channel partners are evaluating a broad range of applications, and we continue to believe Ultra-Wideband adoption in smartphones will be the catalyst for a growing ecosystem of connected devices. We see Ultra-Wideband proliferating quickly and representing an exciting opportunity for Qorvo. 
In IDP, we're very proud to have been selected by the National Institutes of Health for its Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics initiative, or RADx, to add COVID-19 testing capacity. In this program, we will use our Omnia test platform, a complete test solution enabled by Qorvo's high-frequency BAW. This platform is currently pending Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Qorvo's antigen testing has demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and specificity in clinical studies. That means it's capable of producing accurate results with very low levels of false readings. We believe this BAW sensor technology may be able to deliver a new approach to diagnostic testing, ultimately providing central lab testing accuracy at the point of care. 
Elsewhere in IDP, we continue to support a broad range of multiyear trends, including 5G, WiFi 6 and 6E, GaN defense, radar and comms, programmable power management, C-V2X, automotive WiFi and Ultra-Wideband. Our team has done an outstanding job developing products and ramping production to support initial 5G base station deployments in Asia. Today, we are in the early stages of multiyear rollouts and we have strong momentum as 5G continues to deploy. 
We've been selected by multiple OEMs to supply GaN PAs in addition to our small signal components and modules, and we see the focus on power consumption, bandwidth and higher frequencies supporting the continued migration to GaN PAs. During the quarter, Qorvo secured design wins with multiple base station OEMs to support 5GC band in the U.S. for which the spectrum auctions are in the process and initial deployments are expected later this year. We also received the Best Comprehensive Performance Award from ZTE, recognizing our 5G portfolio and customer support during the initial rollout of 5G base stations. 
In defense, we achieved strong growth in domestic radar and communications applications and game defense products for international radar programs. In connectivity, we ramped shipments of our 5-gigahertz WiFi 6 BAW filters and sampled our 6-gigahertz WiFi 6E front-end modules for routers and gateways, maximizing throughput and range for high-bandwidth applications such as video conferencing and online gaming. Demand for our WiFi 6 solutions has been strong across MSOs and retail segments. And we see continued strength as WiFi 6 deployments are still in the early phases. 
In the connected car, we were selected to supply 5G LTE, C-V2X and WiFi automotive qualified products to multiple OEMs, including Audi, BMW and Volvo. In low-power wireless, Qorvo was selected to supply the leading television manufacturer our low-power multi-protocol SoC and custom software, enabling a solar charging remote control. 
Before handing the call over to Mark, I want to say a word about Qorvo's workforce. The team delivered an outstanding performance in the December quarter. They adapted quickly in a dynamic environment and helped support exceptional results. I'm extremely proud of their responsiveness and dedication to our customers' success. As 5G, WiFi 6 and 6E, Ultra-Wideband and other connectivity protocols are rolled out globally, Qorvo is well positioned to delight customers and expand our technology reach. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."
33821,701726294,2190488,"Qorvo, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Qorvo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 third quarter was $1.095 billion, $35 million above the midpoint of our guidance, up 26% or $226 million versus last year and up approximately 11% sequentially, adjusting for",841,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 third quarter was $1.095 billion, $35 million above the midpoint of our guidance, up 26% or $226 million versus last year and up approximately 11% sequentially, adjusting for the 14-week September quarter. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week fiscal year, and the September quarter was a 14-week quarter versus a typical 13-week quarter. 
In the December quarter, Mobile Products drove the sequential growth, with revenue of $826 million on seasonal demand effects and the ramp of higher content 5G smartphones. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of $269 million was up 30% versus last year on robust WiFi demand and double-digit growth from defense, Programmable Power Management and IoT markets. 
Non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 54.4%, which was above our guidance due to better-than-expected volumes, price and mix and lower-than-expected manufacturing and inventory costs. The combination of strong end market demand and our ongoing efforts to improve the portfolio, drive productivity and carefully manage inventories yielded record results. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were better than expected at $194 million and 17.7% of sales, largely due to timing on development programs. As a result, we forecast OpEx to pick up in the March quarter to levels previously guided. Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter was $357 million, and diluted earnings per share of $3.08 was $0.43 above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $404 million and CapEx was $36 million, yielding free cash flow of $368 million and free cash flow margin of 33.6%. We repurchased $160 million of shares during the quarter. 
As discussed on the last earnings call, we retired our 2026 notes during the quarter. We also called the remaining 2025 notes. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of debt and $1.2 billion of cash. Our leverage remains low, our revolver is untapped. The weighted average maturity of our debt is late 2029 and we have no material near-term maturities. 
With our financial flexibility, we can focus on developing technology, supporting customers and making prudent organic and inorganic investments that support long-term earnings and free cash flow growth. To that end, we continue to advance our BAW, SAW, GaN, GaAs, packaging and other core technologies and fund UWB, Programmable Power Management, biotechnologies, MEMS and other promising areas. 
Turning to our current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.025 billion and $1.055 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 50.5% to 51% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 at the midpoint of guidance. Our March quarter outlook reflects sustained broad customer demand stemming from multiyear technology upgrade cycles. In mobile, demand for 5G is adding RF complexity and driving higher content. The breadth of our customer base and firm demand signals provide confidence and stability in our outlook. We forecast mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $770 million at the midpoint or up over 35% year-over-year. 
In IDP, we project revenue of approximately $270 million in the current quarter, sustaining strong double-digit growth driven by WiFi 6 demand and other markets, even as 5G infrastructure build-outs remain uneven. Our March quarter gross margin guide is in line with the gross margin outlook discussed on our last earnings call and up over 100 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the March quarter to around $207 million. At the midpoint of our March quarter guidance, operating margin is forecasted to be over 30.5% for the third consecutive quarter. Our operating margin outlook for the year is 31.5% at the midpoint, clearing the lower end of the margin model we laid out previously. 
Qorvo was built for the integration of advanced technology trends critical to customer success in 5G and other growth markets. With broad and robust end market growth, we're now leveraging a more focused footprint. Our product portfolio is better matched to customer needs and our culture of continuous improvement is thriving. 
We project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be below 7.9%. With our year-to-date earnings and March quarter EPS guide, our fiscal '21 EPS estimate is over $9.40 per share at the midpoint or up nearly 50% year-over-year. Capital expenditures will step up in the March quarter as we work to intersect near-term demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. We still forecast CapEx to remain below $200 million or less than 5% of sales in fiscal '21. 
Currently, we project free cash flow of approximately $1 billion this fiscal year. As the December quarter results and our March quarter outlook show, Qorvo continues to operate well through a challenging period while delivering premium technology to a broad spectrum of customers in 5G, WiFi, IoT, defense and other growth markets. 
In closing, I'd like to join Bob in thanking Qorvo employees again for their continued efforts during this time. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

We spend a lot of time -- fortunately for us, we've got a very broad customer base. So -- and given our position in the market, so we see the space across customers and products and -- have very good visibility. So it's -- it explains why very early last year, we called 250 million 5G handsets and that's about where the number ended up. 
Further, we not only use our rigorous internal assessments but we use external views to balance that and we make the best call we can. We were about 3% off on this particular quarter but we're generally close. And so we feel good about the guide we have in the March quarter, [ 10 40 ].

We're bringing the scale and the customer relationships to really take it to the top tier. 
So we've got -- and then of course, the acquisition of 7Hugs to give the entire software stack has been a huge addition as well that's helping us. So all that's working really well. We're continuing to invest and hire more and critical resources that are enablers to cover all the opportunities. But one of the things that has happened since we closed the acquisition nearly a year ago now is just much more interaction with the mobile handset providers. Of course, that's the channel that we bring. 
Everyone is looking to put this UWB into the next generations of handsets so we're seeing the uptake we're expecting. And then a lot of people are lining up with devices that are going to talk to those handsets as well, right? So a lot of consumer electronics, smart home and so forth devices that we're talking to. 
And then the base of the revenue today is industrial IoT basically, and that's continuing to grow and perform at least as well as what we had expected. And then we'll have auto coming in on top of all of that so we're engaged as well with all the leading auto manufacturers. So it's a lot.

The outlook is basically on top of what I talked about last quarter. So we've become pretty good at being able to forecast where we're going to be. Now I think we got to acknowledge that we missed by quite a margin this Decembe",559,"Yes. So Karl, this is Mark. The outlook is basically on top of what I talked about last quarter. So we've become pretty good at being able to forecast where we're going to be. Now I think we got to acknowledge that we missed by quite a margin this December quarter. So I think you need to understand that in order to understand the March quarter. So the March quarter really isn't a surprise where it's landing. It's more of the December quarter was much stronger than we expected. 
And we're really pleased about the December quarter. I want that to be clear. We've talked about our approach over the years and what we're striving to do about investing in technology, actively working the portfolio, driving productivity, exercising capital discipline. And the December quarter shows what's possible with the business. And it's years of hard work. It's just excellent execution by the team. And it's those things intersecting with favorable market conditions. 
So just about a lot went right in the December quarter and the result is that 54.4%. So volumes were stronger and more importantly, stronger than we expected. And the outlook stayed strong, so that helps us sustain loadings and the associated fixed cost absorption. Spend control remains excellent, which is especially noteworthy, given the tough operating environment that our operations team has to work with. 
I mentioned earlier, the pricing environment is a bit, I guess, more favorable than normal. The market's tight. We're doing the best we can to serve customers and the time that they're expecting us to get them product. And then mix, we continue to move towards integrated modules and that's helping us greatly. And our particular advantage in mid, high-band and BAW-related integrated products is pulling in some other integrated modules into wins. So we're benefiting greatly there. And then we've got, of course, other highly differentiated products that are helping. 
And then there are another -- a number of other favorable items in the quarter, favorable yields. We had lower inventory charges than we expected and a number of other items. Again, generally, things went the right way. As we look forward to the March quarter, we do expect gross margin to drop to about where I said. We guided to 50.5% to 51% today. That's up 100 basis points year-over-year, which is what we've been striving to do is show margin expansion but we're down sequentially due to a number of factors. 
We're trying to keep inventories low so that will keep a check on absorption. We're ramping some lower-margin products We're just still working down the cost curve on those. They're important longer term. But that -- some of those products are coming into the March quarter, and then that actually continues on into the June quarter. And there are some other mix dynamics as well, including some less defense in the March quarter and some other things. 
And then we just can't assume that all these other things go our way as they did in the December quarter. We had -- the pricing environment may probably turn to a more normal state. The inventories write-offs will probably be more normal and we've assumed that. So we feel good about the -- about what we did, comfortable with the guide we have and I'll leave it at that."

I'll do my best to answer your question because as usual, it's not as simple as what many people from externally believe when you're working in the business. Number one, yes, there is tightness in the supply chain. I think it's quite well-known in the industry that silicon is constrained, whether that's in the communications industry or automotive. So in many ways, that is a governor on what's going on in this situation. 
We've been very fortunate that our team has excellent relationships and agreements with our suppliers externally and feel pretty good about how we've done that. And I'm quite confident we left some revenue on the -- out there for us still to get. But Mark mentioned in his opening comments that we've been getting long-term agreements with our customers, so that they feel pretty confident in their demand. And when we do our market model, which Mark also talked about, and we feel we have a pretty good handle on the market based on our comments all the way through last year, that many people believed that it was not going to be turning out the way we projected in just the number of 5G handsets. 
So when we look at our market models, the orders we already have, the migration, as you've already commented on 5G more than doubling, looking in at WiFi, looking at WiFi 6, pod in every room going from 2 streams to 3 streams, that being 2.45 for communicating to the client and then for the backhaul using a third stream, which adds a lot of content, if it's 8 channels feeding it back to the main access point. So when we integrate all this and look at our customer orders, we feel pretty good about the commitments they're making to us. 
And I want to remind everyone, the sudden change at Huawei who was not using best-in-class components. As you guys remember, we talked a lot about how that they've started to -- and rightfully so, because of the U.S. government tried to use local sources while the people that are picking up their share are using best-in-class components, which is what we said Huawei would have done if it was available to them. 
So when we look at everything that's going on, as Mark said, we feel good. We can already comment on June, which he did. So I think as we lay out the year, we'll see how sell-throughs and Chinese New Year and all those conditions in a pandemic and the vaccination, but we feel good about what we're communicating today, very good about it."

And as you say, it's a bit early so we expect to provide more details on our next earnings call, when we'll wrap up fiscal '21 and start fiscal '22. 
But maybe before I get into gross margin or margins overall, maybe just talk a little bit about fiscal '22. As we sit here today, for the most part, demand's firm, as Bob and Eric have talked about. Our business is broad and you see that reflected in the December results, March quarter guide. And then we all know that the markets that we serve, 5G, WiFi, defense, IoT, other markets, we obviously expect those to grow multiyear. 
We believe that Qorvo's technology and products and our ongoing customer engagement positions us really well in those markets. So we've talked about feeling very comfortable about the June quarter, as Eric just mentioned, kind of more of a supply constraint situation than demand constraints we see at this point. We're reasonably confident for a near $1 billion quarter. And again, we'll see what happens on the other side of Lunar New Year and keep watching the channels but keeping an eye on it.
On the rest of the P&L, as you can imagine, while the rest of the year and certainly, the rest of the P&L, it's just a lot more difficult to give anything. We're in our planning cycle now. There's just a number of factors. What happens to the outlook, the effect on loadings and absorption, mix effects in the business yields, inventory, so forth. 
And then just on the OpEx side, investments we want to make in the future. So any number of factors are going to impact the results and we just need to finish the planning. We've given a March guide and we've given a June revenue guide or revenue indication, supply constrained. I think on the June quarter, we actually see margins going down a bit. We actually see the June quarter gross margin below 50%. We see operating margin below 30%. And again, that's price, mix, cost factors. 
But I would say for the year, we still expect, clearly, operating margins to be above 30%. We cleared that this year. We're committed to continue to work to expand operating margins. And I think we'll say that for this call and provide more detail on the next call."

So when we look at just the coming year, if you will, it's going to be highly leveraged towards BAW-based products. In particular, our R&D team is bringing us a fresh technology on a regular cadence now, and we're taking that into highly differentiated discretes as we talked about with antennaplexers but then also those can help make multiplexers as well that sell not only in discrete but enable these highly integrated modules. So we're going to be focusing on places where we can take that BAW technology and leverage it into larger modules to a large extent, and then continuing to really leverage our franchise around the antenna. 
We are clear leaders at helping our customers manage their antenna networks, whether it's tuning or we've got impedance tuning, we have aperture tuning. We have the antennaplexing that we've talked about. And it's getting to be more and more of a problem for our customers as new GPS bands and new bands are added in C-band and CBRS spectrum and so forth. So there's a lot of work around that antenna, and we've got a lot of very unique capability to bring technology but also modeling and app support there. 
So these are large opportunities for us in the near term, really leveraged on the complexity of 5G and our basket of technologies, which is broad and unequaled in a lot of ways. The UWB, we look at, is more of a driver in the next 2 years to 3 years, really, where it begins to get to the scale because we're starting very, very low now, of course, as an industry, and just beginning to take off. But no question in our mind, that's going to be a large driver. If you look out 2 to 3 years from now, it's going to be a big part of our business."

Certainly, as Bob talked about, defense will be off a bit. But our WiFi business is growing very nicely. Our Power Management business is also growing very nicely, and several of the other markets like our broadband business as well. So quite a few of the underlying markets driving the business. 
And if you kind of look history for the first 3 months of the year compared to those same 3 months of last year, we're up almost 47%, I think. And almost all of those underlying businesses are up double digits. So we've got a lot of strengths. We ebb and flow a bit as we go for quarters -- through each quarter. But I would say, pretty significant strength in our WiFi business as WiFi 6 continues to roll out. 
As far as long term, I'm still very confident of the underlying trends in the business, and we'll have some unevenness as we go quarter-to-quarter. But the things like the adoption of GaN and the proliferation of massive MIMO, the rollout of 5G and WiFi 6, all those are great trends that I think will continue to allow the business to grow."

Qorvo exceeded our third fiscal quarter guidance on revenue, gross margin and EPS.

Qorvo exceeded our third fiscal quarter guidance on revenue, gross margin and EPS. Our performance was supported by multiyear technology upgrade cycles and was broad-based across markets and customers. The Qorvo team is executing very well and we are pleased with our operating performance. 
The growth drivers in Qorvo's markets are supported by durable long-term trends. In smartphones, 5G units are set to approximately double year-over-year. 5G also presents opportunities beyond smartphones, with advanced network capabilities for more data, lower latency and machine-to-machine communications. We expect our technologies will be increasingly critical to cloud gaming, connected car, industrial IoT, remote medicine, smart homes and other growth categories. 
In Wi-Fi, we are early in the rollout of Wi-Fi 6 and industry analysts expect rapid adoption to continue. Our next-generation front-end modules and BAW-based filtering products are optimized for higher frequency and wider bandwidths of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, enabling faster upload and download speeds, increasing capacity and improving efficiency. Across our markets, complexity is increasing as functionality is added within shrinking form factors while more demanding next-generation specifications must be met. This is favoring higher performance, more densely integrated system solutions from proven suppliers with large-scale manufacturing expertise. 
Take, for example, the migration to dual-transmit architectures beginning in the premium tier of smartphones for 5G. Dual-transmit architectures require integrated transmit and receive filtering in the traditional receive-only diversity path. This requires better performing, more functionally dense solutions, making high-performance BAW multiplexing a proven differentiator. Industry analysts estimate there were over 250 million 5G phones sold in 2020. For 2021, we forecast approximately 500 million 5G phones. Within these phones, the front-end content is increasing $5 to $7 versus 4G, including in the mid-tier, where content can approximately double. 
The addition of 5G is driving a shift from discrete products to higher-value content, including our highly integrated solutions. For the 5G reference designs ramping now, Qorvo was the first to integrate filters, switching, power amps, LNAs and CMOS control in fully shielded compact solutions. In doing so, we address customer size, performance and time-to-market challenges. Demand has been strong for these complete main path solutions, and customers are increasingly sourcing all 3, including the low, mid-high and ultra-high band placements. 
When combined with our PMICs, tuners, antennaplexers and dual connectivity modules, Qorvo offers customers a compact front-end solution with minimal placements delivering world-class performance. As a result, we enjoy increasingly collaborative relationships with our customers. During the quarter, we were recognized by 2 leading Android manufacturers with highly selective annual awards. Qorvo was the sole RF supplier to win Vivo's Excellent Quality Award for 2020. And we were the sole electronics supplier to win Oppo's esteemed Joint Development Award. We're extremely proud of both honors. 
As I referenced earlier, during the quarter, we increased shipments of our complete main path solutions across the leading 5G basebands. We also secured new design wins for our next-generation complete main path solutions in support of upcoming Android 5G launches. For the diversity path, we launched our first generation of dual connectivity module for the mid- and high bands and commenced shipments to the leading Android smartphone manufacturer. 
We also released a next-generation BAW process, which reduces insertion loss, increases bandwidth in ultra-high band and Wi-Fi 6E applications. In mobile Wi-Fi, we began production shipments of our Wi-Fi 6E solutions to top Android OEMs, increasing capacity and lowering latency in a range of smartphones and mobile devices. 
In Ultra-Wideband, we extended our capabilities to include open, fully supported system solutions, enabling ultra-precision location applications in mobile, IoT and automotive markets. During the quarter, we increased our Ultra-Wideband customer engagements in a broadening range of consumer applications, including tracker tags, smart speakers, smart TVs and other smart home appliances. 
Customers and channel partners are evaluating a broad range of applications, and we continue to believe Ultra-Wideband adoption in smartphones will be the catalyst for a growing ecosystem of connected devices. We see Ultra-Wideband proliferating quickly and representing an exciting opportunity for Qorvo. 
In IDP, we're very proud to have been selected by the National Institutes of Health for its Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics initiative, or RADx, to add COVID-19 testing capacity. In this program, we will use our Omnia test platform, a complete test solution enabled by Qorvo's high-frequency BAW. This platform is currently pending Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Qorvo's antigen testing has demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and specificity in clinical studies. That means it's capable of producing accurate results with very low levels of false readings. We believe this BAW sensor technology may be able to deliver a new approach to diagnostic testing, ultimately providing central lab testing accuracy at the point of care. 
Elsewhere in IDP, we continue to support a broad range of multiyear trends, including 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, GaN defense, radar and comms, programmable power management, C-V2X, automotive Wi-Fi and Ultra-Wideband. Our team has done an outstanding job developing products and ramping production to support initial 5G base station deployments in Asia. Today, we are in the early stages of multiyear rollouts and we have strong momentum as 5G continues to deploy. 
We've been selected by multiple OEMs to supply GaN PAs in addition to our small signal components and modules, and we see the focus on power consumption, bandwidth and higher frequencies supporting the continued migration to GaN PAs. During the quarter, Qorvo secured design wins with multiple base station OEMs to support 5GC band in the U.S. for which the spectrum auctions are in the process and initial deployments are expected later this year. We also received the Best Comprehensive Performance Award from ZTE, recognizing our 5G portfolio and customer support during the initial rollout of 5G base stations. 
In defense, we achieved strong growth in domestic radar and communications applications and game defense products for international radar programs. In connectivity, we ramped shipments of our 5 GHz Wi-Fi 6 BAW filters and sampled our 6 GHz Wi-Fi 6E front-end modules for routers and gateways, maximizing throughput and range for high-bandwidth applications such as video conferencing and online gaming. Demand for our Wi-Fi 6 solutions has been strong across MSOs and retail segments. And we see continued strength as Wi-Fi 6 deployments are still in the early phases. 
In the connected car, we were selected to supply 5G LTE, C-V2X and Wi-Fi automotive qualified products to multiple OEMs, including Audi, BMW and Volvo. In low-power wireless, Qorvo was selected to supply the leading television manufacturer our low-power multi-protocol SoC and custom software, enabling a solar charging remote control. 
Before handing the call over to Mark, I want to say a word about Qorvo's workforce. The team delivered an outstanding performance in the December quarter. They adapted quickly in a dynamic environment and helped support exceptional results. I'm extremely proud of their responsiveness and dedication to our customers' success. As 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, Ultra-Wideband and other connectivity protocols are rolled out globally, Qorvo is well positioned to delight customers and expand our technology reach. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."
33821,701726294,2190820,"Qorvo, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Qorvo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.

Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 third quarter was $1.095 billion, $35 million above the midpoint of our guidance, up 26% or $226 million versus last year and up approximately 11% sequentially, adjusting for the 14-week September quarter. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week fiscal year, and the September quarter was a 14-week quarter versus a typical 13-week quarter. 
In the December quarter, Mobile Products drove the sequential growth, with revenue of $826 million on seasonal demand effects and the ramp of higher content 5G smartphones. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of $269 million was up 30% versus last year on robust Wi-Fi demand and double-digit growth from defense, Programmable Power Management and IoT markets. 
Non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 54.4%, which was above our guidance due to better-than-expected volumes, price and mix and lower-than-expected manufacturing and inventory costs. The combination of strong end market demand and our ongoing efforts to improve the portfolio, drive productivity and carefully manage inventories yielded record results. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were better than expected at $194 million and 17.7% of sales, largely due to timing on development programs. As a result, we forecast OpEx to pick up in the March quarter to levels previously guided. Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter was $357 million, and diluted earnings per share of $3.08 was $0.43 above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $404 million and CapEx was $36 million, yielding free cash flow of $368 million and free cash flow margin of 33.6%. We repurchased $160 million of shares during the quarter. 
As discussed on the last earnings call, we retired our 2026 notes during the quarter. We also called the remaining 2025 notes. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of debt and $1.2 billion of cash. Our leverage remains low, our revolver is untapped. The weighted average maturity of our debt is late 2029 and we have no material near-term maturities. 
With our financial flexibility, we can focus on developing technology, supporting customers and making prudent organic and inorganic investments that support long-term earnings and free cash flow growth. To that end, we continue to advance our BAW, SAW, GaN, GaAs, packaging and other core technologies and fund UWB, Programmable Power Management, biotechnologies, MEMS and other promising areas. 
Turning to our current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.025 billion and $1.055 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 50.5% to 51% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 at the midpoint of guidance. Our March quarter outlook reflects sustained broad customer demand stemming from multiyear technology upgrade cycles. In mobile, demand for 5G is adding RF complexity and driving higher content. The breadth of our customer base and firm demand signals provide confidence and stability in our outlook. We forecast mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $770 million at the midpoint or up over 35% year-over-year. 
In IDP, we project revenue of approximately $270 million in the current quarter, sustaining strong double-digit growth driven by Wi-Fi 6 demand and other markets, even as 5G infrastructure build-outs remain uneven. Our March quarter gross margin guide is in line with the gross margin outlook discussed on our last earnings call and up over 100 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the March quarter to around $207 million. At the midpoint of our March quarter guidance, operating margin is forecasted to be over 30.5% for the third consecutive quarter. Our operating margin outlook for the year is 31.5% at the midpoint, clearing the lower end of the margin model we laid out previously. 
Qorvo was built for the integration of advanced technology trends critical to customer success in 5G and other growth markets. With broad and robust end market growth, we're now leveraging a more focused footprint. Our product portfolio is better matched to customer needs and our culture of continuous improvement is thriving. 
We project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be below 7.9%. With our year-to-date earnings and March quarter EPS guide, our fiscal '21 EPS estimate is over $9.40 per share at the midpoint or up nearly 50% year-over-year. Capital expenditures will step up in the March quarter as we work to intersect near-term demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. We still forecast CapEx to remain below $200 million or less than 5% of sales in fiscal '21. 
Currently, we project free cash flow of approximately $1 billion this fiscal year. As the December quarter results and our March quarter outlook show, Qorvo continues to operate well through a challenging period while delivering premium technology to a broad spectrum of customers in 5G, Wi-Fi, IoT, defense and other growth markets. 
In closing, I'd like to join Bob in thanking Qorvo employees again for their continued efforts during this time. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

So -- and given our position in the market, so we see the space across customers and products and -- have very good visibility. So it's -- it explains why very early last year, we called 250 million 5G handsets and that's about where the number ended up. 
Further, we not only use our rigorous internal assessments but we use external views to balance that and we make the best call we can. We were about 3% off on this particular quarter but we're generally close. And so we feel good about the guide we have in the March quarter, [ 10 40 ]. And then we would think that we'd be somewhere near 1 billion if markets hold up in the June quarter."

It's playing out at least as good or better than we had hoped. They're the pioneers of the technology and just a fantastic organization for design and development. We're bringing the scale and the customer relationships to really take it to the top tier. 
So we've got -- and then of course, the acquisition of 7Hugs to give the entire software stack has been a huge addition as well that's helping us. So all that's working really well. We're continuing to invest and hire more and critical resources that are enablers to cover all the opportunities. But one of the things that has happened since we closed the acquisition nearly a year ago now is just much more interaction with the mobile handset providers. Of course, that's the channel that we bring. 
Everyone is looking to put this UWB into the next generations of handsets so we're seeing the uptake we're expecting. And then a lot of people are lining up with devices that are going to talk to those handsets as well, right? So a lot of consumer electronics, smart home and so forth devices that we're talking to. 
And then the base of the revenue today is industrial IoT basically, and that's continuing to grow and perform at least as well as what we had expected. And then we'll have auto coming in on top of all of that so we're engaged as well with all the leading auto manufacturers. So it's a lot. We've got a lot going on, but the design activity, the reception is strong and really, I think, adding the software stack to the equation just really takes it to another level in terms of what we're going to be able to do for the industry."

The outlook is basically on top of what I talked about last quarter. So we've become pretty good at being able to forecast where we're going to be. Now I think we got to acknowledge that we missed by quite a margin this Decembe",563,"Yes. So Karl, this is Mark. The outlook is basically on top of what I talked about last quarter. So we've become pretty good at being able to forecast where we're going to be. Now I think we got to acknowledge that we missed by quite a margin this December quarter. So I think you need to understand that in order to understand the March quarter. So the March quarter really isn't a surprise where it's landing. It's more of the December quarter was much stronger than we expected. 
And we're really pleased about the December quarter. I want that to be clear. We've talked about our approach over the years and what we're striving to do about investing in technology, actively working the portfolio, driving productivity, exercising capital discipline. And the December quarter shows what's possible with the business. And it's years of hard work. It's just excellent execution by the team. And it's those things intersecting with favorable market conditions. 
So just about a lot went right in the December quarter and the result is that 54.4%. So volumes were stronger, and more importantly, stronger than we expected. And the outlook stayed strong, so that helps us sustain loadings and the associated fixed cost absorption. Spend control remains excellent, which is especially noteworthy, given the tough operating environment that our operations team has to work with. 
I mentioned earlier, the pricing environment is a bit, I guess, more favorable than normal. The market's tight. We're doing the best we can to serve customers and the time that they're expecting us to get them product. And then mix, we continue to move towards integrated modules and that's helping us greatly. And our particular advantage in mid, high-band and BAW-related integrated products is pulling in some other integrated modules into wins. So we're benefiting greatly there. And then we've got, of course, other highly differentiated products that are helping. 
And then there are another -- a number of other favorable items in the quarter, favorable yields. We had lower inventory charges than we expected and a number of other items. Again, generally, things went the right way. As we look forward to the March quarter, we do expect gross margin to drop to about where I said. We guided to 50.5% to 51% today. That's up 100 basis points year-over-year, which is what we've been striving to do is show margin expansion but we're down sequentially due to a number of factors. 
We're trying to keep inventories low so that will keep a check on absorption. We're ramping some lower-margin products to [ Cantley ]. We're just still working down the cost curve on those. They're important longer term. But that -- some of those products are coming into the March quarter, and then that actually continues on into the June quarter. And there are some other mix dynamics as well, including some less defense in the March quarter and some other things. 
And then we just can't assume that all these other things go our way as they did in the December quarter. We had -- the pricing environment may probably turn to a more normal state. The inventories write-offs will probably be more normal and we've assumed that. So we feel good about the -- about what we did, comfortable with the guide we have and I'll leave it at that."

I'll do my best to answer your question because as usual, it's not as simple as what many people from externally believe when you're working in the business. Number one, yes, there is tightness in the supply chain. I think it's quite well-known in the industry that silicon is constrained, whether that's in the communications industry or automotive. So in many ways, that is a governor on what's going on in this situation. 
We've been very fortunate that our team has excellent relationships and agreements with our suppliers externally and feel pretty good about how we've done that. And I'm quite confident we left some revenue on the -- out there for us still to get. But Mark mentioned in his opening comments that we've been getting long-term agreements with our customers, so that they feel pretty confident in their demand. And when we do our market model, which Mark also talked about, and we feel we have a pretty good handle on the market based on our comments all the way through last year, that many people believed that it was not going to be turning out the way we projected in just the number of 5G handsets. 
So when we look at our market models, the orders we already have, the migration, as you've already commented on 5G more than doubling, looking at Wi-Fi, looking at Wi-Fi 6, pod in every room going from 2 streams to 3 streams, that being 2.45 for communicating to the client and then for the backhaul using a third stream, which adds a lot of content, if it's 8 channels feeding it back to the main access point. So when we integrate all this and look at our customer orders, we feel pretty good about the commitments they're making to us. 
And I want to remind everyone, the sudden change at Huawei who was not using best-in-class components. As you guys remember, we talked a lot about how that they've started to -- and rightfully so, because of the U.S. government tried to use local sources while the people that are picking up their share are using best-in-class components, which is what we said Huawei would have done if it was available to them. 
So when we look at everything that's going on, as Mark said, we feel good. We can already comment on June, which he did. So I think as we lay out the year, we'll see how sell-through is in Chinese New Year and all those conditions in a pandemic and the vaccination, but we feel good about what we're communicating today, very good about it."

And as you say, it's a bit early so we expect to provide more details on our next earnings call, when we'll wrap up fiscal '21 and start fiscal '22. 
But maybe before I get into gross margin or margins overall, maybe just talk a little bit about fiscal '22. As we sit here today, for the most part, demand's firm, as Bob and Eric have talked about. Our business is broad and you see that reflected in the December results, March quarter guide. And then we all know that the markets that we serve, 5G, Wi-Fi, defense, IoT, other markets, we obviously expect those to grow multiyear. 
We believe that Qorvo's technology and products and our ongoing customer engagement positions us really well in those markets. So we've talked about feeling very comfortable about the June quarter, as Eric just mentioned, kind of more of a supply constraint situation than demand constraints we see at this point. We're reasonably confident for a near $1 billion quarter. And again, we'll see what happens on the other side of Lunar New Year and keep watching the channels but keeping an eye on it.
On the rest of the P&L, as you can imagine, while the rest of the year, and certainly, the rest of the P&L, it's just a lot more difficult to give anything. We're in our planning cycle now. There's just a number of factors. What happens to the outlook, the effect on loadings and absorption, mix effects in the business yields, inventory, so forth. 
And then just on the OpEx side, investments we want to make in the future. So any number of factors are going to impact the results and we just need to finish the planning. We've given a March guide and we've given a June revenue guide or revenue indication, supply constrained. I think on the June quarter, we actually see margins going down a bit. We actually see the June quarter gross margin below 50%. We see operating margin below 30%. And again, that's price, mix, cost factors. 
But I would say for the year, we still expect, clearly, operating margins to be above 30%. We cleared that this year. We're committed to continue to work to expand operating margins. And I think we'll say that for this call and provide more detail on the next call."

So I'm certainly very confident about where we stand with the technology and excited about all the markets that are adopting it going forward. So I think long term, it's going to continue to be a great thing for IDP and for the company."

So when we look at just the coming year, if you will, it's going to be highly leveraged towards BAW-based products. In particular, our R&D team is bringing us a fresh technology on a regular cadence now, and we're taking that into highly differentiated discretes as we talked about with antennaplexers but then also those can help make multiplexers as well that sell not only in discrete but enable these highly integrated modules. So we're going to be focusing on places where we can take that BAW technology and leverage it into larger modules to a large extent, and then continuing to really leverage our franchise around the antenna. 
We are clear leaders at helping our customers manage their antenna networks, whether it's tuning or we've got impedance tuning, we have aperture tuning. We have the antennaplexing that we've talked about. And it's getting to be more and more of a problem for our customers as new GPS bands and new bands are added in C-band and CBRS spectrum and so forth. So there's a lot of work around that antenna, and we've got a lot of very unique capability to bring technology but also modeling and app support there. 
So these are large opportunities for us in the near term, really leveraged on the complexity of 5G and our basket of technologies, which is broad and unequaled in a lot of ways. The UWB, we look at, is more of a driver in the next 2 years to 3 years, really, where it begins to get to the scale because we're starting very, very low now, of course, as an industry, and just beginning to take off. But no question in our mind, that's going to be a large driver. If you look out 2 to 3 years from now, it's going to be a big part of our business."

And if you kind of look history for the first 3 months of the year compared to those same 3 months of last year, we're up almost 47%, I think. And almost all of those underlying businesses are up double digits. So we've got a lot of strengths. We ebb and flow a bit as we go for quarters -- through each quarter. But I would say, pretty significant strength in our Wi-Fi business as Wi-Fi 6 continues to roll out. 
As far as long term, I'm still very confident of the underlying trends in the business, and we'll have some unevenness as we go quarter-to-quarter. But the things like the adoption of GaN and the proliferation of massive MIMO, the rollout of 5G and Wi-Fi 6, all those are great trends that I think will continue to allow the business to grow."

Qorvo exceeded our third fiscal quarter guidance on revenue, gross margin and EPS.

Qorvo exceeded our third fiscal quarter guidance on revenue, gross margin and EPS. Our performance was supported by multiyear technology upgrade cycles and was broad-based across markets and customers. The Qorvo team is executing very well and we are pleased with our operating performance. 
The growth drivers in Qorvo's markets are supported by durable long-term trends. In smartphones, 5G units are set to approximately double year-over-year. 5G also presents opportunities beyond smartphones, with advanced network capabilities for more data, lower latency and machine-to-machine communications. We expect our technologies will be increasingly critical to cloud gaming, connected car, industrial IoT, remote medicine, smart homes and other growth categories. 
In Wi-Fi, we are early in the rollout of Wi-Fi 6 and industry analysts expect rapid adoption to continue. Our next-generation front-end modules and BAW-based filtering products are optimized for higher frequency and wider bandwidths of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, enabling faster upload and download speeds, increasing capacity and improving efficiency. Across our markets, complexity is increasing as functionality is added within shrinking form factors while more demanding next-generation specifications must be met. This is favoring higher performance, more densely integrated system solutions from proven suppliers with large-scale manufacturing expertise. 
Take, for example, the migration to dual-transmit architectures beginning in the premium tier of smartphones for 5G. Dual-transmit architectures require integrated transmit and receive filtering in the traditional receive-only diversity path. This requires better performing, more functionally dense solutions, making high-performance BAW multiplexing a proven differentiator. Industry analysts estimate there were over 250 million 5G phones sold in 2020. For 2021, we forecast approximately 500 million 5G phones. Within these phones, the front-end content is increasing $5 to $7 versus 4G, including in the mid-tier, where content can approximately double. 
The addition of 5G is driving a shift from discrete products to higher-value content, including our highly integrated solutions. For the 5G reference designs ramping now, Qorvo was the first to integrate filters, switching, power amps, LNAs and CMOS control in fully shielded compact solutions. In doing so, we address customer size, performance and time-to-market challenges. Demand has been strong for these complete main path solutions, and customers are increasingly sourcing all 3, including the low, mid-high and ultra-high band placements. 
When combined with our PMICs, tuners, antennaplexers and dual connectivity modules, Qorvo offers customers a compact front-end solution with minimal placements delivering world-class performance. As a result, we enjoy increasingly collaborative relationships with our customers. During the quarter, we were recognized by 2 leading Android manufacturers with highly selective annual awards. Qorvo was the sole RF supplier to win Vivo's Excellent Quality Award for 2020. And we were the sole electronics supplier to win Oppo's esteemed Joint Development Award. We're extremely proud of both honors. 
As I referenced earlier, during the quarter, we increased shipments of our complete main path solutions across the leading 5G basebands. We also secured new design wins for our next-generation complete main path solutions in support of upcoming Android 5G launches. For the diversity path, we launched our first generation of dual connectivity module for the mid- and high bands and commenced shipments to the leading Android smartphone manufacturer. 
We also released a next-generation BAW process, which reduces insertion loss, increases bandwidth in ultra-high band and Wi-Fi 6E applications. In mobile Wi-Fi, we began production shipments of our Wi-Fi 6E solutions to top Android OEMs, increasing capacity and lowering latency in a range of smartphones and mobile devices. 
In Ultra-Wideband, we extended our capabilities to include open, fully supported system solutions, enabling ultra-precision location applications in mobile, IoT and automotive markets. During the quarter, we increased our Ultra-Wideband customer engagements in a broadening range of consumer applications, including tracker tags, smart speakers, smart TVs and other smart home appliances. 
Customers and channel partners are evaluating a broad range of applications, and we continue to believe Ultra-Wideband adoption in smartphones will be the catalyst for a growing ecosystem of connected devices. We see Ultra-Wideband proliferating quickly and representing an exciting opportunity for Qorvo. 
In IDP, we're very proud to have been selected by the National Institutes of Health for its Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics initiative, or RADx, to add COVID-19 testing capacity. In this program, we will use our Omnia test platform, a complete test solution enabled by Qorvo's high-frequency BAW. This platform is currently pending Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Qorvo's antigen testing has demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and specificity in clinical studies. That means it's capable of producing accurate results with very low levels of false readings. We believe this BAW sensor technology may be able to deliver a new approach to diagnostic testing, ultimately providing central lab testing accuracy at the point of care. 
Elsewhere in IDP, we continue to support a broad range of multiyear trends, including 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, GaN defense, radar and comms, programmable power management, C-V2X, automotive Wi-Fi and Ultra-Wideband. Our team has done an outstanding job developing products and ramping production to support initial 5G base station deployments in Asia. Today, we are in the early stages of multiyear rollouts and we have strong momentum as 5G continues to deploy. 
We've been selected by multiple OEMs to supply GaN PAs in addition to our small signal components and modules, and we see the focus on power consumption, bandwidth and higher frequencies supporting the continued migration to GaN PAs. During the quarter, Qorvo secured design wins with multiple base station OEMs to support 5GC band in the U.S. for which the spectrum auctions are in the process and initial deployments are expected later this year. We also received the Best Comprehensive Performance Award from ZTE, recognizing our 5G portfolio and customer support during the initial rollout of 5G base stations. 
In defense, we achieved strong growth in domestic radar and communications applications and game defense products for international radar programs. In connectivity, we ramped shipments of our 5 GHz Wi-Fi 6 BAW filters and sampled our 6 GHz Wi-Fi 6E front-end modules for routers and gateways, maximizing throughput and range for high-bandwidth applications such as video conferencing and online gaming. Demand for our Wi-Fi 6 solutions has been strong across MSOs and retail segments. And we see continued strength as Wi-Fi 6 deployments are still in the early phases. 
In the connected car, we were selected to supply 5G LTE, C-V2X and Wi-Fi automotive qualified products to multiple OEMs, including Audi, BMW and Volvo. In low-power wireless, Qorvo was selected to supply the leading television manufacturer our low-power multi-protocol SoC and custom software, enabling a solar charging remote control. 
Before handing the call over to Mark, I want to say a word about Qorvo's workforce. The team delivered an outstanding performance in the December quarter. They adapted quickly in a dynamic environment and helped support exceptional results. I'm extremely proud of their responsiveness and dedication to our customers' success. As 5G, Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, Ultra-Wideband and other connectivity protocols are rolled out globally, Qorvo is well positioned to delight customers and expand our technology reach. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."
33821,701726294,2190823,"Qorvo, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Qorvo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.

Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 third quarter was $1.095 billion, $35 million above the midpoint of our guidance, up 26% or $226 million versus last year and up approximately 11% sequentially, adjusting for the 14-week September quarter. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week fiscal year, and the September quarter was a 14-week quarter versus a typical 13-week quarter. 
In the December quarter, Mobile Products drove the sequential growth, with revenue of $826 million on seasonal demand effects and the ramp of higher content 5G smartphones. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of $269 million was up 30% versus last year on robust Wi-Fi demand and double-digit growth from defense, Programmable Power Management and IoT markets. 
Non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 54.4%, which was above our guidance due to better-than-expected volumes, price and mix and lower-than-expected manufacturing and inventory costs. The combination of strong end market demand and our ongoing efforts to improve the portfolio, drive productivity and carefully manage inventories yielded record results. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were better than expected at $194 million and 17.7% of sales, largely due to timing on development programs. As a result, we forecast OpEx to pick up in the March quarter to levels previously guided. Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter was $357 million, and diluted earnings per share of $3.08 was $0.43 above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $404 million and CapEx was $36 million, yielding free cash flow of $368 million and free cash flow margin of 33.6%. We repurchased $160 million of shares during the quarter. 
As discussed on the last earnings call, we retired our 2026 notes during the quarter. We also called the remaining 2025 notes. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of debt and $1.2 billion of cash. Our leverage remains low, our revolver is untapped. The weighted average maturity of our debt is late 2029 and we have no material near-term maturities. 
With our financial flexibility, we can focus on developing technology, supporting customers and making prudent organic and inorganic investments that support long-term earnings and free cash flow growth. To that end, we continue to advance our BAW, SAW, GaN, GaAs, packaging and other core technologies and fund UWB, Programmable Power Management, biotechnologies, MEMS and other promising areas. 
Turning to our current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.025 billion and $1.055 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 50.5% to 51% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 at the midpoint of guidance. Our March quarter outlook reflects sustained broad customer demand stemming from multiyear technology upgrade cycles. In mobile, demand for 5G is adding RF complexity and driving higher content. The breadth of our customer base and firm demand signals provide confidence and stability in our outlook. We forecast mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $770 million at the midpoint or up over 35% year-over-year. 
In IDP, we project revenue of approximately $270 million in the current quarter, sustaining strong double-digit growth driven by Wi-Fi 6 demand and other markets, even as 5G infrastructure build-outs remain uneven. Our March quarter gross margin guide is in line with the gross margin outlook discussed on our last earnings call and up over 100 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the March quarter to around $207 million. At the midpoint of our March quarter guidance, operating margin is forecasted to be over 30.5% for the third consecutive quarter. Our operating margin outlook for the year is 31.5% at the midpoint, clearing the lower end of the margin model we laid out previously. 
Qorvo was built for the integration of advanced technology trends critical to customer success in 5G and other growth markets. With broad and robust end market growth, we're now leveraging a more focused footprint. Our product portfolio is better matched to customer needs and our culture of continuous improvement is thriving. 
We project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be below 7.9%. With our year-to-date earnings and March quarter EPS guide, our fiscal '21 EPS estimate is over $9.40 per share at the midpoint or up nearly 50% year-over-year. Capital expenditures will step up in the March quarter as we work to intersect near-term demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. We still forecast CapEx to remain below $200 million or less than 5% of sales in fiscal '21. 
Currently, we project free cash flow of approximately $1 billion this fiscal year. As the December quarter results and our March quarter outlook show, Qorvo continues to operate well through a challenging period while delivering premium technology to a broad spectrum of customers in 5G, Wi-Fi, IoT, defense and other growth markets. 
In closing, I'd like to join Bob in thanking Qorvo employees again for their continued efforts during this time. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

I think as we look forward and as we've talked about over the years, we're going to continue to work to get the best operating leverage we can. And we're running at about 20% of sales OpEx for a year. 
We would expect next year to be at that -- those levels and maybe slightly below. We're never going to be the lowest OpEx company in the space because as you heard, we're -- the DNA of this company is innovation, so we're going to likely be several points higher than what I would call best-in-class as it relates to just costs. So I think that's what you can look forward to as we go forward on an annual basis."

We spend a lot of time -- fortunately for us, we've got a very broad customer base. So -- and given our position in the market, so we see the space across customers and products and -- have very good visibility. So it's -- it explains why very early last year, we called 250 million 5G handsets and that's about where the number ended up. 
Further, we not only use our rigorous internal assessments but we use external views to balance that and we make the best call we can. We were about 3% off on this particular quarter but we're generally close. And so we feel good about the guide we have in the March quarter, [ 10 40 ].

It's playing out at least as good or better than we had hoped. They're the pioneers of the technology and just a fantastic organization for design and development. We're bringing the scale and the customer relationships to really take it to the top tier. 
So we've got -- and then of course, the acquisition of 7Hugs to give the entire software stack has been a huge addition as well that's helping us. So all that's working really well. We're continuing to invest and hire more and critical resources that are enablers to cover all the opportunities. But one of the things that has happened since we closed the acquisition nearly a year ago now is just much more interaction with the mobile handset providers. Of course, that's the channel that we bring. 
Everyone is looking to put this UWB into the next generations of handsets so we're seeing the uptake we're expecting. And then a lot of people are lining up with devices that are going to talk to those handsets as well, right? So a lot of consumer electronics, smart home and so forth devices that we're talking to. 
And then the base of the revenue today is industrial IoT basically, and that's continuing to grow and perform at least as well as what we had expected. And then we'll have auto coming in on top of all of that so we're engaged as well with all the leading auto manufacturers. So it's a lot. We've got a lot going on, but the design activity, the reception is strong and really, I think, adding the software stack to the equation just really takes it to another level in terms of what we're going to be able to do for the industry."

So we've become pretty good at being able to forecast where we're going to be. Now I think we got to acknowledge that we missed by quite a margin this December quarter. So I think you need to understand that in order to understand the March quarter. So the March quarter really isn't a surprise where it's landing. It's more of the December quarter was much stronger than we expected. 
And we're really pleased about the December quarter. I want that to be clear. We've talked about our approach over the years and what we're striving to do about investing in technology, actively working the portfolio, driving productivity, exercising capital discipline. And the December quarter shows what's possible with the business. And it's years of hard work. It's just excellent execution by the team. And it's those things intersecting with favorable market conditions. 
So just about a lot went right in the December quarter and the result is that 54.4%. So volumes were stronger, and more importantly, stronger than we expected. And the outlook stayed strong, so that helps us sustain loadings and the associated fixed cost absorption. Spend control remains excellent, which is especially noteworthy, given the tough operating environment that our operations team has to work with. 
I mentioned earlier, the pricing environment is a bit, I guess, more favorable than normal. The market's tight. We're doing the best we can to serve customers and the time that they're expecting us to get them product. And then mix, we continue to move towards integrated modules and that's helping us greatly. And our particular advantage in mid, high-band and BAW-related integrated products is pulling in some other integrated modules into wins. So we're benefiting greatly there. And then we've got, of course, other highly differentiated products that are helping. 
And then there are another -- a number of other favorable items in the quarter, favorable yields. We had lower inventory charges than we expected and a number of other items. Again, generally, things went the right way. As we look forward to the March quarter, we do expect gross margin to drop to about where I said. We guided to 50.5% to 51% today. That's up 100 basis points year-over-year, which is what we've been striving to do is show margin expansion but we're down sequentially due to a number of factors. 
We're trying to keep inventories low so that will keep a check on absorption. We're ramping some lower-margin products to [ Cantley ]. We're just still working down the cost curve on those. They're important longer term. But that -- some of those products are coming into the March quarter, and then that actually continues on into the June quarter. And there are some other mix dynamics as well, including some less defense in the March quarter and some other things. 
And then we just can't assume that all these other things go our way as they did in the December quarter. We had -- the pricing environment may probably turn to a more normal state. The inventories write-offs will probably be more normal and we've assumed that. So we feel good about the -- about what we did, comfortable with the guide we have and I'll leave it at that."

I'll do my best to answer your question because as usual, it's not as simple as what many people from externally believe when you're working in the business. Number one, yes, there is tightness in the supply chain. I think it's quite well-known in the industry that silicon is constrained, whether that's in the communications industry or automotive. So in many ways, that is a governor on what's going on in this situation. 
We've been very fortunate that our team has excellent relationships and agreements with our suppliers externally and feel pretty good about how we've done that. And I'm quite confident we left some revenue on the -- out there for us still to get. But Mark mentioned in his opening comments that we've been getting long-term agreements with our customers, so that they feel pretty confident in their demand. And when we do our market model, which Mark also talked about, and we feel we have a pretty good handle on the market based on our comments all the way through last year, that many people believed that it was not going to be turning out the way we projected in just the number of 5G handsets. 
So when we look at our market models, the orders we already have, the migration, as you've already commented on 5G more than doubling, looking at Wi-Fi, looking at Wi-Fi 6, pod in every room going from 2 streams to 3 streams, that being 2.45 for communicating to the client and then for the backhaul using a third stream, which adds a lot of content, if it's 8 channels feeding it back to the main access point. So when we integrate all this and look at our customer orders, we feel pretty good about the commitments they're making to us. 
And I want to remind everyone, the sudden change at Huawei who was not using best-in-class components. As you guys remember, we talked a lot about how that they've started to -- and rightfully so, because of the U.S. government tried to use local sources while the people that are picking up their share are using best-in-class components, which is what we said Huawei would have done if it was available to them. 
So when we look at everything that's going on, as Mark said, we feel good. We can already comment on June, which he did. So I think as we lay out the year, we'll see how sell-through is in Chinese New Year and all those conditions in a pandemic and the vaccination, but we feel good about what we're communicating today, very good about it."

And as you say, it's a bit early so we expect to provide more details on our next earnings call, when we'll wrap up fiscal '21 and start fiscal '22. 
But maybe before I get into gross margin or margins overall, maybe just talk a little bit about fiscal '22. As we sit here today, for the most part, demand's firm, as Bob and Eric have talked about. Our business is broad and you see that reflected in the December results, March quarter guide. And then we all know that the markets that we serve, 5G, Wi-Fi, defense, IoT, other markets, we obviously expect those to grow multiyear. 
We believe that Qorvo's technology and products and our ongoing customer engagement positions us really well in those markets. So we've talked about feeling very comfortable about the June quarter, as Eric just mentioned, kind of more of a supply constraint situation than demand constraints we see at this point. We're reasonably confident for a near $1 billion quarter. And again, we'll see what happens on the other side of Lunar New Year and keep watching the channels but keeping an eye on it.
On the rest of the P&L, as you can imagine, while the rest of the year, and certainly, the rest of the P&L, it's just a lot more difficult to give anything. We're in our planning cycle now. There's just a number of factors. What happens to the outlook, the effect on loadings and absorption, mix effects in the business yields, inventory, so forth. 
And then just on the OpEx side, investments we want to make in the future. So any number of factors are going to impact the results and we just need to finish the planning. We've given a March guide and we've given a June revenue guide or revenue indication, supply constrained. I think on the June quarter, we actually see margins going down a bit. We actually see the June quarter gross margin below 50%. We see operating margin below 30%. And again, that's price, mix, cost factors. 
But I would say for the year, we still expect, clearly, operating margins to be above 30%. We cleared that this year. We're committed to continue to work to expand operating margins. And I think we'll say that for this call and provide more detail on the next call."

And we've got production shipments that have occurred into numerous of those OEMs. So I would say adoption is pretty broad across the industry. 
And we're obviously very bullish about our technology. We've got a tremendous amount of products. I think last time I counted, we have over 200 products that are released in our GaN technology covering a broad range of frequencies and markets and everything like that. We've been in GaN for well over 20 years and continue to focus on developing the technology and bringing new capabilities in and really focused on scale and cost. So I'm certainly very confident about where we stand with the technology and excited about all the markets that are adopting it going forward. So I think long term, it's going to continue to be a great thing for IDP and for the company."

So when we look at just the coming year, if you will, it's going to be highly leveraged towards BAW-based products. In particular, our R&D team is bringing us a fresh technology on a regular cadence now, and we're taking that into highly differentiated discretes as we talked about with antennaplexers but then also those can help make multiplexers as well that sell not only in discrete but enable these highly integrated modules. So we're going to be focusing on places where we can take that BAW technology and leverage it into larger modules to a large extent, and then continuing to really leverage our franchise around the antenna. 
We are clear leaders at helping our customers manage their antenna networks, whether it's tuning or we've got impedance tuning, we have aperture tuning. We have the antennaplexing that we've talked about. And it's getting to be more and more of a problem for our customers as new GPS bands and new bands are added in C-band and CBRS spectrum and so forth. So there's a lot of work around that antenna, and we've got a lot of very unique capability to bring technology but also modeling and app support there. 
So these are large opportunities for us in the near term, really leveraged on the complexity of 5G and our basket of technologies, which is broad and unequaled in a lot of ways. The UWB, we look at, is more of a driver in the next 2 years to 3 years, really, where it begins to get to the scale because we're starting very, very low now, of course, as an industry, and just beginning to take off. But no question in our mind, that's going to be a large driver. If you look out 2 to 3 years from now, it's going to be a big part of our business."

And if you kind of look history for the first 3 months of the year compared to those same 3 months of last year, we're up almost 47%, I think. And almost all of those underlying businesses are up double digits. So we've got a lot of strengths. We ebb and flow a bit as we go for quarters -- through each quarter. But I would say, pretty significant strength in our Wi-Fi business as Wi-Fi 6 continues to roll out. 
As far as long term, I'm still very confident of the underlying trends in the business, and we'll have some unevenness as we go quarter-to-quarter. But the things like the adoption of GaN and the proliferation of massive MIMO, the rollout of 5G and Wi-Fi 6, all those are great trends that I think will continue to allow the business to grow."

Qorvo concluded our fiscal 2021 with an exceptionally strong March quarter. Quarterly revenue, gross margin and EPS were well above guidance. Outperformance was driven primarily by 5G smartphones and WiFi 6 and 6E. Dem",1202,"Thanks, Doug, and welcome, everyone. Qorvo concluded our fiscal 2021 with an exceptionally strong March quarter. Quarterly revenue, gross margin and EPS were well above guidance. Outperformance was driven primarily by 5G smartphones and WiFi 6 and 6E. Demand was broad-based across customers, and design activity suggest continued strength in fiscal '22, supported by multiyear trends in wired and wireless connectivity markets. 
In smartphones, the adoption of 5G is driving demand for higher value content. Device architectures are increasing in complexity as higher frequencies with wider bandwidths are added, transmit is introduced in the diversity path, MIMO architectures are adopted and new receive paths featuring carrier aggregation. This is placing a premium on Qorvo's highly differentiated semiconductor technologies and enabling us to supply an expanding portfolio of products to industry leaders. 
For calendar '21, we expect 5G smartphones to double versus last year. Within these phones, we expect the RF content to increase $5 to $7 per phone when compared to 4G, including in the mid-tier. 
Turning to the March quarterly highlights. Qorvo achieved record shipments of low, mid-high and ultrahigh band main path solutions and WiFi 6E FEMs in support of leading Android OEMs. On the design front, we continue to expand our content opportunity with the leading Android OEMs by securing complete main path solutions and secondary transmit in the diversity path. 
In Ultra-Wideband, Qorvo was selected by a leading provider of consumer IoT products to integrate Ultra-Wideband into a broad set of connected home devices. More customers are looking to add Ultra-Wideband to their products to take advantage of its superior location accuracy, security and latency compared to other wireless technologies. Customer interest in Qorvo's Ultra-Wideband solutions has been robust, and we continue to see adoption in smartphones as the catalyst for an expanding ecosystem of connected devices that includes associated peripherals, automobiles, consumer and industrial IoT applications. 
Finally, in mobile, we're very pleased to have been honored by Samsung with the Best Quality Award, recognizing Qorvo's innovation and outstanding performance in support of their Galaxy product family. 
In IDP, WiFi revenue, including WiFi 6, was a record. The rate of adoption of WiFi 6 is outpacing the adoption that we experienced for WiFi 5 and the rollout is forecasted to span multiple years across enterprise, retail and service providers. Qorvo is seeing a strong attach rate given the performance advantages we enable related to range, efficiency, signal integrity and form factor. To that end, we recently secured the entire bill of materials in support of a major U.S. MSO gateway. We also released multiple 5G -- 5 gigahertz iFEMs that deliver improved band isolation and enhanced capacity and range in tri-band WiFi 6 home mesh networks. 
In broadband, MSOs are increasing downstream and upstream data capabilities by upgrading to DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. During the quarter, we expanded shipments of DOCSIS 3.1 GaN power amplifiers to major U.S. MSOs, offering greater efficiency, longer range and increased bandwidth to maximize upstream and downstream data connectivity. 
In automotive, Qorvo has for years been successful supporting the increased demand for in-vehicle infotainment. During that time, we have expanded our automotive portfolio and engaged with customers to enable the transition to connected car through cellular V2X. In the March quarter, these efforts helped to generate the first production orders for our cellular V2X front-end modules and BAW coexistence filters to support the leading European automotive OEMs. Of note, Qorvo's high-frequency BAW coexistence filters also enable the concurrent operation of cellular V2X and WiFi. 
In programmable power management, customer demand has been strong in support of 2 trends. First, the transition of solid-state drives is ongoing, primarily in laptops and gaming consoles. During the quarter, Qorvo's programmable PMICs continued to support this transition with expanding shipments to and new engagements with multiple leading solid-state drive providers. Second, the transition of brushless DC electric motors is accelerating, enhancing efficiency and a broad set of consumer products, including power tools and appliances. Qorvo increased shipments of motor control solutions during the quarter supporting multiple major consumer brands. 
In defense applications, the shift to higher frequencies, the adoption of phased array radar and the proliferation of GaN are among the trends supporting demand for Qorvo's products. For radar applications, we released a reconfigurable dual-band GaN power amplifier MMIC for the S and X bands, enabling more compact next-generation radar systems. Over 30 million miles away, the successful landing of NASA's JPL Mars Perseverance rover was supported by our components integrated into the rover's descent radar. 
In infrastructure, we continue to ramp shipments during the quarter to a base station OEM in support of U.S. C-band massive MIMO deployments. And we captured initial design wins for massive MIMO deployments in Canada, Japan and Korea. Qorvo brings decades of technology leadership in wireless infrastructure and we are leveraging the full breadth of our GaN power and small signal portfolio to support OEMs on upcoming 5G deployments. 
We have strong customer engagements, we are investing in critical enabling technologies and design activity remained robust. We see tremendous opportunity in 5G infrastructure globally over the next 4 to 5 years as deployments continue to roll out. 
After the quarter closed, We received an emergency use authorization from the FDA for Omnia COVID-19 rapid antigen test, which leverages high-frequency BAW sensors for high sensitivity and specificity. Qorvo began efforts to use BAW sensors to develop diagnostic test solutions in 2013 in a manner similar to how we leveraged our BAW filters to achieve superior frequency selectivity in RF applications. 
Now with the authorization from the FDA, we are preparing to scale production to help support ongoing public health efforts. To that end, Qorvo was awarded a contract with the National Institutes of Health through the rapid acceleration of diagnostics, or RADx, initiative. With $24 million from the Biological Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, the award is helping to advance the production and market launch of our Omnia diagnostic test platform. 
Also after the quarter closed, Qorvo acquired NextInput, a pioneer in the emerging field of force sensing solutions for the next generation of human machine interface. NextInput will be part of the mobile products, providing MEMS-based sensors and innovative products for customers in existing and new markets. They have shipped tens of millions of MEMS-based sensor solutions to leading manufacturers of smartphones, wearables, automobiles and other applications. We see multiple opportunities for their solutions to augment or displace capacitive touch and mechanical buttons with smaller, more reliable and air-tight solutions that are applicable to any surface, including glass, polycarbonate, aluminum and carbon fiber. We welcome the NextInput team to the Qorvo family and we are excited to expand our technology portfolio and accelerate the deployment of the technology to our broad customer base and new markets. 
Before handing the call over to Mark, I want to acknowledge the entire Qorvo team for their commitment to supporting our customers and keeping the world connected. Qorvo is enabling multiyear upgrade cycles in existing markets and introducing disruptive technologies, including Ultra-Wideband, RF-based biotechnology testing and MEMS-based solutions. We expect broad-based end market demand for our products and another year of strong financial results. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 fourth quarter was $1.073 billion, $33 million above the midpoint of our guidance and up 36% or $285 million versus last year. Mobile Products revenue of $808 million was up 45%",964,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 fourth quarter was $1.073 billion, $33 million above the midpoint of our guidance and up 36% or $285 million versus last year. Mobile Products revenue of $808 million was up 45% year-over-year on the growth of higher content 5G smartphones. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of $265 million was up 14% versus last year, led principally by robust WiFi demand. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of gross margin over 50%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 52.6% and above our guidance as less favorable mix was more than offset by better-than-expected price, manufacturing costs and inventory charges. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $207 million or 19.3% of sales and in line with expectations. Sequential and year-over-year increases in OpEx were driven by technology and product development expenses associated with recent acquisitions and other key growth programs. 
Non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter was $315 million, and diluted earnings per share of $2.74 was $0.32 above the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $403 million, and CapEx was $77 million, in line with our expectations. CapEx for the year was $187 million and below 5% of sales. During the quarter, free cash flow was $325 million, and we repurchased $175 million of shares. 
On the balance sheet, cash increased to $1.4 billion, and debt remained unchanged at approximately $1.7 billion. Our leverage remains low, our revolver is untapped, and we have no material near-term maturities. In April, S&P upgraded our credit rating to investment grade, reflecting the steps we've taken to profitably grow the business and maintain a strong balance sheet. 
Before turning to the outlook, I will comment briefly on the past year. Qorvo's full year fiscal '21 performance realized what was envisioned at the time of the merger: to create an enterprise best able to serve customers' technology and product needs when connectivity trends accelerated and as product performance requirements increased. Qorvo's commitment to R&D, active portfolio management, sustained productivity and capital discipline, positioned us to serve our customers' needs, expand supply chain partner opportunities and improve financial results. 
In fiscal '21, Qorvo delivered revenue over $4 billion, non-GAAP gross margin over 52%, non-GAAP operating margin over 32% and free cash flow over $1.1 billion. Qorvo's free cash flow has increased fivefold over the past 4 years. We are committed to build on this and are investing and executing to do so. 
Now turning to our current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.065 billion and $1.095 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 50%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 in the midpoint of our guidance. Our June quarter revenue outlook reflects sustained and broad-based customer demand driven by multiyear technology upgrade cycles. 
In mobile, demand for 5G is adding RF complexity and driving higher content. We forecast mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $810 million at the midpoint or up 73% year-over-year. 
In IDP, we project revenue of approximately $270 million in the current quarter, sustained by WiFi 6 demand and other markets. 
Our June quarter gross margin guide is approximately 50%, reflecting seasonal patterns and less favorable mix. That is up 140 basis points versus last year on higher volumes, active portfolio management and pricing and continuous productivity efforts. We expect our June quarter gross margin to be the lowest gross margin quarter of the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the June quarter to around $214 million on added labor and other development expenses associated with recent acquisitions and key growth programs. 
At the midpoint of our June quarter guidance, operating margin is forecast to be over 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter. We project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be between 9% and 10%. Capital expenditures will remain around $70 million in the June quarter as we work to intersect projected demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. 
For our full year fiscal '22, we forecast approximately 15% revenue growth on an increase in smartphone volumes in the range of 5% to 10%, a doubling of 5G handsets, sustained WiFi demand and growth in other markets, including power management and defense. We project full year gross margin to be approximately 52%. We expect OpEx to increase sequentially through the year and remain below 20% of sales for the full year. This level of OpEx is in line with what we laid out years ago and supports Qorvo's ongoing product and technology leadership in existing markets, while funding investment in newer areas such as UWB, biosensors, power management and MEMS. 
We forecast other expense to drop slightly on lower interest expense but remain above $60 million. We see CapEx around 5% of sales, so up on an absolute basis as we add capacity to intersect known and high confidence opportunities. We expect free cash flow to grow year-over-year modestly due to slightly higher CapEx and working capital build. 
Based on our strong free cash flow performance in fiscal year '21 and our fiscal year '22 outlook, along with our substantial balance sheet capacity and other factors, the Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. 
Amidst the pandemic, the Qorvo team executed well in serving customers and advancing technologies critical to a more connected world.

And both defense and power management also have a really strong year, so I'm really pleased with the results of our fiscal 2021. 
We've been pretty public about the slowdown in the wireless infrastructure business in the back half of last year. And we certainly see that continuing as we go through the first half of this year. We think it will start to pick up in the back half of next year as deployments in China start. And then certainly, we expect C-band to start to roll out in the United States as we get into the back half of the year. 
So overall, I would expect base station to start to pick up a bit. But I think if you look at full year for IDP, base station will actually probably be down a bit, and we'll see significant growth in some of the other markets."

Now that said, I am very happy with the portfolio that we have. We continue to invest in the technology in both in the GaN side for power and in the small signal side, so I'm happy where we are, and I think we continue to make progress there. And we're in the very early stages, so this is just beginning. We've had 1 year in China. We're just starting really in the U.S. and the rest of the world. So this is going to be a multiyear trend. 
I think we're positioned very, very well with the portfolio we have. And of course, we're obviously not going to sit still, we're going to continue to drive that business forward and invest in technology and make sure that we're able to do what we did last year with the early rollouts in China."

But also just all of our complexity around the antenna. It comes with all of that as well, right? As complexity goes, there's a lot more antenna tuning and antennaplexing and so forth. So that's still a strong market for us and WiFi as well. The 6 and 6E rollout has been really, really good for us. So WiFi has been growing at one of the faster clips of all of our product groups as well. 
UWB, a lot of excitement about that for sure, lots of design activity across all the verticals. We announced the design and consumer IoT space, which is pretty big for us. It's going to drive growth second half of the year, and so it's going to be picking up throughout the year.

So we were able to both produce more product and get them more product, and you see that come in a number of forms. We had more favorable absorption. We had some better pricing. Our inventory charges are actually lower than we thought. So a number of positives again in the fourth quarter just showing how well we're serving the market and working with our customers closely. So it gives us a lot of confidence in the next couple of quarters that demand is very firm, which is why I felt comfortable giving a preliminary full year view.

I mean, first of all, it's a very complicated equation, right, on all the things that go into making the gross margin. I think what I'd like to do is just start with our fiscal '22 guide is for margins to hold up. Let's start with the fact that in fiscal year '21, we increased gross margin over 400 basis points versus fiscal year '20. So I'd say sustaining at these levels is pretty good. And I think you've got to remember that some things will go against us in '22 that went with us in '21. Notably, the pricing environment is very firm now, and that is likely to loosen a bit. It'll still be healthy, we believe. But will not be as tight as it is at the moment. We believe our inventory charges. We have to assume they'll kind of pick back up to normal levels. And we've got to remember just how hard this stuff is that we do. So I can go on and on. 
Now there's plenty of good that's going on to offset the bad in fiscal '22. I mean we're continuing to drive productivity. The portfolio management continues. Utilization, we've got some room, and we'll continue to invest as we need to, but keep that utilization high. All the things we've talked about over the years. And so as a result, we just -- we have a view now that we can sustain margin at these levels. 
Of course, over time, Karl, we've said we aspire to expand our gross margins. And I think it runs through the same things we've been doing. We'll continue to be a technology leader allows us to do the hardest parts. We'll pick to play with customers with those hardest parts where our value get recognized. Productivity is as good as it's ever been in the company, and we're driving even more there. And then we're just going to be very circumspect about any capital build. So we're optimistic that, over time, there'll be some opportunity."

Power Management, great trends there. It continues to grow and well up into the double digits and has done that quarter after quarter, so been a very nice acquisition for us as a company. And defense as well. We've got, again, nice trends inside the defense business. Now on top of that, the automotive business is really starting to kick in as we go into this year.

And what I would really like to understand is why is there so much variability between your initial outlook versus, right, what you have reported? And should we assume your gross margin outlook this time is also conservative like it has been in the last 2 quarters?"

And I think our forecast history, as far as our ability to meet commitments, is clear. I think we've had 17 quarters or so. It depends on what you do with the hurricane in Florida several years ago as to whether that's ruined the streak or not. But we do our best to give a good read. And -- but there's a lot of things in the mix any given quarter. And so what's most important to us is can we forecast it well and meet commitments. And I think we -- you can argue that we're kind of missing it on the high side, but I'd say that we have it in control and can continue to improve the business because we know what's going on. 
The second thing is it's indisputable at this point that all the work we've been doing has led to a higher quantum. So we've just -- we've increased gross margin, particularly over the past year and had stabilized it before. So the R&D investment and portfolio management, productivity and reducing capital intensity, it's all paying off. 
To your point, we continue to work on growing the business in the right areas and working on our cost curves and picking and choosing where we're going to compete and bring the most value to customers. And over time, we think that the variability that we have will moderate. 
As it relates to the June quarter, we are down. And we're -- I said actually that we'd be down in the 49s, and the drivers are the same. We assume that price will moderate somewhat sequentially. We do have some product mix effects. And then we have some favorability from, in this case, the March quarter that -- yes, that's not going to repeat. We had some favorable absorption in the factories, and then we had some inventory effects that we have to assume we might return to normal levels on inventory charges. So that explains the sequential decline. 
I'll finish my comments with it. Remember that's an increase versus the soft guidance I gave you before. So we -- our view has actually improved on the quarter. We're driving more productivity than we thought. We have a little bit better price than we thought because the market is still very firm. And then there are a number of other factors. But listen, we're pleased to guide a 50% number, and we're -- we have confidence in that result."

In terms of pricing, I think in terms of loosening, all Mark was indicating is that we've had very firm pricing in the March quarter, extremely tight market. We're going to continue to push the price curve while maintaining course, relationships and design strength that we have. Mark indicated long-term agreements with customers are coming into play, which is great for us and for customers.

It's probably going to take another 3 or 4 years for WiFi 6 to build out, and we're already working on 7. So I think this is a business that we'll continue to drive. As far as overall size of IDP, as I've talked about many times, I love the diversification of the business, and we're going to ebb and flow a bit. And so that kind of guidance that I constantly give of these businesses, albeit about 1/4 of the size. I think as you average through a long cycle, it stays pretty much in that span."

Why should we believe there should be any rebound in demand for anywhere close to what you saw originally for GaN, given that you're going from 64 to macros or much smaller cells? 
And then in the same kind of spirit of things, the Chinese built out on an industrial policy from the government. The U.S. doesn't do that at all U.S. carriers actually have shown ROI for their build-out, which calls into question how many MIMO stations will actually deploy given the relatively modest improvements you get in performance versus the incredibly higher cost for this. So I'm just trying -- I know it's slowing down now that you guys have forecasted that, and that's actually happening now. But if I'm looking out to the end of this year, why are you confident that you'll see a big rebound and it will be in China? Or is it in C-band in the United States? Is it mostly MIMO?

And that sort of has everything into play that has deployments in U.S. and the configurations that our customers are telling us about and deployments in China and of course, the rest of the world. 
Going forward, though, there are a tremendous amount of base stations still to be deployed. And the China deployments during the first year were relatively low. So I do see just tremendous content pickups for us as we go through this 5-year deployment. It's important, Ed, to know that if you go back to 4G, a 64 element array is still about a 10x content pickup for us. With 32 element arrays, not a little bit more than half of that. So these are big, big content gains for us in the business. And so it's really a content story. And as you play that out and deployments around the world, it continues to be a growth business for us. 
And of course, GaN is a new technology for us. We couldn't access the power amplifiers as we went through the 4G cycle. And now we've got great products and great technology that allow us to address that whole segment."

And then if I could also, on the Ultra-Wideband, it looks increasingly like Apple's got their own solution doing their phone. NXP is taking a lot of the handset side of the business in the Android world. And is it a fair assumption to say Decawave is really going to be focused mostly on the other side of it, the IoT side of it, all the devices that talk to the handsets. I mean, other than Google, should we expect to see you much in the Android handset side with UWB?"

So starting with the transmit and the diversity path, yes, that's an openly growing space for us. As you indicated, we had forecasted it would be. And it's not by any means limited to the content we have today. Today it's relatively kind of discrete placements. And going forward, we'll see complete what we call dual connect modules more and more going from the upper tier down. And the dual connect modules we have a complete transmit and receive path for the bands that they do transmit on, right? And those bands are throughout the mid- and high-band frequencies, we'll see. 
So it's a great growing category. Again, we're going to bring all filters to it. We're going to bring integration to it, best-in-class GaAs PAs and everything we have in the main path. So that's a great new category for us. And of course, supported by just more bandwidth in the uplink. And trying to get more video through the networks and higher data rates and so forth. That's really what's driving that as we've been talking about for years, actually. 
On UWB, I think when you say you're seeing NXP primarily in Android house, is that kind of a legacy comment, which I acknowledge, obviously, Decawave wasn't in a position to really address the mobile market, and that's why they took the path they did. As Qorvo though, of course, we're targeting the mobile market directly. And to your point, that is Android as of the current state of play at least, Apple is doing their own. But we expect that we will be engaged and represented in production in the Android ecosystem. Not just in all the accessories, but also in the mobile part themselves. There's really no part of the UWB ecosystem that we feel like we can't address and we are addressing."

And then part two, just for context, roughly what percentage of your future revenue will be tied to long-term supply agreements? Are we talking 5%, 10%? Is it 25%? Just a rough ballpark number would be helpful. 
And then, I guess, most importantly, how should we think about the level of commitment on the part of your customers in terms of both volume and pricing?

The second thing on the guide is just talking about maybe giving a bit of shape to it, and specifically September. Yes, September quarter looks firm as well, expect revenue to be up probably around $50 million or so sequentially versus our June guide.

Demand was broad-based across customers, and design activity suggest continued strength in fiscal '22, supported by multiyear trends in wired and wireless connectivity markets. 
In smartphones, the adoption of 5G is driving demand for higher-value content. Device architectures are increasing in complexity as higher frequencies with wider bandwidths are added, transmit is introduced in the diversity path, MIMO architectures are adopted and new receive paths featuring carrier aggregation. This is placing a premium on Qorvo's highly differentiated semiconductor technologies and enabling us to supply an expanding portfolio of products to industry leaders. 
For calendar '21, we expect 5G smartphones to double versus last year. Within these phones, we expect the RF content to increase $5 to $7 per phone when compared to 4G, including in the mid-tier. 
Turning to the March quarterly highlights. Qorvo achieved record shipments of low, mid-high and ultrahigh band main path solutions and WiFi 6E FEMs in support of leading Android OEMs. On the design front, we continue to expand our content opportunity with the leading Android OEMs by securing complete main path solutions and secondary transmit in the diversity path. 
In Ultra-Wideband, Qorvo was selected by a leading provider of consumer IoT products to integrate Ultra-Wideband into a broad set of connected home devices. More customers are looking to add Ultra-Wideband to their products to take advantage of its superior location accuracy, security and latency compared to other wireless technologies. Customer interest in Qorvo's Ultra-Wideband solutions has been robust, and we continue to see adoption in smartphones as the catalyst for an expanding ecosystem of connected devices that includes associated peripherals, automobiles, consumer and industrial IoT applications. 
Finally, in mobile, we're very pleased to have been honored by Samsung with the Best Quality Award, recognizing Qorvo's innovation and outstanding performance in support of their Galaxy product family. 
In IDP, WiFi revenue, including WiFi 6, was a record. The rate of adoption of WiFi 6 is outpacing the adoption that we experienced for WiFi 5, and the rollout is forecasted to span multiple years across enterprise, retail and service providers. Qorvo is seeing a strong attach rate given the performance advantages we enable related to range, efficiency, signal integrity and form factor. To that end, we recently secured the entire bill of materials in support of a major U.S. MSO gateway. We also released multiple 5G -- 5 gigahertz iFEMs that deliver improved band isolation and enhanced capacity and range in tri-band WiFi 6 home mesh networks. 
In broadband, MSOs are increasing downstream and upstream data capabilities by upgrading to DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. During the quarter, we expanded shipments of DOCSIS 3.1 GaN power amplifiers to major U.S. MSOs, offering greater efficiency, longer range and increased bandwidth to maximize upstream and downstream data connectivity. 
In automotive, Qorvo has for years been successful supporting the increased demand for in-vehicle infotainment. During that time, we have expanded our automotive portfolio and engaged with customers to enable the transition to connected car through cellular V2X. In the March quarter, these efforts helped to generate the first production orders for our cellular V2X front-end modules and BAW coexistence filters to support the leading European automotive OEMs. Of note, Qorvo's high-frequency BAW coexistence filters also enable the concurrent operation of cellular V2X and WiFi. 
In programmable power management, customer demand has been strong in support of 2 trends. First, the transition of solid-state drives is ongoing, primarily in laptops and gaming consoles. During the quarter, Qorvo's programmable PMICs continued to support this transition with expanding shipments to and new engagements with multiple leading solid-state drive providers. Second, the transition of brushless DC electric motors is accelerating, enhancing efficiency in a broad set of consumer products, including power tools and appliances. Qorvo increased shipments of motor control solutions during the quarter supporting multiple major consumer brands. 
In defense applications, the shift to higher frequencies, the adoption of phased array radar and the proliferation of GaN are among the trends supporting demand for Qorvo's products. For radar applications, we released a reconfigurable dual-band GaN power amplifier MMIC for the S and X bands, enabling more compact next-generation radar systems. Over 30 million miles away, the successful landing of NASA's JPL Mars Perseverance rover was supported by our components integrated into the rover's descent radar. 
In infrastructure, we continue to ramp shipments during the quarter to a base station OEM in support of U.S. C-band massive MIMO deployments. And we captured initial design wins for massive MIMO deployments in Canada, Japan and Korea. Qorvo brings decades of technology leadership in wireless infrastructure and we are leveraging the full breadth of our GaN power and small signal portfolio to support OEMs on upcoming 5G deployments. 
We have strong customer engagements, we are investing in critical enabling technologies and design activity remained robust. We see tremendous opportunity in 5G infrastructure globally over the next 4 to 5 years as deployments continue to roll out. 
After the quarter closed, We received an emergency use authorization from the FDA for Omnia COVID-19 rapid antigen test, which leverages high-frequency BAW sensors for high sensitivity and specificity. Qorvo began efforts to use BAW sensors to develop diagnostic test solutions in 2013 in a manner similar to how we leveraged our BAW filters to achieve superior frequency selectivity in RF applications. 
Now with the authorization from the FDA, we are preparing to scale production to help support ongoing public health efforts. To that end, Qorvo was awarded a contract with the National Institutes of Health through the rapid acceleration of diagnostics, or RADx, initiative. With $24 million from the Biological Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, the award is helping to advance the production and market launch of our Omnia diagnostic test platform. 
Also after the quarter closed, Qorvo acquired NextInput, a pioneer in the emerging field of force sensing solutions for the next generation of human-machine interface. NextInput will be part of the mobile products, providing MEMS-based sensors and innovative products for customers in existing and new markets. They have shipped tens of millions of MEMS-based sensor solutions to leading manufacturers of smartphones, wearables, automobiles and other applications. 
We see multiple opportunities for their solutions to augment or displace capacitive touch and mechanical buttons with smaller, more reliable and air-tight solutions that are applicable to any surface, including glass, polycarbonate, aluminum and carbon fiber. We welcome the NextInput team to the Qorvo family and we are excited to expand our technology portfolio and accelerate the deployment of the technology to our broad customer base and new markets. 
Before handing the call over to Mark, I want to acknowledge the entire Qorvo team for their commitment to supporting our customers and keeping the world connected. Qorvo is enabling multiyear upgrade cycles in existing markets and introducing disruptive technologies, including Ultra-Wideband, RF-based biotechnology testing and MEMS-based solutions. We expect broad-based end market demand for our products and another year of strong financial results. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 fourth quarter was $1.073 billion, $33 million above the midpoint of our guidance and up 36% or $285 million versus last year. Mobile Products revenue of $808 million was up 4",963,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 fourth quarter was $1.073 billion, $33 million above the midpoint of our guidance and up 36% or $285 million versus last year. Mobile Products revenue of $808 million was up 45% year-over-year on the growth of higher-content 5G smartphones. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of $265 million was up 14% versus last year, led principally by robust WiFi demand. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of gross margin over 50%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 52.6% and above our guidance as less favorable mix was more than offset by better-than-expected price, manufacturing costs and inventory charges. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $207 million or 19.3% of sales and in line with expectations. Sequential and year-over-year increases in OpEx were driven by technology and product development expenses associated with recent acquisitions and other key growth programs. 
Non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter was $315 million, and diluted earnings per share of $2.74 was $0.32 above the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $403 million, and CapEx was $77 million, in line with our expectations. CapEx for the year was $187 million and below 5% of sales. During the quarter, free cash flow was $325 million, and we repurchased $175 million of shares. 
On the balance sheet, cash increased to $1.4 billion, and debt remained unchanged at approximately $1.7 billion. Our leverage remains low, our revolver is untapped, and we have no material near-term maturities. In April, S&P upgraded our credit rating to investment grade, reflecting the steps we've taken to profitably grow the business and maintain a strong balance sheet. 
Before turning to the outlook, I will comment briefly on the past year. Qorvo's full year fiscal '21 performance realized what was envisioned at the time of the merger: to create an enterprise best able to serve customers' technology and product needs when connectivity trends accelerated and as product performance requirements increased. Qorvo's commitment to R&D, active portfolio management, sustained productivity and capital discipline, positioned us to serve our customers' needs, expand supply chain partner opportunities and improve financial results. 
In fiscal '21, Qorvo delivered revenue over $4 billion, non-GAAP gross margin over 52%, non-GAAP operating margin over 32% and free cash flow over $1.1 billion. Qorvo's free cash flow has increased fivefold over the past 4 years. We are committed to build on this and are investing and executing to do so. 
Now turning to our current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.065 billion and $1.095 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 50%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 in the midpoint of our guidance. Our June quarter revenue outlook reflects sustained and broad-based customer demand driven by multiyear technology upgrade cycles. 
In mobile, demand for 5G is adding RF complexity and driving higher content. We forecast mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $810 million at the midpoint or up 73% year-over-year. 
In IDP, we project revenue of approximately $270 million in the current quarter, sustained by WiFi 6 demand and other markets. 
Our June quarter gross margin guide is approximately 50%, reflecting seasonal patterns and less favorable mix. That is up 140 basis points versus last year on higher volumes, active portfolio management and pricing and continuous productivity efforts. We expect our June quarter gross margin to be the lowest gross margin quarter of the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the June quarter to around $214 million on added labor and other development expenses associated with recent acquisitions and key growth programs. 
At the midpoint of our June quarter guidance, operating margin is forecast to be over 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter. We project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be between 9% and 10%. Capital expenditures will remain around $70 million in the June quarter as we work to intersect projected demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. 
For our full year fiscal '22, we forecast approximately 15% revenue growth on an increase in smartphone volumes in the range of 5% to 10%, a doubling of 5G handsets, sustained WiFi demand and growth in other markets, including power management and defense. We project full year gross margin to be approximately 52%. We expect OpEx to increase sequentially through the year and remain below 20% of sales for the full year. This level of OpEx is in line with what we laid out years ago and supports Qorvo's ongoing product and technology leadership in existing markets, while funding investment in newer areas such as UWB, biosensors, power management and MEMS. 
We forecast other expense to drop slightly on lower interest expense but remain above $60 million. We see CapEx around 5% of sales, so up on an absolute basis as we add capacity to intersect known and high confidence opportunities. We expect free cash flow to grow year-over-year modestly due to slightly higher CapEx and working capital build. 
Based on our strong free cash flow performance in fiscal year '21 and our fiscal year '22 outlook, along with our substantial balance sheet capacity and other factors, the Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. 
Amidst the pandemic, the Qorvo team executed well in serving customers and advancing technologies critical to a more connected world. Entering fiscal '22, we are well positioned to continue delivering premium technology to an expanding set of customers in 5G, WiFi, IoT, defense, power management and other markets. 
In closing, I'd like to join Bob in thanking Qorvo employees again for their contributions over this past year. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And both defense and power management also have a really strong year, so I'm really pleased with the results of our fiscal 2021. 
We've been pretty public about the slowdown in the wireless infrastructure business in the back half of last year. And we certainly see that continuing as we go through the first half of this year. We think it will start to pick up in the back half of next year as deployments in China start. And then certainly, we expect C-band to start to roll out in the United States as we get into the back half of the year. 
So overall, I would expect base station to start to pick up a bit. But I think if you look at full year for IDP, base station will actually probably be down a bit, and we'll see significant growth in some of the other markets."

The other thing that's happened a bit is mix. And again, we've talked about that over the last couple of quarters as the mix has shifted a little bit from 64-element arrays to more macro base stations and more 32-element arrays. 
Now that said, I am very happy with the portfolio that we have. We continue to invest in the technology in both -- in the GaN side for power and in the small signal side, so I'm happy where we are, and I think we continue to make progress there. And we're in the very early stages, so this is just beginning. We've had 1 year in China. We're just starting really in the U.S. and the rest of the world. So this is going to be a multiyear trend. 
I think we're positioned very, very well with the portfolio we have. And of course, we're obviously not going to sit still, we're going to continue to drive that business forward and invest in technology and make sure that we're able to do what we did last year with the early rollouts in China."

But also just all of our complexity around the antenna. It comes with all of that as well, right? As complexity goes, there's a lot more antenna tuning and antennaplexing and so forth. So that's still a strong market for us and WiFi as well. The 6 -- and 6E rollout has been really, really good for us. So WiFi has been growing at one of the faster clips of all of our product groups as well. 
UWB, a lot of excitement about that for sure, lots of design activity across all the verticals. We announced the design and consumer IoT space, which is pretty big for us. It's going to drive growth second half of the year, and so it's going to be picking up throughout the year. It's not driving the growth now given its scale, but as we exit the year, it will be a bigger contributor."

Our inventory charges are actually lower than we thought. So a number of positives again in the fourth quarter just showing how well we're serving the market and working with our customers closely. 
So it gives us a lot of confidence in the next couple of quarters that demand is very firm, which is why I felt comfortable giving a preliminary full year view.

I mean, first of all, it's a very complicated equation, right, on all the things that go into making the gross margin. I think what I'd like to do is just start with our fiscal '22 guide is -- for margins to hold up. Let's start with the fact that in fiscal year '21, we increased gross margin over 400 basis points versus fiscal year '20. So I'd say sustaining at these levels is pretty good. 
And I think you've got to remember that some things will go against us in '22 that went with us in '21. Notably, the pricing environment is very firm now, and that is likely to loosen a bit. It'll still be healthy, we believe, but will not be as tight as it is at the moment. We believe our inventory charges, we have to assume they'll kind of pick back up to normal levels. And we've got to remember just how hard this stuff is that we do. So I can go on and on. 
Now there's plenty of good that's going on to offset the bad in fiscal '22. I mean we're continuing to drive productivity, the portfolio management continues, utilization, we've got some room, and we'll continue to invest as we need to but keep that utilization high. All the things we've talked about over the years. And so as a result, we just -- we have a view now that we can sustain margin at these levels. 
Of course, over time, Karl, we've said we aspire to expand our gross margins. And I think it runs through the same things we've been doing. We'll continue to be a technology leader, allows us to do the hardest parts. We'll pick to play with customers with those hardest parts where our value get recognized. Productivity is as good as it's ever been in the company, and we're driving even more there. And then we're just going to be very circumspect about any capital build.

So really broad, but the team's done a great job of doing all of these with a unified hardware and a unified software stack for the most part with very few variations. So tremendous productivity coming out of that organization to cover such a broad number of verticals. 
And in terms of the outlook for it, we said before, we believe we can get it to a couple of hundred million dollar revenue business within a few years. Nothing has changed there by any means, and we're super excited about the opportunities it's bringing in."

Power Management, great trends there. It continues to grow, well up into the double digits and has done that quarter after quarter, so been a very nice acquisition for us as a company. And defense as well. We've got, again, nice trends inside the defense business. Now on top of that, the automotive business is really starting to kick in as we go into this year. And cable TV has also started to grow our broadband business because of deployment of DOCSIS 3.1. 
So a lot of growth drivers that we have inside the business. As you said, diversification is working for us. It's helping us offset some of the market challenges that we're seeing with the rollout of the infrastructure in China."

But now when I look at your June guide, you're essentially guiding to flattish mobile and IDP sales. So Mark, I'm curious what specifically about mix will drive gross margins down by 250 basis points? 
And what I would really like to understand is why is there so much variability between your initial outlook versus, right, what you have reported? And should we assume your gross margin outlook this time is also conservative like it has been in the last 2 quarters?"

And I think our forecast history, as far as our ability to meet commitments, is clear. I think we've had 17 quarters or so. It depends on what you do with the hurricane in Florida several years ago as to whether that's ruined the streak or not. But we do our best to give a good read. And -- but there's a lot of things in the mix any given quarter. 
And so what's most important to us is can we forecast it well and meet commitments. And I think we -- you can argue that we're kind of missing it on the high side, but I'd say that we have it in control and can continue to improve the business because we know what's going on. 
The second thing is it's indisputable at this point that all the work we've been doing has led to a higher quantum. So we've just -- we've increased gross margin, particularly over the past year and had stabilized it before. So the R&D investment and portfolio management, productivity and reducing capital intensity is all paying off. To your point, we continue to work on growing the business in the right areas and working on our cost curves and picking and choosing where we're going to compete and bring the most value to customers. And over time, we think that the variability that we have will moderate. 
As it relates to the June quarter, we are down. And we're -- I said actually that we'd be down in the 49s, and the drivers are the same. We assume that price will moderate somewhat sequentially. We do have some product mix effects. And then we have some favorability from, in this case, the March quarter that -- yes, that's not going to repeat. We had some favorable absorption in the factories, and then we had some inventory effects that we have to assume we might return to normal levels on inventory charges. So that explains the sequential decline. 
I'll finish my comments with it. Remember that's an increase versus the soft guidance I gave you before. So we -- our view has actually improved on the quarter. We're driving more productivity than we thought. We have a little bit better price than we thought because the market is still very firm. And then there are a number of other factors. But listen, we're pleased to guide a 50% number, and we're -- we have confidence in that result."

And the real underlying question in that is what are your views about the competitive landscape? Because if the industry is so supply constrained, I'm surprised to hear you talk about loosening of price, unless you think something about the competitive landscape could change.

We have other growth drivers coming on top of that as well. But of course, as we enter the year, we take a relatively conservative look. I think it's still a pretty strong guide for the year. 
In terms of pricing, I think in terms of loosening, all Mark was indicating is that we've had very firm pricing in the March quarter, extremely tight market. We're going to continue to push the price curve while maintaining, of course, relationships and design strength that we have. Mark indicated long-term agreements with customers are coming into play, which is great for us and for customers. It's just an incredibly constructive environment for building a long-term business that's profitable for us and helps our customers make a lot of money, too, because of the advanced technologies.

As far as overall size of IDP, as I've talked about many times, I love the diversification of the business. And we're going to ebb and flow a bit.

And then in the same kind of spirit of things, the Chinese built out an industrial policy, edict from the government. The U.S. doesn't do that at all. U.S. carriers actually have to show an ROI for their build-out, which calls into question how many MIMO stations will actually deploy given the relatively modest improvements you get in performance versus the incredibly higher cost for this. 
So I'm just trying -- I know it's slowing down now that you guys have forecasted that, and that's actually happening now.

That has deployments in U.S. and the configurations that our customers are telling us about and deployments in China, and of course, the rest of the world. 
Going forward, though, there are a tremendous amount of base stations still to be deployed, and the China deployments during the first year were relatively low. So I do see just tremendous content pickups for us as we go through this 5-year deployment. 
It's important, Ed, to know that if you go back to 4G, a 64-element array is still about a 10x content pickup for us. With 32-element arrays, not a little bit more than half of that. So these are big, big content gains for us in the business. And so it's really a content story. And as you play that out and deployments around the world, it continues to be a growth business for us.

And going forward, we'll see complete, what we call, dual connect modules more and more going from the upper tier down. And the dual connect modules, we have a complete transmit and receive path for the bands that they do transmit on, right? And those bands are throughout the mid- and high-band frequencies, we'll say. So it's a great growing category. 
Again, we're going to bring all filters to it. We're going to bring integration to it, best-in-class GaAs PAs and everything we have in the main path. So that's a great new category for us. And of course, supported by just more bandwidth in the uplink and trying to get more video through the networks and higher data rates and so forth. That's really what's driving that as we've been talking about for years, actually. 
On UWB, I think when you say you're seeing NXP primarily in Android house, is that kind of a legacy comment, which I acknowledge. Obviously, Decawave wasn't in a position to really address the mobile market, and that's why they took the path they did. As Qorvo, though, of course, we're targeting the mobile market directly. 
And to your point, that is Android, as of the current state of play at least. Apple is doing their own.

It's more of a supply-constrained environment. And the growth drivers in the business are intact, with the near-term exception of infrastructure, as we've discussed. 
You've got the economic recoveries underway, but we know how quickly that can turn. And then there's just pockets of supply chain risks, which we're managing very well, but acknowledging that they're there. So I just want that to be clear in this initial look. 
The second thing on the guide is just talking about maybe giving a bit of shape to it, and specifically September. Yes, September quarter looks firm as well, expect revenue to be up probably around $50 million or so sequentially versus our June guide. The gross margin, we see increasing being between 51%, 52%, so increasing 100, 150 basis points, probably closer to 150 basis points as we see it now. 
We'll give more -- oh, and one last thing, OpEx, we see going up about $10 million sequentially.

Qorvo concluded our fiscal 2021 with an exceptionally strong March quarter. Quarterly revenue, gross margin and EPS were well above guidance. Outperformance was driven primarily by 5G smartphones and WiFi 6 and 6E. D",1200,"Thanks, Doug, and welcome, everyone. 
Qorvo concluded our fiscal 2021 with an exceptionally strong March quarter. Quarterly revenue, gross margin and EPS were well above guidance. Outperformance was driven primarily by 5G smartphones and WiFi 6 and 6E. Demand was broad-based across customers, and design activity suggest continued strength in fiscal '22, supported by multiyear trends in wired and wireless connectivity markets. 
In smartphones, the adoption of 5G is driving demand for higher-value content. Device architectures are increasing in complexity as higher frequencies with wider bandwidths are added, transmit is introduced in the diversity path, MIMO architectures are adopted and new receive paths featuring carrier aggregation. This is placing a premium on Qorvo's highly differentiated semiconductor technologies and enabling us to supply an expanding portfolio of products to industry leaders. 
For calendar '21, we expect 5G smartphones to double versus last year. Within these phones, we expect the RF content to increase $5 to $7 per phone when compared to 4G, including in the mid-tier. 
Turning to the March quarterly highlights. Qorvo achieved record shipments of low, mid-high and ultrahigh band main path solutions and WiFi 6E FEMs in support of leading Android OEMs. On the design front, we continue to expand our content opportunity with the leading Android OEMs by securing complete main path solutions and secondary transmit in the diversity path. 
In ultra-wideband, Qorvo was selected by a leading provider of consumer IoT products to integrate ultra-wideband into a broad set of connected home devices. More customers are looking to add ultra-wideband to their products to take advantage of its superior location accuracy, security and latency compared to other wireless technologies. 
Customer interest in Qorvo's ultra-wideband solutions has been robust, and we continue to see adoption in smartphones as the catalyst for an expanding ecosystem of connected devices that includes associated peripherals, automobiles, consumer and industrial IoT applications. 
Finally, in mobile, we're very pleased to have been honored by Samsung with the Best Quality Award, recognizing Qorvo's innovation and outstanding performance in support of their Galaxy product family. 
In IDP, WiFi revenue, including WiFi 6, was a record. The rate of adoption of WiFi 6 is outpacing the adoption that we experienced for WiFi 5, and the rollout is forecasted to span multiple years across enterprise, retail and service providers. Qorvo is seeing a strong attach rate given the performance advantages we enable related to range, efficiency, signal integrity and form factor. 
To that end, we recently secured the entire bill of materials in support of a major U.S. MSO gateway. We also released multiple 5G -- 5 gigahertz iFEMs that deliver improved band isolation and enhanced capacity and range in tri-band WiFi 6 home mesh networks. 
In broadband, MSOs are increasing downstream and upstream data capabilities by upgrading to DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. During the quarter, we expanded shipments of DOCSIS 3.1 GaN power amplifiers to major U.S. MSOs, offering greater efficiency, longer range and increased bandwidth to maximize upstream and downstream data connectivity.
In automotive, Qorvo has for years been successful supporting the increased demand for in-vehicle infotainment. During that time, we have expanded our automotive portfolio and engaged with customers to enable the transition to connected car through cellular V2X. 
In the March quarter, these efforts helped to generate the first production orders for our cellular V2X front-end modules and BAW coexistence filters to support the leading European automotive OEMs. Of note, Qorvo's high-frequency BAW coexistence filters also enable the concurrent operation of cellular V2X and WiFi. 
In programmable power management, customer demand has been strong in support of 2 trends. First, the transition of solid-state drives is ongoing, primarily in laptops and gaming consoles. During the quarter, Qorvo's programmable PMICs continued to support this transition with expanding shipments to and new engagements with multiple leading solid-state drive providers. 
Second, the transition of brushless DC electric motors is accelerating, enhancing efficiency in a broad set of consumer products, including power tools and appliances. Qorvo increased shipments of motor control solutions during the quarter supporting multiple major consumer brands. 
In defense applications, the shift to higher frequencies, the adoption of phased array radar and the proliferation of GaN are among the trends supporting demand for Qorvo's products. For radar applications, we released a reconfigurable dual-band GaN power amplifier MMIC for the S and X bands, enabling more compact next-generation radar systems. Over 30 million miles away, the successful landing of NASA's JPL Mars Perseverance rover was supported by our components integrated into the rover's descent radar. 
In infrastructure, we continue to ramp shipments during the quarter to a base station OEM in support of U.S. C-band massive MIMO deployments, and we captured initial design wins for massive MIMO deployments in Canada, Japan and Korea. Qorvo brings decades of technology leadership in wireless infrastructure and we are leveraging the full breadth of our GaN power and small signal portfolio to support OEMs on upcoming 5G deployments. 
We have strong customer engagements, we are investing in critical enabling technologies and design activity remains robust. We see tremendous opportunity in 5G infrastructure globally over the next 4 to 5 years as deployments continue to roll out. 
After the quarter closed, we received an emergency use authorization from the FDA for Omnia COVID-19 rapid antigen test, which leverages high-frequency BAW sensors for high sensitivity and specificity. Qorvo began efforts to use BAW sensors to develop diagnostic test solutions in 2013 in a manner similar to how we leveraged our BAW filters to achieve superior frequency selectivity in RF applications. 
Now with the authorization from the FDA, we are preparing to scale production to help support ongoing public health efforts. To that end, Qorvo was awarded a contract with the National Institutes of Health through the rapid acceleration of diagnostics, or RADx, initiative. With $24 million from the Biological Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, the award is helping to advance the production and market launch of our Omnia diagnostic test platform. 
Also after the quarter closed, Qorvo acquired NextInput, a pioneer in the emerging field of force sensing solutions for the next generation of human-machine interface. NextInput will be part of the mobile products, providing MEMS-based sensors and innovative products for customers in existing and new markets. They have shipped tens of millions of MEMS-based sensor solutions to leading manufacturers of smartphones, wearables, automobiles and other applications. 
We see multiple opportunities for their solutions to augment or displace capacitive touch and mechanical buttons with smaller, more reliable and air-tight solutions that are applicable to any surface, including glass, polycarbonate, aluminum and carbon fiber. We welcome the NextInput team to the Qorvo family and we are excited to expand our technology portfolio and accelerate the deployment of the technology to our broad customer base and new markets. 
Before handing the call over to Mark, I want to acknowledge the entire Qorvo team for their commitment to supporting our customers and keeping the world connected. Qorvo is enabling multiyear upgrade cycles in existing markets and introducing disruptive technologies, including ultra-wideband, RF-based biotechnology testing and MEMS-based solutions. We expect broad-based end market demand for our products and another year of strong financial results. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 fourth quarter was $1.073 billion, $33 million above the midpoint of our guidance and up 36% or $285 million versus last year. Mobile Products revenue of $808 million was up 4",963,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal '21 fourth quarter was $1.073 billion, $33 million above the midpoint of our guidance and up 36% or $285 million versus last year. Mobile Products revenue of $808 million was up 45% year-over-year on the growth of higher-content 5G smartphones. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of $265 million was up 14% versus last year, led principally by robust WiFi demand. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of gross margin over 50%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 52.6% and above our guidance as less favorable mix was more than offset by better-than-expected price, manufacturing costs and inventory charges. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $207 million or 19.3% of sales and in line with expectations. Sequential and year-over-year increases in OpEx were driven by technology and product development expenses associated with recent acquisitions and other key growth programs. 
Non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter was $315 million, and diluted earnings per share of $2.74 was $0.32 above the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $403 million, and CapEx was $77 million, in line with our expectations. CapEx for the year was $187 million and below 5% of sales. During the quarter, free cash flow was $325 million, and we repurchased $175 million of shares. 
On the balance sheet, cash increased to $1.4 billion, and debt remained unchanged at approximately $1.7 billion. Our leverage remains low, our revolver is untapped and we have no material near-term maturities. In April, S&P upgraded our credit rating to investment grade, reflecting the steps we've taken to profitably grow the business and maintain a strong balance sheet. 
Before turning to the outlook, I will comment briefly on the past year. Qorvo's full year fiscal '21 performance realized what was envisioned at the time of the merger: to create an enterprise best able to serve customers' technology and product needs when connectivity trends accelerated and as product performance requirements increased. 
Qorvo's commitment to R&D, active portfolio management, sustained productivity and capital discipline positioned us to serve our customers' needs, expand supply chain partner opportunities and improve financial results. 
In fiscal '21, Qorvo delivered revenue over $4 billion, non-GAAP gross margin over 52%, non-GAAP operating margin over 32% and free cash flow over $1.1 billion. Qorvo's free cash flow has increased fivefold over the past 4 years. We are committed to build on this and are investing and executing to do so. 
Now turning to our current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.065 billion and $1.095 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 50%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.45 in the midpoint of our guidance. Our June quarter revenue outlook reflects sustained and broad-based customer demand driven by multiyear technology upgrade cycles. 
In mobile, demand for 5G is adding RF complexity and driving higher content. We forecast mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $810 million at the midpoint or up 73% year-over-year. In IDP, we project revenue of approximately $270 million in the current quarter, sustained by WiFi 6 demand and other markets. 
Our June quarter gross margin guide is approximately 50%, reflecting seasonal patterns and less favorable mix. That is up 140 basis points versus last year on higher volumes, active portfolio management and pricing and continuous productivity efforts. We expect our June quarter gross margin to be the lowest gross margin quarter of the year. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the June quarter to around $214 million on added labor and other development expenses associated with recent acquisitions and key growth programs. 
At the midpoint of our June quarter guidance, operating margin is forecast to be over 30% for the fourth consecutive quarter. We project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be between 9% and 10%. Capital expenditures will remain around $70 million in the June quarter as we work to intersect projected demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. 
For our full year fiscal '22, we forecast approximately 15% revenue growth on an increase in smartphone volumes in the range of 5% to 10%, a doubling of 5G handsets, sustained WiFi demand and growth in other markets, including power management and defense. We project full year gross margin to be approximately 52%. 
We expect OpEx to increase sequentially through the year and remain below 20% of sales for the full year. This level of OpEx is in line with what we laid out years ago and supports Qorvo's ongoing product and technology leadership in existing markets, while funding investment in newer areas such as UWB, biosensors, power management and MEMS. 
We forecast other expense to drop slightly on lower interest expense but remain above $60 million. We see CapEx around 5% of sales, so up on an absolute basis, as we add capacity to intersect known and high confidence opportunities. We expect free cash flow to grow year-over-year modestly due to slightly higher CapEx and working capital build. 
Based on our strong free cash flow performance in fiscal year '21 and our fiscal year '22 outlook, along with our substantial balance sheet capacity and other factors, the Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. 
Amidst the pandemic, the Qorvo team executed well in serving customers and advancing technologies critical to a more connected world. Entering fiscal '22, we are well positioned to continue delivering premium technology to an expanding set of customers in 5G, WiFi, IoT, defense, power management and other markets. 
In closing, I'd like to join Bob in thanking Qorvo employees again for their contributions over this past year. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

We've been pretty public about the slowdown in the wireless infrastructure business in the back half of last year. And we certainly see that continuing as we go through the first half of this year. We think it will start to pick up in the back half of next year as deployments in China start. And then certainly, we expect C-band to start to roll out in the United States as we get into the back half of the year. 
So overall, I would expect base station to start to pick up a bit. But I think if you look at full year for IDP, base station will actually probably be down a bit, and we'll see significant growth in some of the other markets."

Now that said, I am very happy with the portfolio that we have. We continue to invest in the technology in both -- in the GaN side for power and in the small signal side. So I'm happy where we are, and I think we continue to make progress there. And we're in the very early stages, so this is just beginning. We've had 1 year in China. We're just starting really in the U.S. and the rest of the world. So this is going to be a multiyear trend. 
I think we're positioned very, very well with the portfolio we have. And of course, we're obviously not going to sit still, we're going to continue to drive that business forward and invest in technology and make sure that we're able to do what we did last year with the early rollouts in China."

But also just all of our complexity around the antenna. It comes with all of that as well, right? As complexity goes, there's a lot more antenna tuning and antennaplexing and so forth. So that's still a strong market for us. And WiFi as well. The 6 and 6E rollout has been really, really good for us. So WiFi has been growing at one of the faster clips of all of our product groups as well. 
UWB, a lot of excitement about that for sure. Lots of design activity across all the verticals. We announced the design in the consumer IoT space, which is pretty big for us. It's going to drive growth second half of the year, and so it's going to be picking up throughout the year. It's not driving the growth now given its scale, but as we exit the year, it will be a bigger contributor."

So we were able to both produce more product and get them more product, and you see that come in a number of forms. We had more favorable absorption. We had some better pricing. Our inventory charges are actually lower than we thought. So a number of positives again in the fourth quarter just showing how well we're serving the market and working with our customers closely. 
So it gives us a lot of confidence in the next couple of quarters that demand is very firm, which is why I felt comfortable giving a preliminary full year view. And we'll just continue to do what we've been doing and managing our inventories closely, watching the channel. Both of those are very healthy. And the behavior from customers suggests that it's long-term demand, and they're looking to partner with us more closely."

I mean, first of all, it's a very complicated equation, right, on all the things that go into making the gross margin. I think what I'd like to do is just start with our fiscal '22 guide is for margins to hold up. Let's start with the fact that in fiscal year '21, we increased gross margin over 400 basis points versus fiscal year '20. So I'd say sustaining at these levels is pretty good. 
And I think you've got to remember that some things will go against us in '22 that went with us in '21. Notably, the pricing environment is very firm now, and that is likely to loosen a bit. It'll still be healthy, we believe, but will not be as tight as it is at the moment. We believe our inventory charges, we have to assume they'll kind of pick back up to normal levels. And we've got to remember just how hard this stuff is that we do. So I can go on and on. 
Now there's plenty of good that's going on to offset the bad in fiscal '22. I mean we're continuing to drive productivity, the portfolio management continues. Utilization, we've got some room, and we'll continue to invest as we need to but keep that utilization high. All the things we've talked about over the years. And so as a result, we just -- we have a view now that we can sustain margin at these levels. 
Of course, over time, Karl, we've said we aspire to expand our gross margins. And I think it runs through the same things we've been doing. We'll continue to be a technology leader, allows us to do the hardest parts. We'll pick to play with customers with those hardest parts where our value get recognized. Productivity is as good as it's ever been in the company, and we're driving even more there. And then we're just going to be very circumspect about any capital build.

Power Management, great trends there. It continues to grow, well up into the double digits and has done that quarter after quarter, so been a very nice acquisition for us as a company.

So Mark, I'm curious what specifically about mix will drive gross margins down by 250 basis points?

And should we assume your gross margin outlook this time is also conservative like it has been in the last 2 quarters?"

And I think our forecast history, as far as our ability to meet commitments, is clear. I think we've had 17 quarters or so. It depends on what you do with the hurricane in Florida several years ago as to whether that's ruined the streak or not. But we do our best to give a good read. And -- but there's a lot of things in the mix any given quarter. 
And so what's most important to us is can we forecast it well and meet commitments. And I think we -- you can argue that we're kind of missing it on the high side, but I'd say that we have it in control and can continue to improve the business because we know what's going on. 
The second thing is it's indisputable at this point that all the work we've been doing has led to a higher quantum. So we've just -- we've increased gross margin, particularly over the past year, and had stabilized it before. So the R&D investment and portfolio management, productivity and reducing capital intensity is all paying off. 
To your point, we continue to work on growing the business in the right areas and working on our cost curves and picking and choosing where we're going to compete and bring the most value to customers. And over time, we think that the variability that we have will moderate. 
As it relates to the June quarter, we are down. And we're -- I said actually that we'd be down in the 49s. And the drivers are the same. We assume that price will moderate somewhat sequentially. We do have some product mix effects. And then we have some favorability from, in this case, the March quarter that -- yes, that's not going to repeat. We had some favorable absorption in the factories and then we had some inventory effects that we have to assume we might return to normal levels on inventory charges. So that explains the sequential decline. 
I'll finish my comments with that, remember, that's an increase versus the soft guidance I gave you before. So we -- our view has actually improved on the quarter. We're driving more productivity than we thought. We have a little bit better price than we thought because the market is still very firm. And then there are a number of other factors. But listen, we're pleased to guide a 50% number, and we're -- we have confidence in that result."

In terms of pricing, I think in terms of loosening, all Mark was indicating is that we've had very firm pricing in the March quarter, extremely tight market. We're going to continue to push the price curve while maintaining, of course, relationships and design strength that we have. Mark indicated long-term agreements with customers are coming into play, which is great for us and for customers. It's just an incredibly constructive environment for building a long-term business that's profitable for us and helps our customers make a lot of money, too, because of the advanced technologies.

That has deployments in U.S. and the configurations that our customers are telling us about, and deployments in China and, of course, the rest of the world. 
Going forward, though, there are a tremendous amount of base stations still to be deployed, and the China deployments during the first year were relatively low. So I do see just tremendous content pickups for us as we go through this 5-year deployment. 
It's important, Ed, to know that if you go back to 4G, a 64-element array is still about a 10x content pickup for us. A 32-element array is not a little bit more than half of that. So these are big, big content gains for us in the business. And so it's really a content story. And as you play that out in deployments around the world, it continues to be a growth business for us. 
And of course, GaN is a new technology for us. We couldn't access the power amplifiers as we went through the 4G cycle. And now, we've got great products and great technology that allow us to address that whole segment."

But does that limit you -- I mean this would be like instead of n77 WiFi combination for coexist or are all the subseq bands open to your solutions? Are you cherry-picking on that? 
And then if I could, also, on the ultra-wideband. It looks increasingly like Apple's got their own solution doing their phone. NXP is taking a lot of the handset side of the business in the Android world. And is it a fair assumption to say Decawave is really going to be focused mostly on the other side of it, the IoT side of it, all the devices that talk to the handsets? I mean other than Google, should we expect to see you much in the Android handset side with UWB?"

So starting with the transmit and the diversity path, yes, that's a rapidly growing space for us. As you indicated, we had forecasted it would be.

So starting with the transmit and the diversity path, yes, that's a rapidly growing space for us. As you indicated, we had forecasted it would be. And it's not by any means limited to the content we have today. 
Today, it's relatively kind of discrete placements. And going forward, we'll see complete, what we call, dual connect modules more and more going from the upper tier down. In the dual connect modules, we have a complete transmit and receive path for the bands that they do transmit on, right? And those bands are throughout the mid- and high-band frequencies, we'll say. So it's a great growing category. 
Again, we're going to bring BAW filters to it. We're going to bring integration to it, best-in-class GaAs PAs and everything we have in the main path. So that's a great new category for us. And of course, supported by just more bandwidth in the uplink and trying to get more video through the networks and higher data rates and so forth. That's really what's driving that as we've been talking about for years, actually. 
On UWB, I think when you say you're seeing NXP primarily in Android house, that's kind of a legacy comment which I acknowledge. Obviously, Decawave wasn't in a position to really address the mobile market and that's why they took the path they did. As Qorvo, though, of course, we're targeting the mobile market directly. 
And to your point, that is Android, as of the current state of play at least. Apple is doing their own. But we expect that we will be engaged and represented in production in the Android ecosystem, not just in all the accessories, but also in the mobile part themselves. There's really no part of the UWB ecosystem that we feel like we can't address and we are addressing."

And then part two, just for context, roughly what percentage of your future revenue will be tied to long-term supply agreements? Are we talking 5%, 10%? Is it 25%? Just a rough ballpark number would be helpful. 
And then I guess, most importantly, how should we think about the level of commitment on the part of your customers in terms of both volume and pricing? And I ask the question because historically, maybe not specific to Qorvo but in the industry broadly, the suppliers would have to be committed to a long-term agreement, but the customer always has the flexibility to push or cancel purchases.

First, the Qorvo team delivered an exceptional June quarter. Revenue, gross margin and EPS were each above guidance. Customer demand during the quarter was broad-based and included recently released product categories including 5G diversity receive modules, MEMS-based touch sensors and WiFi 6E FEMs to name a few. 
Our R&D teams are relentlessly and the technologies that enable more complete, integrated solutions and increase our differentiation. We are partnering with leading customers, serving them where we are most valued and introducing new products and technologies that expand our addressable markets. We are pleased with ongoing design activity. We are locking in wins and we expect the demand environment to remain robust. 
In the smartphone market, 5G devices are adopting new architectures and adding functionality that enhance performance and create new challenges related to current consumption, space and handset design resources. To address these challenges, handset manufacturers are selecting more highly integrated solutions that delivers superior performance. 
For Qorvo, the content opportunity in a 5G device increases by $5 to $7 when compared to a 4G device. We expect handset units to grow 5% to 10% this year with 5G doubling to around 550 million units. In 2025, 5G units are expected to be approximately 80% of total units. 
In other connectivity markets, new applications are proliferating, supported by generation over generation advancements, in WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Thread, ultra wide band and other wireless protocols. And a growing number of applications, multiple wireless standards coexist and operate concurrently. As an example, one of the largest smart home providers recently integrated numerous low-power wireless protocols into its distributed WiFi 6 router, creating infrastructure for seamless whole home operability. We expect this integration trend to continue. 
Our expertise in areas including product design, software support and system solutions enable us to simplify our customers' product development efforts while significantly enhancing the end-user experience. Outside of connectivity markets, the expanding opportunities are driven by a diverse set of underlying upgrade cycles. 
Rushless DC motors are replacing larger, less efficient conventional DC motors. Solid-state drives are replacing slower and less reliable hard disk drives. And touch sensor solutions are replacing less functional traditional buyer. We also expect RF-based biotechnology testing will enable central lab performance at the point of care. We expect our first commercial orders for our omni test platform by the end of the year. 
Turning to the June quarterly highlights. In 5G handsets, customer demand for highly integrated modules is expanding. During the quarter, we launched our next-generation complete main path solution, which includes low-band, mid-high band and ultra-high band modules, offering higher output power and enhanced MIMO support for upcoming 5G phones. 
For the diversity path, we began sampling our first 5G DRx, a sub-6 ultra-high band placement, offering best-in-class received sensitivity. These main path and diversity path solutions integrate filtering and amplifiers that were formally discrete, helping our customers to save board space, improve device performance and accelerate product development efforts. 
Also during the quarter, we announced the interoperability of our family of ultra-wideband products with Apple's U1 chip and the nearby interaction protocol. Qorvo's ultra-wideband solutions provide a superior level of accuracy, reliability, latency and security when compared to traditional technologies like WiFi, BLE and NFC. 
In addition to remote access to our cars and homes, ultra wideband will enable new applications in the connected home, indoor navigation, contactless payment, factory automation and other use cases. With more in-house software capability from our recent 7Hugs acquisition, we now offer a complete solution, and we're working with customers on products combining our ultra-wideband hardware with our latest software release, shortening their time to market. We see a growing set of applications for our ultra-wideband solutions and customer design activity is accelerating. 
In WiFi for handsets, we secured new reference design engagements with our WiFi 6E FEMs. These chip-on-board FEMs reduce insertion loss and enhanced handset design flexibility versus system-in-a-package solutions by a placement closer to the antenna. Leading Android manufacturers are moving from system and package placements to best-in-class RF solutions. is winning on the strength of our product design, performance and customer support. 
In automotive, we achieved record revenue, up more than 80% year-over-year in support of automotive OEMs in the U.S., Europe and in Asia. Growth was driven primarily by the increased demand and in connectivity requirements for WiFi, VDX, LTE and 5G. Content growth was also included our touch sensor solutions, which automotive OEMs are using to enable smart interiors. This is a new growth category for Qorvo, and we have secured design wins in support of multiple automotive customers. To enhance the functionality of our touch sensor solutions and foster new use cases, we've integrated infrared capabilities, a milestone achievement for our Sensor team. 
For the smart home, we partnered with a leading supplier of home mesh networks to introduce the first WiFi 6 router with integrated BLE, Thread and Zigbee multiprotocol operation. This leveraged our ConcurrentConnect technology. We also secured a BAW filter design win with a leading supplier of high-end audio speakers to support the pairing of Bluetooth low energy and WiFi 6. 
As a member of the Connectivity Standards Alliance and an early participant in the upcoming matter connectivity standard, Qorvo stands to benefit as multi-protocol, seamless interoperability drives IoT adoption and growth. In power management, we released a 40-volt motor control solution that supports the ongoing transition to higher voltage battery power tools. Demand for our motor control and power management products has been very strong, driving growth in applications from appliances and battery power tools to enterprise compute laptops and gaming. We are seeing demand for brushless DC motors expand into lower-cost power tools and smaller appliances, given the advantages in efficiency, size and reliability. We are also leveraging the configurability of our power management solutions to address new applications in defense and other markets. 
In infrastructure, we increased shipments to multiple OEMs in support of 5G sub-6 gigahertz massive MIMO and macro deployments in the U.S., Japan, Korea and Canada. We also achieved initial design wins supporting a massive MIMO deployment in India, and we secured BAW filter design wins for 3.5 gigahertz and 4.9 gigahertz 5G small cells with a major China-based OEM. 
New product launches, including GaN integrated PA modules for massive MIMO systems and a family of high-efficiency power amplifiers for 5G small cells serving densely populated areas. Across our markets, there are strong secular tailwinds. Connectivity is proliferating and complexity is increasing, which is expanding our growth opportunities. We supply best-in-class products. And our investments in new product areas and differentiated technologies are extending our technology leadership and broadening our reach. As our June results and September guidance demonstrate, end market demand is broad-based and robust, and our outlook is strong. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Non-GAAP gross margin was 52.5% and above our guidance on more favorable mix and pricing, improved manufacturing yields and lower inventory charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were $216 million or 19.4% of sales and in line with expectations. 
Sequential and year-over-year increases in OpEx were driven by technology and product development expenses associated with key organic growth programs and recent acquisitions. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the June quarter was $367 million and 33.1% of sales. This was the third consecutive quarter of operating margin over 33%. Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter was $323 million, and diluted earnings per share of $2.83 was $0.38 above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was over $341 million and CapEx was $65 million consistent with the level of spend we've discussed previously to support our outlook. Free cash flow was $276 million, and we repurchased $300 million of shares. The first quarter share repurchase was the largest dollar amount since an ASR in the March quarter of 2016. 
Since the company's formation and through the June quarter, we have repurchased $3.7 billion of shares at an average price of approximately $71. 
On the balance sheet, cash decreased to $1.2 billion following the close of our next input acquisition and the share repurchases. That remained unchanged at approximately $1.7 billion. Our leverage remains low. Our revolver is untapped, and we have no material near-term maturities. Yesterday, Fitch initiated a credit rate out in Qorvo at BBB+. This, along with S&P's upgrade of Qorvo to investment grade in April, highlights the quality of Qorvo's business, the strength and durability of our cash flows and the financial discipline we've maintained. 
Now turning to the current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.235 billion and $1.265 billion; non-GAAP gross margin between 52% and 52.5%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.24 at the midpoint of guidance. Our September quarter revenue outlook reflects sustained and broad-based customer demand, driven by multiyear technology upgrade cycles. 
Qorvo revenue of $1.250 billion at the midpoint is up 13% sequentially, 18% year-over-year and approximately 27% year-over-year adjusting for last year's 14-week quarter. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year, and the September quarter last year was a 14-week quarter versus this fiscal year's more typical 13-week quarter. 
We forecast mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $985 million at the midpoint or up 31% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. In IDP, we project revenue to decline slightly to approximately $265 million in the current quarter on defense program timing and continued supply constraints. We expect IDP sequential and year-over-year growth to return in the December quarter. 
Our September quarter gross margin guide of 52.25% at the midpoint is 55 basis points higher than last year's second quarter and reflects our ongoing portfolio management and sustained strong operating performance. In the second half of the fiscal year, we currently expect gross margins to remain around 52%, resulting in full year gross margin above 52%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the September quarter to approximately $233 million on added labor and other development expenses associated with recent acquisitions and key growth programs. At the midpoint of our September quarter guidance, operating margin is forecasted to remain over 33% for the fourth consecutive quarter. We now project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 9%. 
Capital expenditures are projected to increase to around $75 million in the September quarter as we work to intersect demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. 
We are off to a strong start in fiscal '22, and we are well positioned to continue delivering premium technology to an expanding set of customers in 5G, WiFi, IoT, defense, power management and other growth markets. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

So I think that speaks to the quality of the rest of the business. Yes, the June quarter, another strong beat and things are just going really well. I would say that a combination of the environment we're in which makes -- can be challenging in the forecast, but also just our improvements are outrunning even our own high expectations. So we're doing -- the org is operating very well. and we're in the right places, and that's paying off. 
As it relates to the June beat, we did have the higher volumes, and that was favorable, it skewed favorable on the mix, those higher volumes relative to the guide. We're still supply constrained. So that allows us some tactical opportunities, either to types of products and price. And then, again, we're just operating exceptionally well. The product test yields are better than expected.  Manufacturing costs are in control. We've got good utilization. So the fixed cost absorption is predictable or better than expected. And then we had other inventory charges which were lower than expected. So again, really pleased with the quarter. 
Now we are guiding down a bit. We're still going to be up 55 basis points year-over-year. Some of that is -- we just believe that some of the price effects will begin to moderate a bit. The inventory charges we expect to be a bit more normal. But I think it's hugely important to keep in mind that we're stabilizing around 52%. And structurally, this is a better business than it was years ago. And that's -- so it's sustainable.  It's been driven by a number of efforts on dimensions we've laid out before. 
We are definitively a leader across a number of technologies, have very broad portfolio, gives us flexibility in the products and the opportunities we pursue. We've actively managed the portfolio. We pick the right products. We've got broad customer exposure and pick the place where they're going to evaluate the most. 
You've always done a terrific job on productivity and the culture has matured here around cost savings and just getting more done with less and getting it done more efficiently, which benefits customers and all, and those are ongoing. And it's allowing us to manage risk better which I think has proven in this last 1.5 years. And that we're being very disciplined about our capital spend as we are picking up spend but it's to serve what we believe is a very clear and compelling outlook."

But right now, we're not seeing that. We're still in a supply-constrained environment. 
We do, as I mentioned, see IDP growth resuming in the third quarter sequentially. But the business will still be less than $300 million in the December quarter. That would imply then that mobile is down a little bit sequentially. And the fourth quarter is just too early at this point to really call definitively. 
We think that IDP will be over $300 million in the fourth quarter, so continuing to grow through the year and then mobile be down a bit seasonally. We do, just our gross margins to be clear, see those sort of leveling out around 52% in the back half for a total year of a little over 52%."

So they've got a broad and growing portfolio of really leading-edge technology handsets and doing very well in Europe, for example, and other places. 
So it's a vibrant design opportunity for us using leading-edge technologies, continuing to stick with the road map around highly integrated products that we're supporting and very much adopting our antenna control solutions and so forth. So the environment for design in terms of relationships and and so forth is fantastic. The product portfolio turns over fairly often, which gives lots of opportunities for new functions and new integration levels and features and so forth, which is always great for us. 
So in terms of recent slowness in the sell-through, you see some noise in the data. It's still great sell-through. The 5G phones are on track this year. The vast majority of what we're shipping to our Chinese customers today is 5G components and, of course, the sell-in into China domestic as well as vastly 5G already.

So as Mark talked about, I think that really allows us to move back into starting to grow in Q3 and Q4 for IDP. Now there's a couple of other things that are going to help us get back into growth as we enter the back half of the year. Part of that is we get beyond a really, really high growth that we had last year in the first 2 quarters with base station. And so that will be part of what allows us to get into that growth area. But also, we see significant strength and pretty good visibility as we go in the back half in power management and in our WiFi business.

At that point, if you took a snapshot of what happened back then, you were spread around 20% for each of the major groups, including IDP, which you seem to be happy, but now it seems like we're kind of returning back to that kind of a model with multiple 10% customers. 
What I'm wondering is with the push of 5G into lower-cost phones, which is capturing more of the discrete market, is that going to change? Because if you look at China as a total, it must be a very large portion of your total revenue? Or are you counting in 10%? I mean is the blend across China, if you had multiple 15% customers, which of the box guys, doesn't that expose you to the swings in China, maybe a little bit more than would you be comfortable with?"

I think roughly half their volumes are now being exported around the world and selling into high, mid and even ultra high tier phones across many countries today. So I think that the biggest thing that's changed me over the 5- or 6-year period you're referring to is how much like their phones are becoming like the true flagships of the world, implementing the latest features and sometimes ahead of the bigger guys, if you will because they're fast, they've got a portfolio that turns over, they're shipping all over the world. 
So adopting our new highly integrated things like 5G DRx modules like the dual connect modules and a lot of what we're doing in the antenna systems, I mean that's -- they're early movers in that new technology. And I think that's -- again, we're very, very pleased to be working with these guys."

So I think there's been a lot of smart people out there that have forecasted this thing that's going to go on for years, some say quarters. And I think it's not in our place to forecast this. 
What I can tell you is today, we are clearly capacity constrained on demand. James pointed out, we're adding capacity. Our suppliers are adding capacity. And we'll have to see how some of these great products that we support in both IDP and mobile continue to sell. Mark also commented about the global situation and what's going on and how the world recovers. And as it spikes with what's dealing with the virus, we've got to factor all those things in. And for me to sit here and give you a specific date, I think, would not be smart on our part. But what I do feel good about is the progress we are making and the demand just continues to grow.

We're thrilled with the June quarter the start to the year, $276 million of free cash, and we actually deployed $467 million. So I'd say, very strong deployment out of the gate. If you look at last 12 months, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash. We deployed about 80% of that, of which 3/4 of that was on repurchase. 
Now keep in mind, beginning of the year last year was everyone was hunker down at COVID. so I think 80% is pretty good, all things considered. And then the last 8 quarters, we've generated $2 billion of free cash. We've actually deployed $2.1 billion, and 60% of that was repurchased, about 40% -- while 40% was acquisitions. Now we just got out of the quarter where we -- the ninth quarter was active semi. So if you included that, we actually had deployment of about 50% acquisition, 50% repurchase. 
So I think we're going to -- the whole management team is focused on long-term free cash flow generation. So we believe we're going to continue to grow free cash flow. We think we will this year. Our priorities, organic investment, continue to have a technology lead. We've got build the capacity we need for the markets that we feel confident about. And then we look at inorganic opportunities where it makes sense. And we've been fairly active. 
Of the $1.2 billion that we spent on acquisitions in the last 9 quarters, we're really excited about the markets that we have exposure to. We think that we've brought on over $4 billion of TAM with that, that's conservative, and that's excluding Bio. And then several years out, we would see the TAM being north of $10 billion for what we bought. And again, that's excluding Bio, which is an exciting completely new market for Qorvo. So I think we'll continue to look at things that make sense for Qorvo on markets, customers, technology differentiation, financials, of course, and then as we know culture matters."

I would say that, yes, this has been a very difficult period this past year, 1.5 years to forecast. And the market's tightened up quickly. And of course, there's a lot of operational considerations. So I think you've got to factor some of that in that, that it's been difficult to forecast. You tend to in periods like this be a bit more conservative or more cognizant of the risks, I should say. 
But the other thing is we're just -- the improvements that we're making, we had great expectations and we're doing even better. And it's just emboiling us to do more of the same. Our operating leverage, which is kind of one of your points, does slip as we look out to the December quarter and March quarter. But you've also got to consider that, that's on very difficult comps the prior year. And at the time, when we were putting up those numbers, we said that it really showcases what the business could do, but we guided down. So -- and we did come down some, as you know, as you see here.

And it took a few years to get legs under the ore. But that technology advantage and this wide suite of technologies to serve customers' problems is foundational to the rest of it. And we continue to maintain that lead. And then that gives us the opportunity to make good calls on where to play, where to compete, where the customers are going to value us most. 
So we've been very active in portfolio management. Yes, we've driven productivity, and we've talked about that over the years, the wafer size expansion, the die shrinks, the myriad of other productivity programs, not only in the factories, but in R&D and other areas. And then we've been very mindful about capital spend. Our CapEx as a percent of sales was almost 20% at one point. We've driven that down to mid-single digits, expect it to stay around there. And hence, the -- as 5G hit our factories of have gotten loaded, we're getting great fixed cost absorption costs are in control.

First, the Qorvo team delivered an exceptional June quarter. Revenue, gross margin and EPS were each above guidance. Customer demand during the quarter was broad-based and included recently released product categories including 5G diversity receive modules, MEMS-based touch sensors and WiFi 6E FEMs to name a few. Our R&D teams are relentlessly advancing technologies that enable more complete, integrated solutions and increase our differentiation. We are partnering with leading customers, serving them where we are most valued and introducing new products and technologies that expand our addressable markets. We are pleased with ongoing design activity. We are locking in wins and we expect the demand environment to remain robust. In the smartphone market, 5G devices are adopting new architectures and adding functionality that enhance performance and create new challenges related to current consumption, board space and handset design resources. 
To address these challenges, handset manufacturers are selecting more highly integrated solutions that delivers superior performance. For Qorvo, the content opportunity in a 5G device increases by $5 to $7 when compared to a 4G device. We expect handset units to grow 5% to 10% this year with 5G doubling to around 550 million units. In 2025, 5G units are expected to be approximately 80% of total units. In other connectivity markets, new applications are proliferating, supported by generation over generation advancements in WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Thread, ultra-wideband and other wireless protocols. In a growing number of applications, multiple wireless standards coexist and operate concurrently. As an example, one of the largest smart home providers recently integrated numerous low-power wireless protocols into its distributed WiFi 6 router, creating infrastructure for seamless whole home operability. We expect this integration trend to continue.  
Our expertise in areas including product design, software support and system solutions enable us to simplify our customers' product development efforts while significantly enhancing the end-user experience. Outside of connectivity markets, the expanding opportunities are driven by a diverse set of underlying upgrade cycles. Brushless DC motors are replacing larger, less efficient conventional DC motors. Solid-state drives are replacing slower and less reliable hard disk drives, and touch sensor solutions are replacing less functional traditional buttons. We also expect RF-based biotechnology testing will enable central lab performance at the point of care. We expect our first commercial orders for our omni test platform by the end of the year.  
Turning to the June quarterly highlights. In 5G handsets, customer demand for highly integrated modules is expanding. During the quarter, we launched our next-generation complete main path solution, which includes low-band, mid-high band and ultra-high band modules, offering higher output power and enhanced MIMO support for upcoming 5G phones. For the diversity path, we began sampling our first 5G DRx, a sub-6 ultra-high band placement, offering best-in-class receive sensitivity. These main path and diversity path solutions integrate filtering and amplifiers that were formally discrete, helping our customers to save board space, improve device performance and accelerate product development efforts. Also during the quarter, we announced the interoperability of our family of ultra-wideband products with Apple's U1 chip and the nearby interaction protocol. 
Qorvo's ultra-wideband solutions provide a superior level of accuracy, reliability, latency and security when compared to traditional technologies like WiFi, BLE and NFC. In addition to remote access to our cars and homes, ultra-wideband will enable new applications in the connected home, indoor navigation, contactless payment, factory automation and other use cases. With more in-house software capability from our recent 7Hugs acquisition, we now offer a complete solution, and we're working with customers on products combining our ultra-wideband hardware with our latest software release, shortening their time to market. We see a growing set of applications for our ultra-wideband solutions and customer design activity is accelerating. In WiFi for handsets, we secured new reference design engagements with our WiFi 6E FEMs. 
These chip-on-board FEMs reduce insertion loss and enhance handset design flexibility versus system-in-a-package solutions by enabling placement closer to the antenna. Leading Android manufacturers are moving from system-in-a-package placements to best-in-class RF solutions. And Qorvo is winning on the strength of our product design, performance and customer support. In automotive, we achieved record revenue, up more than 80% year-over-year in support of automotive OEMs in the U.S., Europe and in Asia. Growth was driven primarily by the increased demand and expanding connectivity requirements for WiFi, V2X, LTE and 5G. Content growth was also included our touch sensor solutions, which automotive OEMs are using to enable smart interiors. This is a new growth category for Qorvo, and we have secured design wins in support of multiple automotive customers. 
To enhance the functionality of our touch sensor solutions and foster new use cases, we've integrated infrared capabilities, a milestone achievement for our Sensor team. For the smart home, we partnered with a leading supplier of home mesh networks to introduce the first WiFi 6 router with integrated BLE, Thread and ZigBee multiprotocol operation. This leveraged our ConcurrentConnect technology. We also secured a BAW filter design win with a leading supplier of high-end audio speakers to support the pairing of Bluetooth low energy and WiFi 6. As a member of the Connectivity Standards Alliance and an early participant in the upcoming matter connectivity standard, Qorvo stands to benefit as multi-protocol, seamless interoperability drives IoT adoption and growth. 
In power management, we released a 40-volt motor control solution that supports the ongoing transition to higher voltage battery power tools. Demand for our motor control and power management products has been very strong, driving growth in applications from appliances and battery-power tools to enterprise compute laptops and gaming. We are seeing demand for brushless DC motors expand into lower-cost power tools and smaller appliances, given the advantages in efficiency, size and reliability. We are also leveraging the configurability of our power management solutions to address new applications in defense and other markets. In infrastructure, we increased shipments to multiple OEMs in support of 5G sub-6 gigahertz, massive MIMO and macro deployments in the U.S., Japan, Korea and Canada. 
We also achieved initial design wins supporting a massive MIMO deployment in India, and we secured BAW filter design wins for 3.5 gigahertz and 4.9 gigahertz 5G small cells with a major China-based OEM. New product launches, including GaN integrated PA modules for massive MIMO systems and a family of high-efficiency power amplifiers for 5G small cells serving densely populated areas. Across our markets, there are strong secular tailwinds. Connectivity is proliferating and complexity is increasing, which is expanding our growth opportunities. We supply best-in-class products. And our investments in new product areas and differentiated technologies are extending our technology leadership and broadening our reach. As our June results and September guidance demonstrate, end market demand is broad-based and robust, and our outlook is strong.  
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal year 2022 first quarter was $1.110 billion, $30 million above the midpoint of our guidance and $323 million, or 41%, higher than last year. Mobile Products revenue of $836 million w",744,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal year 2022 first quarter was $1.110 billion, $30 million above the midpoint of our guidance and $323 million, or 41%, higher than last year. Mobile Products revenue of $836 million was up 79% year-over-year on the growth of higher content 5G smartphones. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of $274 million was down year-over-year due to especially strong infrastructure demand during the June 2020 quarter, but the segment was up sequentially as WiFi and programmable power management growth continued and infrastructure growth resumed. Non-GAAP gross margin was 52.5% and above our guidance on more favorable mix and pricing, improved manufacturing yields and lower inventory charges. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were $216 million or 19.4% of sales and in line with expectations. Sequential and year-over-year increases in OpEx were driven by technology and product development expenses associated with key organic growth programs and recent acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income in the June quarter was $367 million and 33.1% of sales. This was the third consecutive quarter of operating margin over 33%. Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter was $323 million, and diluted earnings per share of $2.83 was $0.38 above the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was over $341 million and CapEx was $65 million consistent with the level of spend we've discussed previously to support our outlook. Free cash flow was $276 million, and we repurchased $300 million of shares. 
The first quarter share repurchase was the largest dollar amount since an ASR in the March quarter of 2016. Since the company's formation and through the June quarter, we have repurchased $3.7 billion of shares at an average price of approximately $71. On the balance sheet, cash decreased to $1.2 billion following the close of our next input acquisition and the share repurchases. That remained unchanged at approximately $1.7 billion. Our leverage remains low. Our revolver is untapped, and we have no material near-term maturities. Yesterday, Fitch initiated a credit rating on Qorvo at BBB+. This, along with S&P's upgrade of Qorvo to investment grade in April, highlights the quality of Qorvo's business, the strength and durability of our cash flows and the financial discipline we've maintained.  
Now turning to the current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.235 billion and $1.265 billion; non-GAAP gross margin between 52% and 52.5%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.24 at the midpoint of guidance. Our September quarter revenue outlook reflects sustained and broad-based customer demand, driven by multiyear technology upgrade cycles. Qorvo revenue of $1.250 billion at the midpoint is up 13% sequentially, 18% year-over-year and approximately 27% year-over-year adjusting for last year's 14-week quarter. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year, and the September quarter last year was a 14-week quarter versus this fiscal year's more typical 13-week quarter. We forecast mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $985 million at the midpoint or up 31% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. 
In IDP, we project revenue to decline slightly to approximately $265 million in the current quarter on defense program timing and continued supply constraints. We expect IDP sequential and year-over-year growth to return in the December quarter. Our September quarter gross margin guide of 52.25% at the midpoint is 55 basis points higher than last year's second quarter and reflects our ongoing portfolio management and sustained strong operating performance. In the second half of the fiscal year, we currently expect gross margins to remain around 52%, resulting in full year gross margin above 52%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the September quarter to approximately $233 million on added labor and other development expenses associated with recent acquisitions and key growth programs. At the midpoint of our September quarter guidance, operating margin is forecasted to remain over 33% for the fourth consecutive quarter. 
We now project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 9%. Capital expenditures are projected to increase to around $75 million in the September quarter as we work to intersect demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. We are off to a strong start in fiscal '22, and we are well positioned to continue delivering premium technology to an expanding set of customers in 5G, WiFi, IoT, defense, power management and other growth markets.  
Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And really, a lot of the activity in next-generation 5G phones is around antenna management. So that part of our business, which has been strong for some time continues to see a lot of design interest and customers asking us to even step up and take maybe a larger role in terms of determining the antenna control, the interfaces, the tuning and the antenna flexing and so forth in and out of the antenna. So really, as you're looking to build the next generation of 5G handsets, we're just real pleased with the way our portfolio is lining up to the key challenges that our customers are having."

So I think that speaks to the quality of the rest of the business. Yes, the June quarter, another strong beat and things are just going really well. I would say that a combination of the environment we're in which makes -- can be challenging in the forecast, but also just our improvements are outrunning even our own high expectations. So we're doing -- the org is operating very well, and we're in the right places, and that's paying off. As it relates to the June beat, we did have the higher volumes, and that was favorable. It skewed favorable on the mix, those higher volumes relative to the guide. We're still supply constrained, so that allows us some tactical opportunities, either to types of products and price. And then, again, we're just operating exceptionally well. 
The product test yields are better than expected.  Manufacturing costs are in control. We've got good utilization. So the fixed cost absorption is predictable or better than expected. And then we had other inventory charges, which were lower than expected. So again, really pleased with the quarter. Now we are guiding down a bit. We're still going to be up 55 basis points year-over-year. Some of that is -- we just believe that some of the price effects will begin to moderate a bit. The inventory charges we expect to be a bit more normal. But I think it's hugely important to keep in mind that we're stabilizing around 52%. And structurally, this is a better business than it was years ago. And that's -- so it's sustainable.  It's been driven by a number of efforts on dimensions we've laid out before. We are definitively a leader across a number of technologies, have very broad portfolio, gives us flexibility in the products and the opportunities we pursue. 
We've actively managed the portfolio. We pick the right products. We've got broad customer exposure and pick the place where they're going to evaluate the most. You've always done a terrific job on productivity and the culture has matured here around cost savings and just getting more done with less and getting it done more efficiently, which benefits customers and all, and those are ongoing. And it's allowing us to manage risk better, which I think has proven in this last 1.5 years. And that we're being very disciplined about our capital spend as we are picking up spend but it's to serve what we believe is a very clear and compelling outlook."

Mark mentioned that supply constraints, the team is managing the complexity of the business with the constraints that are out there that all of you know about.

But right now, we're not seeing that. We're still in a supply-constrained environment. We do, as I mentioned, see IDP growth resuming in the third quarter sequentially. But the business will still be less than $300 million in the December quarter. That would imply then that mobile is down a little bit sequentially. And the fourth quarter is just too early at this point to really call definitively. We think that IDP will be over $300 million in the fourth quarter, so continuing to grow through the year and then mobile be down a bit seasonally. We do, just our gross margins to be clear, see those sort of leveling out around 52% in the back half for a total year of a little over 52%."

So they've got a broad and growing portfolio of really leading-edge technology handsets and doing very well in Europe, for example, and other places. So it's a vibrant design opportunity for us using leading-edge technologies, continuing to stick with the roadmap around highly integrated products that we're supporting and very much adopting our antenna control solutions and so forth. So the environment for design in terms of relationships and so forth is fantastic. The product portfolio turns over fairly often, which gives lots of opportunities for new functions and new integration levels and features and so forth, which is always great for us. 
So in terms of recent slowness in the sell-through, you see some noise in the data. It's still great sell-through. The 5G phones are on track this year. The vast majority of what we're shipping to our Chinese customers today is 5G components and, of course, the sell-in into China domestic as well as vastly 5G already.

And so I think as we go into our Q3 and Q4, those start to get better. We are bringing on internal capacity that really does start to help us as we go into the end of the calendar year. And sort of the same note on our supply constraints from outside, those start to get significantly better as we go into our fourth quarter with some improvement in the December quarter as well. 
So as Mark talked about, I think that really allows us to move back into starting to grow in Q3 and Q4 for IDP. Now there's a couple of other things that are going to help us get back into growth as we enter the back half of the year. Part of that is we get beyond a really, really high growth that we had last year in the first 2 quarters with base station. And so that will be part of what allows us to get into that growth area. But also, we see significant strength and pretty good visibility as we go in the back half in power management and in our WiFi business. And the base station business continues to sort of distribute or have a recovery."

When you merge with -- when TriQuint and RF Micro moved way back when we were on the road, you were talking about not really wanting to put a tiger team on the largest customer at the point because you didn't want to get the revenue concentration. At that point, if you took a snapshot of what happened back then, you were spread around 20% for each of the major groups, including IDP, which you seem to be happy, but now it seems like we're kind of returning back to that kind of a model with multiple 10% customers. What I'm wondering is with the push of 5G into lower-cost phones, which is capturing more of the discrete market, is that going to change? Because if you look at China as a total, it must be a very large portion of your total revenue? Or are you counting in 10%?

And we'll have to see how some of these great products that we support in both IDP and mobile continue to sell.

We're thrilled with the June quarter the start to the year, $276 million of free cash, and we actually deployed $467 million. So I'd say, very strong deployment out of the gate. If you look at last 12 months, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash. We deployed about 80% of that, of which 3/4 of that was on repurchase. Now keep in mind, beginning of the year last year was -- everyone was hunkered down at COVID. So I think 80% is pretty good, all things considered. And then the last 8 quarters, we've generated $2 billion of free cash. We've actually deployed $2.1 billion, and 60% of that was repurchased, about 40% -- while 40% was acquisitions. Now we just got out of the quarter where we -- the ninth quarter was active semi. So if you included that, we actually had deployment of about 50% acquisition, 50% repurchase. 
So I think we're going to -- the whole management team is focused on long-term free cash flow generation. So we believe we're going to continue to grow free cash flow. We think we will this year. Our priorities, organic investment, continue to have a technology lead. We've got build the capacity we need for the markets that we feel confident about. And then we look at inorganic opportunities where it makes sense. And we've been fairly active. Of the $1.2 billion that we spent on acquisitions in the last 9 quarters, we're really excited about the markets that we have exposure to. We think that we've brought on over $4 billion of TAM with that, that's conservative, and that's excluding Bio. And then several years out, we would see the TAM being north of $10 billion for what we bought. And again, that's excluding Bio, which is an exciting completely new market for Qorvo.

In M",1085,"Thank you, Doug, and welcome, everyone, to our call. The Qorvo team delivered an exceptional September quarter with revenue and EPS at all-time highs. Strength during the quarter was broad-based across customers and supported by new product launches. In Mobile Products, the multiyear migration of 5G continues to drive RF content and integration trends. What began in top-tier flagship phones is now playing out in the mass market, where the RF content increase is greater on a percent basis than in flagship devices. Qorvo enjoys broad exposure to mass market designs at customers like Honor, OPPO, Pixel, Samsung, Vivo and Xiaomi as a preferred supplier with leading products and a robust technology road map, Qorvo is well positioned as 5G devices and Android ecosystem contribute increasingly to the growth in the RF TAM. 
In other connectivity markets, ultra wideband adoption in smartphones is serving as the infrastructure for a growing ecosystem of ultra-wideband-enabled devices. The opportunity set spans mobile, automotive and IoT markets, creating a strong foundation for growth over the coming years. In WiFi, the adoption of WiFi 6E and the performance limitations of smaller node CMOS-integrated PAs are driving the migration to chip onboard FEMs and iFEMs like ours.  
In WiFi and other markets, Qorvo's products and technologies are at the forefront of multiyear upgrade cycles, enabling new ecosystems and use cases and transforming the user experience. 
Now let's look at some of the quarterly highlights in our end markets, starting with mobile. For [ Guru ], we commenced shipments of mid-high and ultrahigh band PADs, antenna tuners and multiple connectivity solutions to support the ramp of their recently announced Pixel 6 for an upcoming Korea-based 5G mass market smartphone platform, we received the first production orders for our mid-high and ultrahigh band PADs, WiFi FEMs and multiple high-performance discrete solutions. 
In mobile WiFi, we secured a WiFi 6 FEM design wins with multiple top-tier smartphone OEMs and began sampling WiFi 7 FEMs enabling higher data rates and improved performance. In Ultra-Wideband, Qorvo is advancing technologies for a diverse ecosystem of proximity aware connected devices. We secured an ultra wideband design win to enable real-time device tracking and other location-aware applications in home networks, and we were selected to supply ultra-wideband solutions for enterprise access points as well. 
We also expanded our engagement with a leading provider of consumer IoT products across a broad set of connected home devices, including smart speakers, point control fans and air conditioners. In automotive manufacturing, Qorvo was selected to supply ultra-wideband and Zigbee solutions with ConcurrentConnect technology to an automaker in Korea, streamlining automation and manufacturing. In other connectivity markets, we began sampling a WiFi 6 iFEM covering 5.2 gigahertz and 5.6 gigahertz and featuring an integrated BAW filter. Qorvo's 5 gigahertz iFEMs enable higher capacity and improved efficiency and reduced form factor. 
In broadband, we begin sampling a triple output DOCSIS 3.1 amplifier module supporting network upgrades for major cable operators in the U.S. and in Europe. In infrastructure, design win activity was strong across OEMs, including small cells and base stations. Wins included all of the RF transmit and receive path content, including BAW filters for 5G small cells at a major base station OEM. We see infrastructure markets picking up in 2022 with Qorvo SAM growing year-over-year. The SAM for Qorvo outside of China will post significant growth next year and support a strong double-digit CAGR through 2025. 
In Aerospace and Defense, we expanded our product portfolio with an industry-leading 125-watt S-band power amplifier module and a 1.8-kilowatt L-band radar pallet for commercial and defense radar applications. In RF-based biotechnology testing, we received our first commercial orders and commenced shipments of our Omnia antigen test platform. During the quarter, the NIH [ Radix ] Variant Task Force conducted an external study that demonstrated the performance of our Omnia antigen test platform in effectively detecting COVID variants including the Delta variant. 
Although this is a new market for us, we believe we bring a novel technology that offers unique and real value as the world moves to more testing protocols, including for flu AB and other seasonal pathogens. Our platform offers a unique combination of accuracy and speed at the point of care with improved process flow, including real-time wireless delivery of results. 
We have seen its benefits in our own operations as part of our protocol for our own internal testing. After the quarter closed, Qorvo acquired United Silicon Carbide, an innovator in silicon carbide power devices and a pioneer in silicon carbide JFETs. The combination will further differentiate Qorvo's power portfolio enabling more highly integrated power device solutions and expand our addressable market to include higher voltage applications that demand maximum power efficiency such as electric vehicles, charging stations and renewable energy systems. We welcome [ Chris Sri ] and his team and look forward to helping them accelerate the growth in their business. 
For Qorvo, our ability to deliver more power more efficiently and using less current helped put us at the center of the digital transformation. We are eager to expand these competencies as global markets move to electrification and renewable energy. 
Qorvo's technology portfolio is best in class. Our product position is strong. Our end market exposure is expanding, and we are operating very well. Yes, we are seeing constraints, and we are working closely with our customers and our partners. Mark will have more comments about the operating environment, and we look forward to discussions during your question and answers. 
Big picture, we see the industry working through this as it always has. For Qorvo, we see a business with unique competencies and expanding set of growth drivers, and we expect a continuation of double-digit growth over several years. 
Before handing the call over to Mark, I'm pleased to welcome Philip Chesley as President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products Group. Philip has a proven track record, growing global semiconductor businesses with experience in RF, power, data communications, automotive, industrial, aerospace and defense. We are very pleased Philip has joined Qorvo to lead our IDP team. 
I also want to thank James Klein. Since the formation of Qorvo, James and the team have more than doubled IDP revenue while creating a recognized industry leader. We thank James for his many contributions to Qorvo and wish him the very best. James will remain with us through November to help ensure a smooth transition with the change in the IDP leadership. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

In the September quarter, Qorvo delivered the strongest quarterly revenue and earnings in the company's history. Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal year 20,222nd quarter was $1.255 billion, $5 million above the midpo",1488,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. In the September quarter, Qorvo delivered the strongest quarterly revenue and earnings in the company's history. Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal year 20,222nd quarter was $1.255 billion, $5 million above the midpoint of our guidance and $195 million or 18% higher than last year's September quarter. When comparing September quarter numbers, recall that our fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year, and the September quarter last year was a 14-week quarter versus this fiscal year's more typical 13-week quarter. 
Mobile Products revenue of $996 million was up 32% year-over-year on the continued growth of higher content 5G smartphones. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of [ $260 million ] was slightly below expectations due to reduced supply from outsourced assembly and test operations in Malaysia and elsewhere. As expected, IDP was down year-over-year due primarily to last year's strong infrastructure build-out and the 14-week quarter. We expect IDP to return to year-over-year growth in the December quarter and growth to accelerate in the March quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross margin in the September quarter was 52.4%, above the midpoint of our guidance despite supply chain disruptions that worsened through the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were less than expected at $222 million or 17.7% of sales. The sequential and year-over-year increases in OpEx were driven by technology and product development expenses associated with key growth programs and recent acquisitions. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the September quarter was $435 million and 34.7% of sales. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of operating margin over 33%. Non-GAAP net income in the second quarter was $385 million, and diluted earnings per share of $3.42 was $0.18 above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $245 million. Our working capital includes an increase in payables associated with a long-term silicon supply agreement. The largest of these [indiscernible] is a deposit, which we expect to recoup by the end of the agreement in calendar '25. This agreement is structured -- this agreement is a structured way to advance our differentiated technology position and simplify our long-term planning. Furthermore, it's only one of a number of examples whereby Qorvo is building longer-term and more collaborative partnerships to provide our customers supply assurance and meet their product and technology needs. 
Concurrently, our customer relationships are broadening and strengthening allowing us to invest with more certainty. As we have indicated previously, the challenges the industry is currently experiencing are driving more constructive and longer-term relationships that we see enhancing the overall durability and value of the business. 
Capital expenditures in the September quarter were $47 million, lower than expected on spend timing and an earlier-than-expected reimbursement for a portion of our government-funded work on advanced packaging. Free cash flow was $198 million, and we repurchased $223 million of shares. Over the last 2 quarters, we've purchased $523 million of shares, which was 110% of our free cash flow. We continue to repurchase shares as our outlook is positive. Our free cash flow and ability to sustain investment in technology and growth is strong and our leverage remains low. 
On the balance sheet, cash and debt remained largely unchanged from the prior quarter at $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. In the December quarter, our cash is projected to decline following payments associated with the previously mentioned agreement and with our acquisition of United Silicon Carbide. 
Now turning to our current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.09 billion and $1.12 billion, non-GAAP gross margin between 52% and 52.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75 at the midpoint of our guidance. Our December quarter revenue outlook reflects broad-based challenges in supply impacting mobile and IDP and near-term weakness in demand, principally in Asia. 
Starting with supply, we have several areas of constraint. Our external supply chain is still recovering from disruptions in September, including shutdowns in Southeast Asia. Beyond that, select materials, products and production capacity remain tight. These are industry-wide issues affecting all suppliers, and our customers are challenged in producing matched sets for products. 
For example, in smartphones, even where channel inventory for certain parts is healthy, customers lack silicon chips to produce phones. This, in turn, creates tech changes in demand that add to constraints on our own production as we work to adjust mix. Mix changes are part of our business, but in a normal environment, Qorvo can move swiftly to respond and capture demand. These supply-driven gaps are making recent demand softness in select areas such as our Asia smartphone customers harder to quantify. We see the industry working through this situation with some supply effects beginning to moderate this quarter and supply/demand alignment improving more broadly through the March quarter. 
Given these supply and demand effects, we now see 5G smartphone volumes coming in below $550 million in calendar '21. Qorvo's December forecasted revenue of $1.105 billion at the midpoint is down 12% sequentially and up slightly year-over-year. We forecast mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $830 million at the midpoint, down 17% sequentially and flat year-over-year. In the March quarter, we expect mobile to be up slightly sequentially as the typical seasonal decline is offset by improved supply and demand. 
In IDP, we project revenue to increase in the December quarter to $275 million and the segment to return to year-over-year growth. We expect IEP to be over $300 million in the March quarter. 
Our December quarter gross margin guide of 52.25% at the midpoint is up versus the view we provided last quarter despite a more challenging supply-demand environment than expected. We see our technology and product mix and operating and capital efficiency yielding a gross margin above 52% for the fiscal year. We expect the March quarter to be around 52%. We project non-GAAP operating expenses to increase slightly in the December quarter to approximately $224 million reflecting higher investments in core technologies and expanding capabilities in new businesses, including the addition of the United Silicon Carbide team. We now project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be between 8.5% and 9%. 
Capital expenditures are projected to exceed $70 million in the December quarter as we work to intersect demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. Currently, we are supply constrained and project to remain so through our fiscal year-end. We continue to expand BAW and gaps capacity as well as biosensor production capacity to support our growth projections for fiscal 2023. 
In summary, we expect year-over-year revenue growth in the December quarter, though less than we had expected previously. The current supply challenges and near-term demand weaknesses -- weakness are acute but more temporary than durable. We expect supply effects to moderate starting this quarter and improved supply-demand alignment early next calendar year. 
For full fiscal year '22, we expect revenue growth over 15%, gross margin over 52 -- excuse me, we expect revenue growth over 15% and gross margin over 52% and operating margin of approximately 33%. Looking beyond this fiscal year, we expect double-digit growth to continue as Qorvo's premium technology, product portfolio and operating capability support 5G, WiFi, IoT, defense, power and other growth markets. 
Overall, we are investing to grow mobile and IP at or above market. Looking at our business by end markets instead of operating segments helps highlight the strength of our portfolio and market position. On advanced cellular RF front ends for smartphones, Qorvo's technology and product breadth is world class. We expect this part of Qorvo's business near $3.3 billion this fiscal year to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit growth as increasing RF complexity and integration trends support years of content expansion. 
Next, looking at other connectivity beyond cellular solutions for smartphones. Qorvo enjoys exposure across multiple wireless protocols and serves industrial automation, connected home, automotive and other high-growth IoT markets. This fiscal year, connectivity solutions spread across our mobile and IDP segments combined to approximately $700 million and can grow in the strong double digits. 
Finally, defense, infrastructure and power solutions support multiple long-term secular growth drivers. These include the multiyear build-out of 5G infrastructure, increasing semiconductor spend in defense and worldwide demand for power semis driven by mega trends like electrification. We expect to sustain long-term double-digit growth in this business from a base of over $600 million this fiscal year. 
Our December quarter is off what we expected previously but still guided up year-over-year as is our view of the March quarter. We expect the business to strengthen through the second half of our fiscal year and contribute to a record full year performance, including earnings growth over 20%. Longer term, the outlook is bright. Qorvo is exceptionally well positioned to deliver earnings and free cash flow growth, serving the large and growing need for more efficient power and greater connectivity.

So Toshiya, we decreased our December number about $150 million, as you can see, and about $135 million of that was in mobile, where we went from roughly [ 9 65 to 8 30 ] in the December quarter. The balance of the decrease was IDP. IDP is the most straightforward. It's all supply in IDP. So just keep that in mind. 
Of the $135 million roughly in mobile, as we characterize supply constraints, which is our suppliers not having supply for us, our customers not having the chipsets, thus not able to build their product and use our product, and then finally, our own internal constraints, we see up to $100 million that we would characterize as supply related of that $135 million. 
The balance, so $35 million we would view as net demand. Some demand is up and we're able to intersect that. But some demand is clearly down, and I think that's well publicized, particularly in parts of Asia. So broad brush strokes were 3 quarters or less down on supply in mobile and 1 quarter or more related to demand. Now if you add in IDP, which is all supply, then that proportion is stronger. So that's our view, Toshiya."

But it's never easy, but admittedly, it's more difficult than usual environment right now. I do think it's important with this adjustment to step back, not lose sight of how good a business we've got. For this fiscal year, we called down, but that was -- and we missed, but there was an aged consensus that, clearly, the supply environment worsened through the quarter, particularly in mid- to late September and then these publicized weakness and demand emerged.  
we see things improving. We think December is as bad as it gets for us, and we see improving in March and broadly. We had given a guidance range of 15% to 20%. And with this 2.5% adjustment for the year, we're down at the lower end of that range. So we're still in the range that we had provided. 
Yes. Listen, our gross margin outlook is intact around 52%. OpEx is in control, and we're investing in the future of the business. That's both traditional parts of the business and newer parts of the business. And in the end, we're taking EPS roughly [ a dime ] above $12 to roughly [ a dime ] below $12. And so there is a bit of a correction there, but I would say it's the right thing for us to do. 
If we look into next year and beyond, we're just -- feel great about our position. Premium technology and products, serving attractive end markets growing double digits, and we expect to grow double digits. We're operating well, sustained margins over 52%, expanding operating margins. So a lot of talk about the positive beyond this quarter."

But I will tell you that I'm really pleased with the progress we've made. We've had wins, significant wins outside of China in that MIMO space. We begin getting out our first integrated modules or what we call pans power and fire modules and really pleased with those wins and the performance that we have there. 
If you do look at our -- the core -- the IDP business minus the infrastructure side, this year, we'll grow north of 20%. And so it really is the story for us. It is just the lack of deployments going on in China. 
If you look at that base station business outside of China, it's actually growing way up over 30%. So it really is a story for us about slowdown in China is the IDP story. The rest of the business is doing very, very well. 
And on your comment about my retirement, I want to say a few words. First of all, I really wanted to thank the Qorvo team for all the work over this past decade or so. They've done just an absolutely tremendous job and we've been able to accomplish a tremendous amount. 
I also want to thank Bob for all of his leadership in building Qorvo. I have a lot of pride associated with the company that we've built. And I want to thank Bob for I guess, guiding us through that, maybe dragging us. But I want to thank you very much. 
And third, I want to thank Philip for accepting the challenge to lead the IDP team. I'm really confident that he's going to do a great job in the future with the organization. So I want to thank him for joining us."

You're adding 5 to 7 to that. That's a good growth. But as you go down into the mid-tier, you're adding that 5 to 7 on top of maybe $13 or $10 in some cases, right? So I think that was like the interesting kind of content growth story as you go down. 
Some of the fundamental RF challenges in 5G that drive a lot of complexity around filtering and multiband, multimode operation, received diversity requirements going up, [ transplant ] diversity coming and so forth. All of that are sort of independent of tier because they're not -- a lot of them aren't driven specifically by consumer features and things that you see. It's driven just as much more sort of network infrastructure efficiency in economies driven by the provider -- the carriers.

The Qorvo team delivered an exceptional September quarter with revenue and EPS at all-time highs. Strength during the quarter was broad-based across customers and supported by new product launches. In M",1078,"Thank you, Doug, and welcome, everyone, to our call. The Qorvo team delivered an exceptional September quarter with revenue and EPS at all-time highs. Strength during the quarter was broad-based across customers and supported by new product launches. In Mobile Products, the multiyear migration of 5G continues to drive RF content and integration trends. What began in top-tier flagship phones is now playing out in the mass market, where the RF content increase is greater on a percent basis than in flagship devices. Qorvo enjoys broad exposure to mass market designs to customers like Honor, Oppo, Pixel, Samsung, Vivo and Xiaomi. As a preferred supplier with leading products and a robust technology road map, Qorvo is well positioned as 5G devices and Android ecosystem contribute increasingly to the growth in the RF TAM. 
In other connectivity markets, ultra-wideband adoption in smartphones is serving as the infrastructure for a growing ecosystem of ultra-wideband-enabled devices. The opportunity set spans mobile, automotive and IoT markets, creating a strong foundation for growth over the coming years. 
In WiFi, the adoption of WiFi 6E and the performance limitations of smaller node CMOS-integrated PAs are driving the migration to chip onboard FEMs and iFEMs like ours.
In WiFi and other markets, Qorvo's products and technologies are at the forefront of multiyear upgrade cycles, enabling new ecosystems and use cases and transforming the user experience. 
Now let's look at some of the quarterly highlights in our end markets, starting with mobile. For Google, we commenced shipments of mid-high and ultrahigh band PADs, antenna tuners and multiple connectivity solutions to support the ramp of their recently announced Pixel 6. 
For an upcoming Korea-based 5G mass market smartphone platform, we received the first production orders for our mid-high and ultrahigh band PADs, WiFi FEMs and multiple high-performance discrete solutions. 
In mobile WiFi, we secured a WiFi 6 FEM design wins with multiple top-tier smartphone OEMs and began sampling WiFi 7 FEMs, enabling higher data rates and improved performance. In ultra-wideband, Qorvo is advancing technologies for a diverse ecosystem of proximity aware connected devices. We secured an ultra-wideband design win to enable real-time device tracking and other location-aware applications in home mesh networks, and we were selected to supply ultra-wideband solutions for enterprise access points as well. 
We also expanded our engagement with a leading provider of consumer IoT products across a broad set of connected home devices, including smart speakers, point control fans and air conditioners. In automotive manufacturing, Qorvo was selected to supply ultra-wideband and ZigBee solutions with ConcurrentConnect technology to an automaker in Korea, streamlining automation and manufacturing. 
In other connectivity markets, we began sampling a WiFi 6 iFEM covering 5.2 gigahertz and 5.6 gigahertz, and featuring an integrated BAW filter. Qorvo's 5 gigahertz iFEMs enable higher capacity and improved efficiency and reduced form factor. 
In broadband, we begin sampling a triple output DOCSIS 3.1 amplifier module supporting network upgrades for major cable operators in the U.S. and in Europe. 
In infrastructure, design win activity was strong across OEMs, including small cells and base stations. Wins included all of the RF transmit and receive path content, including BAW filters for 5G small cells at a major base station OEM. We see infrastructure markets picking up in 2022 with Qorvo's SAM growing year-over-year. The SAM for Qorvo outside of China will post significant growth next year and support a strong double-digit CAGR through 2025. 
In aerospace and defense, we expanded our product portfolio with an industry-leading 125 watt S-band power amplifier module and a 1.8 kilowatt L-band radar pallet for commercial and defense radar applications. In RF-based biotechnology testing, we received our first commercial orders and commenced shipments of our Omnia antigen test platform. 
During the quarter, the NIH RADx variant task force conducted an external study that demonstrated the performance of our Omnia antigen test platform in effectively detecting COVID variants, including the delta variant. 
Although this is a new market for us, we believe we bring a novel technology that offers unique and real value as the world moves to more testing protocols, including for flu A/B and other seasonal pathogens. Our platform offers a unique combination of accuracy and speed at the point-of-care with improved process flow, including real-time wireless delivery of results. 
We have seen its benefits in our own operations as part of our protocol for our own internal testing. After the quarter closed, Qorvo acquired United Silicon Carbide, an innovator in silicon carbide power devices and a pioneer in silicon carbide JFETs. The combination will further differentiate Qorvo's power portfolio, enabling more highly integrated power device solutions and expand our addressable market to include higher voltage applications that demand maximum power efficiency such as electric vehicles, charging stations and renewable energy systems. We welcome Chris Dries and his team and look forward to helping them accelerate the growth in their business. 
For Qorvo, our ability to deliver more power more efficiently and using less current helped put us at the center of the digital transformation. We are eager to expand these competencies as global markets move to electrification and renewable energy. 
Qorvo's technology portfolio is best in class. Our product position is strong. Our end market exposure is expanding, and we are operating very well. Yes, we are seeing constraints, and we are working closely with our customers and our partners. Mark will have more comments about the operating environment, and we look forward to discussions during your question and answers. 
Big picture, we see the industry working through this as it always has. For Qorvo, we see a business with unique competencies and expanding set of growth drivers, and we expect a continuation of double-digit growth over several years. 
Before handing the call over to Mark, I'm pleased to welcome Philip Chesley as President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products Group. Philip has a proven track record, growing global semiconductor businesses with experience in RF, power, data communications, automotive, industrial, aerospace and defense. We are very pleased Philip has joined Qorvo to lead our IDP team. 
I also want to thank James Klein. Since the formation of Qorvo, James and the team have more than doubled IDP revenue while creating a recognized industry leader. We thank James for his many contributions to Qorvo and wish him the very best. James will remain with us through November to help ensure a smooth transition with the change in the IDP leadership. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

In the September quarter, Qorvo delivered the strongest quarterly revenue and earnings in the company's history. Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal year 2022 second quarter was $1.255 billion, $5 million above the mi",1490,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. In the September quarter, Qorvo delivered the strongest quarterly revenue and earnings in the company's history. Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal year 2022 second quarter was $1.255 billion, $5 million above the midpoint of our guidance and $195 million or 18% higher than last year's September quarter. When comparing September quarter numbers, recall that our fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year, and the September quarter last year was a 14-week quarter versus this fiscal year's more typical 13-week quarter. 
Mobile Products revenue of $996 million was up 32% year-over-year on the continued growth of higher content 5G smartphones. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of [ $260 million ] was slightly below expectations due to reduced supply from outsourced assembly and test operations in Malaysia and elsewhere. As expected, IDP was down year-over-year due primarily to last year's strong infrastructure build-out and the 14-week quarter. We expect IDP to return to year-over-year growth in the December quarter and growth to accelerate in the March quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross margin in the September quarter was 52.4%, above the midpoint of our guidance despite supply chain disruptions that worsened through the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were less than expected at $222 million or 17.7% of sales. The sequential and year-over-year increases in OpEx were driven by technology and product development expenses associated with key growth programs and recent acquisitions. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the September quarter was $435 million and 34.7% of sales. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of operating margin over 33%. Non-GAAP net income in the second quarter was $385 million, and diluted earnings per share of $3.42 was $0.18 above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $245 million. Our working capital includes an increase in payables associated with a long-term silicon supply agreement. The largest of these PADs is a deposit, which we expect to recoup by the end of the agreement in calendar '25. This agreement is structured -- this agreement is a structured way to advance our differentiated technology position and simplify our long-term planning. Furthermore, it's only one of a number of examples whereby Qorvo is building longer-term and more collaborative partnerships to provide our customers supply assurance and meet their product and technology needs. 
Concurrently, our customer relationships are broadening and strengthening, allowing us to invest with more certainty. As we have indicated previously, the challenges the industry is currently experiencing are driving more constructive and longer-term relationships that we see enhancing the overall durability and value of the business. 
Capital expenditures in the September quarter were $47 million, lower than expected on spend timing and an earlier-than-expected reimbursement for a portion of our government-funded work on advanced packaging. Free cash flow was $198 million, and we repurchased $223 million of shares. Over the last 2 quarters, we've purchased $523 million of shares, which was 110% of our free cash flow. We continue to repurchase shares as our outlook is positive. Our free cash flow and ability to sustain investment in technology and growth is strong, and our leverage remains low. 
On the balance sheet, cash and debt remained largely unchanged from the prior quarter at $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. In the December quarter, our cash is projected to decline, following payments associated with the previously mentioned agreement and with our acquisition of United Silicon Carbide. 
Now turning to our current quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $1.09 billion and $1.12 billion, non-GAAP gross margin between 52% and 52.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75 at the midpoint of our guidance. Our December quarter revenue outlook reflects broad-based challenges in supply, impacting Mobile and IDP and near-term weakness in demand, principally in Asia. 
Starting with supply, we have several areas of constraint. Our external supply chain is still recovering from disruptions in September, including shutdowns in Southeast Asia. Beyond that, [ select ] materials, products and production capacity remain tight. These are industry-wide issues affecting all suppliers, and our customers are challenged in producing matched sets for products. 
For example, in smartphones, even where channel inventory for certain parts is healthy, customers lack silicon chips to produce phones. This, in turn, creates changes in demand that add to constraints on our own production as we work to adjust mix. Mix changes are part of our business, but in a normal environment, Qorvo can move swiftly to respond and capture demand. These supply-driven gaps are making recent demand softness in select areas, such as our Asia smartphone customers, harder to quantify. We see the industry working through this situation with some supply effects beginning to moderate this quarter and supply/demand alignment improving more broadly through the March quarter. 
Given these supply and demand effects, we now see 5G smartphone volumes coming in below $550 million in calendar '21. 
Qorvo's December forecasted revenue of $1.105 billion at the midpoint is down 12% sequentially and up slightly year-over-year. We forecast Mobile revenue in the current quarter to be approximately $830 million at the midpoint, down 17% sequentially and flat year-over-year. In the March quarter, we expect Mobile to be up slightly sequentially as the typical seasonal decline is offset by improved supply and demand. 
In IDP, we project revenue to increase in the December quarter to $275 million and the segment to return to year-over-year growth. We expect IDP to be over $300 million in the March quarter. 
Our December quarter gross margin guide of 52.25% at the midpoint is up versus the view we provided last quarter despite a more challenging supply/demand environment than expected. We see our technology and product mix and operating and capital efficiency yielding a gross margin above 52% for the fiscal year. We expect the March quarter to be around 52%. We project non-GAAP operating expenses to increase slightly in the December quarter to approximately $224 million, reflecting higher investments in core technologies and expanding capabilities in new businesses, including the addition of the United Silicon Carbide team. We now project our current quarter and full year non-GAAP tax rate to be between 8.5% and 9%. 
Capital expenditures are projected to exceed $70 million in the December quarter as we work to intersect demand and support long-term supply agreements with multiple customers. Currently, we are supply-constrained and project to remain so through our fiscal year-end. We continue to expand BAW and GaAs capacity as well as biosensor production capacity to support our growth projections for fiscal 2023. 
In summary, we expect year-over-year revenue growth in the December quarter, though less than we had expected previously. The current supply challenges and near-term demand weaknesses -- weakness are acute, but more temporary than durable. We expect supply effects to moderate starting this quarter and improved supply/demand alignment early next calendar year. 
For full fiscal year '22, we expect revenue growth over 15%, gross margin over 52% -- excuse me, we expect revenue growth over 15% and gross margin over 52% and operating margin of approximately 33%. Looking beyond this fiscal year, we expect double-digit growth to continue as Qorvo's premium technology, product portfolio and operating capability support 5G, WiFi, IoT, defense, power and other growth markets. 
Overall, we are investing to grow Mobile and IDP at or above market. Looking at our business by end markets instead of operating segments helps highlight the strength of our portfolio and market position. On advanced cellular RF front ends for smartphones, Qorvo's technology and product breadth is world class. We expect this part of Qorvo's business near $3.3 billion this fiscal year to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit growth as increasing RF complexity and integration trends support years of content expansion. 
Next, looking at other connectivity beyond cellular solutions for smartphones, qorvo enjoys exposure across multiple wireless protocols and serves industrial automation, connected home, automotive and other high-growth IoT markets. This fiscal year, connectivity solutions spread across our Mobile and IDP segments combined to approximately $700 million and can grow in the strong double digits. 
Finally, defense, infrastructure and power solutions support multiple long-term [indiscernible] growth drivers. These include the multiyear build-out of 5G infrastructure, increasing semiconductor spend in defense and worldwide demand for power semis driven by mega trends like electrification. We expect to sustain long-term double-digit growth in this business from a base of over $600 million this fiscal year. 
Our December quarter is off of what we expected previously, but still guided up year-over-year as is our view of the March quarter. We expect the business to strengthen through the second half of our fiscal year and contribute to a record full year performance, including earnings growth over 20%. Longer term, the outlook is bright. Qorvo is exceptionally well positioned to deliver earnings and free cash flow growth, serving the large and growing need for more efficient power and greater connectivity.

So Toshiya, we decreased our December number about $150 million, as you can see, and about $135 million of that was in Mobile, where we went from roughly [ 9 65 to 8 30 ] in the December quarter. The balance of the decrease was IDP. IDP is the most straightforward. It's all supply in IDP. So just keep that in mind. 
Of the $135 million roughly in Mobile, as we characterize supply constraints, which is our suppliers not having supply for us, our customers not having the chipsets, thus not able to build their product and use our product, and then finally, our own internal constraints, we see up to $100 million that we would characterize as supply related of that $135 million. 
The balance, so $35 million we would view as net demand. Some demand is up and we're able to intersect that. But some demand is clearly down, and I think that's well publicized, particularly in parts of Asia. So broad brush strokes were 3 quarters or less down on supply in Mobile and one quarter or more related to demand. Now if you add in IDP, which is all supply, then that proportion is stronger. So that's our view, Toshiya."

It's not perfect, but at least we have ranges of alignment and sort of volume bars, share windows and things like this that we can talk both to our customers and to our suppliers.

But it's never easy, but admittedly, it's more difficult than usual environment right now. I do think it's important with this adjustment to step back, not lose sight of how good a business we've got. For this fiscal year, we called down, but that was -- and we missed, but there was an aged consensus that, clearly, the supply environment worsened through the quarter, particularly in mid- to late September and then these publicized weakness and demand emerged. 
We see things improving. We think December is as bad as it gets for us, and we see improving in March and broadly. We had given a guidance range of 15% to 20%. And with this 2.5% adjustment for the year, we're down at the lower end of that range. So we're still in the range that we had provided. 
Yes. Listen, our gross margin outlook is intact around 52%. OpEx is in control, and we're investing in the future of the business. That's both traditional parts of the business and newer parts of the business. And in the end, we're taking EPS roughly a dime above $12 to roughly a dime below $12. And so there is a bit of a correction there, but I would say it's the right thing for us to do. 
If we look into next year and beyond, we're just -- feel great about our position. Premium technology and products, serving attractive end markets, growing double digits, and we expect to grow double digits. We're operating well, sustained margins over 52%, expanding operating margins. So a lot of talk about the positive beyond this quarter."

So I'm just curious, where do you see this going? What levers do you think you can pull or lever do you have for this new acquisition to get you into EVs because it isn't going to be cost. And given the size of the fab and the fact that they'll be fabbing on wafers, you came and get the 200-millimeter wafers, you're going to be facing a big issue in terms of scale too.

I mean the TAM that we see associated with the $1.6 billion or so acquisitions that we've done over the last several years. I'm including this recent $200 million plus on United Silicon Carbide. We see that TAM at about $5 billion. We see that TAM doubling to $10 billion or more over the next several years. So we expect these businesses to be material and enjoy that growth, which is significant. And that's not including Biotechnologies."

Looking at the RF content in -- as 5G proliferates down, we've said there's like a $5 to $7 increase from 4G Advanced Pro, for example, up to the 5G. And what we said previously is -- what's interesting is we see that $5 to $7 consistent as the phones go down. So on a high-tier phone, high-tier smartphone, you might be looking at $30 to $35 RF bomb. You're adding $5 to $7 to that. That's a good growth. But as you go down into the mid-tier, you're adding that $5 to $7 on top of maybe $13 or $10 in some cases, right? So I think that was like the interesting kind of content growth story as you go down. 
Some of the fundamental RF challenges in 5G that drive a lot of complexity around filtering and multiband, multimode operation, received diversity requirements going up, transmit diversity coming and so forth. All of that are sort of independent of tier because they're not -- a lot of them aren't driven specifically by consumer features and things that you see. It's driven just as much more sort of network infrastructure efficiency in economies driven by the provider -- the carriers. So I think that's the essence of the comments we made in the past that you're asking about."
