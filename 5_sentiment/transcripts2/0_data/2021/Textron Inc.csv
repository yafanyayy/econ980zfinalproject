Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today.

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.7 billion, down $368 million from last year. During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded $23 million in pretax special charges, largely related to restructuring activities on Industrial and Textron Aviation or $0.07 per share after tax. We also recognized a onetime favorable tax benefit related to the sale of TRU Canada of $0.04 per share. Excluding special charges and the onetime favorable benefit, adjusted net income was $1.06 per share compared to $1.11 in last year's fourth quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $467 million, down $183 million from last year's fourth quarter. 
For the full year, revenues were $11.7 billion, down from $13.6 billion a year ago. Adjusted net income was $2.07 per share compared to $3.74 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $596 million as compared to $642 million last year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin",737,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin to 8.8% on lower revenues. 
At Bell, margins of 12.6% were up 30 basis points as compared to the prior year despite lower military revenues and commercial volume. We delivered 57 commercial helicopters, down from 76 in last year's fourth quarter. 
On the military side, the Japanese officially began V-22 flight operations in November. This continues the growth of the worldwide fleet of operating aircraft, which has amassed over 560,000 flight hours. 
Looking to future vertical lift, Bell marked the third anniversary of the V-280 first flight in December, with the aircraft having now flown more than 200 hours. Army Leadership and Congress have been very supportive of future vertical lift and we expect this will continue under the new administration. 
In December, the U.S. Army provided the draft RFP for the FLRAA program for review and comment. The Army continues to anticipate a down-select and FLRAA program award in mid-2022. 
At Systems, revenues were down primarily on lower volume in the TRU Simulation + Training business. In November, Systems announced the sale of its commercial air transport simulator business to CAE. This transaction closed in January. 
In the quarter, ATAC won the recompete of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps flight fighter jet training services program. This contract expands the scope of the services we currently provide into the program and it's worth up to $440 million over the next 5 years. 
Also in the quarter, unmanned systems was awarded a $66 million contract for the U.S. Army for 36 Shadow aircraft. The Shadow platform now has over 1.2 million flight hours globally. 
Moving to Industrial. Revenues were down primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles. 
Kautex, the automotive production outlook, has steadily improved since the low point in May, and demand from our customers continues to ramp in the fourth quarter as revenues approach their prior year levels. 
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were down in the quarter, primarily on lower jet deliveries and aftermarket volume. We delivered 61 jets, down from 71 last year, and 61 commercial turboprops, up from 59 in last year's fourth quarter. 
On the new product front, Aviation began deliveries of the new King Air 360 with 8 units in the quarter and announced the new King Air 260. 
Cessna SkyCourier program continues to progress with 3 aircraft flying in the certification program. The flight test program has completed over 400 flight hours, and the aircraft is on track for entry into service in the second half of 2021. 
In summary, 2020 was a difficult year with many challenges for our operations, and I'm proud of the way our teams responded. Through a focus on working capital management and cost control, the business has generated a strong manufacturing cash flow performance for the year. 
At our defense businesses, we were able to maintain our operations, meeting our customer commitments and delivering strong results. On the commercial side, we overcame temporary manufacturing shutdowns and disruptions in our end markets to deliver strong fourth quarter results and look forward to carrying that momentum into 2021. 
With this backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $12.5 billion for Textron's 2021 financial guidance. 
At Aviation, we are projecting growth from increased aircraft deliveries on both jets and turboprops, including the entry into service of our new Cessna SkyCourier and higher aftermarket revenue is driven by increased fleet utilization. 
At Systems, we're expecting higher revenues and margin expansion, primarily driven by growth in ATAC and Marine and Land systems. 
At Bell, we expect solid margin performance despite lower military and commercial revenues, while continuing to invest in future vertical lift. 
At Industrial, we're expecting revenue growth and margin improvement at Kautex as auto demand continues to recover from pre -- to pre-COVID levels. 
At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we're also expecting revenue growth and margin improvement as we continue to grow our powersports business with Bass Pro shops. 
We are projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit in the quarter was $324 million, down $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 on a $368 million decrease in revenues. 
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.6 billion were down 10%, primarily due to lower Citation jet volume and lower aftermarket volume. Segment profit was $108 million in the fourth quarter, down from $134 million a year ago, primarily due to the impact from lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.6 billion. 
Moving to Bell, revenues were $871 million, down from $961 million last year, primarily on lower military revenues and commercial volume. Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, largely on the lower volume, partially offset by a favorable impact from performance, primarily reflecting higher favorable program adjustments. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.3 billion. 
At Textron Systems, revenues were $357 million, down from $399 million a year ago, primarily due to lower volume at TRU Simulation + Training. Segment profit of $49 million was up $16 million, primarily due to favorable performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.6 billion. 
Industrial revenues were $866 million, a decrease of $61 million from last year, primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles. Segment profit was $55 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a favorable impact from pricing and inflation and favorable performance, partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix. 
Finance segment revenues were $13 million and profit was $2 million. 
Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $50 million and interest expense was $36 million. We recorded pretax special charges of $23 million in the quarter related to restructuring activities. 
Following the strong cash performance in the quarter, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The $2.3 billion represents a higher-than-normal level of cash on hand, reflecting a prefunding of $500 million of 2021 debt maturities. 
During the quarter, we repaid $350 million of floating rate notes that matured in November and $362 million of outstanding borrowings on corporate-owned life insurance policies that were drawn in the first quarter for additional liquidity.
In the quarter, we also reactivated our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately 129 million of shares. 
Turning to our 2021 outlook, I'll begin with our segments on Slide 9 of the earnings call presentation. 
At Textron Aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $4.5 billion, reflecting higher aircraft deliveries for both jets and turboprops as well as higher aftermarket revenues. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 5.5%, reflecting the higher volume and increased production. 
Looking to Bell, we expect slightly lower revenues of about $3.1 billion, reflecting lower military revenues from a lower H-1 production and aftermarket volume and lower commercial deliveries. We're forecasting a margin of about 12.5%, largely reflecting the lower military and commercial revenues and increased R&D investments related to FLRAA and FARA. 
At Systems, we're estimating higher 2021 revenues of about $1.4 billion. Segment margin is expected to be about 12.5%. 
At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.4 billion, reflecting higher revenues at Kautex and Textron Specialized Vehicles. Segment margin is expected to be about 6%. 
At Finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $10 million. 
Turning to Slide 10. We're estimating 2021 pension income of about $30 million versus a pension cost of $33 million last year. Our 2021 pension item reflects the strong return on our pension assets for 2020 of 17.4% and a change to the amortization period for accumulated actuarial losses for one of our domestic plans, resulting in those losses being amortized over a longer period. Offsetting these favorable changes are a 75 basis point decrease in our discount rate to 2.7% and a decrease in our estimated long-term asset return of 50 basis points to 7.25%. 
Turning to Slide 11. R&D is expected to be about $600 million, up from $545 million in 2020. 
Estimating CapEx will be about $400 million, up from $317 million last year. 
Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $120 million of corporate expense, $135 million of interest expense and a full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%. 
Our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is $2.70 to $2.90 per share, which excludes $20 million to $30 million of pretax special charges for the completion of our previously announced restructuring plan and a pretax gain of about $10 million from the sale of TRU Canada. 
Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash towards share repurchases in 2021. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions."

So I think people are feeling like things are recovering and demand remains there. Obviously, you see the data around used aircraft for sale is at record lows. If you look at Citations that are less than 10 years old, it's only about 1% of the fleet. So I think the market has been strong, not just as we've seen increased interest in orders on the new side, but also very strong on the used side. Flight activity has rebounded quite strongly. November and December in the U.S. were actually up for our aircraft over a year ago. So I think the demand and what we recognize that's primarily leisure travel at this point, there's still a pretty muted amount of what we think is straight business travel. So as things continue to return to normal, we think we'll see ongoing improvements in utilization as well. 
So at a macro level, considering the level of interest we're seeing, the momentum that we see through the course of the year and the very low levels of used aircraft that are within that 10-year window in terms of age, are all kind of pointing to continued momentum and strength in the order side of the business."

So the dynamic is business aviation flight hours have recovered much faster than commercial, obviously. I mean, they were up over -- to about 85%. And again, in November and December, in the U.S., they were actually up above what they had been in prior years. So -- but the dynamic that I think you have to moderate that a little bit is that all that recovery really is driven by leisure travel. So in a normal world, we probably -- and again, the data is not collected exactly this way, so it's hard to get the exact numbers around it. But I mean, you'd certainly say that most business jet flying are business trips, and then there's an augmentation of utilization of those aircraft for leisure travel. I think what we're seeing right now is almost exclusively leisure travel. So you've got almost back to where you were on a more normalized basis in terms of flight hours. But all of the flying, almost all the flying, is leisure. So as you start to see the economy recover, you see travel restrictions come down, you see more business flying, again, you start to see conferences coming back and business trips and meetings, these sorts of things, that when you add that on top of what we're already seeing in strong demand on the leisure side, that you will see very strong demand on the business jet side dramatically over what we've seen in the past. And it is because of the dynamic that you're talking about, which is, with the fewer flights, for someone to go from a small airport area to a trip that's going to land them in another small airport area, with fewer flights to get through hubs, it's a day. I mean it's very challenging with those schedules. And I think health is also part of it. People feel more comfortable in getting into an aircraft with just themselves or family versus getting on to commercial aircraft. So the issue is that this rebound, which has been much more pronounced than what we've seen in commercial, is all leisure. And so our belief is when you add business travel back on top of that, that you will see this in a very strong recovery. 
But again, today, even though we're seeing and very good -- feel very good about the rebound in travel, it really is only on the leisure side because you still have very little business travel. And that's what's muting it a little bit. But I expect that will change, again, as the economy starts to come back and people start to travel on business trips."

We continue to to work on that program, but we are being a little cautious here to gate how much we spend and where we invest, to understand what the regulatory environment is going to look like. Because there are 2 issues here. One is these are aircraft that are going to have human beings in them. And therefore, they will have to go through a full regulatory approval process. Those standards are evolving and trying to understand with certainty what it will take to certify such an aircraft. And the other is the air taxi model. And again, we don't operate the air taxi model. But obviously, the business case of how much you invest and what the volume looks like will depend on how are these businesses going to operate. And again, there is, I believe, a real -- a lot of regulatory uncertainty as to getting approval for the routings and where are these things going to fly and at what altitudes and what kind of controlled airspace. For the sort of the vision that people have around the air taxi, there's still a lot of uncertainty around what that regulatory environment looks like. So I would say that I think when you think about the technology that's involved and the ability to design and certify an aircraft that can meet that mission, our team in Bell is absolutely qualified and capable to do that, I would say far much more so than a lot of the other hype that you hear out there. But I do think we have to be cautious here in terms of not getting too far out front of a regulatory environment that's very uncertain in order to allow that business model to be successful."

The one that's really going to drive a lot of the R&D here for the next 2 years is the FARA program, because right now, you're in the middle of all the detailed design, you're starting component, manufacturing and assembly. As you go into 2022, first flight is at the end of 2022. So you have all of the cost in 2022, is really driven by the FARA program and completing all the design and getting ready for a flight test program. And you go into 2023, that's really the flight test program through the course of that year. So that's the program schedule. 
And so the relative level of R&D is highly driven by FARA, particularly as you get into '22, '23. This year, it's a little more balanced, but a significant increase in FARA spending as you go through this year."

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.7 billion, down $368 million from last year. During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded $23 million in pre-tax special charges, largely related to restructuring activities on Industrial and Textron Aviation or $0.07 per share after tax. We also recognized a onetime favorable tax benefit related to the sale of TRU Canada of $0.04 per share.
Excluding special charges and the onetime favorable benefit, adjusted net income was $1.06 per share compared to $1.11 in last year's fourth quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $467 million, down $183 million from last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, revenues were $11.7 billion, down from $13.6 billion a year ago. Adjusted net income was $2.07 per share compared to $3.74 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $596 million as compared to $642 million last year.

Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin to 8.8% on lower revenues.
At Bell, margins of 12.6% were up 30 basis points as compared to the prior year despite lower military revenues and commercial volume. We delivered 57 commercial helicopters, down from 76 in last year's fourth quarter.
On the military side, the Japanese officially began V-22 flight operations in November. This continues the growth of the worldwide fleet of operating aircraft, which has amassed over 560,000 flight hours.
Looking to Future Vertical Lift, Bell marked the third anniversary of the V-280's first flight in December, with the aircraft having now flown more than 200 hours. Army leadership and Congress have been very supportive of Future Vertical Lift and we expect this will continue under the new administration.
In December, the U.S. Army provided the draft RFP for the FLRAA program for review and comment. The Army continues to anticipate a down-select and FLRAA program award in mid-2022.
At Systems, revenues were down primarily on lower volume at the TRU Simulation + Training business. In November, Systems announced sale of its commercial air transport simulator business to CAE. This transaction closed in January.
In the quarter, ATAC won the recompete of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps flight -- fighter jet training services program. This contract expands the scope of the services we currently provide into the program and it's worth up to $440 million over the next 5 years.
Also in the quarter, unmanned systems was awarded a $66 million contract for the U.S. Army for 36 Shadow aircraft. The Shadow platform now has over 1.2 million flight hours globally.
Moving to Industrial. Revenues were down primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles. Kautex, the automotive production outlook, has steadily improved since the low point in May, and demand from our customers continues to ramp in the fourth quarter as revenues approach their prior-year levels.
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were down in the quarter, primarily on lower jet deliveries and aftermarket volume. We delivered 61 jets, down from 71 last year, and 61 commercial turboprops, up from 59 in last year's fourth quarter.
On the new product front, Aviation began deliveries of the new King Air 360 with 8 units in the quarter and announced the new King Air 260.
Cessna SkyCourier program continues to progress with 3 aircraft flying in the certification program. The flight test program has completed over 400 flight hours, and the aircraft is on track for entry into service in the second half of 2021.
In summary, 2020 was a difficult year with many challenges for our operations, and I'm proud of the way our teams responded. Through a focus on working capital management and cost control, the business has generated a strong manufacturing cash flow performance for the year.
At our defense businesses, we were able to maintain our operations, meeting our customer commitments and delivering strong results. On the commercial side, we overcame temporary manufacturing shutdowns and disruptions in our end markets to deliver strong fourth quarter results and look forward to carrying that momentum into 2021. With this backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $12.5 billion for Textron's 2021 financial guidance.
At Aviation, we are projecting growth from increased aircraft deliveries on both jets and turboprops, including the entry into service of our new Cessna SkyCourier and higher aftermarket revenues driven by increased fleet utilization.
At Systems, we're expecting higher revenues and margin expansion, primarily driven by growth in ATAC and Marine and Land Systems.
At Bell, we expect solid margin performance despite lower military and commercial revenues, while continuing to invest in Future Vertical Lift.
At Industrial, we're expecting revenue growth and margin improvement at Kautex as auto demand continues to recover from pre -- to pre-COVID levels.
At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we're also expecting revenue growth and margin improvement as we continue to grow our powersports business with Bass Pro Shops.
We are projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Good morning, everyone.
Segment profit in the quarter was $324 million, down $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 on a $368 million decrease in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.6 billion were down 10%, primarily due to lower Citation jet volume and lower aftermarket volume. Segment profit was $108 million in the fourth quarter, down from $134 million a year ago, primarily due to the impact from lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.6 billion.
Moving to Bell, revenues were $871 million, down from $961 million last year, primarily on lower military revenues and commercial volume. Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, largely on the lower volume, partially offset by a favorable impact from performance, primarily reflecting higher favorable program adjustments. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.3 billion.
At Textron Systems, revenues were $357 million, down from $399 million a year ago, primarily due to lower volume at TRU Simulation + Training. Segment profit of $49 million was up $16 million, primarily due to favorable performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.6 billion.
Industrial revenues were $866 million, a decrease of $61 million from last year, primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles. Segment profit was $55 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a favorable impact from pricing and inflation and favorable performance, partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix.
Finance segment revenues were $13 million and profit was $2 million.
Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $50 million and interest expense was $36 million. We recorded pre-tax special charges of $23 million in the quarter related to restructuring activities.
Following the strong cash performance in the quarter, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The $2.3 billion represents a higher-than-normal level of cash on hand, reflecting a prefunding of $500 million of 2021 debt maturities.
During the quarter, we repaid $350 million of floating rate notes that matured in November and $362 million of outstanding borrowings on corporate-owned life insurance policies that were drawn in the first quarter for additional liquidity.
In the quarter, we also reactivated our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately 129 million of shares.
Turning to our 2021 outlook, I'll begin with our segments on Slide 9 of the earnings call presentation.
At Textron Aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $4.5 billion, reflecting higher aircraft deliveries for both jets and turboprops as well as higher aftermarket revenues. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 5.5%, reflecting the higher volume and increased production.
Looking to Bell, we expect slightly lower revenues of about $3.1 billion, reflecting lower military revenues from a lower H-1 production and aftermarket volume and lower commercial deliveries. We're forecasting a margin of about 12.5%, largely reflecting the lower military and commercial revenues and increased R&D investments related to FLRAA and FARA.
At Systems, we're estimating higher 2021 revenues of about $1.4 billion. Segment margin is expected to be about 12.5%.
At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.4 billion, reflecting higher revenues at Kautex and Textron Specialized Vehicles. Segment margin is expected to be about 6%. 
At Finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $10 million.
Turning to Slide 10. We're estimating 2021 pension income of about $30 million versus a pension cost of $33 million last year. Our 2021 pension item reflects the strong return on our pension assets for 2020 of 17.4% and a change to the amortization period for accumulated actuarial losses for one of our domestic plans, resulting in those losses being amortized over a longer period. Offsetting these favorable changes are a 75 basis point decrease in our discount rate to 2.7% and a decrease in our estimated long-term asset return of 50 basis points to 7.25%.
Turning to Slide 11. R&D is expected to be about $600 million, up from $545 million in 2020. Estimating CapEx will be about $400 million, up from $317 million last year.
Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $120 million of corporate expense, $135 million of interest expense and a full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%.
Our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is $2.70 to $2.90 per share, which excludes $20 million to $30 million of pre-tax special charges for the completion of our previously announced restructuring plan and a pre-tax gain of about $10 million from the sale of TRU Canada.
Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash towards share repurchases in 2021.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions."

So I think people are feeling like things are recovering and demand remains there.
Obviously, you see the data around used aircraft for sale is at record lows. If you look at Citations that are less than 10 years old, it's only about 1% of the fleet. So I think the market has been strong, not just as we've seen increased interest in orders on the new side, but also very strong on the used side.
Flight activity has rebounded quite strongly. November and December in the U.S. were actually up for our aircraft over a year ago. So I think the demand -- and what we recognize that's primarily leisure travel at this point. There's still a pretty muted amount of what we think is straight business travel. So as things continue to return to normal, we think we'll see ongoing improvements in utilization as well.
So at a macro level, considering the level of interest we're seeing, the momentum that we're seeing through the course of the year and the very low levels of used aircraft that are within that 10-year window in terms of age are all kind of pointing to continued momentum and strength in the order side of the business."

I think demand has been good. As you know, this thing is -- we have quite a few retail aircraft out there that's out operating in the NetJets fleet and doing really, really well. So I probably won't go into gross margin by aircraft, but we're very happy with where the Longitude is."

I think that's part of why you see the reflection of so much used aircraft activity, is the demand out there supports about 135 operators, charter operators, all these guys are seeing very strong demand.

We expect to see that continued momentum. And powersports, when you look at -- everything from ATVs and side by sides and even through the snowmobiles retail has been very strong.
To be honest, we've been struggling to keep up just because we've got our own supply chain challenges based on smaller suppliers and COVID and whatnot.

So the dynamic is business aviation flight hours have recovered much faster than commercial, obviously. I mean they were up over -- to about 85%. And again, in November and December, in the U.S., they were actually up above what they had been in prior years. So -- but the dynamic that I think you have to moderate that a little bit is that all that recovery really is driven by leisure travel. So in a normal world, we probably -- and again, the data is not collected exactly this way, so it's hard to get the exact numbers around it. But I mean, you'd certainly say that most business jet flying are business trips, and then there's an augmentation of utilization of those aircraft for leisure travel.
I think what we're seeing right now is almost exclusively leisure travel. So you've got almost back to where you were on a more normalized basis in terms of flight hours. But all of the flying, almost all the flying, is leisure. So as you start to see the economy recover, as you see travel restrictions come down, you see more business flying. Again, you start to see conferences coming back and business trips and meetings, these sorts of things, that when you add that on top of what we're already seeing and strong demand on the leisure side, that you will see very strong demand on the business jet side dramatically over what we've seen in the past.
And it is because of the dynamic that you're talking about, which is, with the fewer flights, for someone to go from a small airport area to a trip that's going to land them in another small airport area with fewer flights to get through hubs, it's a day. I mean it's very challenging with those lower schedules. And I think health is also part of it. People feel more comfortable in getting into an aircraft with just themselves or family versus getting on to commercial aircraft.
So the issue is that this rebound, which has been much more pronounced than what we've seen in commercial, is all leisure. And so our belief is when you add business travel back on top of that, that you will see this in a very strong recovery. But again, today, even though we're seeing and very good -- feel very good about the rebound in travel, it really is only on the leisure side because you still have very little business travel. And that's what's muting it a little bit. But I expect that will change, again, as the economy starts to come back and people start to travel on business trips."

We continue to work on that program, but we are being a little cautious here to gate how much we spend and where we invest, understand what the regulatory environment is going to look like because there are 2 issues here. One is these are aircraft that are going to have human beings in them. And therefore, they will have to go through a full regulatory approval process. Those standards are evolving and trying to understand with certainty what it will take to certify such an aircraft.
And the other is the air taxi model. And again, we don't operate the air taxi model. But obviously, the business case of how much you invest and what the volume looks like will depend on how are these businesses going to operate. And again, there is, I believe, a real -- a lot of regulatory uncertainty as to getting approval for the routings and where are these things going to fly and at what altitudes and what kind of controlled airspace. For the sort of the vision that people have around the air taxi, there's still a lot of uncertainty around what that regulatory environment looks like.
So I would say that I think when you think about the technology that's involved and the ability to design and certify an aircraft that can meet that mission, our team in Bell is absolutely qualified and capable to do that, I would say far much more so than a lot of the other hype that you hear out there. But I do think we have to be cautious here in terms of not getting too far out front of a regulatory environment that's very uncertain in order to allow that business model to be successful."

The one that's really going to drive a lot of the R&D here for the next 2 years is the FARA program because right now, you're in the middle of all the detailed design, you're starting component, manufacturing and assembly.
As you go into 2022, first flight is at the end of 2022. So you have all of the cost in 2022, is really driven by the FARA program and completing all the design and getting ready for a flight test program. And you go into 2023, that's really the flight test program through the course of that year. So that's the program schedule.

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.7 billion, down $368 million from last year. During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded $23 million in pre-tax special charges, largely related to restructuring activities on Industrial and Textron Aviation or $0.07 per share after tax. We also recognized a onetime favorable tax benefit related to the sale of TRU Canada of $0.04 per share.
Excluding special charges and the onetime favorable benefit, adjusted net income was $1.06 per share compared to $1.11 in last year's fourth quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $467 million, down $183 million from last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, revenues were $11.7 billion, down from $13.6 billion a year ago. Adjusted net income was $2.07 per share compared to $3.74 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $596 million as compared to $642 million last year.

Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin",735,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin to 8.8% on lower revenues.
At Bell, margins of 12.6% were up 30 basis points as compared to the prior year despite lower military revenues and commercial volume. We delivered 57 commercial helicopters, down from 76 in last year's fourth quarter.
On the military side, the Japanese officially began V-22 flight operations in November. This continues the growth of the worldwide fleet of operating aircraft, which has amassed over 560,000 flight hours.
Looking to Future Vertical Lift, Bell marked the third anniversary of the V-280's first flight in December, with the aircraft having now flown more than 200 hours. Army leadership and Congress have been very supportive of Future Vertical Lift and we expect this will continue under the new administration.
In December, the U.S. Army provided the draft RFP for the FLRAA program for review and comment. The Army continues to anticipate a down-select and FLRAA program award in mid-2022.
At Systems, revenues were down primarily on lower volume at the TRU Simulation + Training business. In November, Systems announced sale of its commercial air transport simulator business to CAE. This transaction closed in January.
In the quarter, ATAC won the recompete of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps flight -- fighter jet training services program. This contract expands the scope of the services we currently provide into the program and it's worth up to $440 million over the next 5 years.
Also in the quarter, unmanned systems was awarded a $66 million contract for the U.S. Army for 36 Shadow aircraft. The Shadow platform now has over 1.2 million flight hours globally.
Moving to Industrial. Revenues were down primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles. Kautex, the automotive production outlook, has steadily improved since the low point in May, and demand from our customers continues to ramp in the fourth quarter as revenues approach their prior-year levels.
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were down in the quarter, primarily on lower jet deliveries and aftermarket volume. We delivered 61 jets, down from 71 last year, and 61 commercial turboprops, up from 59 in last year's fourth quarter.
On the new product front, Aviation began deliveries of the new King Air 360 with 8 units in the quarter and announced the new King Air 260.
Cessna SkyCourier program continues to progress with 3 aircraft flying in the certification program. The flight test program has completed over 400 flight hours, and the aircraft is on track for entry into service in the second half of 2021.
In summary, 2020 was a difficult year with many challenges for our operations, and I'm proud of the way our teams responded. Through a focus on working capital management and cost control, the business has generated a strong manufacturing cash flow performance for the year.
At our defense businesses, we were able to maintain our operations, meeting our customer commitments and delivering strong results. On the commercial side, we overcame temporary manufacturing shutdowns and disruptions in our end markets to deliver strong fourth quarter results and look forward to carrying that momentum into 2021. With this backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $12.5 billion for Textron's 2021 financial guidance.
At Aviation, we are projecting growth from increased aircraft deliveries on both jets and turboprops, including the entry into service of our new Cessna SkyCourier and higher aftermarket revenues driven by increased fleet utilization.
At Systems, we're expecting higher revenues and margin expansion, primarily driven by growth in ATAC and Marine and Land Systems.
At Bell, we expect solid margin performance despite lower military and commercial revenues, while continuing to invest in Future Vertical Lift.
At Industrial, we're expecting revenue growth and margin improvement at Kautex as auto demand continues to recover from pre -- to pre-COVID levels.
At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we're also expecting revenue growth and margin improvement as we continue to grow our powersports business with Bass Pro Shops.
We are projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit was $108 million in the fourth quarter, down from $134 million a year ago, primarily due to the impact from lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.6 billion.
Moving to Bell, revenues were $871 million, down from $961 million last year, primarily on lower military revenues and commercial volume. Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, largely on the lower volume, partially offset by a favorable impact from performance, primarily reflecting higher favorable program adjustments. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.3 billion.
At Textron Systems, revenues were $357 million, down from $399 million a year ago, primarily due to lower volume at TRU Simulation + Training. Segment profit of $49 million was up $16 million, primarily due to favorable performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.6 billion.
Industrial revenues were $866 million, a decrease of $61 million from last year, primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles. Segment profit was $55 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a favorable impact from pricing and inflation and favorable performance, partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix.
Finance segment revenues were $13 million and profit was $2 million.
Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $50 million and interest expense was $36 million. We recorded pre-tax special charges of $23 million in the quarter related to restructuring activities.
Following the strong cash performance in the quarter, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The $2.3 billion represents a higher-than-normal level of cash on hand, reflecting a prefunding of $500 million of 2021 debt maturities.
During the quarter, we repaid $350 million of floating rate notes that matured in November and $362 million of outstanding borrowings on corporate-owned life insurance policies that were drawn in the first quarter for additional liquidity.
In the quarter, we also reactivated our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately 129 million of shares.
Turning to our 2021 outlook, I'll begin with our segments on Slide 9 of the earnings call presentation.
At Textron Aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $4.5 billion, reflecting higher aircraft deliveries for both jets and turboprops as well as higher aftermarket revenues. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 5.5%, reflecting the higher volume and increased production.
Looking to Bell, we expect slightly lower revenues of about $3.1 billion, reflecting lower military revenues from a lower H-1 production and aftermarket volume and lower commercial deliveries. We're forecasting a margin of about 12.5%, largely reflecting the lower military and commercial revenues and increased R&D investments related to FLRAA and FARA.
At Systems, we're estimating higher 2021 revenues of about $1.4 billion. Segment margin is expected to be about 12.5%.
At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.4 billion, reflecting higher revenues at Kautex and Textron Specialized Vehicles. Segment margin is expected to be about 6%. 
At Finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $10 million.
Turning to Slide 10. We're estimating 2021 pension income of about $30 million versus a pension cost of $33 million last year. Our 2021 pension item reflects the strong return on our pension assets for 2020 of 17.4% and a change to the amortization period for accumulated actuarial losses for one of our domestic plans, resulting in those losses being amortized over a longer period. Offsetting these favorable changes are a 75 basis point decrease in our discount rate to 2.7% and a decrease in our estimated long-term asset return of 50 basis points to 7.25%.
Turning to Slide 11. R&D is expected to be about $600 million, up from $545 million in 2020. Estimating CapEx will be about $400 million, up from $317 million last year.
Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $120 million of corporate expense, $135 million of interest expense and a full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%.
Our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is $2.70 to $2.90 per share, which excludes $20 million to $30 million of pre-tax special charges for the completion of our previously announced restructuring plan and a pre-tax gain of about $10 million from the sale of TRU Canada.
Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash towards share repurchases in 2021.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions."

So I think people are feeling like things are recovering and demand remains there.
Obviously, you see the data around used aircraft for sale is at record lows. If you look at Citations that are less than 10 years old, it's only about 1% of the fleet. So I think the market has been strong, not just as we've seen increased interest in orders on the new side, but also very strong on the used side.
Flight activity has rebounded quite strongly. November and December in the U.S. were actually up for our aircraft over a year ago. So I think the demand -- and what we recognize that's primarily leisure travel at this point. There's still a pretty muted amount of what we think is straight business travel. So as things continue to return to normal, we think we'll see ongoing improvements in utilization as well.
So at a macro level, considering the level of interest we're seeing, the momentum that we're seeing through the course of the year and the very low levels of used aircraft that are within that 10-year window in terms of age are all kind of pointing to continued momentum and strength in the order side of the business."

I think that's part of why you see the reflection of so much used aircraft activity, is the demand out there supports about 135 operators, charter operators, all these guys are seeing very strong demand.

We expect to see that continued momentum. And powersports, when you look at -- everything from ATVs and side by sides and even through the snowmobiles retail has been very strong.
To be honest, we've been struggling to keep up just because we've got our own supply chain challenges based on smaller suppliers and COVID and whatnot.

Are there other items or dynamics that we should consider in why that may not be the case?

So the dynamic is business aviation flight hours have recovered much faster than commercial, obviously. I mean they were up over -- to about 85%. And again, in November and December, in the U.S., they were actually up above what they had been in prior years. So -- but the dynamic that I think you have to moderate that a little bit is that all that recovery really is driven by leisure travel. So in a normal world, we probably -- and again, the data is not collected exactly this way, so it's hard to get the exact numbers around it. But I mean, you'd certainly say that most business jet flying are business trips, and then there's an augmentation of utilization of those aircraft for leisure travel.
I think what we're seeing right now is almost exclusively leisure travel. So you've got almost back to where you were on a more normalized basis in terms of flight hours. But all of the flying, almost all the flying, is leisure. So as you start to see the economy recover, as you see travel restrictions come down, you see more business flying. Again, you start to see conferences coming back and business trips and meetings, these sorts of things, that when you add that on top of what we're already seeing and strong demand on the leisure side, that you will see very strong demand on the business jet side dramatically over what we've seen in the past.
And it is because of the dynamic that you're talking about, which is, with the fewer flights, for someone to go from a small airport area to a trip that's going to land them in another small airport area with fewer flights to get through hubs, it's a day. I mean it's very challenging with those lower schedules. And I think health is also part of it. People feel more comfortable in getting into an aircraft with just themselves or family versus getting on to commercial aircraft.
So the issue is that this rebound, which has been much more pronounced than what we've seen in commercial, is all leisure. And so our belief is when you add business travel back on top of that, that you will see this in a very strong recovery. But again, today, even though we're seeing and very good -- feel very good about the rebound in travel, it really is only on the leisure side because you still have very little business travel. And that's what's muting it a little bit. But I expect that will change, again, as the economy starts to come back and people start to travel on business trips."

We continue to work on that program, but we are being a little cautious here to gate how much we spend and where we invest, understand what the regulatory environment is going to look like because there are 2 issues here. One is these are aircraft that are going to have human beings in them. And therefore, they will have to go through a full regulatory approval process. Those standards are evolving and trying to understand with certainty what it will take to certify such an aircraft.
And the other is the air taxi model. And again, we don't operate the air taxi model. But obviously, the business case of how much you invest and what the volume looks like will depend on how are these businesses going to operate. And again, there is, I believe, a real -- a lot of regulatory uncertainty as to getting approval for the routings and where are these things going to fly and at what altitudes and what kind of controlled airspace. For the sort of the vision that people have around the air taxi, there's still a lot of uncertainty around what that regulatory environment looks like.
So I would say that I think when you think about the technology that's involved and the ability to design and certify an aircraft that can meet that mission, our team in Bell is absolutely qualified and capable to do that, I would say far much more so than a lot of the other hype that you hear out there. But I do think we have to be cautious here in terms of not getting too far out front of a regulatory environment that's very uncertain in order to allow that business model to be successful."

The one that's really going to drive a lot of the R&D here for the next 2 years is the FARA program because right now, you're in the middle of all the detailed design, you're starting component, manufacturing and assembly.
As you go into 2022, first flight is at the end of 2022. So you have all of the cost in 2022, is really driven by the FARA program and completing all the design and getting ready for a flight test program.

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.7 billion, down $368 million from last year. During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded $23 million in pre-tax special charges, largely related to restructuring activities on Industrial and Textron Aviation or $0.07 per share after tax. We also recognized a onetime favorable tax benefit related to the sale of TRU Canada of $0.04 per share.
Excluding special charges and the onetime favorable benefit, adjusted net income was $1.06 per share compared to $1.11 in last year's fourth quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $467 million, down $183 million from last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, revenues were $11.7 billion, down from $13.6 billion a year ago. Adjusted net income was $2.07 per share compared to $3.74 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $596 million as compared to $642 million last year.

Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin",735,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin to 8.8% on lower revenues.
At Bell, margins of 12.6% were up 30 basis points as compared to the prior year despite lower military revenues and commercial volume. We delivered 57 commercial helicopters, down from 76 in last year's fourth quarter.
On the military side, the Japanese officially began V-22 flight operations in November. This continues the growth of the worldwide fleet of operating aircraft, which has amassed over 560,000 flight hours.
Looking to Future Vertical Lift, Bell marked the third anniversary of the V-280's first flight in December, with the aircraft having now flown more than 200 hours. Army leadership and Congress have been very supportive of Future Vertical Lift and we expect this will continue under the new administration.
In December, the U.S. Army provided the draft RFP for the FLRAA program for review and comment. The Army continues to anticipate a down-select and FLRAA program award in mid-2022.
At Systems, revenues were down primarily on lower volume at the TRU Simulation + Training business. In November, Systems announced sale of its commercial air transport simulator business to CAE. This transaction closed in January.
In the quarter, ATAC won the recompete of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps flight -- fighter jet training services program. This contract expands the scope of the services we currently provide into the program and it's worth up to $440 million over the next 5 years.
Also in the quarter, unmanned systems was awarded a $66 million contract for the U.S. Army for 36 Shadow aircraft. The Shadow platform now has over 1.2 million flight hours globally.
Moving to Industrial. Revenues were down primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles. Kautex, the automotive production outlook, has steadily improved since the low point in May, and demand from our customers continues to ramp in the fourth quarter as revenues approach their prior-year levels.
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were down in the quarter, primarily on lower jet deliveries and aftermarket volume. We delivered 61 jets, down from 71 last year, and 61 commercial turboprops, up from 59 in last year's fourth quarter.
On the new product front, Aviation began deliveries of the new King Air 360 with 8 units in the quarter and announced the new King Air 260.
Cessna SkyCourier program continues to progress with 3 aircraft flying in the certification program. The flight test program has completed over 400 flight hours, and the aircraft is on track for entry into service in the second half of 2021.
In summary, 2020 was a difficult year with many challenges for our operations, and I'm proud of the way our teams responded. Through a focus on working capital management and cost control, the business has generated a strong manufacturing cash flow performance for the year.
At our defense businesses, we were able to maintain our operations, meeting our customer commitments and delivering strong results. On the commercial side, we overcame temporary manufacturing shutdowns and disruptions in our end markets to deliver strong fourth quarter results and look forward to carrying that momentum into 2021. With this backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $12.5 billion for Textron's 2021 financial guidance.
At Aviation, we are projecting growth from increased aircraft deliveries on both jets and turboprops, including the entry into service of our new Cessna SkyCourier and higher aftermarket revenues driven by increased fleet utilization.
At Systems, we're expecting higher revenues and margin expansion, primarily driven by growth in ATAC and Marine and Land Systems.
At Bell, we expect solid margin performance despite lower military and commercial revenues, while continuing to invest in Future Vertical Lift.
At Industrial, we're expecting revenue growth and margin improvement at Kautex as auto demand continues to recover from pre -- to pre-COVID levels.
At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we're also expecting revenue growth and margin improvement as we continue to grow our powersports business with Bass Pro Shops.
We are projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Good morning, everyone.Segment profit in the quarter was $324 million, down $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 on a $368 million decrease in revenues.Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Avia",821,"Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone.
Segment profit in the quarter was $324 million, down $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 on a $368 million decrease in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.6 billion were down 10%, primarily due to lower Citation jet volume and lower aftermarket volume. Segment profit was $108 million in the fourth quarter, down from $134 million a year ago, primarily due to the impact from lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.6 billion.
Moving to Bell, revenues were $871 million, down from $961 million last year, primarily on lower military revenues and commercial volume. Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, largely on the lower volume, partially offset by a favorable impact from performance, primarily reflecting higher favorable program adjustments. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.3 billion.
At Textron Systems, revenues were $357 million, down from $399 million a year ago, primarily due to lower volume at TRU Simulation + Training. Segment profit of $49 million was up $16 million, primarily due to favorable performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.6 billion.
Industrial revenues were $866 million, a decrease of $61 million from last year, primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles. Segment profit was $55 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a favorable impact from pricing and inflation and favorable performance, partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix.
Finance segment revenues were $13 million and profit was $2 million.
Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $50 million and interest expense was $36 million. We recorded pre-tax special charges of $23 million in the quarter related to restructuring activities.
Following the strong cash performance in the quarter, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The $2.3 billion represents a higher-than-normal level of cash on hand, reflecting a prefunding of $500 million of 2021 debt maturities.
During the quarter, we repaid $350 million of floating rate notes that matured in November and $362 million of outstanding borrowings on corporate-owned life insurance policies that were drawn in the first quarter for additional liquidity.
In the quarter, we also reactivated our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately 129 million of shares.
Turning to our 2021 outlook, I'll begin with our segments on Slide 9 of the earnings call presentation.
At Textron Aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $4.5 billion, reflecting higher aircraft deliveries for both jets and turboprops as well as higher aftermarket revenues. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 5.5%, reflecting the higher volume and increased production.
Looking to Bell, we expect slightly lower revenues of about $3.1 billion, reflecting lower military revenues from a lower H-1 production and aftermarket volume and lower commercial deliveries. We're forecasting a margin of about 12.5%, largely reflecting the lower military and commercial revenues and increased R&D investments related to FLRAA and FARA.
At Systems, we're estimating higher 2021 revenues of about $1.4 billion. Segment margin is expected to be about 12.5%.
At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.4 billion, reflecting higher revenues at Kautex and Textron Specialized Vehicles. Segment margin is expected to be about 6%. 
At Finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $10 million.
Turning to Slide 10. We're estimating 2021 pension income of about $30 million versus a pension cost of $33 million last year. Our 2021 pension item reflects the strong return on our pension assets for 2020 of 17.4% and a change to the amortization period for accumulated actuarial losses for one of our domestic plans, resulting in those losses being amortized over a longer period. Offsetting these favorable changes are a 75 basis point decrease in our discount rate to 2.7% and a decrease in our estimated long-term asset return of 50 basis points to 7.25%.
Turning to Slide 11. R&D is expected to be about $600 million, up from $545 million in 2020. Estimating CapEx will be about $400 million, up from $317 million last year.
Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $120 million of corporate expense, $135 million of interest expense and a full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%.
Our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is $2.70 to $2.90 per share, which excludes $20 million to $30 million of pre-tax special charges for the completion of our previously announced restructuring plan and a pre-tax gain of about $10 million from the sale of TRU Canada.
Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash towards share repurchases in 2021.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions."

So I think people are feeling like things are recovering and demand remains there.
Obviously, you see the data around used aircraft for sale is at record lows. If you look at Citations that are less than 10 years old, it's only about 1% of the fleet. So I think the market has been strong, not just as we've seen increased interest in orders on the new side, but also very strong on the used side.
Flight activity has rebounded quite strongly. November and December in the U.S. were actually up for our aircraft over a year ago. So I think the demand -- and what we recognize that's primarily leisure travel at this point. There's still a pretty muted amount of what we think is straight business travel. So as things continue to return to normal, we think we'll see ongoing improvements in utilization as well.
So at a macro level, considering the level of interest we're seeing, the momentum that we're seeing through the course of the year and the very low levels of used aircraft that are within that 10-year window in terms of age are all kind of pointing to continued momentum and strength in the order side of the business."

We're seeing a lot of new customers coming to the market. We certainly have dialogues with new customers on new aircraft sales. We know that's happening in charter, in fractional and club. It's really across the board.
I think that's part of why you see the reflection of so much used aircraft activity, is the demand out there supports about 135 operators, charter operators, all these guys are seeing very strong demand. And that's just really driven by leisure because we haven't seen much rebound yet on the business side of travel. But we certainly expect to see that same dynamic as businesses start to travel again.
So I think structurally, at a macro level, it will drive a larger end market, which is good for everyone that is a participant in this -- the biz jet world. And that's why we feel like we'll get -- there's still an overhang, obviously, of the COVID impacts and not seeing a lot of business demand yet, which is why we think we'll see half of that recovery back to '19 this year. And I think we feel pretty good about that. And then we would certainly expect to see back to that '19 level when you get into the 2022 time frame."

On the vehicle side, ex the ground support equipment business, because I think that's going to continue to be challenged here until we start to see the commercial aviation business coming back, but we certainly expect to see another solid year in Gulf, the PTV business, which was very strong for us in the back half of last year. We expect to see that continued momentum. And powersports, when you look at -- everything from ATVs and side by sides and even through the snowmobiles retail has been very strong.
To be honest, we've been struggling to keep up just because we've got our own supply chain challenges based on smaller suppliers and COVID and whatnot.

So the dynamic is business aviation flight hours have recovered much faster than commercial, obviously. I mean they were up over -- to about 85%.

So the dynamic is business aviation flight hours have recovered much faster than commercial, obviously. I mean they were up over -- to about 85%. And again, in November and December, in the U.S., they were actually up above what they had been in prior years. So -- but the dynamic that I think you have to moderate that a little bit is that all that recovery really is driven by leisure travel. So in a normal world, we probably -- and again, the data is not collected exactly this way, so it's hard to get the exact numbers around it. But I mean you'd certainly say that most business jet flying are business trips, and then there's an augmentation of utilization of those aircraft for leisure travel.
I think what we're seeing right now is almost exclusively leisure travel. So you've got almost back to where you were on a more normalized basis in terms of flight hours. But all of the flying, almost all the flying, is leisure. So as you start to see the economy recover, as you see travel restrictions come down, you see more business flying. Again, you start to see conferences coming back and business trips and meetings, these sorts of things, that when you add that on top of what we're already seeing and strong demand on the leisure side, that you will see very strong demand on the business jet side dramatically over what we've seen in the past.
And it is because of the dynamic that you're talking about, which is, with the fewer flights, for someone to go from a small airport area to a trip that's going to land them in another small airport area with fewer flights to get through hubs, it's a day. I mean it's very challenging with those lower schedules. And I think health is also part of it. People feel more comfortable in getting into an aircraft with just themselves or family versus getting on to commercial aircraft.
So the issue is that this rebound, which has been much more pronounced than what we've seen in commercial, is all leisure. And so our belief is when you add business travel back on top of that, that you will see this in a very strong recovery. But again, today, even though we're seeing and very good -- feel very good about the rebound in travel, it really is only on the leisure side because you still have very little business travel. And that's what's muting it a little bit. But I expect that will change, again, as the economy starts to come back and people start to travel on business trips."

We continue to work on that program, but we are being a little cautious here to gate how much we spend and where we invest, understand what the regulatory environment is going to look like because there are 2 issues here. One is these are aircraft that are going to have human beings in them. And therefore, they will have to go through a full regulatory approval process. Those standards are evolving and trying to understand with certainty what it will take to certify such an aircraft.
And the other is the air taxi model. And again, we don't operate the air taxi model. But obviously, the business case of how much you invest and what the volume looks like will depend on how are these businesses going to operate. And again, there is, I believe, a real -- a lot of regulatory uncertainty as to getting approval for the routings and where are these things going to fly and at what altitudes and what kind of controlled airspace. For the sort of the vision that people have around the air taxi, there's still a lot of uncertainty around what that regulatory environment looks like.
So I would say that I think when you think about the technology that's involved and the ability to design and certify an aircraft that can meet that mission, our team in Bell is absolutely qualified and capable to do that, I would say far much more so than a lot of the other hype that you hear out there. But I do think we have to be cautious here in terms of not getting too far out front of a regulatory environment that's very uncertain in order to allow that business model to be successful."

The one that's really going to drive a lot of the R&D here for the next 2 years is the FARA program because right now, you're in the middle of all the detailed design, you're starting component, manufacturing and assembly.
As you go into 2022, first flight is at the end of 2022. So you have all of the cost in 2022, is really driven by the FARA program and completing all the design and getting ready for a flight test program. And you go into 2023, that's really the flight test program through the course of that year. So that's the program schedule. And so the relative level of R&D is highly driven by FARA, particularly as you get into '22, '23. This year, it's a little more balanced, but a significant increase in FARA spending as you go through this year."

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.7 billion, down $368 million from last year. During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded $23 million in pre-tax special charges, largely related to restructuring activities on Industrial and Textron Aviation or $0.07 per share after tax. We also recognized a onetime favorable tax benefit related to the sale of TRU Canada of $0.04 per share.
Excluding special charges and the onetime favorable benefit, adjusted net income was $1.06 per share compared to $1.11 in last year's fourth quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $467 million, down $183 million from last year's fourth quarter.
For the full year, revenues were $11.7 billion, down from $13.6 billion a year ago. Adjusted net income was $2.07 per share compared to $3.74 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $596 million as compared to $642 million last year.

Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin",735,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin to 8.8% on lower revenues.
At Bell, margins of 12.6% were up 30 basis points as compared to the prior year despite lower military revenues and commercial volume. We delivered 57 commercial helicopters, down from 76 in last year's fourth quarter.
On the military side, the Japanese officially began V-22 flight operations in November. This continues the growth of the worldwide fleet of operating aircraft, which has amassed over 560,000 flight hours.
Looking to Future Vertical Lift, Bell marked the third anniversary of the V-280's first flight in December, with the aircraft having now flown more than 200 hours. Army leadership and Congress have been very supportive of Future Vertical Lift and we expect this will continue under the new administration.
In December, the U.S. Army provided the draft RFP for the FLRAA program for review and comment. The Army continues to anticipate a down-select and FLRAA program award in mid-2022.
At Systems, revenues were down primarily on lower volume at the TRU Simulation + Training business. In November, Systems announced sale of its commercial air transport simulator business to CAE. This transaction closed in January.
In the quarter, ATAC won the recompete of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps flight -- fighter jet training services program. This contract expands the scope of the services we currently provide into the program and it's worth up to $440 million over the next 5 years.
Also in the quarter, unmanned systems was awarded a $66 million contract for the U.S. Army for 36 Shadow aircraft. The Shadow platform now has over 1.2 million flight hours globally.
Moving to Industrial. Revenues were down primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles. Kautex, the automotive production outlook, has steadily improved since the low point in May, and demand from our customers continues to ramp in the fourth quarter as revenues approach their prior-year levels.
Moving to Textron Aviation. Revenues were down in the quarter, primarily on lower jet deliveries and aftermarket volume. We delivered 61 jets, down from 71 last year, and 61 commercial turboprops, up from 59 in last year's fourth quarter.
On the new product front, Aviation began deliveries of the new King Air 360 with 8 units in the quarter and announced the new King Air 260.
Cessna SkyCourier program continues to progress with 3 aircraft flying in the certification program. The flight test program has completed over 400 flight hours, and the aircraft is on track for entry into service in the second half of 2021.
In summary, 2020 was a difficult year with many challenges for our operations, and I'm proud of the way our teams responded. Through a focus on working capital management and cost control, the business has generated a strong manufacturing cash flow performance for the year.
At our defense businesses, we were able to maintain our operations, meeting our customer commitments and delivering strong results. On the commercial side, we overcame temporary manufacturing shutdowns and disruptions in our end markets to deliver strong fourth quarter results and look forward to carrying that momentum into 2021. With this backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $12.5 billion for Textron's 2021 financial guidance.
At Aviation, we are projecting growth from increased aircraft deliveries on both jets and turboprops, including the entry into service of our new Cessna SkyCourier and higher aftermarket revenues driven by increased fleet utilization.
At Systems, we're expecting higher revenues and margin expansion, primarily driven by growth in ATAC and Marine and Land Systems.
At Bell, we expect solid margin performance despite lower military and commercial revenues, while continuing to invest in Future Vertical Lift.
At Industrial, we're expecting revenue growth and margin improvement at Kautex as auto demand continues to recover from pre -- to pre-COVID levels.
At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we're also expecting revenue growth and margin improvement as we continue to grow our powersports business with Bass Pro Shops.
We are projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Good morning, everyone.
Segment profit in the quarter was $324 million, down $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 on a $368 million decrease in revenues.
Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.6 billion were down 10%, primarily due to lower Citation jet volume and lower aftermarket volume. Segment profit was $108 million in the fourth quarter, down from $134 million a year ago, primarily due to the impact from lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.6 billion.
Moving to Bell, revenues were $871 million, down from $961 million last year, primarily on lower military revenues and commercial volume. Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, largely on the lower volume, partially offset by a favorable impact from performance, primarily reflecting higher favorable program adjustments. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.3 billion.
At Textron Systems, revenues were $357 million, down from $399 million a year ago, primarily due to lower volume at TRU Simulation + Training. Segment profit of $49 million was up $16 million, primarily due to favorable performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.6 billion.
Industrial revenues were $866 million, a decrease of $61 million from last year, primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles. Segment profit was $55 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a favorable impact from pricing and inflation and favorable performance, partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix.
Finance segment revenues were $13 million and profit was $2 million.
Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $50 million and interest expense was $36 million. We recorded pre-tax special charges of $23 million in the quarter related to restructuring activities.
Following the strong cash performance in the quarter, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The $2.3 billion represents a higher-than-normal level of cash on hand, reflecting a prefunding of $500 million of 2021 debt maturities.
During the quarter, we repaid $350 million of floating rate notes that matured in November and $362 million of outstanding borrowings on corporate-owned life insurance policies that were drawn in the first quarter for additional liquidity.
In the quarter, we also reactivated our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately 129 million of shares.
Turning to our 2021 outlook, I'll begin with our segments on Slide 9 of the earnings call presentation.
At Textron Aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $4.5 billion, reflecting higher aircraft deliveries for both jets and turboprops as well as higher aftermarket revenues. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 5.5%, reflecting the higher volume and increased production.
Looking to Bell, we expect slightly lower revenues of about $3.1 billion, reflecting lower military revenues from a lower H-1 production and aftermarket volume and lower commercial deliveries. We're forecasting a margin of about 12.5%, largely reflecting the lower military and commercial revenues and increased R&D investments related to FLRAA and FARA.
At Systems, we're estimating higher 2021 revenues of about $1.4 billion. Segment margin is expected to be about 12.5%.
At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.4 billion, reflecting higher revenues at Kautex and Textron Specialized Vehicles. Segment margin is expected to be about 6%. 
At Finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $10 million.
Turning to Slide 10. We're estimating 2021 pension income of about $30 million versus a pension cost of $33 million last year. Our 2021 pension item reflects the strong return on our pension assets for 2020 of 17.4% and a change to the amortization period for accumulated actuarial losses for one of our domestic plans, resulting in those losses being amortized over a longer period. Offsetting these favorable changes are a 75 basis point decrease in our discount rate to 2.7% and a decrease in our estimated long-term asset return of 50 basis points to 7.25%.
Turning to Slide 11. R&D is expected to be about $600 million, up from $545 million in 2020. Estimating CapEx will be about $400 million, up from $317 million last year.
Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $120 million of corporate expense, $135 million of interest expense and a full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%.
Our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is $2.70 to $2.90 per share, which excludes $20 million to $30 million of pre-tax special charges for the completion of our previously announced restructuring plan and a pre-tax gain of about $10 million from the sale of TRU Canada.
Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash towards share repurchases in 2021.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions."

So I think people are feeling like things are recovering and demand remains there.
Obviously, you see the data around used aircraft for sale is at record lows. If you look at Citations that are less than 10 years old, it's only about 1% of the fleet. So I think the market has been strong, not just as we've seen increased interest in orders on the new side, but also very strong on the used side.
Flight activity has rebounded quite strongly. November and December in the U.S. were actually up for our aircraft over a year ago. So I think the demand -- and what we recognize that's primarily leisure travel at this point. There's still a pretty muted amount of what we think is straight business travel. So as things continue to return to normal, we think we'll see ongoing improvements in utilization as well.
So at a macro level, considering the level of interest we're seeing, the momentum that we're seeing through the course of the year and the very low levels of used aircraft that are within that 10-year window in terms of age are all kind of pointing to continued momentum and strength in the order side of the business."

We expect to see that continued momentum. And powersports, when you look at -- everything from ATVs and side by sides and even through the snowmobiles retail has been very strong.
To be honest, we've been struggling to keep up just because we've got our own supply chain challenges based on smaller suppliers and COVID and whatnot.

So the dynamic is business aviation flight hours have recovered much faster than commercial, obviously. I mean they were up over -- to about 85%. And again, in November and December, in the U.S., they were actually up above what they had been in prior years. So -- but the dynamic that I think you have to moderate that a little bit is that all that recovery really is driven by leisure travel. So in a normal world, we probably -- and again, the data is not collected exactly this way, so it's hard to get the exact numbers around it. But I mean you'd certainly say that most business jet flying are business trips, and then there's an augmentation of utilization of those aircraft for leisure travel.
I think what we're seeing right now is almost exclusively leisure travel. So you've got almost back to where you were on a more normalized basis in terms of flight hours. But all of the flying, almost all the flying, is leisure. So as you start to see the economy recover, as you see travel restrictions come down, you see more business flying. Again, you start to see conferences coming back and business trips and meetings, these sorts of things, that when you add that on top of what we're already seeing and strong demand on the leisure side, that you will see very strong demand on the business jet side dramatically over what we've seen in the past.
And it is because of the dynamic that you're talking about, which is, with the fewer flights, for someone to go from a small airport area to a trip that's going to land them in another small airport area with fewer flights to get through hubs, it's a day. I mean it's very challenging with those lower schedules. And I think health is also part of it. People feel more comfortable in getting into an aircraft with just themselves or family versus getting on to commercial aircraft.
So the issue is that this rebound, which has been much more pronounced than what we've seen in commercial, is all leisure. And so our belief is when you add business travel back on top of that, that you will see this in a very strong recovery. But again, today, even though we're seeing and very good -- feel very good about the rebound in travel, it really is only on the leisure side because you still have very little business travel. And that's what's muting it a little bit. But I expect that will change, again, as the economy starts to come back and people start to travel on business trips."

We continue to work on that program, but we are being a little cautious here to gate how much we spend and where we invest, understand what the regulatory environment is going to look like because there are 2 issues here. One is these are aircraft that are going to have human beings in them. And therefore, they will have to go through a full regulatory approval process. Those standards are evolving and trying to understand with certainty what it will take to certify such an aircraft.
And the other is the air taxi model. And again, we don't operate the air taxi model. But obviously, the business case of how much you invest and what the volume looks like will depend on how are these businesses going to operate. And again, there is, I believe, a real -- a lot of regulatory uncertainty as to getting approval for the routings and where are these things going to fly and at what altitudes and what kind of controlled airspace. For the sort of the vision that people have around the air taxi, there's still a lot of uncertainty around what that regulatory environment looks like.
So I would say that I think when you think about the technology that's involved and the ability to design and certify an aircraft that can meet that mission, our team in Bell is absolutely qualified and capable to do that, I would say far much more so than a lot of the other hype that you hear out there. But I do think we have to be cautious here in terms of not getting too far out front of a regulatory environment that's very uncertain in order to allow that business model to be successful."

As you go into 2022, first flight is at the end of 2022. So you have all of the cost in 2022, is really driven by the FARA program and completing all the design and getting ready for a flight test program. And you go into 2023, that's really the flight test program through the course of that year. So that's the program schedule. And so the relative level of R&D is highly driven by FARA, particularly as you get into '22, '23.

Adjusted net income on a non-GAAP measure was $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.35 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted net income for 2021 excludes $6 million of pretax special charges, $0.02 per share after tax-related to the 2020 restructuring plan and $15 million or $0.07 per share after tax was $256 million, up from $156 million in the first quarter of 2020.

Overall, the first quarter was a strong quarter for Textron. Segment margins were up 330 basis points in the quarter, driven by strong execution across all of our segments. At Bell, revenues were up in the quarter",673,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Overall, the first quarter was a strong quarter for Textron. Segment margins were up 330 basis points in the quarter, driven by strong execution across all of our segments. At Bell, revenues were up in the quarter on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues. On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 17 helicopters up from 15 in last year's first quarter. We saw solid order activity in the quarter across our commercial models, both domestically and internationally and across multiple end markets, including corporate, private, utility, and emergency medical services. On future vertical lift, that was awarded a contract modification of $293 million for the second phase of the competitive demonstration and reduction program for FLRAA. 
As we conclude final flight activity on the V-280, I think it's important to highlight the impressive performance milestones that the aircraft has demonstrated in over 215 flight hours over the past 3-plus years. This included 305 knots of demonstrated true airspeed, level 1 handling qualities and autonomous flight. On FLRAA, Bell is continuing with its build of the Invictus 360 prototype, where we are about 1/3 of the way through the manufacturing process in anticipation of first flight in Q4 of next year. 
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues were flat in the quarter while the business continued to execute well with improved operating margins. In the quarter, systems was awarded a contract to up to $607 million from the U.S. Army for the sustainment and modernization of existing shadow systems to the upgraded block 3 configuration. Also U.S. Army's future tactical unmanned air systems rodeo at Fort Benning and completed direct soldier flight demonstrations of our platform, the Aerosonde HQ. 
Systems is currently responding to the FTUAS RFI, which will help inform the next phase of that program. Systems also delivered the first RCV medium prototype to the Army customer as the requirements for the future of robotic combat vehicle programs. [indiscernible] at the operating sites related to the 3 awards of the U.S. Air Force CAPCAS program ran at the end of the quarter, we had 16 F1 aircraft certified for operation and deployed across our customer sites. In aviation, we were eventually flat in the quarter with slightly lower volume, reflecting lower aftermarket revenues, partially offset by higher pricing. We delivered 28 jets, up from 23 last year and 14 commercial turboprops, down from 16 in last year's first quarter. Order activity was strong in the quarter, resulting in backlog growth of $450 million to $2.1 billion at quarter  end. 
In the quarter, we delivered our 1,560 XL based Citation jet. This milestone delivery is a testament to the value and performance of this platform as well as Textron Aviation's commitment to the ongoing support of the fleet. We also announced the new CJ4 gen 2 and delivered 5 aircraft in the quarter. This model upgrade is another example of our continued investment in our existing portfolio of aircraft. On the new product front, the Sky car aircraft certification program continues to progress well as we work towards entering to service targeted towards the second half of this year. 
Moving to Industrial. Revenues were up from last year's first quarter, primarily driven by higher volume and price in our specialized vehicle product line. At specialized vehicles, we continue to see strong retail demand across our customer end markets. 
At Kautex, we saw our volume of fuel systems for hybrid electric vehicles more than double to about 9% of our total production volume in the quarter, the startup of 4 new models. While the retail demand in industrial owned markets has been improving, channel inventory remains below targeted levels as we work through supply shortages and disruptions, which we expect. 
In summary, it was a great start to the year. We've seen improving customer demand in our end markets, increased commercial and continued solid execution in our military businesses with strong cash generation in the quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Segment profit was $47 million in the first quarter, up from $3 million of profit last year, primarily due to a favorable impact from performance and the mix of products sold. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.1 billion. 
Moving to Bell, revenues were $846 million, up $23 million from last year on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues. Segment profit of $105 million was down $10 million, primarily due to higher research and development related to future vertical lift programs. 
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.2 billion. Revenues were $328 million, flat with a year ago. Segment profit of $51 million was up $25 million due to a $27 million favorable impact from Performance and Other. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.4 billion. Industrial revenues of $825 million were up $85 million from last year, primarily from higher volume and specialized vehicles and foreign exchange fluctuations. Segment profit was $47 million, up $38 million from the first quarter, primarily due to higher volume and mix, price, net of inflation and favorable performance at Specialized vehicles. 
Finance segment revenues were $15 million, and profit was $6 million. 
Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $40 million, and interest expense was $35 million. With respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded pretax charges of $6 million on the special charges line. We also completed the sale of True Canada in the quarter and realized a pretax gain of $15 million. Cash performance on manufacturing cash flow and a $501 million improvement over last year's first quarter as we continued our focus on inventory and working capital management.  In the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares, returning $91 million in cash to shareholders. 
To wrap up with guidance, we're raising our expected guidance of adjusted EPS to a range of $2.80 to $3 per share, up $0.10 from our prior outlook. We're reiterating our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million with planned pension contributions of $50 million.

Obviously, the number of cycles on aircraft continues to increase, particularly domestically in the U.S. March was actually up over where it was in 2019. These comps for 2020 are obviously kind of flaky, but if you look going back to 2019, the cycles domestically were up for our aircraft, which is great. I think it's still predominantly driven by a lot of personal travel and things like that, but we are clearly starting to see some corporate travel coming back. I mean I just personally as I'm traveling around to our businesses [indiscernible], you go out the restaurants, you're meeting, I mean, suppliers are starting to travel. Customers have starting to travel. You're starting to see more of that. And I think as that happens, we'll see more and more corporate level, flight department, buying activity pick up."

So those guys are staying very much on schedule in terms of what they've told us. We've just wrapped up our V-280 flight activity, which I think was a hugely successful program that demonstrated everything we wanted to demonstrate. So right now, the team is focused on the objectives of the second phase of the program, which is continuing to do risk reduction. So this thing makes a smooth transition from the risk reduction phase into a full blown program record.

They were never expecting some big top line adjustment. They have always said that they would fund this by reducing legacy funding, so they could put their focus on modernization.

So some of those swings, I think, are helping to strengthen the margins in the business. I think overall, the performance of the business has been quite strong. As you know, we're transitioning. We'll see this as we go forward on the transition from the development side of the ship to shore and the production side ship-to-shore, which clearly will have better margins than the development side. 
So I think as you look at those macro things, this is a performance that has a lot of good performing elements to it. And I expect they will continue to perform really well. As I said earlier, I think part of our guide increase is that we expect that we will probably have margins that are stronger than what we originally guided on the system side. I'd say also that business is pursuing an awful lot of new opportunities that will continue to come to roost over the course of the next couple 2, 3 years. So I think they're in a really good place. 
I do think we'll have a little bit of headwind noise as we get in the back half of the year here on some of our fee-for-service in Afghanistan. That wind down will take down some of our sites. I think we've been very conservative about how we run that business in terms of asset values. But -- and I think there are opportunities to redeploy those to other locations, which I think will happen, but you probably have a little bit of a gap between the sites that are operating today and future sites. So it's not a big impact, but it's enough that it will reduce a little bit of revenue and margin here probably in the back half of the year.

And I think largely, that comes down to the battery technology. So we've got teams, obviously, that have been following that and working on that, and we'll make our move, and we think it's the right time. And as to what the structure that might look like, that's sort of to be determined at this point."

Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today.

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Revenues in the quarter were $2.9 billion, up from $2.8 billion in last year's first quarter. During this year's first quarter, we reported net income of $0.75 per share. Adjusted net income on a non-GAAP measure was $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $0.35 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted net income for 2021 excludes $6 million of pretax special charges, $0.02 per share after tax related to the 2020 restructuring plan and $15 million of pretax gain on the sale of TRU Canada, $0.07 per share after tax.
Segment profit in the quarter was $256 million, up from $156 million in the first quarter of 2020.  Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $71 million, up $501 million from last year's first quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

Overall, the first quarter was a strong quarter for Textron. Segment margins were up 330 basis points in the quarter, driven by strong execution across all of our segments.

Segment margins were up 330 basis points in the quarter, driven by strong execution across all of our segments. At Bell, revenues were up in the quarter on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues.
On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 17 helicopters up from 15 in the last year's first quarter. We saw solid order activity in the quarter across our commercial models, both domestically and internationally and across multiple end markets, including corporate, private, utility, and emergency medical services. On future vertical lift, that was awarded a contract modification of $293 million for the second phase of the competitive demonstration and reduction program for FLRAA.
As we conclude final flight activity on the V-280, I think it's important to highlight the impressive performance milestones that the aircraft has demonstrated in over 215 flight hours over the past 3-plus years. This included 305 knots of demonstrated true airspeed, level 1 handling qualities and autonomous flight. On FLRAA, Bell is continuing with its build of the Invictus 360 prototype, where we are about 1/3 of the way through the manufacturing process in anticipation of first flight in Q4 of next year.
Moving to Textron Systems. Revenues were flat in the quarter while the business continued to execute well with improved operating margins. In the quarter, Systems was awarded a contract to up to $607 million from the U.S. Army for the sustainment and modernization of existing shadow systems to the upgraded Block III configuration. Also in the quarter, Systems successfully participated in the U.S. Army's Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems rodeo at Fort Benning and completed direct soldier flight demonstrations of our platform, the Aerosonde HQ.
Systems is currently responding to the FTUAS RFI, which will help inform the next phase of that program. Systems also delivered the first RCV medium prototype to the Army customer as they look to test these vehicles and define requirements for the future of robotic combat vehicle programs. At ATAC, we are continuing to ramp F1 flight hours at the operating sites related to the 3 awards of the U.S. Air Force CAPCAS program. At the end of the quarter, we had 16 F1 aircraft certified for operation and deployed across our customer sites.
In Aviation, revenues were up -- I'm sorry, revenues were eventually flat in the quarter with slightly lower volume, reflecting lower aftermarket revenues, partially offset by higher pricing. We delivered 28 jets, up from 23 last year and 14 commercial turboprops, down from 16 in last year's first quarter. Order activity was strong in the quarter, resulting in backlog growth of $450 million to $2.1 billion at quarter  end.
In the quarter, we delivered our 1,560 XL-based Citation jet. This milestone delivery is a testament to the value and performance of this platform as well as Textron Aviation's commitment to the ongoing support of the fleet. We also announced the new CJ4 Gen2 and delivered 5 aircraft in the quarter. This model upgrade is another example of our continued investment in our existing portfolio of aircraft. On the new product front, the Cessna SkyCourier aircraft certification program continues to progress well as we work towards entering to service targeted towards the second half of this year.
Moving to Industrial. Revenues were up from last year's first quarter, primarily driven by higher volume and price in our Specialized Vehicle product line. At Specialized Vehicles, we continue to see strong retail demand across our customer end markets.
At Kautex, we saw our volume of fuel systems for hybrid electric vehicles more than double to about 9% of our total production volume in the quarter, the startup of 4 new models. While the retail demand in industrial-owned markets has been improving, channel inventory remains below targeted levels as we work through supply shortages and disruptions, which we expect will improve throughout the course of the year.
In summary, it was a great start to the year. We've seen improving customer demand in our end markets, increased commercial order flow at Aviation and Bell and continued solid execution in our military businesses with strong cash generation in the quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $865 million were down $7 million from a year ago, largely due to lower aftermarket volume, partially offset by higher pricing. Segment profit was $47 million in the first quarter, up from $3 million of profit last year, primarily due to a favorable impact from performance and the mix of products sold. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.1 billion.
Moving to Bell. Revenues were $846 million, up $23 million from last year on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues. Segment profit of $105 million was down $10 million, primarily due to higher research and development in the quarter, largely related to future vertical lift programs. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.2 billion.
At Textron Systems, revenues were $328 million, flat with a year ago. Segment profit of $51 million was up $25 million due to a $27 million favorable impact from performance and other. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.4 billion.
Industrial revenues of $825 million were up $85 million from last year, primarily from higher volume and mix as well as price at Specialized Vehicles and foreign exchange fluctuations. Segment profit was $47 million, up $38 million from the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher volume and mix, price, net of inflation and favorable performance at Specialized Vehicles.
Finance segment revenues were $15 million, and profit was $6 million.
Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $40 million, and interest expense was $35 million. With respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded pretax charges of $6 million on the special charges line. We also completed the sale of TRU Canada in the quarter and realized a pretax gain of $15 million. Cash performance in the quarter was strong with $71 million on manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions, a $501 million improvement over last year's first quarter as we continued our focus on inventory and working capital management.
In the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares, returning $91 million in cash to shareholders.
To wrap up with guidance, we're raising our expected guidance of adjusted EPS to a range of $2.80 to $3 per share, up $0.10 from our prior outlook. We're reiterating our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million with planned pension contributions of $50 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So Brad, we can open the line for questions."

I think the overall demand environment is also more positive, right, so you've got more people that are looking to acquire aircraft than we've seen in quite some time.

These comps for 2020 are obviously kind of flaky, but if you look going back to 2019, the cycles domestically were up for our aircraft, which is great.

I mean, I think the team has been executing really well. As you know, over the last a couple of years, we had a lot of investment that was going into programs like the ATAC F1 program, and you had to make that expense and that investment ahead of winning those contracts in order to be eligible for those contracts. So we went through a period of having those expenses with no revenue. Those assets are now gainfully employed and out there generating revenue and margins. So some of those swings, I think, are helping to strengthen the margins in the business.
I think overall, the performance of the business has been quite strong. As you know, we're transitioning. We'll see this as we go forward on the transition from the development side of the ship-to-shore and the production side of the ship-to-shore, which clearly will have better margins than the development side.
So I think as you look at those macro things, this is a performance that has a lot of good performing elements to it. And I expect they will continue to perform really well. As I said earlier, I think part of our guide increase is that we expect that we will probably have margins that are stronger than what we originally guided on the Systems side. I'd say also that business is pursuing an awful lot of new opportunities that will continue to come to roost over the course of the next couple 2, 3 years. So I think they're in a really good place.
I do think we'll have a little bit of headwind, Noah, as we get in the back half of the year here on some of our fee-for-service in Afghanistan. That wind-down will take down some of our sites. I think we've been very conservative about how we run that business in terms of asset values. But -- and I think there are opportunities to redeploy those to other locations, which I think will happen, but you probably have a little bit of a gap between the sites that are operating today and the future sites. So it's not a big impact, but it's enough that it will reduce a little bit of revenue and margin here probably in the back half of the year.

I think our ability to execute on the design and development of an aircraft and the certification of an aircraft is quite proven. We've done this many times. I think we're sitting on an enormous amount of technological capability in terms of what we've done in the past and obviously, the technology of our teams. I mean, it takes some really talented people to go design and build and certify an aircraft, the fixed-wing or VTOL. We do think there's a potential for a very, very large market out there in that urban air mobility, but you have to make sure that all the technology you need to have in place to have a useful aircraft is there. And as I said earlier, I think in my mind, it largely comes down to around the battery technology.
So we have a great team of people. As you know, we created a sort of a breakout of a group called the eAviation that Rob Scholl is running for right now and pulling together the efforts and technology and engineers from across both the fixed-wing aviation, those at Textron Aviation as well as at Bell, some key resources out of our Systems business. So we are actively working on this. But again, you have to have the right propulsion system to make this work. And that's really going to be the gating item. And that's one that we're working on, and we're keeping an eye on it.
 
So -- but look, am I worried about some of these guys that have never certified an aircraft obviously going to dominate a market? I'm not worried about that at all. We're working on this, but we don't need to be wildly public or out there making crazy claims at this stage of the game. We're executing, and we'll pick our time and place to do it.

We had a strong second quarter with higher revenues across all of our manufacturing segments, operating margins of 9.1% and strong cash generation. The Bell revenues were up in the quarter on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues. On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 47 helicopters, up from 27 in last year's second quarter. We continue to see strong commercial demand and solid order activity in the quarter across all our commercial models, both domestically and internationally and across multiple end markets, including corporate, private, utility and EMS. Moving to future vertical lift in June following 214 flight hours over 3 years, Bell retired the V-280 Valor demonstrator aircraft. Over this 3-year period, the Valor successfully demonstrated all key performance parameters from the FA program, including low-speed agility, long-range crews, 305 knot high-speed flights, autonomous flight and rapid Mission Systems integration. On July 6, the Army issued the FARA RFP. The program remains on track to the Army schedule with bids due in September, followed by down-selected award in the second quarter of 2022. On FARA, Bell is about 45% of the way through its build of a [ 36V ] prototype. And lastly, Bell announced plans for new systems integration lab in Arlington to provide integration, verification and validation in on aircraft emission systems needed to meet the requirements for both FPL programs. 
Moving to Textron Systems. We saw another strong quarter execution with operating margins of 14.4%, up 310 basis points from last quarter. We saw a strong performance at ATAC driven by increased flight activity, led by our [ F1 ] fleet on the U.S. Air Force cash program, where we have made significant investments over the last few years. In June, C Systems delivered the third ship to shore Connector, [ Cat12 ] to the U.S. Navy. As development contract portion of this program continues to wind down through the remainder of 2021, we expect to see revenue growth and margin expansion on the program as we increase our activity on the production contract. Also in the quarter, Land Systems delivered the fourth and final Rip Solium 5 vehicle to the U.S. Army for RCV medium program. The customer will be an integration and testing the preparation for the 2022 soldier operational experiment. Land Systems also unveiled the Cottonmouth, vehicle purpose built for the U.S. Marine Corps advanced connaissance vehicle program selected for further prototype development under an anticipated OTA contract award. Offsetting higher revenues in most of its operating units in the quarter, we did experience some top line pressure at Air Systems largely related to the reduction in hours of our fee-for-service activities due to the U.S. Army's Afghanistan withdrawal and impact of the sale of the True Simulation business earlier this year. 
At Aviation, revenues were up in the quarter on higher volumes for Citation jets and commercial turboprops as well as in our aftermarket business. We delivered 44 jets, up from 23 last year and 33 commercial turboprops, up from 15 in last year's second quarter. We continue to see strong commercial demand and order activity for our aircraft, which resulted in backlog growth of $689 million to $2.7 billion at quarter end. 
Through the first half of the year, we recorded over $1.1 billion of backlog growth in Aviation. Both the Citation Longitude and Citation CJ4 Gen 2 received the ASO-type certification in the quarter. These certifications are expected to generate additional demand opportunities for each of these models. On the new product front, [ SeaSkyCar ] aircraft certification program has now accumulated over 1,200 flight hours and continues to progress well as we work towards entering the service targeted for later this year. 
Moving to Industrial. Revenues and margins were up at both Kautex and specialized vehicles from last year's second quarter, primarily due to higher volume and mix at each of the businesses. At Kautex, despite the higher revenues, we've experienced order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, which have directly impacted our production scheduling, resulting in intermittent line shutdowns and manufacturing efficiencies. 
At Specialized Vehicles, we saw higher revenues and improved operating performance from a strong retail pricing environment driven by continued high customer demand in our end markets. While we've experienced continued strong retail demand for our products, we have been impacted by our supply chain's ability to fully meet this demand, and we continue to work through these production challenges. 
In summary, we continue to see increased commercial order flow at Aviation and Bell, solid execution in our military businesses, strong retail demand for our products, the Industrial segment and improved cash generation that all contributed to the second quarter performance and our improved EPS and cash outlook. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Moving to Bell. Revenues were $891 million, up $69 million from last year on higher commercial revenues of $99 million, partially offset by lower military revenues. Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, primarily due to higher research and development costs in the quarter, largely related to the future vertical lift programs. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.8 billion. 
At Textron Systems, revenues were $333 million, up $7 million from a year ago. Segment profit of $48 million was up $11 million due to a favorable impact from performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.3 billion. 
Industrial revenues of $794 million were up $232 million from last year with $169 million from Fuel Systems and Functional Components and $63 million from Specialized Vehicles, largely reflecting higher volume and mix. Segment profit was $32 million, up $43 million from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the higher volume and mix at each of the businesses. Finance segment revenues were $12 million and profit was $3 million. 
Moving below segment profit. Corporate expenses were $37 million and interest expense was $32 million. With respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded a pretax charge of $4 million on the special charges line. We had another strong quarter of cash generation, reflecting our focus on working capital management across the segments and cash deposits from strong order activity at Aviation. Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $509 million, $294 million higher than last year's second quarter. 
In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares, returning $96 million in cash to shareholders, and we repaid at par $250 million of 5.95% notes with a stated maturity of September 2021. Following these activities, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. To wrap up, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 16%, reflecting increased tax credits related to higher qualifying domestic investments in R&D. We are raising our expected full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $3 to $3.20 per share, up $0.20 from our prior outlook. We're also raising our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to a range of $800 million to $900 million, up $200 million from our prior outlook, with planned pension contributions of $50 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions."

I think the Q will come out, you'll see that we had services was about -- aftermarket was about 31%. And when you account for that and you account for used aircraft sale, our book-to-bill actually probably is closer to [ 2% ] in terms of new equipment. That order activity continues to be strong here as we've gone through the end of the quarter. So I think -- The sustainability appears to be quite strong as we've seen through the course of the year, we have an awful lot of new customers coming into the market, which I think is great. We've got very low used aircraft at all for sale. I mean, it's sort at record low levels. So people that are coming into the market. There's not a whole lot to be had out there in terms of quality relatively new -- used aircraft, and that's driving a lot of strength in the new side. I think from everything we're seeing, it appears to be quite sustainable. The demand is, is there flying. If you look to that is at the highest levels we've seen in a very long time in terms of daily utilization. So I think demand, if you look at sort of the macro level, everything from charter to club to fractional the whole ownership is very strong. It's very U.S.-centric in terms of Jet right now, although we're starting to see some pickup in the South American and European markets, particularly on the turboprop side, we're starting to see more activity in South America. As you know, that those international markets tend to be the dominant part of our turboprop market, they haven't been just because they're a little slower. So I think when you look at the demand that we're seeing and then you start thinking about South America and the European markets, starting to come back. And frankly, just corporate. We're -- I think we're talking about a lot of high net worth individuals, small businesses, things like that are really driving it so far.  And the addition, I think as we go further into the year and start to see more corporate activity will help to make it a sustainable demand environment."

Systems, a couple hundred million -- I'm sorry, a couple of hundred basis points of better margin versus our initial guide. I don't think Bell's about where we expect it to be.

So there's no doubt that this business -- I think this industry is healthier when you've got more like a 6- to 9-month backlog. And it gives you better visibility. It's -- I think it's better for the customer in the end in terms of the ability to customize and get the configuration of the aircraft straight. So that's a lot of what we look at. So obviously, we are increasing the volume consistent with what our expectations were for the year. And obviously, you're feeling good about that increased rate as we go into next year given the backlog. But for sure, we want to be cautious here and not increase volume and get back to a situation where you just got too much short cycle sales going on."

So our participation on those platforms is very good and a good part of our business and a growing part of the business. On a pure BEV world, I think that we will see a transition just as we saw, frankly, Kautex became Kautex because you moved from metal gas tanks to plastic or composite gas tanks. And we think the same opportunity is there for battery enclosures, and we're working with a lot of the OEMs right now on opportunities to move from these metal battery and closure systems to a composite closure system. It's lower weight. It's lower cost, so it's very beneficial to the OEM and to the platform, and we're working through qualifications of those technologies as we speak."

Revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, up from $2.5 billion in last year's second quarter. During this year's second quarter, we reported net income of $0.81 per share. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was also $0.81 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2020.

We had a strong second quarter with higher revenues across all of our manufacturing segments, operating margins of 9.1% and strong cash generation.

We had a strong second quarter with higher revenues across all of our manufacturing segments, operating margins of 9.1% and strong cash generation. The Bell revenues were up in the quarter on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues. On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 47 helicopters, up from 27 in last year's second quarter. We continue to see strong commercial demand and solid order activity in the quarter across all our commercial models, both domestically and internationally and across multiple end markets, including corporate, private, utility and EMS.
Moving to future vertical lift in June following 214 flight hours over 3 years, Bell retired the V-280 Valor demonstrator aircraft. Over this 3-year period, the Valor successfully demonstrated all key performance parameters with FLRAA program, including low-speed agility, long-range crews, 305 knot high-speed flights, autonomous flight and rapid Mission Systems integration. On July 6, the Army issued the FLRAA RFP. The program remains on track to the Army schedule with bids due in September, followed by down-selected award in the second quarter of 2022. On FLRAA, Bell is about 45% of the way through its build of the 360 Invictus prototype. 
And lastly, Bell announced plans for new systems integration lab in Arlington to provide integration, verification and validation testing on aircraft emission systems needed to meet the requirements for both [indiscernible] programs. 
Moving to Textron Systems. We saw another strong quarter of execution with operating margins of 14.4%, up 310 basis points from last quarter. We saw a strong performance at ATAC driven by increased flight activity, led by our F1 fleet on the U.S. Air Force cash program, where we have made significant investments over the last few years. In June, Sea Systems delivered the third Ship-to-Shore Connector, LCAC 102 to the U.S. Navy. As development contract portion of this program continues to wind down through the remainder of 2021, we expect to see revenue growth and margin expansion on the program as we increase our activity on the production time frame.
Also in the quarter, Land Systems delivered the fourth and final Ripsaw M5 vehicle to the U.S. Army for RCV medium program. The customer will be geting integration and testing of these vehicle in preparation for the 2022 soldier operational experiment. Land Systems also unveiled the Cottonmouth, vehicle purpose built for the U.S. Marine Corps Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle program and was recently selected for further prototype development under an anticipated OTA contract award. Offsetting higher revenues in most of its operating units in the quarter, we did experience some top line pressure at [ Air Systems ] largely related to the reduction in hours of our fee-for-service activities due to the U.S. Army's Afghanistan withdrawal and impact of the sale of the TRU Simulation business earlier this year. 
At Aviation, revenues were up in the quarter on higher volumes for Citation jets and commercial turboprops as well as in our aftermarket business. We delivered 44 jets, up from 23 last year and 33 commercial turboprops, up from 15 in last year's second quarter. We continue to see strong commercial demand and order activity for our aircraft, which resulted in backlog growth of $689 million to $2.7 billion at quarter end.
Through the first half of the year, we recorded over $1.1 billion of backlog growth in Aviation. Both the Citation Longitude and Citation CJ4 Gen2 received the ASO type certification in the quarter. The certification is expected to generate additional demand opportunities for each of these models. 
On the new product front, Cessna SkyCourier aircraft certification program has now accumulated over 1,200 flight hours and continues to progress well as we work towards entering the service targeted for later this year.
Moving to Industrial. Revenues and margins were up at both Kautex and Specialized Vehicles from last year's second quarter, primarily due to higher volume and mix at each of the businesses. At Kautex, despite the higher revenues, we've experienced order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, which have directly impacted our production scheduling, resulting in intermittent line shutdowns and manufacturing efficiencies. 
At Specialized Vehicles, we saw higher revenues and improved operating performance from a strong retail pricing environment driven by continued high customer demand in our end markets. While we've experienced continued strong retail demand for our products, we have been impacted by our supply chain's ability to fully meet this demand, and we continue to work through these production challenges.
In summary, we continue to see increased commercial order flow at Aviation and Bell, solid execution in our military businesses, strong retail demand for our products, the Industrial segment and improved cash generation that all contributed to the second quarter performance and our improved EPS and cash outlook. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.2 billion were up $414 million from a year ago, largely due to higher Citation jet volume of $174 million, aftermarket volume of $98 million and commercial turboprop volume of $75 million. Segment profit was $96 million in the second quarter, up $162 million from last year's second quarter due to the higher volume and mix of $117 million, a favorable impact from performance of $34 million and favorable pricing net of inflation of $11 million. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.7 billion. 
Moving to Bell. Revenues were $891 million, up $69 million from last year on higher commercial revenues of $99 million, partially offset by lower military revenues. Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, primarily due to higher research and development costs in the quarter, largely related to the future vertical lift programs. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.8 billion. 
At Textron Systems, revenues were $333 million, up $7 million from a year ago. Segment profit of $48 million was up $11 million due to a favorable impact from performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.3 billion. 
Industrial revenues of $794 million were up $232 million from last year with $169 million from Fuel Systems and Functional Components and $63 million from Specialized Vehicles, largely reflecting higher volume and mix. Segment profit was $32 million, up $43 million from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the higher volume and mix at each of the businesses. 
Finance segment revenues were $12 million and profit was $3 million. 
Moving below segment profit. Corporate expenses were $37 million and interest expense was $32 million. With respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded a pretax charge of $4 million on the special charges line. We had another strong quarter of cash generation, reflecting our focus on working capital management across the segments and cash deposited from strong order activity at Aviation. Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $509 million, $294 million higher than last year's second quarter.
In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares, returning $96 million in cash to shareholders, and we repaid at par $250 million of 5.95% notes with a stated maturity of September 2021. Following these activities, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. 
To wrap up, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 16%, reflecting increased tax credits related to higher qualifying domestic investments in R&D. We are raising our expected full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $3 to $3.20 per share, up $0.20 from our prior outlook. We're also raising our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to a range of $800 million to $900 million, up $200 million from our prior outlook, with planned pension contributions of $50 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions."

I think the [indiscernible] come out, you'll see that we had -- services was about -- aftermarket was about 31%. And when you account for that and you account for used aircraft sale, our book-to-bill actually probably is closer to 2 in terms of new equipment. That order activity continues to be strong here as we've gone through the end of the quarter. So I think -- The sustainability appears to be quite strong as we've seen through the course of the year, we have an awful lot of new customers coming into the market, which I think is great. We've got very low used aircraft available for sale. I mean, it's sort of record low levels. So people that are coming into the market. There's not a whole lot to be had out there in terms of quality, relatively new used aircraft, and that's driving a lot of strength in the new side. 
I think from everything we're seeing, it appears to be quite sustainable. The demand is, is there flying. If you look to that is at the highest levels we've seen in a very long time in terms of daily utilization. So I think demand, if you look at sort of the macro level, everything from charter to club to fractional the whole ownership is very strong. It's very U.S. centric in terms of jet right now, although we're starting to see some pickup in the South American and European markets, particularly on the turboprop side, we're starting to see more activity in South America. As you know, that those international markets tend to be the dominant part of our turboprop market, they haven't been just because they're a little slower. 
So I think when you look at the demand that we're seeing and then you start thinking about South America and the European markets, starting to come back. And frankly, just corporate. We're -- I think we're talking about a lot of high net worth individuals, small businesses, things like that are really driving it so far.  And in addition, I think as we go further into the year and start to see more corporate activity, we will have to make it a sustainable demand environment."

Systems, a couple hundred million -- I'm sorry, a couple of hundred basis points of better margin versus our initial guide. I don't think Bell's about where we expect it to be.

There was too much short cycle sale going on as it's particularly challenging for the factory to do that, to load things the right way to not have rework when people buy on short cycle and you're reconfiguring and tailoring the aircraft too late in that manufacturing cycle.  So there's no doubt that this business -- I think this industry is healthier when you've got more like a 6- to 9-month backlog. And it gives you better visibility. It's -- I think it's better for the customer in the end in terms of the ability to customize and get the configuration of the aircraft straight. So that's a lot of what we look at.

Revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, up from $2.5 billion in last year's second quarter. During this year's second quarter, we reported net income of $0.81 per share. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was also $0.81 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2020.

We had a strong second quarter with higher revenues across all of our manufacturing segments, operating margins of 9.1% and strong cash generation. The Bell revenues were up in the quarter on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues. On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 47 helicopters, up from 27 in last year's second quarter. We continue to see strong commercial demand and solid order activity in the quarter across all our commercial models, both domestically and internationally and across multiple end markets, including corporate, private, utility and EMS.
Moving to future vertical lift. In June following 214 flight hours over 3 years, Bell retired the V-280 Valor Demonstrator aircraft. Over this 3-year period, the Valor successfully demonstrated all key performance parameters with FLRAA program, including low-speed agility, long-range cruise, 305-knot high-speed flights, autonomous flight and rapid mission systems integration. On July 6, the Army issued the FLRAA RFP. The program remains on track to the Army schedule with bids due in September, followed by a down-selected award in the second quarter of 2022. On FLRAA, Bell is about 45% of the way through its build of the 360 Invictus prototype. 
And lastly, Bell announced plans for a new systems integration lab in Arlington to provide integration, verification and validation testing on aircraft emission systems needed to meet the requirements for both FVL programs. 
Moving to Textron Systems. We saw another strong quarter of execution with operating margins of 14.4%, up 310 basis points from last quarter. We saw a strong performance at ATAC driven by increased flight activity, led by our F1 fleet on the U.S. Air Force CAPCAS program, where we have made significant investments over the last few years. In June, Sea Systems delivered the third Ship-to-Shore Connector, LCAC 102, to the U.S. Navy. As the development contract portion of this program continues to wind down through the remainder of 2021, we expect to see revenue growth and margin expansion on the program as we increase our activity on the production time frame.
Also in the quarter, Land Systems delivered the fourth and final Ripsaw M5 vehicle to the U.S. Army for RCV medium program. The customer will begin integration and testing of these vehicles in preparation for the 2022 Soldier Operational Experiment. Land Systems also unveiled the Cottonmouth, a vehicle purpose built for the U.S. Marine Corps' Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle program and was recently selected for further prototype development under an anticipated OTA contract award. Offsetting higher revenues in most of its operating units in the quarter, we did experience some top line pressure at Air Systems largely related to the reduction in hours of our fee-for-service activities due to the U.S. Army's Afghanistan withdrawal and impact of the sale of the TRU Simulation business earlier this year. 
At Aviation, revenues were up in the quarter on higher volumes for Citation jets and commercial turboprops as well as in our aftermarket business. We delivered 44 jets, up from 23 last year and 33 commercial turboprops, up from 15 in last year's second quarter. We continue to see strong commercial demand and order activity for our aircraft, which resulted in backlog growth of $689 million to $2.7 billion at quarter end.
Through the first half of the year, we recorded over $1.1 billion of backlog growth in Aviation. Both the Citation Longitude and Citation CJ4 Gen2 received EASA Type Certification in the quarter. The certification is expected to generate additional demand opportunities for each of these models. 
On the new product front, Cessna SkyCourier aircraft certification program has now accumulated over 1,200 flight hours and continues to progress well as we work towards entering the service targeted for later this year.
Moving to Industrial. Revenues and margins were up at both Kautex and Specialized Vehicles from last year's second quarter, primarily due to higher volume and mix at each of the businesses. At Kautex, despite the higher revenues, we've experienced order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, which have directly impacted our production scheduling, resulting in intermittent line shutdowns and manufacturing efficiencies. 
At Specialized Vehicles, we saw higher revenues and improved operating performance from a strong retail pricing environment driven by continued high customer demand in our end markets. While we've experienced continued strong retail demand for our products, we have been impacted by our supply chain's ability to fully meet this demand, and we continue to work through these production challenges.
In summary, we continue to see increased commercial order flow at Aviation and Bell, solid execution in our military businesses, strong retail demand for our products in Industrial segment and improved cash generation that all contributed to the second quarter performance and our improved EPS and cash outlook. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.2 billion were up $414 million from a year ago, largely due to higher Citation jet volume of $174 million, aftermarket volume of $98 million and commercial turboprop volume of $75 million. Segment profit was $96 million in the second quarter, up $162 million from last year's second quarter due to the higher volume and mix of $117 million, a favorable impact from performance of $34 million and favorable pricing net of inflation of $11 million. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.7 billion. 
Moving to Bell. Revenues were $891 million, up $69 million from last year on higher commercial revenues of $99 million, partially offset by lower military revenues. Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, primarily due to higher research and development costs in the quarter, largely related to the future vertical lift programs. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.8 billion. 
At Textron Systems, revenues were $333 million, up $7 million from a year ago. Segment profit of $48 million was up $11 million due to a favorable impact from performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.3 billion. 
Industrial revenues of $794 million were up $232 million from last year with $169 million from Fuel Systems and Functional Components and $63 million from Specialized Vehicles, largely reflecting higher volume and mix. Segment profit was $32 million, up $43 million from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the higher volume and mix at each of the businesses.  Finance segment revenues were $12 million and profit was $3 million. 
Moving below segment profit. Corporate expenses were $37 million and interest expense was $32 million. With respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded a pretax charge of $4 million on the special charges line. We had another strong quarter of cash generation, reflecting our focus on working capital management across the segments and cash deposited from strong order activity at Aviation. Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $509 million, $294 million higher than last year's second quarter.
In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares, returning $96 million in cash to shareholders, and we repaid at par $250 million of 5.95% notes with a stated maturity of September 2021. Following these activities, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. 
To wrap up, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 16%, reflecting increased tax credits related to higher qualifying domestic investments in R&D. We are raising our expected full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $3 to $3.20 per share, up $0.20 from our prior outlook. We're also raising our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to a range of $800 million to $900 million, up $200 million from our prior outlook, with planned pension contributions of $50 million.

I think that we'll come out -- you'll see that we had -- services was about -- aftermarket was about 31%. At least when you account for that and you account for used aircraft sale, our book-to-bill actually probably is closer to 2 in terms of new equipment. That order activity continues to be strong here as we've gone through the end of the quarter. So I think -- the sustainability appears to be quite strong. As we've seen through the course of the year, we have an awful lot of new customers coming into the market, which I think is great. We've got very low used aircraft available for sale. I mean, it's sort of at record low levels. So people that are coming into the market, there's not a whole lot to be had out there in terms of quality, relatively new used aircraft, and that's driving a lot of strength in the new side. 
I think from everything we're seeing, it appears to be quite sustainable. The demand is there in flying. If you look to that, it's at the highest levels we've seen in a very long time in terms of daily utilization. So I think demand, if you look at sort of the macro level, everything from charter to club to fractional to whole ownership, it is very strong. It's very U.S. centric in terms of jet right now, although we're starting to see some pickup in the South American and European markets. Particularly on the turboprop side, we're starting to see more activity in South America. As you know, that -- those international markets tend to be the dominant part of our turboprop market. They haven't been just because they're a little slower. 
So I think when you look at the demand that we're seeing and then you start thinking about South America and the European markets starting to come back, and frankly, just corporate. We're -- I think we're talking about a lot of high net worth individuals, small businesses, things like that are really driving it so far.  And in addition, I think as we go further into the year and start to see more corporate activity, we will have to make it a sustainable demand environment."

It takes a while for that to happen. So I don't think -- it's not a horrible story. It's just the reality of the pullback in Afghanistan. And I think we've been conservative in terms of how we manage those assets. The team has done a great job with that. So it's not a bottom line problem right now. I do think a lot of those assets will get redeployed into other opportunities. But it is creating a little bit of a top line headwind.

We're certainly seeing a little more linearity, a stronger delivery here in Q2. And that's helping to give us a more linear -- a better managed working capital, I would say.
So in terms of the modeling around EPS, that is kind of -- help a little bit here is, think about aviation being up a couple of hundred million on revenue and a couple of hundred basis points of better margin versus the guide. Systems, a couple hundred million -- I'm sorry, a couple of hundred basis points of better margin versus our initial guide. I don't think Bell's -- Bell is about where we expect it to be. They're performing well, but they're performing more or less to the guide. And I think industrial will probably be around in that same area, right?

There was too much short cycle sale going on as it's particularly challenging for the factory to do that, to load things the right way, to not have rework when people buy on short cycle and you're reconfiguring and tailoring the aircraft too late in that manufacturing cycle.  So there's no doubt that this business -- I think this industry is healthier when you've got more like a 6- to 9-month backlog. And it gives you better visibility. It's -- I think it's better for the customer in the end in terms of the ability to customize and get the configuration of the aircraft straight. So that's a lot of what we look at.

I mean, obviously, there's other opportunities out there where we have customers that want to buy numbers of aircraft. 
You probably saw the announcement around the Caravan deal. Obviously, we've had programs like with SkyCourier, for instance, with FedEx, which are large aircraft acquisitions. But I don't think we've seen anything different or unique going on or the difference between fleet or retail and our bias one way or the other. If there's a good fleet opportunity, then -- that we'll compete hard for that. But the bulk of our sales, when you look at this, the order book and what's going on, are individual aircraft sales."

Revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, up from $2.5 billion in last year's second quarter. During this year's second quarter, we reported net income of $0.81 per share. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was also $0.81 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2020.

We had a strong second quarter with higher revenues across all of our manufacturing segments, operating margins of 9.1% and strong cash generation. The Bell revenues were up in the quarter on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues. On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 47 helicopters, up from 27 in last year's second quarter. We continue to see strong commercial demand and solid order activity in the quarter across all our commercial models, both domestically and internationally and across multiple end markets, including corporate, private, utility and EMS.
Moving to future vertical lift. In June following 214 flight hours over 3 years, Bell retired the V-280 Valor Demonstrator aircraft. Over this 3-year period, the Valor successfully demonstrated all key performance parameters with FLRAA program, including low-speed agility, long-range cruise, 305-knot high-speed flights, autonomous flight and rapid mission systems integration. On July 6, the Army issued the FLRAA RFP. The program remains on track to the Army schedule with bids due in September, followed by a down-selected award in the second quarter of 2022. On FLRAA, Bell is about 45% of the way through its build of the 360 Invictus prototype. 
And lastly, Bell announced plans for a new systems integration lab in Arlington to provide integration, verification and validation testing on aircraft emission systems needed to meet the requirements for both FVL programs. 
Moving to Textron Systems. We saw another strong quarter of execution with operating margins of 14.4%, up 310 basis points from last quarter. We saw a strong performance at ATAC driven by increased flight activity, led by our F1 fleet on the U.S. Air Force CAPCAS program, where we have made significant investments over the last few years. In June, Sea Systems delivered the third Ship-to-Shore Connector, LCAC 102, to the U.S. Navy. As the development contract portion of this program continues to wind down through the remainder of 2021, we expect to see revenue growth and margin expansion on the program as we increase our activity on the production time frame.
Also in the quarter, Land Systems delivered the fourth and final Ripsaw M5 vehicle to the U.S. Army for RCV medium program. The customer will begin integration and testing of these vehicles in preparation for the 2022 Soldier Operational Experiment. Land Systems also unveiled the Cottonmouth, a vehicle purpose built for the U.S. Marine Corps' Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle program and was recently selected for further prototype development under an anticipated OTA contract award. Offsetting higher revenues in most of its operating units in the quarter, we did experience some top line pressure at Air Systems largely related to the reduction in hours of our fee-for-service activities due to the U.S. Army's Afghanistan withdrawal and impact of the sale of the TRU Simulation business earlier this year. 
At Aviation, revenues were up in the quarter on higher volumes for Citation jets and commercial turboprops as well as in our aftermarket business. We delivered 44 jets, up from 23 last year and 33 commercial turboprops, up from 15 in last year's second quarter. We continue to see strong commercial demand and order activity for our aircraft, which resulted in backlog growth of $689 million to $2.7 billion at quarter end.
Through the first half of the year, we recorded over $1.1 billion of backlog growth in Aviation. Both the Citation Longitude and Citation CJ4 Gen2 received EASA Type Certification in the quarter. These certifications are expected to generate additional demand opportunities for each of these models. 
On the new product front, Cessna SkyCourier aircraft certification program has now accumulated over 1,200 flight hours and continues to progress well as we work towards entering the service targeted for later this year.
Moving to Industrial. Revenues and margins were up at both Kautex and Specialized Vehicles from last year's second quarter, primarily due to higher volume and mix at each of the businesses. At Kautex, despite the higher revenues, we've experienced order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, which have directly impacted our production scheduling, resulting in intermittent line shutdowns and manufacturing efficiencies. 
At Specialized Vehicles, we saw higher revenues and improved operating performance from a strong retail pricing environment driven by continued high customer demand in our end markets. While we've experienced continued strong retail demand for our products, we have been impacted by our supply chain's ability to fully meet this demand, and we continue to work through these production challenges.
In summary, we continue to see increased commercial order flow at Aviation and Bell, solid execution in our military businesses, strong retail demand for our products in Industrial segment and improved cash generation that all contributed to the second quarter performance and our improved EPS and cash outlook. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.2 billion were up $414 million from a year ago, largely due to higher Citation jet volume of $174 million, aftermarket volume of $98 million and commercial turboprop volume of $75 million. Segment profit was $96 million in the second quarter, up $162 million from last year's second quarter due to the higher volume and mix of $117 million, a favorable impact from performance of $34 million and favorable pricing net of inflation of $11 million. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.7 billion. 
Moving to Bell. Revenues were $891 million, up $69 million from last year on higher commercial revenues of $99 million, partially offset by lower military revenues. Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, primarily due to higher research and development costs in the quarter, largely related to the future vertical lift programs. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.8 billion. 
At Textron Systems, revenues were $333 million, up $7 million from a year ago. Segment profit of $48 million was up $11 million due to a favorable impact from performance. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.3 billion. 
Industrial revenues of $794 million were up $232 million from last year with $169 million from Fuel Systems and Functional Components and $63 million from Specialized Vehicles, largely reflecting higher volume and mix. Segment profit was $32 million, up $43 million from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the higher volume and mix at each of the businesses.  Finance segment revenues were $12 million and profit was $3 million. 
Moving below segment profit. Corporate expenses were $37 million and interest expense was $32 million. With respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded a pretax charge of $4 million on the special charges line. We had another strong quarter of cash generation, reflecting our focus on working capital management across the segments and cash deposited from strong order activity at Aviation. Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $509 million, $294 million higher than last year's second quarter.
In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares, returning $96 million in cash to shareholders, and we repaid at par $250 million of 5.95% notes with a stated maturity of September 2021. Following these activities, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. 
To wrap up, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 16%, reflecting increased tax credits related to higher qualifying domestic investments in R&D. We are raising our expected full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $3 to $3.20 per share, up $0.20 from our prior outlook. We're also raising our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to a range of $800 million to $900 million, up $200 million from our prior outlook, with planned pension contributions of $50 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions."

I think that we'll come out -- you'll see that we had -- services was about -- aftermarket was about 31%. At least when you account for that and you account for used aircraft sale, our book-to-bill actually probably is closer to 2 in terms of new equipment. That order activity continues to be strong here as we've gone through the end of the quarter. So I think -- the sustainability appears to be quite strong. As we've seen through the course of the year, we have an awful lot of new customers coming into the market, which I think is great. We've got very low used aircraft available for sale. I mean, it's sort of at record low levels. So people that are coming into the market, there's not a whole lot to be had out there in terms of quality, relatively new used aircraft, and that's driving a lot of strength in the new side. 
I think from everything we're seeing, it appears to be quite sustainable. The demand is there in flying. If you look to that, it's at the highest levels we've seen in a very long time in terms of daily utilization. So I think demand, if you look at sort of the macro level, everything from charter to club to fractional to whole ownership, it is very strong. It's very U.S. centric in terms of jet right now, although we're starting to see some pickup in the South American and European markets. Particularly on the turboprop side, we're starting to see more activity in South America. As you know, that -- those international markets tend to be the dominant part of our turboprop market. They haven't been just because they're a little slower. 
So I think when you look at the demand that we're seeing and then you start thinking about South America and the European markets starting to come back, and frankly, just corporate. We're -- I think we're talking about a lot of high net worth individuals, small businesses, things like that are really driving it so far.  And in addition, I think as we go further into the year and start to see more corporate activity, we will have to make it in a sustainable demand environment."

So in terms of the modeling around EPS, that is kind of -- help a little bit here is, think about aviation being up a couple of hundred million on revenue and a couple of hundred basis points of better margin versus the guide. Systems, a couple hundred million -- I'm sorry, a couple of hundred basis points of better margin versus our initial guide. I don't think Bell's -- Bell is about where we expect it to be.

So there's no doubt that this business -- I think this industry is healthier when you've got more like a 6- to 9-month backlog. And it gives you better visibility. It's -- I think it's better for the customer in the end in terms of the ability to customize and get the configuration of the aircraft straight. So that's a lot of what we look at.

Obviously, a number of those folks are people that have been laid off and have come back into the company, but we're happy to do additional hiring beyond that. 
And look, it's -- I think everybody in the country is having the same challenge with some of the programs that are out there, but those programs should wind down as we get, I think, into that Labor Day time frame. So we are hiring. It is a challenge. I think hiring will get easier as the year goes on and we get off some of these unemployment programs that are frankly, creating huge disincentives for people not to work."

So the fuel systems have some unique technologies for those hybrid applications, and we've done well in that space. And the volume of that, frankly, continues to grow, and it's growing even faster now sort of post COVID than even it was on pre-COVID. So our participation on those platforms is very good and a good part of our business and a growing part of the business. 
On a pure BEV world, I think that we will see a transition just as we saw, frankly, Kautex became Kautex because you move from metal gas tanks to plastic or composite gas tanks. And we think the same opportunity is there for battery enclosures, and we're working with a lot of the OEMs right now on opportunities to move from these metal battery enclosure systems to a composite closure system. It's lower weight. It's lower cost, so it's very beneficial to the OEM and to the platform, and we're working through qualifications of those technologies as we speak."

Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings, and also in today's press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Revenues in the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion in last year's third quarter. During this year's third quarter, we reported income from continuing operations of $0.82 per share. Adjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.85 per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Segment profit in the quarter was $279 million, up $90 million from the third quarter of 2020. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $271 million in the quarter and $851 million year-to-date. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

We continue to execute well across the company in the quarter. At Aviation, we continue to see a solid recovery in the general aviation market with strong commercial demand, increased deliveries in citation jets and commercial total crops and higher aftermarket volume. We delivered 49 jets, up from 25 last year and 35 commercial total crops, up from 21 in last year's third quarter. Order activity in the quarter remained very strong, resulting in backlog growth of $721 million bringing us to $3.5 billion at the quarter end. 
Also in the third quarter, the Beechcraft King Air 360 and 260 achieved AAS certification and began to deliver customers throughout the region. Continuing with our product strategy of upgrading existing models at NBAA, we recently announced the Citation M2 Gen 2 and the XLS Gen 2 product upgrades. Also on the new product front, such as Sky Courier is continuing to progress through certification with over 1,600 hours of flight test activity and the Beechcraft Analia successfully completed its initial ground engine runs powered by GE's new Catalyst engine. At Bell revenues were down 3% in the quarter, largely on lower military revenues. On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 33 helicopters down 41 in last year's third quarter. 
Moving to future vertical lift. In September, Bell submit its proposal for the flower program, a down selected award is expected in the second quarter of 2022. On FARA, Bell is about 60% of the way through its build of the 360 Vigus prototype and remains on schedule. Also in the quarter, Bell inducted the first U.S. Air Force CV-22 for its nacelle improvement modifications. 
Moving to systems. We saw another strong quarter of execution with operating margins at 15.1%, up 190 basis points from last year's third quarter. ATAC continued to expand its fleet of certified F1 aircraft with 2 additional aircraft entering service in the quarter bringing the total fleet to 19 aircraft at the end of the quarter. The fleet continues to support higher customer demand for adversary air services, driving higher revenues in the quarter. At Air Systems, the team booked $25 million in new orders in the quarter, including both fee-for-service activities as well as new hardware. 
Moving to Industrial, overall revenues were lower in the quarter as we continue to experience manufacturing disruptions related to supply chain challenges. In Kautex, we again saw order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, which have directly impacted production scheduling and resulting in intermittent line shutdowns of manufacturing efficiencies. At Specialized Vehicles, we saw continued strong demand in our end markets with higher pricing, which offset production disruptions from part shortages. 
To wrap up, Textron delivered a solid quarter with increased aviation backlog, improved manufacturing margins and continued strong cash generation while working to minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.2 billion were up $386 million from a year ago, largely due to higher Citation jet volume of $290 million, aftermarket volume of $62 million and commercial turboprop volume of $48 million. Segment profit was $9 million in the third quarter, up $127 million from a year ago, largely due to the higher volume and mix of $96 million and favorable pricing net of inflation of $22 million. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $3.5 billion. 
Moving to Bell. Revenues were $769 million, down $24 million from last year, largely reflecting lower military revenues. Segment profit of $105 million was down $14 million primarily due to lower military revenues. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.1 billion. At Textron Systems, revenues were $299 million, down $3 million from last year's third quarter due to lower volume of $39 million at Air Systems, which primarily reflected the impact from the U.S. Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan on its fee-for-service contracts, partially offset by higher volume, primarily at ATAC and Electronic Systems. Segment profit of $45 million was up $5 million to a favorable impact from performance and other. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.2 billion. 
Industrial revenues were $730 million, down $102 million from last year, reflecting lower volume and mix of $156 million primarily at fuel systems and functional components, reflecting order disruptions related to the global OEM supply shortages, partially offset by favorable impact of $44 million from pricing, largely at specialized vehicles. Segment profit of $23 million was down $35 million from the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the lower volume and mix described above, partially offset by higher pricing net of inflation and specialized vehicles. 
Finance segment revenues of $11 million were $11 million and profit was $8 million. Moving below segment profit. Corporate expenses were $23 million and interest expense was $28 million. With respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded pretax charges of $10 million on the special charges line. Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $271 million in the quarter and $851 million year-to-date as compared to $129 million for the corresponding 9-month period in 2020. Year-to-date, our cash generation reflects improved working capital management, which includes [Audio Gap] we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares, returning $299 million in cash to shareholders. We're raising our expected full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $3.20 to $3.30 per share. This includes revised tax guidance at effective rate of 15.5% for the full year. We're also raising our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up $200 million from our prior outlook, with planned pension contributions of $50 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, so we can open the line for questions."

I think the backlog is fairly broad in terms of the makeup of those customers. It still remains more U.S.-centric. I think when we look at order activity in the quarter on the jet side, it's probably roughly 70% were so domestic versus 30% international. So I think we'll continue to see the shift. It's a little bit more international as Europe is starting to pick up and South America is starting to pick up. But it is still more North America-centric. It's probably closer to 50-50 on the turboprops, that's usually been a market where it's the turboprops Kongers and such caravans usually end up being more international. I think it will continue to shift that way. But right now, it's closer to 50-50. Obviously, there's a mix of the next year or so deliveries of what we have coming up with NetJets, but we have very strong retail individual customers in there. It's -- if I looked at the number of new customers, folks that are coming in buying a jet who have not owned a jet before, that number probably is somewhere around the 20% or so kind of a range. So which is encouraging. We do see a lot of people. As you know, buying a jet and you've not had an aircraft before is a little bit of a daunting task. One of the things we do in our business is we have a whole dedicated team that helps someone who's not owned an aircraft like that before, but wants to do that, and we help them with the complex issues of pilots and hangers and insurance and all the things that you have to look at to do that to successfully place that aircraft with a brand new customer. But for sure, we're seeing a lot more interest in demand from from those first-time buyers than we would historically see."

But for sure, the order activity which has been getting stronger as we've worked our way through the year and remain strong, supports that number, and we'll be looking hard at that backlog and that order rate as we finalize our production ramps and aviation. I mean, clearly, right now, we are in the process of ramping up production with the goal, as we stated, to get up to that 2019 level and there's probably room for a little bit beyond that, but we'll give you the final guys when we get into January."

I mean as I said at NBAA, we put the Gen 2 version of that, the Gen2 version of XLS, has been a fabulous aircraft for us for a long time, and it's a really nice update that I think is sparking even greater new interest in that aircraft as well. So it's really across the board. And look, we're not going to get into details on the model by model on the backlog. But as we've said before, I think this business, this industry, frankly, operates better if it's sort of looking at a 9- to 12-month sort of backlog, and that it gives a customer who has an aircraft time to sell the aircraft. It gives them time to specify the interiors and colors and paints. Obviously, it makes it much easier for us in terms of our production forecasting and then smooth production line flow. And as you know, that -- historically, that's how this industry works. This last decade has been unusual where you're actually having to try to build to forecast instead. So I do think 1 of the things that we certainly keep in mind as we look at production rates is that we want this business to be out there as sort of a 9- to 12-month kind of a backlog business. So it's a much healthier way to run the business. I think it's better for the customers, again, for their planning perspective and marketing of used aircraft if they already have an aircraft, which is the majority of our customers. 
So I think that that's a healthy place for the business to be, and that's kind of where I feel like we are right now."

I mean I think there's a limit to how far out someone is willing to say, okay, I'm going to wait for a year. It's probably on that shorter side on maybe a smaller aircraft, where there's not as much customization. It's a little quick return. But I think on a larger aircraft, you see it move out on that in more of that 12 months or so. So there's not an absolute dollar number we look at, but we do look at demand model by model. And where we think that backlog that cycle time is reasonable in terms of where -- how it fits with our production planning, how it fits with our customers' expectations.

I would say we're not seeing big issues right now in our -- in the supply chain associated with the A&D businesses. My view is -- most of these suppliers also do defense work, much like our company. And so most of them didn't go through an entirely hard shutdown, as you saw a lot of the commercial world doing. Also, as you know, a lot of these suppliers also have a lot of business that goes into the commercial aviation space with the Airbuses and the Boeings of the world and those guys are not back anywhere near the demand that they used to have. So there's capacity available in these supply chains. So as we work our way through this thing, most of our critical suppliers in the A&D space are able to meet our demand. I'm not suggesting there's never an issue or a problem, but those things pop up here and there. It's also a longer cycle supply chain. So if you do have a problem or a challenge, you've got more time to work on it and go manage it and look for alternatives and work with the supplier around that, whereas in the industrial and commercial world, you tend to find out a vital problem it's going to hurt you on Tuesday, the previous Friday. So we don't see as much of that in the A&D side. 
So I don't think when we look at this, we feel like we're going to be supplier constrained at this stage of the game.

In the case of Kautex, where we're a Tier 1 guy, we're sort of following the OEM path, right? So we don't independently set that. It's -- 1 of the challenges, frankly, this year is there's been a lot of disruption that the OEMs have felt and changing model types and volumes through the course of the year as a result of other supply chain issues. Fortunately, the Kautex guys have done a nice job in not being the problem, right? I mean we've been able to fulfill whatever demand is placed on us, and certainly, we don't want to be the reason they can't run a line. So I think our guys have done a really nice job of that. But we look really at the IHS data, Pete, in terms of how it -- how we forecast. I mean we obviously have to go down model by model. But I think when you listen to what the OEMs are saying, they're starting to indicate that a lot of their other issues in their supply chain, which semiconductor is the 1 that's obviously talked about the most, that's going to start to abate. I think if you look at IHS data right now, they're talking about probably a 10%, 11% increase in global auto volumes as you go from '21 to '22. So that's how we think about our business, right? We look at that IHS data. We don't really have an independent view, I suppose, of what's going on in that market. In the case of our vehicle business, we're the OEM, we're the market guy. So we are a lot closer and having to make that call. And as you indicated, the good news is demand is very strong. I mean everything we can build is is going out in the channel and selling inventory levels are at, frankly, on healthy low levels. We're working hard with our suppliers to get parts in and everything we can build, we get out there and tends to be selling through strongly. So I think our guys in the vehicle business, frankly, but we would love to have seen revenue growth in the quarter from year-over-year. We couldn't get that just because we can't get the parts to do it, but I think the team has managed price inflation disruption and all that sort of stuff, so that at least we've been able to hold on to the margin rates where we were. And obviously, as we can get the supply chain flowing better and get the revenue top line growing, we think the margins will improve with it. But our dynamics in that business in terms of pricing and the performance of the business was able to at least at a margin level, overcome a lot of the interruptions and inefficiencies that we've seen in the factory. So I think the business is being well run. It just needs to be able to start to generate more top line, and that's a supply issue. And the demand is quite strong. We've got great products out there. And as a result, we're getting good pricing for them. But we would we get higher revenues, and I think we will. We just got to work through the margins."

We continue to execute well across the company in the quarter. At Aviation, we continue to see a solid recovery in the general aviation market with strong commercial demand, increased deliveries in Citation jets and commercial turboprops and higher aftermarket volume. We delivered 49 jets, up from 25 last year and 35 commercial turboprops, up from 21 in last year's third quarter. Order activity in the quarter remained very strong, resulting in backlog growth of $721 million bringing us to $3.5 billion at the quarter end.  
Also in the third quarter, the Beechcraft King Air 360 and 260 achieved EASA certification and began to deliver customers throughout the region. Continuing with our product strategy of upgrading existing models at NBAA, we recently announced the Citation M2 Gen2 and the XLS Gen2 product upgrades. Also on the new product front, such as SkyCourier is continuing to progress through certification with over 1,600 hours of flight test activity and the Beechcraft Denali successfully completed its initial ground engine runs powered by GE's new Catalyst engine. The Bell revenues were down 3% in the quarter, largely on lower military revenues. On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 33 helicopters down from 41 in last year's third quarter.  
Moving to future vertical lift. In September, Bell submitted its proposal for the FARA program, [ a down selecting ] award is expected in the second quarter of 2022. On FARA, Bell is about 60% of the way through its build of the 360 Invictus prototype remains on schedule. Also in the quarter, Bell inducted the first U.S. Air Force CV-22 for its nacelle improvement modifications.  
Moving to systems. We saw another strong quarter of execution with operating margins at 15.1%, up 190 basis points from last year's third quarter. ATAC continued to expand its fleet of certified F1 aircraft with 2 additional aircraft entering service in the quarter bringing the total fleet to 19 aircrafts at the end of the quarter. The fleet continues to support higher customer demand for adversary air services, driving higher revenues in the quarter. At Air Systems, the team booked $25 million in new orders in the quarter, including both fee-for-service activities as well as new hardware.  
Moving to Industrial, overall revenues were lower in the quarter as we continue to experience manufacturing disruptions related to supply chain challenges. In Kautex, we again saw order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, which have directly impacted production scheduling and resulting in intermittent line shutdowns of manufacturing efficiencies.  
At Specialized Vehicles, we saw continued strong demand in our end markets with higher pricing, which offset production disruptions from part shortages.  
To wrap up, Textron delivered a solid quarter with increased aviation backlog, improved manufacturing margins and continued strong cash generation while working to minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions.

Segment profit was $98 million in the third quarter, up $127 million from a year ago, largely due to the higher volume and mix of $96 million and favorable pricing net of inflation of $22 million. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $3.5 billion. 
Moving to Bell. Revenues were $769 million, down $24 million from last year, largely reflecting lower military revenues. Segment profit of $105 million was down $14 million primarily due to lower military revenues. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.1 billion. At Textron Systems, revenues were $299 million, down $3 million from last year's third quarter due to lower volume of $39 million at Air Systems, which primarily reflected the impact from the U.S. Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan on its fee-for-service contracts, partially offset by higher volume, primarily at ATAC and Electronic Systems. Segment profit of $45 million was up $5 million to a favorable impact from performance and other. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.2 billion. 
Industrial revenues were $730 million, down $102 million from last year, reflecting lower volume and mix of $156 million primarily at Fuel Systems and Functional Components, reflecting order disruptions related to the global OEM supply shortages, partially offset by favorable impact of $44 million from pricing, largely at Specialized Vehicles. Segment profit of $23 million was down $35 million from the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the lower volume and mix described above, partially offset by higher pricing net of inflation at Specialized Vehicles. 
Finance segment revenues of $11 million -- were $11 million and profit was $8 million. Moving below segment profit. Corporate expenses were $23 million and interest expense was $28 million. With respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded pretax charges of $10 million on the special charges line. Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $271 million in the quarter and $851 million year-to-date as compared to $129 million for the corresponding 9-month period in 2020. Year-to-date, our cash generation reflects improved working capital management, which includes more linearity in quarterly aircraft deliveries and higher customer deposits in Aviation from an increased backlog. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares, returning $299 million in cash to shareholders. We're raising our expected full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $3.20 to $3.30 per share. This includes revised tax guidance at effective rate of 15.5% for the full year. We're also raising our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up $200 million from our prior outlook, with planned pension contributions of $50 million.

It's -- if I looked at the number of new customers, folks that are coming in buying a jet who have not owned a jet before, that number probably is somewhere around the 20% or so kind of a range. So which is encouraging. We do see a lot of people. As you know, buying a jet and you've not had an aircraft before is a little bit of a daunting task. One of the things we do in our business is we have a whole dedicated team that helps someone who's not owned an aircraft like that before, but wants to do that, and we help them with the complex issues of pilots and hangers and insurance and all the things that you have to look at to do that to successfully place that aircraft with a brand-new customer. But for sure, we're seeing a lot more interest in demand from those first-time buyers than we would historically see."

Order activity and interest in all of them is quite strong. And part of that is we've been putting updates and upgrades. I mean as I said at NBAA, we put the M2 -- Gen2 version of that, the Gen2 version of the XLS, which has been a fabulous aircraft for us for a long time, and it's a really nice update that I think is sparking even greater new interest in that aircraft as well. So it's really across the board. And look, we're not going to get into details on the model by model on the backlog. But as we've said before, I think this business, this industry, frankly, operates better if it's sort of looking at a 9- to 12-month sort of backlog, and that gives a customer who has an aircraft time to sell the aircraft. It gives them time to specify the interiors and colors and paints. Obviously, it makes it much easier for us in terms of our production forecasting and then smooth our production line flow. And as you know, that -- historically, that's how this industry works. This last decade has been unusual where you're actually having to try to build to forecast instead. So I do think one of the things that we certainly keep in mind as we look at production rates is that we want this business to be out there as sort of a 9- to 12-month kind of a backlog business. So it's a much healthier way to run the business. I think it's better for the customers, again, for their planning perspective and marketing of used aircraft if they already have an aircraft, which is the majority of our customers. 
So I think that that's a healthy place for the business to be, and that's kind of where I feel like we are right now."

I would say we're not seeing big issues right now in our -- in the supply chain associated with the A&D businesses. My view is -- most of these suppliers also do defense work, much like our company. And so most of them didn't go through an entirely hard shutdown, as you saw a lot of the commercial world doing. Also, as you know, a lot of these suppliers also have a lot of business that goes into the commercial aviation space with the Airbuses and the Boeings of the world and those guys are not back anywhere near the demand that they used to have. So there's capacity available in these supply chains. So as we work our way through this thing, most of our critical suppliers in the A&D space are able to meet our demand. I'm not suggesting there's never an issue or a problem, but those things pop up here and there. It's also a longer cycle supply chain. So if you do have a problem or a challenge, you've got more time to work on it and go manage it and look for alternatives and work with the supplier around that, whereas in the industrial and commercial world, you tend to find out a vital problem it's going to hurt you on Tuesday, the previous Friday. So we don't see as much of that in the A&D side. 
So I don't think when we look at this, we feel like we're going to be supplier constrained at this stage of the game. It's more around managing and making sure that we're doing the right thing here in terms of production rates versus long-term demand and again, managing to a backlog that works for us and works for our customers."

It's -- one of the challenges, frankly, this year is there's been a lot of disruption that the OEMs have felt and changing model types and volumes through the course of the year as a result of other supply chain issues. Fortunately, the Kautex guys have done a nice job in not being the problem, right? I mean we've been able to fulfill whatever demand is placed on us, and certainly, we don't want to be the reason they can't run a line. So I think our guys have done a really nice job of that. But we look really at the IHS data, Pete, in terms of how it -- how we forecast. I mean we obviously have to go down model by model. But I think when you listen to what the OEMs are saying, they're starting to indicate that a lot of their other issues in their supply chain, which semiconductor is the one that's obviously talked about the most, that's going to start to abate. And I think if you look at IHS data right now, they're talking about probably a 10%, 11% increase in global auto volumes as you go from '21 to '22. So that's how we think about our business, right? We look at that IHS data. We don't really have an independent view, I suppose, of what's going on in that market. In the case of our vehicle business, we're the OEM, we're the market guy. So we are a lot closer and having to make that call. And as you indicated, the good news is demand is very strong. I mean everything we can build is going out in the channel and selling inventory levels are at, frankly, [ unhealthy ] low levels. We're working hard with our suppliers to get parts in and everything we can build, we get out there and tends to be selling through strongly. So I think our guys in the vehicle business, frankly, but we would love to have seen revenue growth in the quarter from year-over-year. We couldn't get that just because we can't get the parts to do it, but I think the team has managed price inflation disruption and all that sort of stuff, so that at least we've been able to hold on to the margin rates where we were. And obviously, as we can get the supply chain flowing better and get the revenue top line growing, we think the margins will improve with it. But our dynamics in that business in terms of pricing and the performance of the business was able to at least at a margin level, overcome a lot of the interruptions and inefficiencies that we've seen in the factory. So I think the business is being well run. It just needs to be able to start to generate more top line, and that's a supply issue. And the demand is quite strong. We've got great products out there. And as a result, we're getting good pricing for them. But we would love to get higher revenues, and I think we will. We just got to work through the margins."

So we've had kind of better seasonality of cash flow and good customer deposits, the cash flow for the fourth quarter [ implied ] in the guide continues to be in the area of 1:1 or a little over 1 of kind of net -- relative to net income. So we saw a lot of benefit this year, kind of that we'll continue, I think, to see very strong working capital management next year. I'm not ready to guide on it. A lot of it will depend on order activity. I think that on the inventory side and the linearity of the business, we'll continue to see strong performance. It will depend on kind of customer deposit activity to some degree to how that ultimately works out. 
Look, on the pension side, we're not ready to kind of lay out numbers there. We've had a good year so far on return on assets. Interest rates are up a little bit. So as you sit here today, I don't think that we would expect to be -- we would expect pensions to continue to be a benefit as we go into '22, but we're not ready to quantify things."

Revenues in the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion in last year's third quarter. During this year's third quarter, we reported income from continuing operations of $0.82 per share. Adjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.85 per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2020.

We continue to execute well across the company in the quarter. At Aviation, we continue to see a solid recovery in the general aviation market with strong commercial demand, increased deliveries in Citation jets and commercial turboprops and higher aftermarket volume. We delivered 49 jets, up from 25 last year and 35 commercial turboprops, up from 21 in last year's third quarter. Order activity in the quarter remained very strong, resulting in backlog growth of $721 million bringing us to $3.5 billion at the quarter end.  
Also in the third quarter, the Beechcraft King Air 360 and 260 achieved EASA certification and began to deliver customers throughout the region. Continuing with our product strategy of upgrading existing models at NBAA, we recently announced the Citation M2 Gen2 and the XLS Gen2 product upgrades. Also on the new product front, such as SkyCourier is continuing to progress through certification with over 1,600 hours of flight test activity and the Beechcraft Denali successfully completed its initial ground engine runs powered by GE's new Catalyst engine. The Bell revenues were down 3% in the quarter, largely on lower military revenues. On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 33 helicopters down from 41 in last year's third quarter.  
Moving to future vertical lift. In September, Bell submitted its proposal for the FARA program, [ a down selecting ] award is expected in the second quarter of 2022. On FARA, Bell is about 60% of the way through its build of the 360 Invictus prototype remains on schedule. Also in the quarter, Bell inducted the first U.S. Air Force CV-22 for its nacelle improvement modifications.  
Moving to systems. We saw another strong quarter of execution with operating margins at 15.1%, up 190 basis points from last year's third quarter. ATAC continued to expand its fleet of certified F1 aircraft with 2 additional aircraft entering service in the quarter bringing the total fleet to 19 aircrafts at the end of the quarter. The fleet continues to support higher customer demand for adversary air services, driving higher revenues in the quarter. At Air Systems, the team booked $25 million in new orders in the quarter, including both fee-for-service activities as well as new hardware.  
Moving to Industrial, overall revenues were lower in the quarter as we continue to experience manufacturing disruptions related to supply chain challenges. In Kautex, we again saw order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, which have directly impacted production scheduling and resulting in intermittent line shutdowns of manufacturing efficiencies.  
At Specialized Vehicles, we saw continued strong demand in our end markets with higher pricing, which offset production disruptions from part shortages.  
To wrap up, Textron delivered a solid quarter with increased aviation backlog, improved manufacturing margins and continued strong cash generation while working to minimize the impact of supply chain disruptions.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank."

Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.2 billion were up $386 million from a year ago, largely due to higher Citation jet volume of $290 million, aftermarket volume of $62 million and commercial turboprop volume of $48 million. Segment profit was $98 million in the third quarter, up $127 million from a year ago, largely due to the higher volume and mix of $96 million and favorable pricing net of inflation of $22 million. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $3.5 billion. 
Moving to Bell. Revenues were $769 million, down $24 million from last year, largely reflecting lower military revenues. Segment profit of $105 million was down $14 million primarily due to lower military revenues. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.1 billion. At Textron Systems, revenues were $299 million, down $3 million from last year's third quarter due to lower volume of $39 million at Air Systems, which primarily reflected the impact from the U.S. Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan on its fee-for-service contracts, partially offset by higher volume, primarily at ATAC and Electronic Systems. Segment profit of $45 million was up $5 million to a favorable impact from performance and other. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.2 billion. 
Industrial revenues were $730 million, down $102 million from last year, reflecting lower volume and mix of $156 million primarily at Fuel Systems and Functional Components, reflecting order disruptions related to the global OEM supply shortages, partially offset by favorable impact of $44 million from pricing, largely at Specialized Vehicles. Segment profit of $23 million was down $35 million from the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the lower volume and mix described above, partially offset by higher pricing net of inflation at Specialized Vehicles. 
Finance segment revenues of $11 million -- were $11 million and profit was $8 million. Moving below segment profit. Corporate expenses were $23 million and interest expense was $28 million. With respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded pretax charges of $10 million on the special charges line. Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $271 million in the quarter and $851 million year-to-date as compared to $129 million for the corresponding 9-month period in 2020. Year-to-date, our cash generation reflects improved working capital management, which includes more linearity in quarterly aircraft deliveries and higher customer deposits in Aviation from an increased backlog. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares, returning $299 million in cash to shareholders. We're raising our expected full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $3.20 to $3.30 per share. This includes revised tax guidance at effective rate of 15.5% for the full year. We're also raising our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up $200 million from our prior outlook, with planned pension contributions of $50 million.

I think the backlog is fairly broad in terms of the makeup of those customers. It still remains more U.S.-centric. I think when we look at order activity in the quarter on the jet side, it's probably roughly 70% were so domestic versus 30% international. So I think we'll continue to see the shift. It's a little bit more international as Europe is starting to pick up and South America is starting to pick up. But it is still more North America-centric. It's probably closer to 50-50 on the turboprops, that's usually been a market where it's the turboprops,                 and such caravans usually end up being more international. I think it will continue to shift that way. But right now, it's closer to 50-50. Like, obviously, there's a mix of the next year or so deliveries of what we have coming up with NetJets, but we have very strong retail individual customers in there. It's -- if I looked at the number of new customers, folks that are coming in buying a jet who have not owned a jet before, that number probably is somewhere around the 20% or so kind of a range. So which is encouraging. We do see a lot of people. As you know, buying a jet and you've not had an aircraft before is a little bit of a daunting task. One of the things we do in our business is we have a whole dedicated team that helps someone who's not owned an aircraft like that before, but wants to do that, and we help them with the complex issues of pilots and hangers and insurance and all the things that you have to look at to do that to successfully place that aircraft with a brand-new customer. But for sure, we're seeing a lot more interest in demand from those first-time buyers than we would historically see."

So it's really across the board. And look, we're not going to get into details on the model by model on the backlog. But as we've said before, I think this business, this industry, frankly, operates better if it's sort of looking at a 9- to 12-month sort of backlog, and that gives a customer who has an aircraft time to sell the aircraft. It gives them time to specify the interiors and colors and paints. Obviously, it makes it much easier for us in terms of our production forecasting and then smooth our production line flow. And as you know, that -- historically, that's how this industry works. This last decade has been unusual where you're actually having to try to build to forecast instead. So I do think one of the things that we certainly keep in mind as we look at production rates is that we want this business to be out there as sort of a 9- to 12-month kind of a backlog business. So it's a much healthier way to run the business. I think it's better for the customers, again, for their planning perspective and marketing of used aircraft if they already have an aircraft, which is the majority of our customers. 
So I think that that's a healthy place for the business to be, and that's kind of where I feel like we are right now."

It's probably on that shorter side on maybe a smaller aircraft, where there's not as much customization. It's a little quick return. But I think on a larger aircraft, you see it move out on that in more of that 12 months or so. So there's not an absolute dollar number we look at, but we do look at demand model by model. And where we think that backlog that cycle time is reasonable in terms of where -- how it fits with our production planning, how it fits with our customers' expectations. And as I said, I think that's it ideally somewhere in that 9 to 12 months, again, some variability on the models, largely a smaller aircraft, probably being on the shorter side of that and things like longitude being in that more than 12 months or so kind of time line."

I would say we're not seeing big issues right now in our -- in the supply chain associated with the A&D businesses. My view is -- most of these suppliers also do defense work, much like our company. And so most of them didn't go through an entirely hard shutdown, as you saw a lot of the commercial world doing. Also, as you know, a lot of these suppliers also have a lot of business that goes into the commercial aviation space with the Airbuses and the Boeings of the world and those guys are not back anywhere near the demand that they used to have. So there's capacity available in these supply chains. So as we work our way through this thing, most of our critical suppliers in the A&D space are able to meet our demand. I'm not suggesting there's never an issue or a problem, but those things pop up here and there. It's also a longer cycle supply chain. So if you do have a problem or a challenge, you've got more time to work on it and go manage it and look for alternatives and work with the supplier around that, whereas in the industrial and commercial world, you tend to find out a vital problem it's going to hurt you on Tuesday, the previous Friday. So we don't see as much of that in the A&D side. 
So I don't think when we look at this, we feel like we're going to be supplier constrained at this stage of the game. It's more around managing and making sure that we're doing the right thing here in terms of production rates versus long-term demand and again, managing to a backlog that works for us and works for our customers."

In the case of Kautex, where we're a Tier 1 guy, we're sort of following the OEM path, right? So we don't independently set that. It's -- one of the challenges, frankly, this year is there's been a lot of disruption that the OEMs have felt and changing model types and volumes through the course of the year as a result of other supply chain issues. Fortunately, the Kautex guys have done a nice job in not being the problem, right? I mean we've been able to fulfill whatever demand is placed on us, and certainly, we don't want to be the reason they can't run a line. So I think our guys have done a really nice job of that. But we look really at the IHS data, Pete, in terms of how it -- how we forecast. I mean we obviously have to go down model by model. But I think when you listen to what the OEMs are saying, they're starting to indicate that a lot of their other issues in their supply chain, which semiconductor is the one that's obviously talked about the most, that's going to start to abate. And I think if you look at IHS data right now, they're talking about probably a 10%, 11% increase in global auto volumes as you go from '21 to '22. So that's how we think about our business, right? We look at that IHS data. We don't really have an independent view, I suppose, of what's going on in that market. In the case of our vehicle business, we're the OEM, we're the market guy. So we are a lot closer and having to make that call. And as you indicated, the good news is demand is very strong. I mean everything we can build is going out in the channel and selling inventory levels are at, frankly, [ unhealthy ] low levels. We're working hard with our suppliers to get parts in and everything we can build, we get out there and tends to be selling through strongly. So I think our guys in the vehicle business, frankly, but we would love to have seen revenue growth in the quarter from year-over-year. We couldn't get that just because we can't get the parts to do it, but I think the team has managed price inflation disruption and all that sort of stuff, so that at least we've been able to hold on to the margin rates where we were. And obviously, as we can get the supply chain flowing better and get the revenue top line growing, we think the margins will improve with it. But our dynamics in that business in terms of pricing and the performance of the business was able to at least at a margin level, overcome a lot of the interruptions and inefficiencies that we've seen in the factory. So I think the business is being well run. It just needs to be able to start to generate more top line, and that's a supply issue. And the demand is quite strong. We've got great products out there. And as a result, we're getting good pricing for them. But we would love to get higher revenues, and I think we will. We just got to work through the margins."
