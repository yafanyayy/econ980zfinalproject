The entire team responded exceptionally well in a year dominated by COVID. Our front-line workers, in particular, deserve special recognition for what they accomplished and what they continue to do for our customers, our patients and our communities. Despite the challenges of COVID, our key safety metrics continue to trend positively. We always say safety first here at Linde, and our people certainly walk the talk in 2020. We ramped up our health care capabilities around the world. We developed new protocols to treat COVID patients in their homes, freeing up needed capacity and overburdened hospitals. Since March, we have treated 90,000 COVID home care patients. And unfortunately, that number continues to grow. And we did that while caring for our existing base of some 1.6 million home care patients. We kept our plants running reliably and maintained service to our customers. We started up new plants in challenging circumstances with minimal delays. With the help of virtual tools, we transitioned from central to distributed operations almost flawlessly. In light of the inequalities in our society exposed by COVID-19, we contributed an additional $1.5 million to our communities beyond our normal level of giving. We demonstrated the resiliency of our business model. We quickly adjusted cost structures in line with local market conditions. We utilized our strong commercial term conditions to shield us from volume disruptions. We capitalized on more resilient growth opportunities in health care, electronics and food freezing. We delivered strong financial performance for the full year. Matt will provide more detail on the financials, but let me share a few highlights. Ex FX, we delivered 13% earnings per share growth on minus 2% sales. Our EBIT percent rose 260 basis points to 21.3%. Gross operating cash flow grew 21% to $7.4 billion. And the single most important metric to me, return on capital grew 180 basis points to 13.4%. 
We won significant projects serving new semiconductor fabs. The largest of which is yet to be announced, and is not yet included in the $3.6 billion sale of gas backlog number you see in the presentation. We won 36 small on-site projects in growing markets such as pulp and paper, lithium-ion batteries and precious metals. We advanced our sustainability initiative. We are the only chemical company in the world who has been recognized in the World Dow Jones Sustainability index for 18 consecutive years. And MSCI recently upgraded our ESG rating to an A rating. This time last year, we announced a new greenhouse gas emission intensity reduction goal of 35% by 2028. At this point, we're nearly halfway to achieving this goal. And we continue to develop applications that enable our customers to address their environmental challenges. We're currently working on several carbon capture utilization and sequestration projects that we expect to come to fruition in the coming months. We've made progress on our clean hydrogen initiative. We ramped up our JV with ITM to build PEM, proton exchange membrane, electrolysis plants, we formed a dozen partnerships with fuel cell electric vehicle manufacturers, energy companies and renewable power producers. We closed several important projects in China, South Korea and Germany. We made significant progress on our diversity goals for women globally and minorities in the U.S. We conducted our second employee engagement survey, and the results were very positive and improved year-over-year. We maintained a strong compliance program, establishing a strong culture of compliance is a fundamental responsibility of every leader in our company. We didn't ring a bell or anything, but the merger integration is over, thanks to the outstanding work of many people from both legacy companies. In short, we accomplished a great deal in 2020 and performed at an exceptional level, especially when considering the environment. 
Now I've just made a lot of we statements, and now I have one more. We are well positioned for another outstanding year in 2021. Now I'll turn it over to Sanjiv to provide more details on the business trends and outlook."

However, not all end markets have recovered at growth rates have been quite varied. Given the current uncertainty around the shape and speed of the economic recovery, I'd like to walk through the current business conditions, the key trends by end markets that you can find on the next slide, Slide 4. 
This slide represents our global end key market sales, excluding engineering source for the last quarter. And the first point I'd like to make to you over here is that our sales are well balanced, with 40% in resilient markets like health care, electronics, food and beverage. And the other 60% in cyclical end markets, such as metals, manufacturing, chemicals and refining. Clearly, the resilient end markets provided both stability and earnings accretion throughout the year. These growth rates are more aligned with demographic and consumer trends. And of course, incremental application technology. This is especially true for our merchant and packaged supply modes. In fact, our strategic focus towards developing an integrated supply network across all 3 supply modes of on site, merchant and packaged enables us to efficiently serve all these customers. 
In health care, which is about 20% of our sales, we continue to make considerable investments around the world to serve patients in both hospitals and homes. We have expanded our medical-grade oxygen capacity. We've introduced an inhaled nitric oxide alternative in the United States and Canada, provided specialty gases for research and drug discovery and, of course, increased CO2 supply for dry eye production for the storage and transportation of vaccines. Furthermore, we've been better prepared our home care organization to safely and reliably care for millions of high-risk patients right through this pandemic. It is, of course, difficult to say how much longer we'll face these challenges, but I can say with some confidence that we will continue to do our part to support and care for our customers. 
Moving on to food and beverage, which comprises 10% of global sales. This end market includes production and distribution for both pulp products and retail. Growth trends have been more prominent in bulk food freezing, dry for transport and specific trends like oxygen for aquaculture, CO2 for greenhouses. I anticipate these trends will continue based on the rise of food delivery services, concentration of food production itself and, of course, a growing demand for high-quality ready-to-eat meals. Now although the beverage market has been negatively impacted, particularly by the closure of restaurants, especially in North America and the U.K., that business has partially recovered through diner takeout trends that we see along with increased bottler demand. Overall, we see this as a stable market with some upside when there is return to restaurant dining. 
Moving on to electronics, which is 10% of our sales. We also consider this a resilient market since it tracks closely to consumer trends rather than industrial cycle and also because we supply critical products such as high-purity nitrogen and specialty gases and complex mixtures. Now these products enable our customers to make smaller and increasingly more powerful electronic devices, irrespective of their technology platforms. This is, of course, one of our fastest-growing markets both in the Americas and Asia Pacific as more investments are made into these integrated circuitry, memory, display and solar panels. Some recent examples of on-site project wins include the recently announced Samsung win in South Korea. And there are other Tier 1 fabs in Taiwan, China and Singapore as well. In fact, this is a market where I expect that most project backlog opportunities in 2021, and as we are, of course, pursuing actively in large number of projects, that should result in an additional win or wins being announced this year itself. Overall, the resilient end markets provide a healthy foundation for future growth, while offering downside protection as evidenced by our financial performance during 2020. 
Let me move on to the bottom half of the slide, Slide 4. That shows the cyclical markets. Some you can see are denoted in yellow since they were negatively affected by the economic downturn, especially in Americas and EMEA. While many of these markets are underpinned by fixed fee payments, such as on-site contracts and metals and chemicals or cylinder rental payments and manufacturing. Gas volumes are, however, exposed to industrial growth trends. Of course, this is also the part of our portfolio that will see the most leverage to recovery in the economy. Metals and glass represents about 13% of our sales. Carbon steel production has been increasing in China, but of course, a lot more volatile in developed markets like Europe and the U.S., especially when those mills are linked to auto production. However, quarter 4 saw some of the highest in 2020 due to catch-up demand after pandemic production shutdowns and, of course, the depletion of inventory in steel mills as well as end customers. We're also seeing some recent trends in this space, including the efforts to decarbonize steel production such as the use of oxy fuel combustion to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency. We also see recovery in flat steel from a rebound in auto production. Of course, if we see any significant infrastructure stimulus spending, the metals industry will definitely benefit. We, of course, continue to have confidence in our portfolio of high-quality customer assets which have successfully navigated economic headwinds for many decades. 
Moving on to chemicals and refining that represents 19% of our sales global and is well balanced across the different segments. Now similar to metals, we have focused efforts on partnering with high-quality assets. And therefore, our customers are some of the lowest-cost producers in the world. Production activity for 2020 ended below pre pandemic levels. But so far this year, we've seen refining capacity utilization trend up to low 80s in the U.S. The Gulf Coast refining system is a well integrated and still has some of the lowest cost feedstock in the world. Our current chemicals and refining backlog of projects are with leading global companies and protected with strong contractual terms. We recently announced and we signed a new project with in Hungary and, of course, continue to explore new opportunities as our customers work to reduce their carbon footprint. A good example of this is the increasing trend in biofuel production, requiring additional hydrogen for hydrotreating and hydroprocessing. So while 2020 represented a challenging year for these customers, we see upside potential heading into 2021. 
Let me move on to manufacturing, which at 19% contains a variety of end markets, including aviation, automotive, pulp and paper and general manufacturing, but also some growth markets like commercial space flight. Now overall trends have been down due to weaker general manufacturing as many small to medium-sized manufacturing customers have to shut down operations for extended periods. And while aviation has decreased with overall travel industry, we continue to see strong growth in commercial space flight, albeit off a very small base. In addition, we've seen pulp and paper customers add more capacity to serve consumer retail demand, which has enabled more small on-site oxygen plant wins, especially true in Latin America and Northern Europe. But for most parts, manufacturing end markets correlates with industrial production and thus would be expected to move up or down with those trends. 
For the overall gases business, we have a good balance of both resilient and cyclical end markets. 2020 has already demonstrated the downside protection and stability in our business. And while we remain somewhat cautious in our outlook, we are well positioned to leverage any recovery in 2021. 
Let me move on to engineering. Our engineering segment represents approximately 10% of our consolidated sales. It's a longer cycle business, so quarterly trends don't quite provide the full story. The last year was a culmination of a multiyear growth trend for order intake. Most of that primarily related to gas processing and petrochemical expansions. So for 2021, we estimate a net decrease in the sale of equipment backlog from a lower capital cycle spend. However, as clean energy projects continue to develop, I expect these to steadily become a larger part of the engineering portfolio. Irrespective of the near-term outlook, we have a high degree of confidence in the sustainability of long-term margins and cash generation in this business, driven by captive sale of gas opportunities, unrivaled technology portfolio and focus on higher-quality engineering and services. 
So let me wrap up by sharing some of my priorities for 2021. On safety and compliance, which is always first in Linde, we must maintain a best-in-class performance and a culture with continuous improvement across all our KPIs. For sustainability, we must further progress on the goals we set last year. In particular, our focus will be on the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions intensity and, of course, increasing gender diversity. Price and cost management is a hallmark of Linde. We will build upon the current best practices on pricing and productivity, while also remaining laser-focused on cash management. We will also remain quite nimble, adjusting each local business to its environment for optimal results, yet, always remaining prepared to capture any growth opportunities that fit our investment criteria. I'm sure you've heard Steve say in the past, ROC is a truth serum for any capital-intensive industry. And I truly believe that. We've instilled a culture Linde where capital isn't free, where we have to be good stewards of shareholder capital. And to do so, we need to continuously optimize our base CapEx, while also pursuing all good investment opportunities. That means projects, acquisitions and decaps as well. Our approach to growth remains disciplined. We will pursue all growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria, double-digit, unlevered, after-tax IRR with reputable customers who have competitive assets and in regions where we have confidence we can enforce our contracts. For such opportunities that we target, I'm confident we will win more than our fair share. Thus we continue to improve the numerator, the after-tax operating profit and maintain a long-term and disciplined approach to investing, I expect to see our ROC continue to grow. 
With that, I'll now hand over to Matt will take you through the financial results and guidance. Matt?"

Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales of $7.3 billion were 3% above last year and 6% higher sequentially. Year-over-year, gas volume trends have started to stabilize, with an increase of 1% from 2019. This",1260,"Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales of $7.3 billion were 3% above last year and 6% higher sequentially. Year-over-year, gas volume trends have started to stabilize, with an increase of 1% from 2019. This is driven by contribution from the project backlog as most of our customers have started up as anticipated. Organic volumes were stable with prior year as increases from electronics and health care were mostly offset by slight declines in manufacturing and refining. Sequentially, volumes increased across all geographic segments and most end markets. The engineering business drove a 1% decrease in sales from prior year. As you know, this is a longer cycle business so quarterly trends are less indicative of overall conditions. Currently, projects are being completed faster than order intake, thus resulting in a slightly lower backlog of $4.7 billion, which is about 1.5 to 2x annualized sales. Despite the lower fourth quarter sales, the team improved EBIT margin 110 basis points and ended the full year with margins above 15%. Looking ahead, we expect engineering EBIT margins to average low double-digit percent throughout the cycle. Pricing remains healthy at 2%, as most business units are keeping up with local inflation. Proper contract management is an integral part of our operating model, and therefore, provides long-term confidence in the ability to maintain positive pricing in any environment. Foreign currency was a 2% tailwind as the U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies in APAC and EMEA, although the Americas still has a headwind due to weaker Latin American currencies. The combination of stable volumes, higher pricing and strong productivity and cost management, resulted in operating profit of $1.6 billion, which is 20% above last year. The 22.2% margin is 320 basis points above 2019, and represents our 6th consecutive quarter of expanding operating margins more than 200 basis points. Earnings per share of $2.3 increased 22% from prior year and 7% sequentially. The incremental growth rate versus operating profit is primarily due to the lower share count. Operating cash flow of $2.4 billion was our highest quarter yet, ending at 12% above last year and 29% above the third quarter. In fact, it represents another quarter where the operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio exceeded 100%. We had a strong finish in working capital, especially in the engineering segment, but I'll speak more to that on the next slide. CapEx of $1 billion was 1% above last year and 30% higher sequentially. As a reminder, project CapEx represents opportunities over $5 million in spend with returns supported by long-term contracts. These projects often take 3 or more years to build. So spending patterns fluctuate from construction and delivery timing. Therefore, a better indicator is the sale of gas project backlog, which stands at $3.6 billion, similar to the third quarter. Base CapEx has increased from both periods, primarily due to quality growth investments that meet our return criteria, but not all requirements to be included in the project backlog. Example investments include small on site, specialty gas plants, hydrogen mobility and expanding medical gas capacity. Ultimately, all capital decisions roll up to ROC, which continues to trend in the right direction with Q4 ending at 13.4%. You can see a continual improvement from substantial earnings growth on a stable capital base. As Sanjiv mentioned, we, as management, are stewards of shareholder capital, so this metric is the best way to define long-term success in deploying that capital. To build off that, I'd like to spend some time reviewing the full year 2020 capital management on Slide 6. 
As you can see on the left side, full year operating cash increased 21%. This was driven by a combination of higher earnings, lower merger costs and better working capital management. Cash from operations grew steadily over the 2-year period despite the challenges related to the pandemic, including the second and third quarters of 2020. The right side represents how that capital was deployed. Linde has a stable and predictable cash allocation approach, irrespective of any short-term disruptions around the world. The underlying mandate is an A credit rating with a growing dividend each year. In fact, just 2 weeks ago, we announced a 10% dividend increase for 2021 to mark our 28th consecutive year of increasing dividends. Our capital priority is to invest back into the business. It can be for projects, decaps or acquisitions. We view them equally under our consistent investment criteria. All growth must meet a proper risk/reward balance because mistakes in this industry can result in long-term losses that exceed the initial investment. During 2020, $3.5 billion met our investment standards and I expect this number to increase over time. 
Finally, any excess cash left over after dividends and investments is used for stock repurchases. And you can see that number was $2.4 billion for 2020. We recently approved a new $5 billion stock repurchase program, which further validates our confidence in the ability to generate significant excess cash flow. The path to long-term compound value generation requires annual growth of earnings and cash flow with a consistent, disciplined capital deployment model for both a good and challenging years. Furthermore, building local density in diverse end markets provides Linde downside protection with significant leverage to growth cycles. 2020 validated the resilience of this model in a tough year. And we look forward to demonstrating how we can perform in a recovery. 
I'll now wrap up with guidance, which you can find on Slide 7. Initial EPS outlook for full year 2021 is $9.1 to $9.3. This represents an 11% to 13% growth rate with an estimated 1% FX tailwind. Excluding FX, the 10% to 12% range assumes minimal economic benefit at the bottom end and a low single-digit economic growth at the top end. In other words, and consistent with prior statements, we have confidence we can grow EPS double-digit percent with minimal help from the economy. And while we don't provide revenue guidance, I do want to mention for modeling purposes, that effective January 1, we have deconsolidated a 50% joint venture in the APAC segment. Our ownership and economic interest remain the same. However, we had some incremental shareholder rights that expired in December, which both parties agreed not to renew. The effect of this deconsolidation will be shown as a divestiture and will reduce annualized sales approximately $600 million at average op margins. Note, this change will not affect EPS, due to the proportional increase in equity income. Stated simply, this is merely an accounting change that will not impact our economic benefits. 
Turning to the first quarter. We are providing EPS guidance of $2.20 to $2.25 or 16% to 19% growth rate including an assumed 2% FX tailwind. This range assumes a normal seasonal decline from the fourth quarter, including Chinese New Year and Brazilian Carnival. At this point, we are not assuming any meaningful improvement in sequential volumes from Q4. And while we started 2021 with a stronger January than anticipated, we're not in a position to update guidance at this time. Consistent with prior quarters, we believe it's prudent to remain cautious on the outlook as the pandemic evolves. But rest assured, if there is any economic upside, we will capture more than our fair share as demonstrated by the second half of 2020. And if the economy does improve more than our baseline assumptions, we will likely be at the upper end or above this guidance range. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

She only cares about the share price, by the way, she won't be listening in. So Bob, as we think about continuing to expand margins, obviously, that's in our sites that's built into our plans. We're giving clear guidance on double-digit earnings growth. And as Matt described, even at the low end, there's no real volume expectation. And at the higher end, there's low single-digit volume expectations. So obviously, we're going to lever up the EBIT quite a bit off of a pretty small volume assumption, and then we'll lever that further through share buybacks, and I didn't really go back and calculate the number, but clearly, it's going to be another significant move. That's the plan in terms of EBIT margin expansion. And I think, as Matt probably said a couple of times, we don't really know what's going to happen this year. I mean we are looking at January, obviously, and the results are pretty encouraging. 1 month doesn't make a quarter and 1 month certainly doesn't make a year. So we certainly have to be a little more cautious in terms of what could happen in the second half of the year."

So we see this as a compound value opportunity, as Steve mentioned, and this doesn't assume much volume help at all at this stage on the organic. Obviously, we'll have our backlog volume and then we'll just have to see what happens to the economy. We'll take it quarter-by-quarter, and we'll keep giving updates as they occur. But January was better than what we expected, and we'll just have to see how it plays out in the next 2 months, and we'll give you another update, come our next call."

And also whether you think that this could drive an acceleration in new investments going forward?"

So backlog contribution, 2% is kind of, I think, the right number you should use, kind of 2 on the top, 2 on the bottom, that's really kind of been our ongoing rate. We have a fairly strong CapEx start-ups -- lineup of start-ups in 2021. Of course, it's during different times of the year, so you don't get all the contributions in 2021. They tend to roll over. It's always difficult to talk about what you think a year-end backlog number is going to be because it's really a function of -- you know what you've got in front of you that you're going to book, and I've certainly alluded to a very large project that we're looking forward to telling you more about in the not-too-distant future. But what happens during the remainder of the year is kind of a function of, I'd say, the pace of clean energy projects, maybe the pace of other electronics projects. If demand comes back, that generally provides projects for -- we see more project activity, more of our traditional industries like petrochemical and metals. But that kind of -- we have to kind of wait and see. There's not much going on, obviously, in that latter category at this point. It's more around electronics and clean energy. So the CapEx spend is pretty consistent. Again, we -- it doesn't move that much unless the backlog really starts to drop year over year-over-year, then you'd see that large project spend continued to drop. The base CapEx is more consistent. There's lots of little growth opportunities inside of that. I said 33 or 36 small on-site that we booked in 2020. We have a very strong focus on that. We like those projects. There's good opportunities in some of these markets that Sanjiv alluded to that we'll spend some CapEx against to capitalize on that growth. So yes, I do think semiconductors will continue to be a very strong opportunity. Sanjiv talked about that in his comments as well. It's how we work today, virtually, it's the Internet of Things. It's chips that are going to go on everything, especially in automobiles. So semiconductor opportunity is going to be very strong. We've been talking about this for 2 years. We're well positioned in places like South Korea, Taiwan and China, which is really kind of the axis of where all the semiconductor fabs have been built. There is some new activity. Obviously, the U.S. is trying to go more prime in terms of having domestic semiconductor fabrication."

We'll kind of have to wait and see what happens this time in coming out of January and during the quarter. But if you kind of look at some of the elements of that, there's a significant piece that's electronics. Obviously, that's going to do well. I think the industrial volumes will kind of move as the industry recovers. Balloons are clearly down, have been down, will continue to be down, and I don't have to explain why. And then there's a piece of it for us that's also tied to MRI, and that looks kind of stable to maybe slightly up. So it looks to me like there's going to be sequential improvement, not at a rapid pace, but certainly sequential improvement on volumes going forward. I would say in terms of refinery volumes, and what I look at is hydrogen. Clearly, in Q4, we're down something like 7% or so year-over-year. So up a little bit from Q3. And starting off in January, I'm looking at like January versus December, and I'm seeing plus 8% kind of numbers on volume. So they are starting to improve. I think you know what the drivers are behind their end markets. Clearly, jet fuel is very weak, still. Diesel has been strong, gasoline is weaker. And what one would have to expect is as you get deeper into the year and COVID gets behind us, particularly in places like the U.S., that you would see hydrogen volumes improve and should improve considerably. We also have some new project start-ups that will augment that. And then if you get into like liquid hydrogen volumes, which aren't necessarily tied to refining, but some piece might go into biofuels, that's a pretty -- that's on a pretty positive trend itself. So that's kind of the status of our volumes to the refining industry, still down year-over-year, but starting to see some improvement. I would expect that to improve -- could improve quite a bit in the back half of the year."

That obviously does a lot to drive the top line and being very efficient in terms of how we allocate capital below the line. And we continue to get a little better at that all the time, continuing to invest in good return projects. Again, I see -- I'm not going to call it. It's something I told me a long time ago, you give them a number or a date, but don't give them a number and a date. So that goes back to my GE days. But I don't know when -- what year that's going to be, but it's something that's clearly in our sights. And 30% of our long-term incentive is tied to return on capital. So it has the highest weighting in our LTI. So I'm not the only one that thinks that's an important metric. I think we have thousands of people. I see Sanjiv smiling that we all know it's the same. is just -- is an example of our view in terms of portfolio optimization. I don't like joint ventures. Normally speaking, I think, especially for traditional industrial gas businesses. And this was a case, this company had a public float. So you can imagine the distractions that go with having a small business in a country like that with a public float. And so by essentially eliminating the public float, buying all those shares and being able to run that country just like any other country that we operate around the globe, we can focus on all the things that we know are important, which is making that business better every day, price management, efficiency, and there's quite a bit of opportunity and continue to grow cash flow, being very prudent with capital, working capital, safety, compliance, it's the same list for every country. So I'm pretty confident that we're going to see a pretty nice step-up in that case. But there are other examples of that, too, that clearly is on our target list of places that we want to, I'll say, season and control so we can run them the way we think they should be run."

And as we've been evolving on that, we've got a better stride there. Also, as you know, the engineering business, it runs most things through COGS, and they had a margin expansion. They were running better through some of their absorption as they were more efficient on how they executed projects and completed projects. That would also have an effect on that given they run through inventory and COGS on a percent completion. So a little bit of mix, but also a lot of the effort around the world to just improve the efficiencies across our whole cost stack, not just fixed cost, but variable costs as well.

Clearly, we had to ramp up a lot of health care capabilities around the world to fight COVID. Unfortunately, that's not going to be behind us for a while. I think we can see -- you can look at the pace of vaccinations and the advance of these new variants, and I think it's very possible that these variants are going to outpace the world's ability to vaccinate the population. And therefore, they're going to be consuming a lot of action well into 2021. And we might be talking about this again, this time in 2022. So I don't think this is going away anytime soon. You correctly pointed out that while we're providing more oxygen to fight COVID, that there are people that are not having elective surgeries, they didn't go into hospitals. Hospitals are focused, obviously, on fighting this primary virus. And so there's not as much oxygen that's being sold for more of the elective type or more of the -- more of the traditional types of activities. I think post COVID, obviously, the latter will come back. I do think that our businesses like Lincare have clearly demonstrated to the government and large managed care operators, how important it is to have a very strong, capable with wide breadth of capability services, nurses, clinicians, the home works, that can step in and be a very strong second line of defense for hospitals. And so I think in terms of pandemic preparedness going forward, I think we're in a new world now with respect to our relationship with the government. I feel very confident about that. And so I think that's going to be a positive. So that's a, I guess, a silver lining, if you will, of this COVID. It gave us a chance to demonstrate what we could do on a home care basis, not just a broad hospital basis. But it might be this time next year before really talking about a world after COVID. And of course, as oxygen subsides maybe to fight specifically COVID, then the manufacturing side of the business, the industrial side of the business, there will be more volumes going that way. I mean, I can talk about oxygen being up quite a bit. I can also look at still being down quite a bit because manufacturing has not come back yet. And so there are trade-offs, obviously."

The pricing that we see, I mean, we have a fairly sophisticated group of people because, again, we buy a lot -- we buy -- I think it's $3 billion last year of power around the world. So we buy a lot of power. We're pretty sophisticated in terms of how we negotiate contracts. What I've seen, it's been on par with what we would normally get and so we're not looking to sacrifice economics to claim we have a higher percent renewable, we want to accomplish both.

And if I remember right, that's like going from $1 billion of renewable power purchases to about $2 billion. So it is something that we're focused on here, and it's obviously -- if the ultimate goal is to be carbon neutral by some date, then obviously, by either proactively contract renewable power or just countries naturally green their grids, it's going to be an important part of how we ultimately get there."

So I think Steve and I spent a lot of time talking about this. This is something that we see deeply embedded in our businesses. I've described this previously on previous conversations we've had in the earnings call saying, I see the fact that we've got productivity entrenched in the business at a level where we've got to generate in different countries, hundreds of projects to make sure that they are actually delivering on a continuous basis. And I think you've heard Steve say this before, every day, we look at our business, and we kind of figure out how we can be better than we were yesterday. So it is a continuous program. It's something that's deeply entrenched in the business. It's something that embedded the DNA of people who work in our business, and we look at it every day. It isn't a program that we run, it's something that we live and breath. So that's kind of the the cultural aspect of productivity, if you like. And I mean, I can ask Steve later on, but I feel that he agrees with my view that we've made substantial progress on this journey. This was new to half the organization, if you will, but the way they've embraced it and kind of move forward with it has been very, very encouraging. I want to give you a different slant on productivity as well. One of the things that we drive at is sustainable productivity. Productivity that helps our sustainability targets and ensuring that we're contributing to those goals that we set up. And we do that through making sure we've got sustainability initiatives, again, within the business on efficiency, on energy management, on managing emissions, et cetera, which all of which actually contribute not just to the bottom line, which is very important for me, but also impacted the sustainability goals that we've set up as well. And again, I'd say there's a lot more work to be done, but we are really off to a great start in that space. So as I see it, I think we are well on our way on this journey. Obviously, we can see a lot of benefit ahead of us if we continue to keep the pace and momentum on this."

I mean you name all of that. And we were able to do it not because volume was just tremendously strong for 25 years, it was a factor, but clearly, good price management and strong productivity. And that's -- so we have a track record of knowing how to do this. And the fact that we now have a much larger organization that hasn't been added quite so long, I think, is very encouraging. I am very pleased and very proud of what really the whole organization has done in terms of grabbing on to productivity. But it's not a 3-year, 5-year 10-year, 25-year thing, it's something that you do for the rest of your life."

Because renewable power costs are still relatively high around the world. They need to come down as we scale up. So I'm kind of looking at as you get into bigger projects. So that's a factor. This is a relatively large PIM, as I said, it's the largest one announced 24 megawatts. So this is not where it's going to be 10 years from now in terms of cost. It's at kind of the early days in terms of producing projects of this size. So the CapEx costs are higher, the OpEx costs are higher. So we know costs need to come down, both through the whole electrolysis process, but also in the renewable power. Renewable power is a significant factor of that. So those costs are going to come down. We clearly received subsidies in this project. In fact, most of these projects, we do received subsidies. So that clearly helps with these projects. And that's probably important until the costs do come down so that green hydrogen can be competitive, I'd say, on its own with gray hydrogen. Though there's always going to be some gap but I think closing that gap is very important. And obviously, a carbon price as it's assigned to carbon molecules in the future will help do that. But this project works. Obviously, we have negotiations that have been completed before we ever made the announcement. So we know that the prices work. But there certainly are sensitivities around the market price on the non-contracted piece like there would be with any merchant liquid business. And there's sensitivities around the input side on renewable power. And we took very conservative assumptions going into this, thinking that we probably were going to end up with a better deal that would help us when we finally conclude the power negotiations. So that's how I'd answer that. But you're right. I've said 50%, it's probably 60%. It's probably closer to the truth."

And unlike perhaps other industries, you got to keep in mind, they use a lot of hydrogen today. You know that, but it's gray hydrogen. So dropping in blue hydrogen, which I think would probably be a very good solution for them and even green. If you look at Texas, there's lots of renewable power. There's obviously lots of natural gas. You have depleted oil reservoir. So I think blue or green can be substituted for gray. I think it'd be very helpful to refineries, if the costs come down to enable that. So there is some ability to do that. And I think that's going to happen. I think longer term, it's kind of like probably other industries in the past that have been -- haven't -- have seen their better growth days perhaps. I'm not the official spokesman on what happens in the refining industry. But what I think is you take a place like the U.S. Gulf Coast, which you have very strong, large scale, very efficient refineries so they can use -- you know the story, they can use heavier sweet feedstocks. They're very complex refineries. They can produce a full suite of transportation fuels. They're heavily integrated with the petrochemical industry at large in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So I happen to think that if people think they're going to turn into a dinosaur, they'll probably be -- the last dinosaurs walking around are going to be down in the U.S. Gulf Coast."

So we have specific projects which I think certainly help with the economics where you have an end market use for the CO2. We have several projects like that. We have others that we have worked on or working on with, say, coal-fired utilities that are looking at carbon capture. We obviously have solutions around -- we have multiple solutions around carbon capture, but it can be post combustion, it could be pre combustion. And I think for some of those to move forward, particularly in a place like the United States, you need a more defined cost of carbon, of CO2. But I think when that happens and you have to think that this administration is very determined to make that happen, you will see some of these projects move forward. I don't think it's going to be as large as I look at it today. I could be wrong as perhaps the straight hydrogen opportunities, but they can be significant, too."

So the market in Asia Pacific, as you might imagine, is quite varied and the largest market in there for us is obviously China. So the dynamic around pricing that we see is twofold. One, obviously, we have many large on-site projects. So obviously, from a portfolio perspective, the opportunity around the merchant side pricing impact that we can fully bring to bear is a little bit more limited than potentially some of the other segments. But more importantly, I think in a market like China where we've got some significant end user customers, which is where we focus our efforts and energy on. But at times, we would use the distributor model as well to make sure that we've got our plants running at optimal levels. And in 2020, in particular, that became quite important. So we wanted to make sure that channel was fully utilized. And when you do that, then the pricing impact actually does get moderated down a little bit. You've seen that happen in 2020. It is an area of focus. And just as I talked about productivity, the other piece I'd say is pricing is an area of focus every day. And the guys in China, in particular, now that we are watching that very carefully. We review that every month at the GDR, and they do have a bit of a tough time around that. So there is a lot of action happening in the marketplace around that, which hopefully will reflect in the quarters ahead."

Well, I think -- as I think about that question, Laurence, there are so many uses for our basic core products, CO2, oxygen, our rare gases, all of our products that they become new uses, and we talk about CO2 for greenhouse gases. And of course, you have this little thing called cannabis, which is a growing marketplace. Dry ice for biopharma, dry ice to carry it back. Dry ice has been around a long time. So there we continue to find good uses and applications, new uses and applications in markets that are growing. If you look at commercial space, we're selling hydrogen. We're selling oxygen. We are selling nitrogen as rocket propellers, they call it. And what is used depends on the rocket and the platform and the company. We also sell rare gases that are used in, I'll call it, satellite mobility. So a lot of new markets that are developing that consume our basic gases. And as far as -- I don't like to stray too far away from our, I'll call it, our core knitting. Our business model is pretty good. And we think we are pretty good at executing this business model. So history has shown us that you never want to lose sight of your strengths, and we won't do that. But certainly, any opportunity that's developing that we think lends itself to an industrial gas approach, model approach will certainly pursue. We all like growth there. It certainly -- that's not a problem. So in terms of acquisitions, I think that we'll -- you'll be seeing a lot more. We'll be doing a lot in the packaged gas space. I think we'll do it in the health care space. I think those are natural. Decaps kind of come and go. You can look at the same for 5 years and nothing moves forward. So that's more opportunistic in my mind. As far as blending hydrogen into natural gas, I mean, that is the clear intention of this partnership that we formed with Snam in Italy, which is the largest natural gas operator in Europe. And they're very committed to blending hydrogen in with their natural gas. I have to go back and look, I think it's probably at the 10% level. But even that, if you did that across the entire world, that's a very significant amount. There are some limitations because you got to start changing out burner equipment on the other end. Compression -- might change out compression depending on how high of the mix you get up the hydrogen and certain kind of metallurgy, you have to take a closer look at as hydrogen grows. But it is something that I think is getting closer to fruition."

The entire team responded exceptionally well in a year dominated by COVID. Our front-line workers, in particular, deserve special recognition for what they accomplished and what they continue to do for our customers, our patients, and our communities. Despite the challenges of COVID, our key safety metrics continue to trend positively. We always say safety first here at Linde, and our people certainly walk the talk in 2020. 
We ramped up our healthcare capabilities around the world. We developed new protocols to treat COVID patients in their homes, freeing up needed capacity and overburdened hospitals. Since March, we have treated 90,000 COVID home care patients. And unfortunately, that number continues to grow. And we did that while caring for our existing base of some 1.6 million home care patients. 
We kept our plants running reliably and maintained service to our customers. We started up new plants in challenging circumstances with minimal delays. With the help of virtual tools, we transitioned from central to distributed operations almost flawlessly. In light of the inequalities in our society exposed by COVID-19, we contributed an additional $1.5 million to our communities beyond our normal level of giving. 
We demonstrated the resiliency of our business model. We quickly adjusted cost structures in line with local market conditions. We utilized our strong commercial terms and conditions to shield us from volume disruptions. We capitalized on more resilient growth opportunities in healthcare, electronics, and food freezing. We delivered strong financial performance for the full year. Matt will provide more detail on the financials but let me share a few highlights. 
Ex-FX, we delivered 13% earnings per share growth on minus 2% sales. Our EBIT percent rose 260 basis points to 21.3%. Gross operating cash flow grew 21% to $7.4 billion. And the single most important metric to me, return on capital grew 180 basis points to 13.4%.
We won significant projects serving new semiconductor fabs. The largest of which is yet to be announced and is not yet included in the $3.6 billion sale of gas backlog number you see in the presentation. 
We won 36 small on-site projects in growing markets such as pulp and paper, lithium-ion batteries, and precious metals. We advanced our sustainability initiative. We are the only chemical company in the world who has been recognized in the World Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 18 consecutive years. And MSCI recently upgraded our ESG rating to an A rating. 
This time last year, we announced a new greenhouse gas emission intensity reduction goal of 35% by 2028. At this point, we're nearly halfway to achieving this goal. And we continue to develop applications that enable our customers to address their environmental challenges. We're currently working on several carbon capture utilization and sequestration projects that we expect to come to fruition in the coming months. We've made progress on our clean hydrogen initiative. We ramped up our JV with ITM to build PEM, proton exchange membrane, electrolysis plants. 
We formed a dozen partnerships with fuel cell electric vehicle manufacturers, energy companies, and renewable power producers. We closed several important projects in China, South Korea, and Germany. We made significant progress on our diversity goals for women globally and minorities in the U.S. We conducted our second employee engagement survey, and the results were very positive and improved year-over-year. 
We maintained a strong compliance program, establishing a strong culture of compliance is a fundamental responsibility of every leader in our company. We didn't ring a bell or anything, but the merger integration is over, thanks to the outstanding work of many people from both legacy companies. In short, we accomplished a great deal in 2020 and performed at an exceptional level, especially when considering the environment.
Now I've just made a lot of we statements, and now I have one more. We are well positioned for another outstanding year in 2021. Now I'll turn it over to Sanjiv to provide more details on the business trends and outlook."

This slide represents our global end key market sales, excluding engineering source for the last quarter. And the first point I'd like to make to you over here is that our sales are well balanced, with 40% in resilient markets like healthcare, electronics, food and beverage. And the other 60% in cyclical end markets, such as metals, manufacturing, chemicals, and refining. 
Clearly, the resilient end-markets provided both stability and earnings accretion throughout the year. These growth rates are more aligned with demographic and consumer trends. And of course, incremental application technology. This is especially true for our merchant and packaged supply modes. In fact, our strategic focus towards developing an integrated supply network across all 3 supply modes of on-site, merchant, and packaged, enables us to efficiently serve all these customers.
In healthcare, which is about 20% of our sales, we continue to make considerable investments around the world to serve patients in both hospitals and homes. We have expanded our medical-grade oxygen capacity. We've introduced an inhaled nitric oxide alternative in the United States and Canada, provided specialty gases for research and drug discovery, and, of course, increased CO2 supply for dry eye production for the storage and transportation of vaccines. 
Furthermore, we've been better prepared our home care organization to safely and reliably care for millions of high-risk patients right through this pandemic. It is, of course, difficult to say how much longer we'll face these challenges, but I can say with some confidence that we will continue to do our part to support and care for our customers.
Moving on to food and beverage, which comprises 10% of global sales. And this end market includes production and distribution for both pulp products and retail. Growth trends have been more prominent in bulk food freezing, dry eye for transport, and specific trends like oxygen for aquaculture, CO2 for greenhouses. I anticipate these trends will continue based on the rise of food delivery services, concentration of food production itself, and, of course, a growing demand for high-quality ready-to-eat meals. Now although the beverage market has been negatively impacted, particularly by the closure of restaurants, especially in North America and the U.K., that business has partially recovered through diner takeout trends that we see along with increased bottler demand. Overall, we see this as a stable market with some upside when there is return to restaurants dining.
Moving on to electronics, which is 10% of our sales. We also consider this a resilient market since it tracks closely to consumer trends rather than industrial cycle and also because we supply critical products such as high-purity nitrogen and specialty gases and complex mixtures. Now these products enable our customers to make smaller and increasingly more powerful electronic devices, irrespective of their technology platforms. 
This is, of course, one of our fastest-growing markets both in the Americas and Asia Pacific as more investments are made into these integrated circuitry, memory, display, and solar panels. Some recent examples of on-site project wins include the recently announced Samsung win in South Korea. And there are other Tier 1 fabs in Taiwan, China, and Singapore as well. 
In fact, this is a market where I expect that most project backlog opportunities in 2021. And as we are, of course, pursuing actively in large number of projects, that should result in an additional win or wins being announced this year itself. Overall, the resilient end-markets provide a healthy foundation for future growth, while offering downside protection as evidenced by our financial performance during 2020.
Let me move on to the bottom half of the slide, Slide 4. That shows the cyclical markets. Some of those you can see are denoted in yellow since they were negatively affected by the economic downturn, especially in Americas and EMEA. While many of these markets are underpinned by fixed-fee payments, such as on-site contracts, and metals and chemicals, or cylinder rental payments, and manufacturing. Gas volumes are, however, exposed to industrial growth trends. Of course, this is also the part of our portfolio that will see the most leverage to recovery in the economy. 
Metals and glass represents about 13% of our sales. Carbon steel production has been increasing in China, but of course, a lot more volatile in developed markets like Europe and the U.S., especially when those mills are linked to auto production. However, quarter 4 saw some of the highest in 2020 due to catch-up demand after pandemic production shutdowns and, of course, depletion of inventory in steel mills as well as end customers. We're also seeing some recent trends in this space, including the efforts to decarbonize steel production such as the use of oxyfuel combustion to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency. We also see recovery in flat steel from a rebound in auto production. 
Of course, if we see any significant infrastructure stimulus spending, the metals industry will definitely benefit. We, of course, continue to have confidence in our portfolio of high-quality customer assets which have successfully navigated economic headwinds for many decades.
Moving on to chemicals and refining that represents 19% of our sales globally and is well balanced across the different segments. Now similar to metals, we have focused efforts on partnering with high-quality assets. And therefore, our customers are some of the lowest-cost producers in the world. Production activity for 2020 ended below pre-pandemic levels. But so far this year, we've seen refining capacity utilization trend up to low 80s in the U.S. 
The Gulf Coast refining system is a well-integrated and still has some of the lowest cost feedstock in the world. Our current chemicals and refining backlog of projects are with leading global companies and protected with strong contractual terms. We recently announced and we signed a new project with Wanhua in Hungary and, of course, continue to explore new opportunities as our customers work to reduce their carbon footprint. 
A good example of this is the increasing trends in biofuel production, requiring additional hydrogen for hydrotreating and hydroprocessing. So while 2020 represented a challenging year for these customers, we see upside potential heading into 2021.
Let me move on to manufacturing, which at 19% contains a variety of end markets, including aviation, automotive, pulp and paper, and general manufacturing, but also some growth markets like commercial space flight. Now overall trends have been down due to weaker general manufacturing as many small to medium-sized manufacturing customers have to shut down some operations for extended periods. And while aviation has decreased with overall travel industry, we continue to see strong growth in commercial space flight, albeit off a very small base. 
In addition, we've seen pulp and paper customers add more capacity to serve consumer retail demand, which has enabled more small on-site oxygen plant wins, especially true in Latin America and Northern Europe. But for most parts, manufacturing end-markets correlates with industrial production and thus would be expected to move up or down with those trends.
For the overall gases business, we have a good balance of both resilient and cyclical end markets. 2020 has already demonstrated the downside protection and stability in our business. And while we remain somewhat cautious in our outlook, we are well positioned to leverage any recovery in 2021.
Let me move on to engineering. Our Engineering segment represents approximately 10% of our consolidated sales. It's a longer cycle business, so quarterly trends don't quite provide the full story. The last year was a culmination of a multiyear growth trend for order intake. Most of that primarily related to gas processing and petrochemical expansions. So for 2021, we estimate a net decrease in the sale of equipment backlog from a lower capital cycle spend. 
However, as clean energy projects continue to develop, I expect these to steadily become a larger part of the engineering portfolio. Irrespective of the near-term outlook, we have a high degree of confidence in the sustainability of long-term margins and cash generation in this business, driven by captive sale of gas opportunities, unrivaled technology portfolio, and focus on higher-quality engineering and services.
So let me wrap up by sharing some of my priorities for 2021. On safety and compliance, which is always first in Linde, we must maintain a best-in-class performance and a culture with continuous improvement across all our KPI's. For sustainability, we must further progress on the goals we set last year. In particular, our focus will be on the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions intensity and, of course, increasing gender diversity. 
Price and cost management is a hallmark of Linde. We will build upon the current best practices on pricing and productivity, while also remaining laser-focused on cash management. We will also remain quite nimble, adjusting each local business to its environment for optimal results, yet, always remaining prepared to capture any growth opportunities that fit our investment criteria. I'm sure you've heard Steve say in the past, ROC is a truth serum for any capital-intensive industry. And I truly believe that. 
We've instilled a culture in Linde where capital isn't free, where we have to be good stewards of shareholder capital. And to do so, we need to continuously optimize our base CapEx, while also pursuing all good investment opportunities. That means projects, acquisitions, and decaps as well. Our approach to growth remains disciplined. 
We will pursue all growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria, double-digit, unlevered, after-tax IRR with reputable customers who have competitive assets and in regions where we have confidence, we can enforce our contracts. For such opportunities that we target, I'm confident we will win more than our fair share. Thus, we continue to improve the numerator, the after-tax operating profit, and maintain a long-term and disciplined approach to investing, I expect to see our ROC continue to grow.
With that, I'd now hand over to Matt, who will take you through the financial results and guidance. Matt?"

Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales of $7.3 billion were 3% above last year and 6% higher sequentially. Year-over-year, gas volume trends have started to stabilize, with an increase of 1% from 2019. This",1259,"Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales of $7.3 billion were 3% above last year and 6% higher sequentially. Year-over-year, gas volume trends have started to stabilize, with an increase of 1% from 2019. This is driven by contribution from the project backlog as most of our customers have started up as anticipated. Organic volumes were stable with prior year as increases from electronics and healthcare were mostly offset by slight declines in manufacturing and refining. Sequentially, volumes increased across all geographic segments and most end markets. 
The engineering business drove a 1% decrease in sales from prior year. As you know, this is a longer cycle business. So quarterly trends are less indicative of overall conditions. Currently, projects are being completed faster than order intake, thus resulting in a slightly lower backlog of $4.7 billion, which is about 1.5 to 2x annualized sales. Despite the lower fourth quarter sales, the team improved EBIT margin a 110 basis points and ended the full year with margins above 15%. 
Looking ahead, we expect engineering EBIT margins to average low double-digit percent throughout the cycle. Pricing remains healthy at 2%, as most business units are keeping up with local inflation. Proper contract management is an integral part of our operating model, and therefore, provides long-term confidence in the ability to maintain positive pricing in any environment. Foreign currency was a 2% tailwind as the U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies in APAC and EMEA, although the Americas still has a headwind due to weaker Latin American currencies. 
The combination of stable volumes, higher pricing, and strong productivity and cost management, resulted in operating profit of $1.6 billion, which is 20% above last year. The 22.2% margin is 320 basis points above 2019 and represents our 6th consecutive quarter of expanding operating margins more than 200 basis points. Earnings per share of $2.30 increased 22% from prior year and 7% sequentially. 
The incremental growth rate versus operating profit is primarily due to the lower share count. Operating cash flow of $2.4 billion was our highest quarter yet, ending at 12% above last year and 29% above the third quarter. In fact, it represents another quarter where the operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio exceeded 100%. We had a strong finish in working capital, especially in the Engineering segment, but I'll speak more to that on the next slide. 
CapEx of $1 billion was 1% above last year and 30% higher sequentially. As a reminder, project CapEx represents opportunities over $5 million in spend with returns supported by long-term contracts. These projects often take 3 or more years to build. So spending patterns fluctuate from construction and delivery timing. Therefore, a better indicator is the sale of gas project backlog, which stands at $3.6 billion, similar to the third quarter. Base CapEx has increased from both periods, primarily due to quality growth investments that meet our return criteria, but not all requirements to be included in the project backlog. 
Example investments include small on-site, specialty gas plants, hydrogen mobility, and expanding medical gas capacity. Ultimately, all capital decisions roll up to ROC, which continues to trend in the right direction with Q4 ending at 13.4%. You can see a continual improvement from substantial earnings growth on a stable capital base. 
As Sanjiv mentioned, we, as management, are stewards of shareholder capital. So this metric is the best way to define long-term success in deploying that capital. To build off that, I'd like to spend some time reviewing the full year 2020 capital management on Slide 6.
As you can see on the left side, full year operating cash increased 21%. This was driven by a combination of higher earnings, lower merger costs, and better working capital management. Cash from operations grew steadily over the 2-year period despite the challenges related to the pandemic, including the second and third quarters of 2020. The right side represents how that capital was deployed. Linde has a stable and predictable cash allocation approach, irrespective of any short-term disruptions around the world. The underlying mandate is an A credit rating with a growing dividend each year. In fact, just 2 weeks ago, we announced a 10% dividend increase for 2021 to mark our 28th consecutive year of increasing dividends. 
Our capital priority is to invest back into the business. It can be for projects, decaps, or acquisitions. We view them equally under our consistent investment criteria. All growth must meet a proper risk/reward balance because mistakes in this industry can result in long-term losses that exceed the initial investment. During 2020, $3.5 billion met our investment standards and I expect this number to increase over time.
Finally, any excess cash left over after dividends and investments is used for stock repurchases. And you can see that number was $2.4 billion for 2020. We recently approved a new $5 billion stock repurchase program, which further validates our confidence in the ability to generate significant excess cash flow. The path to long-term compound value generation requires annual growth of earnings and cash flow with a consistent, disciplined capital deployment model for both a good and challenging years. 
Furthermore, building local density in diverse end markets provides Linde downside protection with significant leverage to growth cycles. 2020 validated the resilience of this model in a tough year. And we look forward to demonstrating how we can perform in a recovery.
I'll now wrap up with guidance, which you can find on Slide 7. Initial EPS outlook for full year 2021 is $9.10 to $9.30. This represents an 11% to 13% growth rate with an estimated 1% FX tailwind. Excluding FX, the 10% to 12% range assumes minimal economic benefit at the bottom end and a low single-digit economic growth at the top end. In other words, and consistent with prior statements, we have confidence we can grow EPS double-digit percent with minimal help from the economy. And while we don't provide revenue guidance, I do want to mention for modeling purposes, that effective January 1, we have deconsolidated a 50% joint venture in the APAC segment. Our ownership and economic interest remain the same. 
However, we had some incremental shareholder rights that expired in December, which both parties agreed not to renew. The effect of this deconsolidation will be shown as a divestiture and will reduce annualized sales approximately $600 million at average op margins. Note, this change will not affect EPS, due to the proportional increase in equity income. Stated simply, this is merely an accounting change that will not impact our economic benefits.
Turning to the first quarter. We are providing EPS guidance of $2.20 to $2.25 or 16% to 19% growth rate including an assumed 2% FX tailwind. This range assumes a normal seasonal decline from the fourth quarter, including Chinese New Year and Brazilian Carnival. At this point, we are not assuming any meaningful improvement in sequential volumes from Q4. And while we started 2021 with a stronger January than anticipated, we're not in a position to update guidance at this time. Consistent with prior quarters, we believe it's prudent to remain cautious on the outlook as the pandemic evolves. But rest assured, if there is any economic upside, we will capture more than our fair share as demonstrated by the second half of 2020. 
And if the economy does improve more than our baseline assumptions, we will likely be at the upper end or above this guidance range. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

She only cares about the share price, by the way, she won't be listening in. 
So Bob, as we think about continuing to expand margins, obviously, that's in our sites that's built into our plans. We're giving clear guidance on double-digit earnings growth. And as Matt described, even at the low end, there's no real volume expectation. And at the higher end, there's low single-digit volume expectations. So obviously, we're going to lever up the EBIT quite a bit off of a pretty small volume assumption, and then we'll lever that further through share buybacks, and I didn't really go back and calculate the number, but clearly, it's going to be another significant move. That's the plan in terms of EBIT margin expansion. 
And I think, as Matt probably said a couple of times, we don't really know what's going to happen this year. I mean we are looking at January, obviously, and the results are pretty encouraging. 1 month doesn't make a quarter and 1 month certainly doesn't make a year.

So this is beyond the merger. This is beyond anything like that. 
We don't anticipate temporary cost savings that pop back or anything to that extent, as we've discussed in prior calls. So we see this as a compound value opportunity, as Steve mentioned, and this doesn't assume much volume help at all at this stage on the organic. Obviously, we'll have our backlog volume and then we'll just have to see what happens to the economy. We'll take it quarter-by-quarter, and we'll keep giving updates as they occur. But January was better than what we expected, and we'll just have to see how it plays out in the next 2 months, and we'll give you another update, come our next call."

We have a fairly strong CapEx start-ups -- lineup of start-ups in 2021. Of course, it's during different times of the year, so you don't get all the contributions in 2021. They tend to roll over. It's always difficult to talk about what you think a year-end backlog number is going to be because it's really a function of -- you know what you've got in front of you that you're going to book, and I've certainly alluded to a very large project that we're looking forward to telling you more about in the not-too-distant future. 
But what happens during the remainder of the year is kind of a function of, I'd say, the pace of clean energy projects, maybe the pace of other electronics projects. If demand comes back, that generally provides projects for -- we see more project activity, more of our traditional industries like petrochemical and metals. But that kind of -- we have to kind of wait and see. There's not much going on, obviously, in that latter category at this point. It's more around electronics and clean energy. 
So the CapEx spend is pretty consistent. Again, we -- it doesn't move that much unless the backlog really starts to drop year over year-over-year, then you'd see that large project spend continued to drop. The base CapEx is more consistent. There's lots of little growth opportunities inside of that. I said 33 or 36 small on-site that we booked in 2020 there. We have a very strong focus on that. We like those projects. There's good opportunities in some of these markets that Sanjiv alluded to that we'll spend some CapEx against to capitalize on that growth. 
So yes, I do think semiconductors will continue to be a very strong opportunity. Sanjiv talked about that in his comments as well. It's how we work today, virtually, it's the Internet of Things. It's chips that are going to go on everything, especially in automobiles. So semiconductor opportunity is going to be very strong. We've been talking about this for 2 years. We're well positioned in places like South Korea, Taiwan, and China, which is really kind of the axis of where all the semiconductor fabs have been built. There is some new activity. Obviously, the U.S. is trying to go more prime in terms of having domestic semiconductor fabrication."

We'll kind of have to wait and see what happens this time in coming out of January and during the quarter. But if you kind of look at some of the elements of that, there's a significant piece that's electronics. Obviously, that's going to do well. I think the industrial volumes will kind of move as the industry recovers. Balloons are clearly down, have been down, will continue to be down, and I don't have to explain why. And then there's a piece of it for us that's also tied to MRI, and that looks kind of stable to maybe slightly up. 
So it looks to me like there's going to be sequential improvement, not at a rapid pace, but certainly sequential improvement on volumes going forward. I would say in terms of refinery volumes, and what I look at is hydrogen. Clearly, in Q4, we're down something like 7% or so year-over-year. So up a little bit from Q3. And starting off in January, I'm looking at like January versus December, and I'm seeing plus 8% kind of numbers on volume. So they are starting to improve. I think you know what the drivers are behind their end markets. Clearly, jet fuel is very weak, still. Diesel has been strong, gasoline is weaker. And what one would have to expect is as you get deeper into the year and COVID gets behind us, particularly in places like the U.S., that you would see hydrogen volumes improve and should improve considerably. We also have some new project start-ups that will augment that. 
And then if you get into like liquid hydrogen volumes, which aren't necessarily tied to refining, but some piece might go into biofuels, that's a pretty -- that's on a pretty positive trend itself. So that's kind of the status of our volumes to the refining industry, still down year-over-year, but starting to see some improvement.

And then following on from that, a very interesting announcement with Afrox, where obviously, you've delisted, you're talking about the opportunities here. I know it's relatively small in the context of Linde plc, but the operating margin there looks sort of mid-teens level for a clear leader in the market.

I didn't have to go look at them to know what we at Praxair want to operate, which was pushing 15%. I don't see any reason why this business can't do that as well. Continue to grow earnings kind of double-digit range. That obviously does a lot to drive the top-line, it being very efficient in terms of how we allocate capital below the line. And we continue to get a little better at that all the time, continuing to invest in good return projects. Again, I see -- I'm not going to call it. It's something I told me a long time ago, you give them a number or a date, but don't give them a number and a date. 
So that goes back to my GE days. But I don't know when -- what year that's going to be, but it's something that's clearly in our sights. And 30% of our long-term incentive is tied to return on capital. So it has the highest weighting in our LTI. So I'm not the only one that thinks that's an important metric. I think we have thousands of people. I see Sanjiv smiling that we all know it's the same. Afrox is just -- is an example of our view in terms of portfolio optimization. I don't like joint ventures. Normally speaking, I think, especially for traditional industrial gas businesses. And this was a case, this company had a public float. 
So you can imagine the distractions that go with having a small business in a country like that with a public float. And so by essentially eliminating the public float, buying all those shares, and being able to run that country just like any other country that we operate around the globe, we can focus on all the things that we know are important, which is making that business better every day, price management, efficiency, and there's quite a bit of opportunity and continue to grow cash flow, being very prudent with capital, working capital, safety, compliance, it's the same list for every country. So I'm pretty confident that we're going to see a pretty nice step-up in that case. But there are other examples of that, too, that clearly is on our target list of places that we want to, I'll say, season and control so we can run them the way we think they should be run."

And as we've been evolving on that, we've got a better stride there. Also, as you know, the engineering business, it runs most things through COGS, and they had a margin expansion. They were running better through some of their absorption as they were more efficient on how they executed projects and completed projects. That would also have an effect on that given they run through inventory and COGS on a percent completion. 
So a little bit of mix, but also a lot of the effort around the world to just improve the efficiencies across our whole cost stack, not just fixed cost, but variable costs as well.

Clearly, we had to ramp up a lot of healthcare capabilities around the world to fight COVID. Unfortunately, that's not going to be behind us for a while. I think we can see -- you can look at the pace of vaccinations and the advance of these new variants, and I think it's very possible that these variants are going to outpace the world's ability to vaccinate the population. And therefore, they're going to be consuming a lot of action well into 2021. And we might be talking about this again in, this time in 2022. 
So I don't think this is going away anytime soon. You correctly pointed out that while we're providing more oxygen to fight COVID, that there are people that are not having elective surgeries, they didn't go into hospitals. Hospitals are focused, obviously, on fighting this primary virus. And so there's not as much oxygen that's being sold for more of the elective type or more of the non -- more of the traditional types of activities. 
I think post-COVID, obviously, the latter will come back. I do think that our businesses like Lincare have clearly demonstrated to the government and large managed care operators, how important it is to have a very strong, capable with wide breadth of capability services, nurses, clinicians, the home works, that can step in and be a very strong second line of defense for hospitals. 
And so I think in terms of pandemic preparedness going forward, I think we're in a new world now with respect to our relationship with the government. I feel very confident about that. And so I think that's going to be a positive. So that's a, I guess, a silver lining, if you will, of this COVID. It gave us a chance to demonstrate what we could do on a home care basis, not just a broad hospital basis. But it might be this time next year before really talking about a world after COVID. And of course, as oxygen subsides may be to fight specifically COVID, then the manufacturing side of the business, the industrial side of the business, there will be more volumes going that way. I mean, I can talk about oxygen being up quite a bit. I can also look at argon still being down quite a bit because manufacturing has not come back yet. And so there are trade-offs, obviously."

The way we think about renewable energy, obviously, we are a large user, which gives us some advantages. And being able to combine that to make green hydrogen or make green hydrogen by using renewable power source in terms of just which you can get off the grid through electrolysis, I think is important to being able to produce and sell 100% carbon-free hydrogen. 
The pricing that we see, I mean, we have a fairly sophisticated group of people because, again, we buy a lot -- we buy -- I think it's $3 billion last year of power around the world. So we buy a lot of power. We're pretty sophisticated in terms of how we negotiate contracts. What I've seen, it's been on par with what we would normally get and so we're not looking to sacrifice economics to claim we have a higher percent renewable, we want to accomplish both. And I think we're up to 37% renewable now. I think we were at 34% or so, 33% maybe a couple of years ago. So we're making some progress. The goal was to double the original number. And if I remember right, that's like going from $1 billion of renewable power purchases to about $2 billion. So it is something that we're focused on here, and it's obviously -- if the ultimate goal is to be carbon neutral by some date, then obviously, by either proactively contract renewable power or just countries naturally green their grids, it's going to be an important part of how we ultimately get there."

This was new to half the organization if you will, but the way they've embraced it and kind of move forward with it has been very, very encouraging. 
I want to give you a different slant on productivity as well. One of the things that we drive at is sustainable productivity. Productivity that helps our sustainability targets and ensuring that we're contributing to those goals that we set up. And we do that through making sure we've got sustainability initiatives, again, within the business on efficiency, on energy management, on managing emissions, et cetera, which all of which actually contribute not just to the bottom-line, which is very important for me, but also impacted the sustainability goals that we've set up as well.

Because renewable power costs are still relatively high around the world. 
They need to come down as we scale up. So I'm kind of looking at as you get into bigger projects. So that's a factor. This is a relatively large PEM, as I said, it's the largest one announced 24 megawatts. So this is not where it's going to be 10 years from now in terms of cost. It's at kind of the early days in terms of producing projects of this size. So the CapEx costs are higher, the OpEx costs are higher. So we know costs need to come down, both through the whole electrolysis process, but also in the renewable power. Renewable power is a significant factor of that. So those costs are going to come down. 
We clearly received subsidies in this project. In fact, most of these projects, we do received subsidies. So that clearly helps with these projects. And that's probably important until the costs do come down so that green hydrogen could be competitive, I'd say, on its own with gray hydrogen. Though there's always going to be some gap, but I think closing that gap is very important. And obviously, a carbon price as it's assigned to carbon molecules in the future will help do that. But this project works. Obviously, we have negotiations that have been completed before we ever made the announcement. So we know that that the prices work. 
But there certainly are sensitivities around the market price on the non-contracted piece like there would be with any merchant liquid business. And there's sensitivities around the input side on renewable power. 
And we took very conservative assumptions going into this, thinking that we probably were going to end up with a better deal that would help us when we finally conclude the power negotiations. So that's how I'd answer that. But you're right. I've said 50%, it's probably 60%. It's probably closer to the truth."

And unlike perhaps other industries, you got to keep in mind, they use a lot of hydrogen today. You know that, but it's gray hydrogen. So dropping in blue hydrogen, which I think would probably be a very good solution for them and even green. If you look at Texas, there's lots of renewable power. There's obviously lots of natural gas. You have depleted oil reservoir. So I think blue or green can be substituted for gray. I think it'd be very helpful to refineries if the costs come down to enable that. 
So there is some ability to do that. And I think that's going to happen. I think longer term, it's kind of like probably other industries in the past that have been -- haven't -- have seen their better growth days perhaps. I'm not the official spokesman on what happens in the refining industry. But what I think is you take a place like the U.S. Gulf Coast, which you have very strong, large scale, very efficient refineries so they can use -- you know the story, they can use heavier sweet feedstocks. They're very complex refineries. They can produce a full suite of transportation fuels. They're heavily integrated with the petrochemical industry at large in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So I happen to think that if people think they're going to turn into a dinosaur, they'll probably be -- the last dinosaurs walking around are going to be down in the U.S. Gulf Coast."

So the customer has an incentive with the cost of CO2 emissions going up. They have an incentive to have us capture that carbon, and we have a use for it in terms of commercial, whether it's for greenhouses, whether it's for -- to make dry ice, pH control, carbon -- carbonation of beverages, all of those are uses of CO2. 
So we have specific projects which I think certainly help with the economics where you have an end market use for the CO2. We have several projects like that. We have others that we have worked on or working on with, say, coal-fired utilities that are looking at carbon capture. We obviously have solutions around -- we have multiple solutions around carbon capture, but it could be post-combustion, it could be pre-combustion. And I think for some of those to move forward, particularly in a place like the United States, you need a more defined cost of carbon, of CO2. But I think when that happens and you have to think that this administration is very determined to make that happen, you will see some of these projects move forward. I don't think it's going to be as large as I look at it today. I could be wrong as perhaps the straight hydrogen opportunities, but they can be significant, too."

So the market in Asia Pacific, as you might imagine, is quite varied and the largest market in there for us is obviously China. So the dynamic around pricing that we see is twofold. One, obviously, we have many large on-site projects. So obviously, from a portfolio perspective, the opportunity around the merchant side pricing impact that we can fully bring to bear is a little bit more limited than potentially some of the other segments. But more importantly, I think in a market like China where we've got some significant end-user customers, which is where we focus our efforts and energy on. But at times, we would use the distributor model as well to make sure that we've got our plants running at optimal levels. 
And in 2020, in particular, that became quite important. So we wanted to make sure that channel was fully utilized. And when you do that, then the pricing impact actually does get moderated down a little bit. You've seen that happen in 2020. It is an area of focus. And just as I talked about productivity, the other piece I'd say is pricing is an area of focus every day. And the guys in China, in particular, know that we are watching that very carefully. We review that every month at the GbR and they do have a bit of a tough time around that. So there is a lot of action happening in the marketplace around that, which hopefully will reflect in the quarters ahead."

And secondly, with respect to acquisitions and how you think about the boundaries for the business model, if we think about like kind of the forays that you've done into adjacencies, specialty gases for healthcare, electronic chemicals, co jet, there's been -- where do you see kind of logical extensions of the business model? I mean, for example, like remote monitoring of industrial boilers or would you ever engage in vertical integrations or total production of ammonia or methanol. Just how do you see the boundary conditions for what you would look at in terms of either acquisitions or flexing the business model a bit?"

And of course, you",461,"Yes. Well, I think -- as I think about that question, Laurence, there are so many uses for our basic core products, CO2, oxygen, our rare gases, all of our products that they become new uses, and we talk about CO2 for greenhouse gases. And of course, you have this little thing called cannabis, which is a growing marketplace. Dry ice for biopharma, dry ice to carry it back. Dry ice has been around a long time. So there we continue to find good uses and applications, new uses and applications in markets that are growing. If you look at commercial space, we're selling hydrogen. We're selling oxygen. We are selling nitrogen as rocket propellers, they call it. And what is used depends on the rocket and the platform and the company. We also sell rare gases that are used in, I'll call it, satellite mobility. 
So a lot of new markets that are developing that consume our basic gases. And as far as -- I don't like to stray too far away from our, I'll call it, our core knitting. Our business model is pretty good. And we think we are pretty good at executing this business model. So history has shown us that you never want to lose sight of your strengths, and we won't do that. But certainly, any opportunity that's developing that we think lends itself to an industrial gas approach, model approach will certainly pursue. We all like growth there. It certainly -- that's not a problem. So in terms of acquisitions, I think that we'll -- you'll be seeing a lot more. We'll be doing a lot in the packaged gas space. I think we'll do it in the healthcare space. I think those are natural. Decaps kind of come and go. You can look at the same decap for 5 years and nothing moves forward. 
So that's more opportunistic in my mind. As far as blending hydrogen into natural gas, I mean, that is the clear intention of this partnership that we formed with Snam in Italy, which is the largest natural gas operator in Europe. And they're very committed to blending hydrogen in with their natural gas. I have to go back and look, I think it's probably at the 10% level. But even that, if you did that across the entire world, that's a very significant amount. There are some limitations because you got to start changing out burner equipment on the other end. 
Compression. You might have to change out compression depending on how high of the mix you get up the hydrogen and certain kind of metallurgy, you have to take a closer look at as hydrogen grows. But it is something that I think is getting closer to fruition."

The entire team responded exceptionally well in a year dominated by COVID. Our front-line workers, in particular, deserve special recognition for what they accomplished and what they continue to do for our customers, our patients, and our communities. Despite the challenges of COVID, our key safety metrics continue to trend positively. We always say safety first here at Linde, and our people certainly walk the talk in 2020. 
We ramped up our healthcare capabilities around the world. We developed new protocols to treat COVID patients in their homes, freeing up needed capacity and overburdened hospitals. Since March, we have treated 90,000 COVID home care patients. And unfortunately, that number continues to grow. And we did that while caring for our existing base of some 1.6 million home care patients. 
We kept our plants running reliably and maintained service to our customers. We started up new plants in challenging circumstances with minimal delays. With the help of virtual tools, we transitioned from central to distributed operations almost flawlessly. In light of the inequalities in our society exposed by COVID-19, we contributed an additional $1.5 million to our communities beyond our normal level of giving. 
We demonstrated the resiliency of our business model. We quickly adjusted cost structures in line with local market conditions. We utilized our strong commercial terms and conditions to shield us from volume disruptions. We capitalized on more resilient growth opportunities in healthcare, electronics, and food freezing. We delivered strong financial performance for the full year. Matt will provide more detail on the financials but let me share a few highlights. 
Ex-FX, we delivered 13% earnings per share growth on minus 2% sales. Our EBIT percent rose 260 basis points to 21.3%. Gross operating cash flow grew 21% to $7.4 billion. And the single most important metric to me, return on capital, grew 180 basis points to 13.4%.
We won significant projects serving new semiconductor fabs, the largest of which is yet to be announced and is not yet included in the $3.6 billion sale of gas backlog number you see in the presentation. 
We won 36 small on-site projects in growing markets such as pulp and paper, lithium-ion batteries, and precious metals. We advanced our sustainability initiative. We are the only chemical company in the world who has been recognized in the World Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 18 consecutive years. And MSCI recently upgraded our ESG rating to an A rating. 
This time last year, we announced a new greenhouse gas emission intensity reduction goal of 35% by 2028. At this point, we're nearly halfway to achieving this goal. And we continue to develop applications that enable our customers to address their environmental challenges. We're currently working on several carbon capture utilization and sequestration projects that we expect to come to fruition in the coming months. We've made progress on our clean hydrogen initiative. We ramped up our JV with ITM to build PEM, proton exchange membrane, electrolysis plants. 
We formed a dozen partnerships with fuel cell electric vehicle manufacturers, energy companies, and renewable power producers. We closed several important projects in China, South Korea, and Germany. We made significant progress on our diversity goals for women globally and minorities in the U.S. We conducted our second employee engagement survey, and the results were very positive and improved year-over-year. 
We maintained a strong compliance program, establishing a strong culture of compliance is a fundamental responsibility of every leader in our company. We didn't ring a bell or anything, but the merger integration is over, thanks to the outstanding work of many people from both legacy companies. In short, we accomplished a great deal in 2020 and performed at an exceptional level, especially when considering the environment.
Now I've just made a lot of we statements, and now I have one more. We are well positioned for another outstanding year in 2021. Now I'll turn it over to Sanjiv to provide more details on the business trends and outlook."

As Steve mentioned, we had a strong finish to a challenging year. However, not all end markets have recovered and growth rates have been quite varied.

However, not all end markets have recovered and growth rates have been quite varied. Given the current uncertainty around the shape and speed of the economic recovery, I'd like to walk through the current business conditions, the key trends by end markets that you can find on the next slide, Slide 4.
This slide represents our global end key market sales, excluding engineering source for the last quarter. And the first point I'd like to make to you over here is that our sales are well balanced, with 40% in resilient markets like healthcare, electronics, food and beverage, and the other 60% in cyclical end markets, such as metals, manufacturing, chemicals, and refining. 
Clearly, the resilient end-markets provided both stability and earnings accretion throughout the year. These growth rates are more aligned with demographic and consumer trends, and of course, incremental application technology. This is especially true for our merchant and packaged supply modes. In fact, our strategic focus towards developing an integrated supply network across all 3 supply modes of on-site, merchant, and packaged enables us to efficiently serve all these customers.
In healthcare, which is about 20% of our sales, we continue to make considerable investments around the world to serve patients in both hospitals and homes. We have expanded our medical-grade oxygen capacity. We've introduced an inhaled nitric oxide alternative in the United States and Canada, provided specialty gases for research and drug discovery, and, of course, increased CO2 supply for dry ice production for the storage and transportation of vaccines. 
Furthermore, we've been better prepared our home care organization to safely and reliably care for millions of high-risk patients right through this pandemic. It is, of course, difficult to say how much longer we'll face these challenges, but I can say with some confidence that we will continue to do our part to support and care for our customers.
Moving on to food and beverage, which comprises 10% of global sales. And this end market includes production and distribution for both pulp products and retail. Growth trends have been more prominent in bulk food freezing, dry ice for transport, and specific trends like oxygen for aquaculture, CO2 for greenhouses. I anticipate these trends will continue based on the rise of food delivery services, concentration of food production itself, and, of course, a growing demand for high-quality ready-to-eat meals. Now although the beverage market has been negatively impacted, particularly by the closure of restaurants, especially in North America and the U.K., that business has partially recovered through diner takeout trends that we see along with increased bottler demand. Overall, we see this as a stable market with some upside when there is return to restaurants dining.
Moving on to electronics, which is 10% of our sales. We also consider this a resilient market since it tracks closely to consumer trends rather than industrial cycle and also because we supply critical products such as high-purity nitrogen and specialty gases and complex mixtures. Now these products enable our customers to make smaller and increasingly more powerful electronic devices, irrespective of their technology platforms. This is, of course, one of our fastest-growing markets both in the Americas and Asia Pacific as more investments are made into these integrated circuitry, memory, display, and solar panels. 
Some recent examples of on-site project wins include the recently announced Samsung win in South Korea. And there are other Tier 1 fabs in Taiwan, China, and Singapore as well. In fact, this is a market where I expect the most project backlog opportunities in 2021. And as we are, of course, pursuing actively in large number of projects, that should result in an additional win or wins being announced this year itself. Overall, the resilient end-markets provide a healthy foundation for future growth, while offering downside protection as evidenced by our financial performance during 2020.
Let me move on to the bottom half of the slide, Slide 4. That shows the cyclical markets. Some of those you can see are denoted in yellow since they were negatively affected by the economic downturn, especially in Americas and EMEA. While many of these markets are underpinned by fixed-fee payments, such as on-site contracts and metals and chemicals, or cylinder rental payments, and manufacturing. Gas volumes are, however, exposed to industrial growth trends. Of course, this is also the part of our portfolio that will see the most leverage to recovery in the economy. 
Metals and glass represents about 13% of our sales. Carbon steel production has been increasing in China, but of course, a lot more volatile in developed markets like Europe and the U.S., especially when those mills are linked to auto production. However, quarter 4 saw some of the highest in 2020 due to catch-up demand after pandemic production shutdowns and, of course, depletion of inventory in steel mills as well as end customers. We're also seeing some recent trends in this space, including the efforts to decarbonize steel production such as the use of oxyfuel combustion to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency. We also see recovery in flat steel from a rebound in auto production. 
Of course, if we see any significant infrastructure stimulus spending, the metals industry will definitely benefit. We, of course, continue to have confidence in our portfolio of high-quality customer assets which have successfully navigated economic headwinds for many decades.
Moving on to chemicals and refining. That represents 19% of our sales globally and is well balanced across the different segments. Now similar to metals, we have focused efforts on partnering with high-quality assets. And therefore, our customers are some of the lowest-cost producers in the world. Production activity for 2020 ended below pre-pandemic levels. But so far this year, we've seen refining capacity utilization trend up to low 80s in the U.S. 
The Gulf Coast refining system is well-integrated and still has some of the lowest cost feedstock in the world. Our current chemicals and refining backlog of projects are with leading global companies and protected with strong contractual terms. 
We recently announced and we signed a new project with Wanhua in Hungary and, of course, continue to explore new opportunities as our customers work to reduce their carbon footprint. A good example of this is the increasing trends in biofuel production, requiring additional hydrogen for hydrotreating and hydroprocessing. So while 2020 represented a challenging year for these customers, we see upside potential heading into 2021.
Let me move on to manufacturing, which at 19% contains a variety of end markets, including aviation, automotive, pulp and paper, and general manufacturing, but also some growth markets like commercial space flight. Now overall trends have been down due to weaker general manufacturing as many small to medium-sized manufacturing customers have to shut down some operations for extended periods. And while aviation has decreased with overall travel industry, we continue to see strong growth in commercial space flight, albeit off a very small base. 
In addition, we've seen pulp and paper customers add more capacity to serve consumer retail demand, which has enabled more small on-site oxygen plant wins, especially true in Latin America and Northern Europe. But for most parts, manufacturing end-markets correlates with industrial production and thus would be expected to move up or down with those trends.
For the overall gases business, we have a good balance of both resilient and cyclical end markets. 2020 has already demonstrated the downside protection and stability in our business. And while we remain somewhat cautious in our outlook, we are well positioned to leverage any recovery in 2021.
Let me move on to engineering. Our Engineering segment represents approximately 10% of our consolidated sales. It's a longer cycle business, so quarterly trends don't quite provide the full story. The last year was a culmination of a multiyear growth trend for order intake. Most of that primarily related to gas processing and petrochemical expansions. So for 2021, we estimate a net decrease in the sale of equipment backlog from a lower capital cycle spend. 
However, as clean energy projects continue to develop, I expect these to steadily become a larger part of the engineering portfolio. Irrespective of the near-term outlook, we have a high degree of confidence in the sustainability of long-term margins and cash generation in this business, driven by captive sale of gas opportunities, unrivaled technology portfolio, and focus on higher-quality engineering and services.
So let me wrap up by sharing some of my priorities for 2021. On safety and compliance, which is always first in Linde, we must maintain a best-in-class performance and a culture with continuous improvement across all our KPI's. For sustainability, we must further progress on the goals we set last year. In particular, our focus will be on the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions intensity and, of course, increasing gender diversity. 
Price and cost management is a hallmark of Linde. We will build upon the current best practices on pricing and productivity, while also remaining laser-focused on cash management. We will also remain quite nimble, adjusting each local business to its environment for optimal results, yet always remaining prepared to capture any growth opportunities that fit our investment criteria. I'm sure you've heard Steve say in the past, ROC is a truth serum for any capital-intensive industry. And I truly believe that. 
We've instilled a culture in Linde where capital isn't free, where we have to be good stewards of shareholder capital. And to do so, we need to continuously optimize our base CapEx, while also pursuing all good investment opportunities. That means projects, acquisitions, and decaps as well. 
Our approach to growth remains disciplined. We will pursue all growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria, double-digit, unlevered, after-tax IRR with reputable customers who have competitive assets and in regions where we have confidence we can enforce our contracts. For such opportunities that we target, I'm confident we will win more than our fair share. Thus, we continue to improve the numerator, the after-tax operating profit, and maintain a long-term and disciplined approach to investing, I expect to see our ROC continue to grow.
With that, I'd now hand over to Matt, who will take you through the financial results and guidance. Matt?"

Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales of $7.3 billion were 3% above last year and 6% higher sequentially. Year-over-year, gas volume trends have started to stabilize, with an increase of 1% from 2019. This",1258,"Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales of $7.3 billion were 3% above last year and 6% higher sequentially. Year-over-year, gas volume trends have started to stabilize, with an increase of 1% from 2019. This is driven by contribution from the project backlog as most of our customers have started up as anticipated. Organic volumes were stable with prior year as increases from electronics and healthcare were mostly offset by slight declines in manufacturing and refining. Sequentially, volumes increased across all geographic segments and most end markets. 
The engineering business drove a 1% decrease in sales from prior year. As you know, this is a longer cycle business. So quarterly trends are less indicative of overall conditions. Currently, projects are being completed faster than order intake, thus resulting in a slightly lower backlog of $4.7 billion, which is about 1.5x to 2x annualized sales. Despite the lower fourth quarter sales, the team improved EBIT margin 110 basis points and ended the full year with margins above 15%. 
Looking ahead, we expect engineering EBIT margins to average low double-digit percent throughout the cycle. Pricing remains healthy at 2%, as most business units are keeping up with local inflation. Proper contract management is an integral part of our operating model, and therefore provides long-term confidence in the ability to maintain positive pricing in any environment. Foreign currency was a 2% tailwind as the U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies in APAC and EMEA, although the Americas still has a headwind due to weaker Latin American currencies. 
The combination of stable volumes, higher pricing, and strong productivity and cost management resulted in operating profit of $1.6 billion, which is 20% above last year. The 22.2% margin is 320 basis points above 2019 and represents our 6th consecutive quarter of expanding operating margins more than 200 basis points. Earnings per share of $2.30 increased 22% from prior year and 7% sequentially. The incremental growth rate versus operating profit is primarily due to the lower share count. 
Operating cash flow of $2.4 billion was our highest quarter yet, ending at 12% above last year and 29% above the third quarter. In fact, it represents another quarter where the operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio exceeded 100%. We had a strong finish in working capital, especially in the Engineering segment, but I'll speak more to that on the next slide. 
CapEx of $1 billion was 1% above last year and 30% higher sequentially. As a reminder, project CapEx represents opportunities over $5 million in spend with returns supported by long-term contracts. These projects often take 3 or more years to build. So spending patterns fluctuate from construction and delivery timing. Therefore, a better indicator is the sale of gas project backlog, which stands at $3.6 billion, similar to the third quarter. Base CapEx has increased from both periods, primarily due to quality growth investments that meet our return criteria, but not all requirements to be included in the project backlog.
Example investments include small on-site, specialty gas plants, hydrogen mobility, and expanding medical gas capacity. Ultimately, all capital decisions roll up to ROC, which continues to trend in the right direction with Q4 ending at 13.4%. You can see a continual improvement from substantial earnings growth on a stable capital base. 
As Sanjiv mentioned, we as management are stewards of shareholder capital. So this metric is the best way to define long-term success in deploying that capital. To build off that, I'd like to spend some time reviewing the full year 2020 capital management on Slide 6.
As you can see on the left side, full year operating cash increased 21%. This was driven by a combination of higher earnings, lower merger costs, and better working capital management. Cash from operations grew steadily over the 2-year period despite the challenges related to the pandemic, including the second and third quarters of 2020. The right side represents how that capital was deployed. Linde has a stable and predictable cash allocation approach, irrespective of any short-term disruptions around the world. The underlying mandate is an A credit rating with a growing dividend each year. In fact, just 2 weeks ago, we announced a 10% dividend increase for 2021 to mark our 28th consecutive year of increasing dividends. 
Our capital priority is to invest back into the business. It can be for projects, decaps, or acquisitions. We view them equally under our consistent investment criteria. All growth must meet a proper risk/reward balance because mistakes in this industry can result in long-term losses that exceed the initial investment. During 2020, $3.5 billion met our investment standards and I expect this number to increase over time.
Finally, any excess cash left over after dividends and investments is used for stock repurchases. And you can see that number was $2.4 billion for 2020. We recently approved a new $5 billion stock repurchase program, which further validates our confidence in the ability to generate significant excess cash flow. The path to long-term compound value generation requires annual growth of earnings and cash flow with a consistent, disciplined capital deployment model for both the good and challenging years. 
Furthermore, building local density in diverse end markets provides Linde downside protection with significant leverage to growth cycles. 2020 validated the resilience of this model in a tough year. And we look forward to demonstrating how we can perform in a recovery.
I'll now wrap up with guidance, which you can find on Slide 7. Initial EPS outlook for full year 2021 is $9.10 to $9.30. This represents an 11% to 13% growth rate with an estimated 1% FX tailwind. Excluding FX, the 10% to 12% range assumes minimal economic benefit at the bottom end and a low single-digit economic growth at the top end. In other words, and consistent with prior statements, we have confidence we can grow EPS double-digit percent with minimal help from the economy. 
And while we don't provide revenue guidance, I do want to mention for modeling purposes, that effective January 1, we have deconsolidated a 50% joint venture in the APAC segment. Our ownership and economic interest remain the same. However, we had some incremental shareholder rights that expired in December, which both parties agreed not to renew. The effect of this deconsolidation will be shown as a divestiture and will reduce annualized sales approximately $600 million at average op margins. Note, this change will not affect EPS, due to the proportional increase in equity income. Stated simply, this is merely an accounting change that will not impact our economic benefits.
Turning to the first quarter. We are providing EPS guidance of $2.20 to $2.25 or 16% to 19% growth rate including an assumed 2% FX tailwind. This range assumes a normal seasonal decline from the fourth quarter, including Chinese New Year and Brazilian Carnival. At this point, we are not assuming any meaningful improvement in sequential volumes from Q4. And while we started 2021 with a stronger January than anticipated, we're not in a position to update guidance at this time. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we believe it's prudent to remain cautious on the outlook as the pandemic evolves. But rest assured, if there is any economic upside, we will capture more than our fair share as demonstrated by the second half of 2020. And if the economy does improve more than our baseline assumptions, we will likely be at the upper end or above this guidance range. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

She only cares about the share price, by the way; she won't be listening in. 
So Bob, as we think about continuing to expand margins, obviously, that's in our sights, that's built into our plans. We're giving clear guidance on double-digit earnings growth. And as Matt described, even at the low end, there's no real volume expectation. And at the higher end, there's low single-digit volume expectations. So obviously, we're going to lever up the EBIT quite a bit off of a pretty small volume assumption, and then we'll lever that further through share buybacks, and I didn't really go back and calculate the number, but clearly, it's going to be another significant move. That's the plan in terms of EBIT margin expansion. 
And I think, as Matt probably said a couple of times, we don't really know what's going to happen this year. I mean we are looking at January, obviously, and the results are pretty encouraging. 1 month doesn't make a quarter and 1 month certainly doesn't make a year. So we certainly have to be a little more cautious in terms of what could happen in the second half of the year."

So this is beyond the merger. This is beyond anything like that. 
We don't anticipate temporary cost savings that pop back or anything to that extent, as we've discussed in prior calls. So we see this as a compound value opportunity, as Steve mentioned, and this doesn't assume much volume help at all at this stage on the organic. Obviously, we'll have our backlog volume and then we'll just have to see what happens to the economy. We'll take it quarter-by-quarter, and we'll keep giving updates as they occur. But January was better than what we expected, and we'll just have to see how it plays out in the next 2 months, and we'll give you another update come our next call."

We have a fairly strong CapEx start-ups -- lineup of start-ups in 2021. Of course, it's during different times of the year, so you don't get all the contributions in 2021. They tend to roll over. It's always difficult to talk about what you think a year-end backlog number is going to be because it's really a function of -- you know what you've got in front of you that you're going to book, and I've certainly alluded to a very large project that we're looking forward to telling you more about in the not-too-distant future. 
But what happens during the remainder of the year is kind of a function of, I'd say, the pace of clean energy projects, maybe the pace of other electronics projects. If demand comes back, that generally provides projects for -- we see more project activity, more of our traditional industries like petrochemical and metals. But that kind of -- we have to kind of wait and see. There's not much going on, obviously, in that latter category at this point. It's more around electronics and clean energy. 
So the CapEx spend is pretty consistent. Again, we -- it doesn't move that much unless the backlog really starts to drop year over year-over-year, then you'd see that large project spend continued to drop. The base CapEx is more consistent. There's lots of little growth opportunities inside of that. I said 33 or 36 small on-site that we booked in 2020 there. We have a very strong focus on that. We like those projects. There's good opportunities in some of these markets that Sanjiv alluded to that we'll spend some CapEx against to capitalize on that growth. 
So yes, I do think semiconductors will continue to be a very strong opportunity. Sanjiv talked about that in his comments as well. It's how we work today, virtually, it's the Internet of Things. It's chips that are going to go on everything, especially in automobiles. So semiconductor opportunity is going to be very strong. We've been talking about this for 2 years. We're well positioned in places like South Korea, Taiwan, and China, which is really kind of the axis of where all the semiconductor fabs have been built. There is some new activity. Obviously, the U.S. is trying to go more prime in terms of having domestic semiconductor fabrication."

But if you kind of look at some of the elements of that, there's a significant piece that's electronics. Obviously, that's going to do well. I think the industrial volumes will kind of move as the industry recovers. Balloons are clearly down, have been down, will continue to be down, and I don't have to explain why. And then there's a piece of it for us that's also tied to MRI, and that looks kind of stable to maybe slightly up. So it looks to me like there's going to be sequential improvement, not at a rapid pace, but certainly sequential improvement on volumes going forward. 
I would say in terms of refinery volumes, and what I look at is hydrogen. Clearly, in Q4, we're down something like 7% or so year-over-year. So up a little bit from Q3. And starting off in January, I'm looking at like January versus December, and I'm seeing plus 8% kind of numbers on volume. So they are starting to improve. I think you know what the drivers are behind their end markets. Clearly, jet fuel is very weak, still. Diesel has been strong, gasoline is weaker. And what one would have to expect is as you get deeper into the year and COVID gets behind us, particularly in places like the U.S., that you would see hydrogen volumes improve and should improve considerably. We also have some new project start-ups that will augment that. 
And then if you get into like liquid hydrogen volumes, which aren't necessarily tied to refining, but some piece might go into biofuels, that's a pretty -- that's on a pretty positive trend itself. So that's kind of the status of our volumes to the refining industry, still down year-over-year, but starting to see some improvement.

And so by essentially eliminating the public float, buying all those shares, and being able to run that country just like any other country that we operate around the globe, we can focus on all the things that we know are important, which is making that business better every day, price management, efficiency, and there's quite a bit of opportunity and continue to grow cash flow, being very prudent with capital, working capital, safety, compliance, it's the same list for every country. So I'm pretty confident that we're going to see a pretty nice step-up in that case. But there are other examples of that, too, that clearly is on our target list of places that we want to, I'll say, season and control so we can run them the way we think they should be run."

I mean it's going to be a couple of things, as you can imagine. Clearly, with the synergies, while the fixed costs we were able to get at early in most regions, the variable costs tend to take a little more programs, sometimes they take some capital. And as we've been evolving on that, we've got a better stride there. Also, as you know, the engineering business, it runs most things through COGS, and they had a margin expansion. They were running better through some of their absorption as they were more efficient on how they executed projects and completed projects. That would also have an effect on that given they run through inventory and COGS on a percent completion. 
So a little bit of mix, but also a lot of the effort around the world to just improve the efficiencies across our whole cost stack, not just fixed cost, but variable costs as well.

Clearly, we had to ramp up a lot of healthcare capabilities around the world to fight COVID. Unfortunately, that's not going to be behind us for a while. I think we can see -- you can look at the pace of vaccinations and the advance of these new variants, and I think it's very possible that these variants are going to outpace the world's ability to vaccinate the population. And therefore, they're going to be consuming a lot of action well into 2021. And we might be talking about this again in, this time in 2022. 
So I don't think this is going away anytime soon. You correctly pointed out that while we're providing more oxygen to fight COVID, that there are people that are not having elective surgeries, they didn't go into hospitals. Hospitals are focused, obviously, on fighting this primary virus. And so there's not as much oxygen that's being sold for more of the elective type or more of the non -- more of the traditional types of activities. 
I think post-COVID, obviously, the latter will come back. I do think that our businesses like Lincare have clearly demonstrated to the government and large managed care operators how important it is to have a very strong, capable with wide breadth of capability services, nurses, clinicians, the whole works, that can step in and be a very strong second line of defense for hospitals. 
And so I think in terms of pandemic preparedness going forward, I think we're in a new world now with respect to our relationship with the government. I feel very confident about that. And so I think that's going to be a positive. So that's a, I guess, a silver lining, if you will, of this COVID. It gave us a chance to demonstrate what we could do on a home care basis, not just a broad hospital basis. But it might be this time next year before really talking about a world after COVID. And of course, as oxygen subsides, maybe to fight specifically COVID, then the manufacturing side of the business, the industrial side of the business, there will be more volumes going that way. I mean I can talk about oxygen being up quite a bit. I can also look at argon still being down quite a bit because manufacturing has not come back yet. And so there are trade-offs, obviously."

The way we think about renewable energy, obviously, we are a large user, which gives us some advantages. And being able to combine that to make green hydrogen or make green hydrogen by using renewable power source in terms of just which you can get off the grid through electrolysis, I think is important to being able to produce and sell 100% carbon-free hydrogen. 
The pricing that we see, I mean we have a fairly sophisticated group of people because, again, we buy a lot -- we buy -- I think it's $3 billion last year of power around the world. So we buy a lot of power. We're pretty sophisticated in terms of how we negotiate contracts. What I've seen, it's been on par with what we would normally get and so we're not looking to sacrifice economics to claim we have a higher percent renewable, we want to accomplish both. And I think we're up to 37% renewable now. I think we were at 34% or so, 33% maybe a couple of years ago. So we're making some progress. The goal was to double the original number. And if I remember right, that's like going from $1 billion of renewable power purchases to about $2 billion. So it is something that we're focused on here, and it's obviously -- if the ultimate goal is to be carbon neutral by some date, then obviously, by either proactively contract renewable power or just countries naturally green their grids, it's going to be an important part of how we ultimately get there."

This was new to half the organization if you will, but the way they've embraced it and kind of move forward with it has been very, very encouraging. 
I want to give you a different slant on productivity as well. One of the things that we drive at is sustainable productivity. Productivity that helps our sustainability targets and ensuring that we're contributing to those goals that we set up. And we do that through making sure we've got sustainability initiatives, again, within the business on efficiency, on energy management, on managing emissions, et cetera, which all of which actually contribute not just to the bottom line, which is very important for me, but also impacted the sustainability goals that we've set up as well. 
And again, I'd say there's a lot more work to be done, but we are really off to a great start in that space. So as I see it, I think we are well on our way on this journey. Obviously, we can see a lot of benefit ahead of us if we continue to keep the pace and momentum on this."

Because renewable power costs are still relatively high around the world. They need to come down as we scale up. So I'm kind of looking at as you get into bigger projects. So that's a factor. This is a relatively large PEM. As I said, it's the largest one announced, 24 megawatts. So this is not where it's going to be 10 years from now in terms of cost. It's at kind of the early days in terms of producing projects of this size. So the CapEx costs are higher, the OpEx costs are higher. So we know costs need to come down, both through the whole electrolysis process, but also in the renewable power. Renewable power is a significant factor of that. So those costs are going to come down. 
We clearly received subsidies in this project. In fact, most of these projects, we do receive subsidies. So that clearly helps with these projects. And that's probably important until the costs do come down so that green hydrogen can be competitive, I'd say, on its own with gray hydrogen. Though there's always going to be some gap, but I think closing that gap is very important. And obviously, a carbon price as it's assigned to carbon molecules in the future will help do that. But this project works. Obviously, we have negotiations that have been completed before we ever made the announcement. So we know that the prices work. 
But there certainly are sensitivities around the market price on the non-contracted piece like there would be with any merchant liquid business. And there's sensitivities around the input side on renewable power. And we took very conservative assumptions going into this, thinking that we probably were going to end up with a better deal that would help us when we finally conclude the power negotiations. So that's how I'd answer that. But you're right. I've said 50%, it's probably 60% is probably closer to the truth."

But what I think is you take a place like the U.S. Gulf Coast, which you have very strong, large scale, very efficient refineries. They can use -- you know the story, they can use heavier sweet feedstocks. They're very complex refineries. They can produce a full suite of transportation fuels. They're heavily integrated with the petrochemical industry at large in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So I happen to think that if people think they're going to turn into a dinosaur, they'll probably be -- the last dinosaurs walking around are going to be down in the U.S. Gulf Coast."

They have an incentive to have us capture that carbon, and we have a use for it in terms of commercial, whether it's for greenhouses, whether it's for -- to make dry ice, pH control, carbon -- carbonation of beverages, all of those are uses of CO2. 
So we have specific projects which I think certainly help with the economics where you have an end market use for the CO2. We have several projects like that. We have others that we have worked on or working on with, say, coal-fired utilities that are looking at carbon capture. We obviously have solutions around -- we have multiple solutions around carbon capture, but it can be post-combustion, it can be pre-combustion. And I think for some of those to move forward, particularly in a place like the United States, you need a more defined cost of carbon, of CO2. But I think when that happens and you have to think that this administration is very determined to make that happen, you will see some of these projects move forward. I don't think it's going to be as large as I look at it today. I could be wrong as perhaps the straight hydrogen opportunities, but they can be significant, too."

So the market in Asia Pacific, as you might imagine, is quite varied and the largest market in there for us is obviously China. So the dynamic around pricing that we see is twofold. One, obviously, we have many large on-site projects. So obviously, from a portfolio perspective, the opportunity around the merchant side pricing impact that we can fully bring to bear is a little bit more limited than potentially some of the other segments. But more importantly, I think in a market like China where we've got some significant end-user customers, which is where we focus our efforts and energy on. But at times, we would use the distributor model as well to make sure that we've got our plants running at optimal levels. And in 2020, in particular, that became quite important. 
So we wanted to make sure that channel was fully utilized. And when you do that, then the pricing impact actually does get moderated down a little bit. You've seen that happen in 2020. It is an area of focus. And just as I talked about productivity, the other piece I'd say is pricing is an area of focus every day. And the guys in China, in particular, know that we are watching that very carefully. We review that every month at the GbR and they do have a bit of a tough time around that. So there is a lot of action happening in the marketplace around that, which hopefully will reflect in the quarters ahead."

Well, I think -- as I think about that question, Laurence, there are so many uses for our basic core products, CO2, oxygen, our rare gases, all of our products that they become new uses, and we talk about CO2 for greenhouse gases. And of course, you have this little thing called cannabis, which is a growing marketplace. Dry ice for biopharma, dry ice to carry it back. Dry ice has been around a long time. So there we continue to find good uses and applications, new uses and applications in markets that are growing. If you look at commercial space, we're selling hydrogen. We're selling oxygen. We are selling nitrogen as rocket propellants, they call it. And what is used depends on the rocket and the platform and the company. We also sell rare gases that are used in, I'll call it, satellite mobility. 
So a lot of new markets that are developing that consume our basic gases. And as far as -- I don't like to stray too far away from our, I'll call it, our core knitting. Our business model is pretty good. And we think we are pretty good at executing this business model. So history has shown us that you never want to lose sight of your strengths, and we won't do that. But certainly, any opportunity that's developing that we think lends itself to an industrial gas approach, model approach, we'll certainly pursue. We all like growth here. It certainly -- that's not a problem. So in terms of acquisitions, I think that we'll -- you'll be seeing a lot more. We'll be doing a lot in the packaged gas space. I think we'll do it in the healthcare space. I think those are natural. Decaps kind of come and go. You can look at the same decap for 5 years and nothing moves forward. 
So that's more opportunistic in my mind. As far as blending hydrogen into natural gas, I mean that is the clear intention of this partnership that we formed with Snam in Italy, which is the largest natural gas operator in Europe. And they're very committed to blending hydrogen in with their natural gas. I have to go back and look, I think it's probably at the 10% level. But even that, if you did that across the entire world, that's a very significant amount. There are some limitations because you got to start changing out burner equipment on the other end. 
Compression. You might have to change out compression depending on how high of the mix you get of the hydrogen and certain kind of metallurgy, you have to take a closer look at as hydrogen grows. But it is something that I think is getting closer to fruition."

10% EPS outlook excludes the impact from the transition to clean energy. Currently, we view the benefits from this transition as incremental to our EPS outlook. Clean Energy, of course, is a hot topic, as you all know. In fact, I haven't quite realized how many global hydrogen experts they really were until only 6 months ago. However, producing, storing and supplying hydrogen to enable cleaner fuels is something we've been doing for decades. In fact, hydrogen has been one of our fastest-growing molecules over the past 10 years. So given this, I'd like to use the last few slides to provide you a view on the overall clean energy market, explained why Linde is exceptionally well positioned to succeed and share with you our overarching strategy going forward. But before I start, I want to state that we are not providing specific guidance on either expected sales or wins from clean energy at this time. This is a rapidly evolving landscape with many countries taking different parts. So the pace of the transition is just too uncertain to make multiyear detailed projections. However, what I can confirm is that Linde has the experience, the technology and the asset network to be a significant player in the transition. 
To further elaborate on this, I'd like to provide you our view of the keen energy market on the next slide, Slide 6. It's safe to say that nobody really knows how the decarbonization market will ultimately play out. So it may be helpful to start with an overview of the potential opportunity. We think of clean energy transition in 2 main pieces. The first being how we can provide solutions to managing carbon and the second relating to clean hydrogen development. Now we already have a number of significant applications that reduce, capture, sequester or clean and monetized gas streams for use. A good example of this is our current carbon dioxide business at about $1.3 billion, serving several key end markets. 
Looking ahead, we see more opportunities for our technologies and solutions to enable our customers to reduce their carbon footprint through capture and removal of their emissions. Furthermore, we believe blue and green hydrogen will both play an important role in the transition to cleaner energy. In theory, the total available opportunity can be represented by the current $6 trillion of hydrocarbon market. However, that will be served by a blend of solutions, and it will take years to evolve. So As an example, 1 estimate assumes clean hydrogen will reach $100 billion by 2030. Or say, roughly 1.5% of today's hydrocarbon market. But time will tell. 
Given the uncertainty, as I said before, I'm not going to provide you a specific estimate or time line today, but I do want to reiterate that this is a significant opportunity for Linde and something we see as an upside to our PACE business. So with this as a backdrop, it may be helpful to understand what Linde brings to the table regarding technology, asset network and experience which you can find on the next slide, Slide 7. 
Whether it's production, distribution or application and services, we have over 50 years of experience as an owner and an operator of billions of dollars of hydrogen infrastructure. We are agnostic to how that molecule is made, whether it's through reforming chemistry or bioelectric. We have the technology and the operating expertise for all of them. Furthermore, we have the largest and the most dense hydrogen distribution network in the world. This will be crucial to ensuring a safe, reliable and cost-effective energy transition. 
Our technology, many proprietary applications and extended service capabilities, position us exceptionally well for this opportunity. 
And finally, we also have the ability to leverage our engineering business to integrate various technologies into solutions and to offer sale of gas or selectively sale of equipment, providing us a unique competitive advantage. 
Overall, we have a very long and successful history supporting the transition to clean energy, and I believe we are incredibly well positioned across the entire value chain as this initiative accelerates. 
I'd like to wrap up the clean energy discussion on the next slide, Slide 8, with a view of our overarching strategy and give you some key supporting examples as well. The strategy on the left is something we've mentioned before. It represents a proven approach to profitably growing an industrial gas business, including hydrogen. It starts with leveraging a leading integrated asset network. In addition to that, we execute locally market-driven strategies. We believe many of these initiatives will vary by country. We also expect to continue to advance and grow our technology leadership in this space across the value chain by leveraging the expertise of our engineering team, as well as developing partnerships that provide us access, insight and hopefully accelerate opportunities. 
Now on the right-hand side of the slide, you'll see 3 projects we recently announced. I just want to remind you that these are part of our base CapEx and therefore, not included in the $3.5 billion backlog. Now these projects are over $350 million for green and blue hydrogen infrastructure in South Korea, Germany and the United States. Just to pick on the example in South Korea. We are partnering with one of the largest industrial conglomerates to build out a liquid hydrogen infrastructure to fuel municipality buses there. We continue to evaluate a significant and growing number of opportunities from large mega projects to very small ones. But irrespective of the size of the opportunity, we will always maintain our disciplined approach to pursuing projects that meet our investment criteria. This summarizes our midterm strategy and how we currently sleep the clean energy market. But this is something I'll provide more updates on in the future as it continues to evolve. 
Now before I hand over to Matt, I want to make one final point on our ESG initiatives. Simply said, ESG is embedded in our culture. It's part of our operating rhythm and it's part of our compensation philosophy. It has been an integral part of our values and forms the foundation of Linde's mission statement, making our world more productive. I'm pleased to say we are currently tracking ahead in many of the initiatives we laid out in early 2020, including carbon emission intensity reduction and increasing gender diversity, but this isn't enough. We know we need to do more. We are therefore in the process of thoughtfully developing more ambitious ESG goals, which I expect to share with you in a future call. But until then, you can be certain that we will continue to improve our performance in this area. So with that, I'd now hand over to Matt, who will take you through the financial results and our guidance. Matt?"

Please turn to Slide 9 for an overview of the first quarter results. Before I jump into the numbers, I'd like to remind you that we deconsolidated a joint venture in APAC, which reduces sales and operating profit by about 3%  but has no effect on EPS since we are maintaining a consistent ownership position. This deconsolidation is shown as a divestiture, and we provide further details in the APAC segment results, which you can find in the appendix. 
Total sales grew 7% from last year and were flat sequentially. Underlying sales increased 5% from prior year and 2% sequentially. Volumes continue to recover, growing 3% over last year and 1% over the fourth quarter. Sequentially, negative seasonal effects and temporary outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast from Storm Berry were more than offset by a broad-based increase in volumes. Industrial production levels have consistently risen in most geographies which supports volume recovery in the packaged and merchant supply modes. And note that while had a temporary negative effect on sales for the first quarter, profit impact was immaterial due to our contractual structure. 
Referring to our end market trends in the appendix, every end market grew sequentially and over prior year, except for food, mostly due to restaurant closures and seasonality in GIST, our distribution business in the U.K. 
Pricing improvements of 2% and is in line with globally weighted inflation. Since the majority of our contracts have mechanisms in place to adjust for local cost inflation. Operating profit increased 25% over prior year from a combination of higher pricing, incremental volumes and a lower cost base. Furthermore, operating margins expanded 320 basis points, which marks the seventh consecutive quarter that we have expanded operating margins more than 200 basis points. of $2.49 grew 32% from last year and 8% sequentially. You can see the wider than normal growth rate differential between operating profit and EPS, which is mostly driven by the joint venture deconsolidation. We had another strong quarter in capital management, with operating cash flow up 57% and return on capital reaching 14.5%. 
ROC levels have been trending well as we continue to grow earnings by double-digit percent while maintaining a disciplined and focused capital allocation process. 
CapEx is down 5% from prior year as temporary declines in project backlog spending, more than offset increases in growth projects categorized as base CapEx. Approximately 40% of base CapEx is for growth, including the clean energy projects Sanjiv mentioned, as well as the majority of small on-site wins we announced yesterday. 
Overall, these results clearly validate our positive leverage to the economic recovery while offering significant downside protection as evidenced in 2020. Slide 10 provides an update on our capital management process. It starts with cash generation, which you can see on the left side. Linde employees have done a great job focusing on cash conversion and thus making more capital available for the company to deploy. 
Available operating cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less base CapEx and has exceeded $1.5 billion for the last 2 quarters. And while we continue to generate healthy levels of cash, how we spend it is equally important, which is shown on the right half of the slide. 
Our capital allocation process is simple and consistent. We have a mandate to maintain an A credit rating and raise the dividend every year, after which our priority is to invest in growth that meets our criteria. And then any leftover cash is used for stock repurchases. The pie chart represents how we spent the first quarter operating cash, investing $0.8 billion to grow and returning $1.4 billion to shareholders. This approach provides balance, but more importantly, forms the foundation of the strategy and earnings outlook provided by Sanjiv. 
I'll wrap up with guidance, which you can find on Slide 11. The second quarter guidance range is $2.50 to $2.55. The The midpoint represents an increase of 33% over 2020 and 38% over 2019. I believe it's important to provide the 2019 comparison to properly distinguish between true growth, which this demonstrates, from mere recovery which other companies may be showing. This guidance includes an estimated year-over-year FX tailwind of 4% since Q2 of 2020 was the low point on foreign currency weakness. Sequentially, this range assumes stable economic conditions with a moderate improvement related to normal seasonality. In other words, the Q2 guidance range does not assume any improvement in the underlying economy from Q1. Note that preliminary April results came in better than our internal estimates. So if these conditions persist, Q2 EPS would be at the upper end or above this range. The updated full year guidance range is $9.60 to $9.80 or $0.50 higher than what we provided last quarter. The midpoint of the range is 18% above 2020 and 32% above 2019. I'd like to explain how we approached full year guidance especially as it relates to the half year comparisons. At this point, we have updated full year for the better performance in Q1 and the latest Q2 outlook of which this first half year combined was approximately $0.50 better. However, we have not updated the second half guidance. In other words, we left the second half alone until we get a better sense of the recovery pace. Rest assured, we will capture any improvement in the economy as we have recently demonstrated. Furthermore, we will provide a more detailed update next quarter. However, today, we are refraining from adjusting the back half until we get more visibility. Of course, if economic conditions hold or improve, we will be above this full year range. But for now, we believe this is the most prudent approach given the global uncertainty. I'd now like to turn the call over for Q&A."

Today, we do see that differential between green hydrogen to gray and blue hydrogen. Obviously, blue hydrogen somewhere in the middle, providing a more immediate scalable option. But green hydrogen for it to kind of get to a point of inflection where adoption really happens. Essentially, 3 things need to happen. The first, regulators across the world need to get to a view on what carbon tax, what carbon pricing or other mechanisms that create that incentive to go and do something about it are put in place. We can talk about what that range might look like, if you like. But that's a necessity. The second is, you've got to see the technology evolve and get down to a point where you're seeing significant reduction in costs. There are 2 costs for green hydrogen, as you're well aware, Bob. One is obviously renewable energy becoming cheaper. I know there's a lot of work happening in that space. And equally, we're doing a lot of work on the second option, which is about making sure that our planned CapEx comes down. So working through ITM on the PEM option as an example. but also making sure that efficiencies around that, the membranes improve sufficiently to give us a little bit of lift there as well. So all of those 3 things need to happen, Bob, for really adoption to happen the inflection point that I referenced earlier on."

That's almost tenfold of what we were producing and delivering just 4 weeks ago. So a huge amount of work has gone in there. We've deployed about 1,200 drivers on the road, serving about 1,000 hospitals in the country. There's been phenomenal work being done on that.

But the reality is they were faced with similar challenges and have done enormously good work to support hospitals and patients. So I'm really proud that our teams across the world are doing their bit to support our communities through this pandemic. Now PJ, I'm going to kind of most specifically talk to your question on inflation and our view on inflation, as you know, we price to a weighted average on inflation typically. And as we think about inflation, our kind of natural conclusion there is that we will see prices going up as inflation happens. And as you know, have a great track record of being able to do that consistently. In fact, even when inflation wasn't quite there, you've seen us perform on our pricing. History on pricing is positive if you go back 20 years as well. And that's kind of the DNA that the team carries to move forward on the pricing piece. So fully expect to see that happening as inflation does come into play."

Their consumption of gases also tends to go up. So we'll see to what extent you can see that as well. I mean we're starting to see parts of it.

This is something that -- this is the hard work that everyone in the world is doing. This is about putting together quality business and making sure we run it efficiently and effectively. And as far as good as it gets, we get asked that question every quarter. But I would say this -- when I said it before, just look at the segments, right? When you look at the geographic segments of Americas, EMEA and APAC. There's nothing that is fundamentally different between those 3 segments. We do the same thing. It is a very homogeneous business. They supply across all 3 supply modes. They have end market distributions that aren't drastically different. So that kind of defines what the opportunity set is. And if you go back to 2018, Americas was 23%, EMEA was 17%. Now EMEA over 25% and America is 28%. So you're seeing the improvement across the board, APAC as well, almost 25% was 17%. And This is part of what we're doing to run this business, and I don't see any temporary aspect. And I would say whichever segment is leading, is kind of showing the way."

Thanks a lot for that detail on clean energy. Actually, again, I hear you in terms of the timing being uncertain and some of the opportunities being long dated.

So let me just take a step back and give you a sense of the projects we're looking at and then dive a little bit deeper and tell you where we see some of that kind of buildup that you were asking about.

And we see, obviously, many of them progressing, some maybe not. And there'll be others that we will probably not want to do because they don't meet our investment criteria, so we'll be kind of selective about that as well. Now we see that spread focused in 2 specific areas primarily. I think mobility driving a lot is kind of well ahead, if you like, in its development. And then carbon capture and sequestration picking up, particularly in geographies which have oil and gas assets and therefore, want to understand how best to manage the energy transition through this piece. To your exact point on which part of the value chain we see, I think in mobility tends to be a little bit of a balance between what we see around production versus distribution and dispensation. We have technologies across the entire value chain. So in many ways, we are really fortunate to have the ability to kind of be able to provide that holistic solution to our potential customers. On CCS, obviously, it tends to be a lot more on the production side, which is where the blue hydrogen piece, in particular, as a consequence of CCS comes into play.

As you well know, the spread of our price less cost inflation of productivity is a very important metric that is part of our operating rhythm, that we look at, at every country at the lowest levels of detail. Because that spread is very important. How we manage that spread as the compound decades go. And every country is different, right? Every country has different inflation profiles, but the spread is something we constantly look at. So given in the first quarter here, obviously, we have the price at the top of the house at 2%. On our cost front, they were lower, as you probably saw, especially on the fixed cost just due to some efficiencies we were able to achieve. We're also achieving efficiencies in the variable cost. So the spread was probably a little wider in this first quarter. But nevertheless, on a go-forward basis, we always have to make sure we manage that spread, and we feel quite confident in our ability to do it. And also the things, the large commodity inputs since we pass them through, they don't create as much issues on that as you might see in other types of industries.

So that's good that we are seeing action from these larger players. In addition to that, obviously, we then go out specifically and sign up PPAs with renewable power kind of developers who, in some cases, on a one-on-one basis in other cases on a shared basis, we would then get into long-term contracts with. Often providing them support for their broader project as well.

And something that we believe provides a really wholesome growth kind of opportunity for our businesses across the world. So there are a couple of ways to kind of look at that portfolio and see how that correlates to what we're seeing in the market. So we're seeing that growth not coming from COVID. There is no linkage to that at all. Most of these units are VPSA units, which are slightly lower purity, typically going into industrial processes. We do that for pulp and paper. We've seen a fair amount of growth in pulp and paper. We are seeing growth in some other segments -- ancillary segments around metals as well and glass and many others in fact. So I mean it is a widespread portfolio that supports a large number of different industries. I would say to you that it's a good point to industrial activity generally. I don't see a particular correlation for larger projects, if that was your question. But we do see this kind of correlate to industrial activity and as people move their consumption increases, these come into play."

I think about China, South Korea, India, a couple of the ASEAN markets as well. So we're seeing a lot more projects. Now, a part of these projects are electronics. You've heard me talk about electronics before, about a strong growth we've seen in the quarter and my expectation is that we will see a lot more of electronic project growth happen as we see these new fab buildups happen as well. They are progressing well. They're all on track, and you've seen a number of announcements, I'm sure, from TSMC, Samsung, Intel and so on and so forth. So those are all looking to be on track and part of that activity. I also have to say that the other piece I'm a little more -- I'm a little more positive on is the more traditional markets, steel, chemicals, refining, also project activity actually picking up over there as we see. So I'm not going to comment particularly on if we are seeing potentially this as a snapback. I see this as fundamental underlying activity picking up and translating them into projects that people are pursuing, and we are getting a chance to participate in."

About the productivity being embedded, obviously, in in the PLC, is the story now on productivity more about not adding costs back if the volumes continue to grow rather than savage cost cutting as such because I did notice, obviously, Q4, we'll get the Q1 numbers later in terms of the headcount and the severance costs. But they did slow, obviously, in the fourth quarter from the pace earlier in the year. And then for Matt, on the cash flow, I mean, the Q1 performance now is what we would normally see in the legacy companies, excuse me, in Q4, which is normally the strongest quarter. I'm just wondering how that progresses through the year, given that you always make more money in the second half?"

I'm going to give you a quick view on productivity. So you've heard me say this before, and I think Matt kind of made a very good observation earlier on, which is that We are always going to be very, very focused on managing our cost base. Our total cash fixed cost is something we kind of discuss every month of the business reviews that we carry out. So adding costs back is something we kind of manage actively I think it doesn't necessarily translate into productivity because for productivity, we want to see that incremental action as well, which makes it tough. But it is in the DNA of the organization, Peter, and you've heard me talk kind of passionately about the fact that every individual in our organization has got a mandate to go out and look for productivity every day. It's thousands of projects which add small benefits but actually flow into the entire productivity part that we put together. There's one other thing which I think is now enabling that or helping us accelerate that, and that's around digitalization. And again, hopefully, you've heard me speak about this as well before. We're using digitalization, not as a significant tool that's going to create earth shattering new discoveries for us, but it's something that we apply in our business to deal with pain points every day. Our organizational model is embedded within the organization. So digital kind of expertise is being built up within every business across the world, and we are encouraging them. And in fact, I track it every quarter to ask them what percentage of productivity is coming from digital work or initiatives that we put in place. So that is an enabler that I see in actually ensuring our productivity stays on track. Matt?"

I think starting with -- when I think about operating cash flow kind of as a percentage of our EBITDA, we were almost high 80s this quarter. Normally, to your point, Q1 is seasonally lower. So I think it's a combination of a few things. I mean first of all, obviously, with EPS growing at 32%, half of the benefit just came from earnings. So as we continue to have strong earnings growth, that should flow right through the cash flow. The other half of the year-over-year improvement was mostly working capital as we had net everywhere else. And we're just seeing strong performance around the world in terms of collections, management of payables, inventory, just managing the asset and liability base quite well. Engineering had a very strong working capital performance as well as they continue to manage their projects incredibly well under different -- difficult circumstances. As you look forward into the second half, I think it should just be a continuation of an earnings driven with tight working capital management efforts. So If we can continue to see kind of the strong results that should flow through to cash. I mean cash is an integral part of our compensation. It's something that we track very diligently each month, and we're seeing the benefits, I think of that effort, and we should continue to see the benefits of that effort looking forward."

And we would anticipate to continue to see growth in base CapEx primarily around either distribution, infrastructure-type assets to support and some production assets, whether it be electrolyzers or other kinds of hydrogen -- smaller hydrogen producing assets. So from that perspective, I would model that 40% or more growth portion of the base CapEx might accelerate related to these initiatives. If there are any backlog projects, they would likely be announced in terms of being additions to the backlog. But I would say from a CapEx spend and benefit, we're not changing our investment criteria, it's the same. How we approach these is the same. And so I would just model it, just like Sanjiv said, it's incremental to the greater than 10% EPS growth rate that we're looking to do and what we find and can add into this should be accretive to that over the coming years here."

So again, I think it's a good opportunity for me to just mention that our team in Texas did an outstanding job. They've managed to ensure that we shut down and started up safely, quickly. We were able to support our customers. And even in some cases, some of the players who are not our customers to just make sure that they remain safe and helping them with their start-ups as well. So our customers really have actually started up and are operational now, whether it's refineries, chemicals, all of them back online, and we're seeing volumes back to pre-COVID levels in some cases as well, particularly on the chemical side. Bulk customers, again, I think we saw a quick turnaround over there post the winter freeze and again, with some support from us, our customers are back up and running. We see levels back to January already in that space as well. Refinery is probably the most specific one where you know that they have a longer lead time to startups. Even there, we were quite pleased to see that they were up and running in 3 or 4 weeks. And today hydrogen volumes are about 12%. I think they're about higher than where we were earlier in the year. So again, it's been pretty good in terms of how that overall piece has been managed. I guess the point that the guys in Texas said to me, which I think holds here as well is, we're used to seeing storms, hurricanes, freezes. This is not new. This is something that we work on every year and we've got a team that fully understands that and getting plants back online is significantly important, making sure our customers have the product available to keep them safe and ready to go. Now contractually, obviously, we are well protected, as you've just remarked. So that's one of the reasons we don't see a significant exposure. While we see some top line movement.

And",1952,"Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Once again, the Linde team delivered another stellar quarter across all fronts, 32% growth in EPS, 57% growth in operating cash flows, operating margins expanding 320 basis points and of course, ROC at 14.5%. And of course, very strong progress across our ESG goals of reducing carbon intensity and making strides in gender diversity. Matt will walk through the more -- through the details on the financial numbers. But frankly, they speak for themselves. A few months ago, we marked the 2-year anniversary of the merger. So I'd like to take the opportunity to recap both our performance and also provide you a medium-term outlook on expected financial performance going ahead. 
Let me move on to Slide 3. Slide 3 shows our 2018 to 2020 growth relative to key competitors across 4 major financial metrics: EPS, operating profit margin, operating cash flows and, of course, very importantly, return on capital. From my perspective, these are the 4 most important financial metrics to determine performance in this industry. And it is, of course, quite clear from that slide, as you see, that we have led across all 4. In fact, I'd say with some pride that Linde has the undisputed best performance in the entire industry since our merger. Our employees have accomplished this while integrating 2 global companies during possibly the worst pandemic in a century. But of course, this is nothing new. We have been the industry leader for almost 3 decades now. 
And I want to move on to Slide 4 and talk a little bit about that history of over 25 years from 1993 to 2017 as the last full year before the merger. The compound annual growth rate of Linde's sales, EPS, dividend and operating cash flow exceeds both competitors across the board. We have a long history of generating compound value for our shareholders while sustainably and profitably growing the company. And of course, Linde's outperformance extends beyond just our industry. On the right-hand side over there, you can see the EPS CAGR that we've had over the same period against the broader S&P 500. So it's clear we've been the industry leader for many years, and we fully expect to continue that trend for decades to come. 
Our midterm strategy, which is on our next Slide 5, provides a road map on how we plan to get there. Most of you have seen this strategy before. It's fairly straightforward and simple enough that we can summarize it on one page. It starts, of course, with optimizing our base business of industrial gases and engineering. I've said this before, our unique operating rhythm provides a real competitive advantage on how we extract value year in and year out, irrespective of the macroeconomic climate. We've, of course, proven this in the prior recessions and some black swan events, including the most recent COVID pandemic. 
So while our resilient business model provides downside protection, we also have the ability to leverage and any economic recovery due to our exposure to the cyclical end markets, primarily here through merchant and packaged gases. Of course, the pricing structure here also helps as it closely correlates with inflation. You've already seen some of that demonstrated in the last few quarters, and I anticipate further upside if the economy continues to recover. 
Finally, we will continue to grow by capitalizing on future opportunities. Linde has demonstrated the highest compound growth rate in the industry across all key financial metrics, and we expect to maintain this distinction. Currently, there are secular growth drivers around 2 of our key markets that comprise about 30% of our sales. These are health care and electronics. You're all familiar with what is happening in the electronic space today. 
Our customers are looking to expand production of chips to meet soaring demand while improving and strengthening local supply chain logistics. We are an integral part of this development as industrial gases are a critical component to successfully operating a modern fab today. I fully expect electronics to comprise the largest portion of backlog wins over the next couple of years as we continue to see high levels of interest for new customer builds.
Furthermore, the health care market continues to grow as well, combination of demographics and trend towards telehealth. As you know, our health care business, particularly the home care business, served as a critical second line of defense during the recent pandemic. And, of course, we expect future trends to create new growth opportunities, allowing us to leverage our leading dense network to support momentum towards a distributed health care market. The combination of these strategic elements should enable us to grow annual earnings per share on average more than 10%. That is something we've demonstrated throughout our history, and we feel confident we can continue for the long term. 
Now you will notice, I said 10% EPS outlook excludes the impact from the transition to clean energy. Currently, we view the benefits from this transition as incremental to our EPS outlook. Clean energy, of course, is a hot topic, as you all know. In fact, I haven't quite realized how many global hydrogen experts there really were until only 6 months ago. However, producing, storing and supplying hydrogen to enable cleaner fuels is something we've been doing for decades. In fact, hydrogen has been one of our fastest-growing molecules over the past 10 years. So given this, I'd like to use the last few slides to provide you a view on the overall clean energy market, explain why Linde is exceptionally well positioned to succeed and share with you our overarching strategy going forward. 
But before I start, I want to state that we are not providing specific guidance on either expected sales or wins from clean energy at this time. This is a rapidly evolving landscape with many countries taking different paths. So the pace of the transition is just too uncertain to make multiyear detailed projections. However, what I can confirm is that Linde has the experience, the technology and the asset network to be a significant player in the transition.  
To further elaborate on this, I'd like to provide you our view of the clean energy market on the next slide, Slide 6. It's safe to say that nobody really knows how the decarbonization market will ultimately play out. So it may be helpful to start with an overview of the potential opportunity. We think of clean energy transition in 2 main pieces. The first being how we can provide solutions to managing carbon and the second relating to clean hydrogen development. Now we already have a number of significant applications that reduce, capture, sequester or clean and monetize gas streams for use. A good example of this is our current carbon dioxide business at about $1.3 billion, serving several key end markets.  
Looking ahead, we see more opportunities for our technologies and solutions to enable our customers to reduce their carbon footprint through capture and removal of their emissions. Furthermore, we believe blue and green hydrogen will both play an important role in the transition to cleaner energy. In theory, the total available opportunity can be represented by the current $6 trillion of hydrocarbon market. However, that will be served by a blend of solutions, and it will take years to evolve. So as an example, one estimate assumes clean hydrogen will reach $100 billion by 2030. Or say, roughly 1.5% of today's hydrocarbon market. But time will tell.  
Given the uncertainty, as I said before, I'm not going to provide you a specific estimate or time line today, but I do want to reiterate that this is a significant opportunity for Linde and something we see as an upside to our base business. So with this as a backdrop, it may be helpful to understand what Linde brings to the table regarding technology, asset network and experience which you can find on the next slide, Slide 7.  
Whether it's production, distribution or application and services, we have over 50 years of experience as an owner and an operator of billions of dollars of hydrogen infrastructure. We are agnostic to how that molecule is made, whether it's through reforming chemistry or by electrolysis. We have the technology and the operating expertise for all of them. Furthermore, we have the largest and the most dense hydrogen distribution network in the world. This will be crucial to ensuring a safe, reliable and cost-effective energy transition.  
Our technology, many proprietary applications and extended service capabilities, position us exceptionally well for this opportunity.  
And finally, we also have the ability to leverage our engineering business to integrate various technologies into solutions and to offer sale of gas or selectively, sale of equipment, providing us a unique competitive advantage.  
Overall, we have a very long and successful history supporting the transition to clean energy, and I believe we are incredibly well positioned across the entire value chain as this initiative accelerates.  
I'd like to wrap up the clean energy discussion on the next slide, Slide 8, with a view of our overarching strategy and give you some key supporting examples as well. The strategy on the left is something we've mentioned before. It represents a proven approach to profitably growing an industrial gas business, including hydrogen. It starts with leveraging a leading integrated asset network. In addition to that, we execute locally market-driven strategies. We believe many of these initiatives will vary by country. We also expect to continue to advance and grow our technology leadership in this space across the value chain by leveraging the expertise of our engineering team as well as developing partnerships that provide us access, insight and hopefully accelerate opportunities.  
Now on the right-hand side of the slide, you'll see 3 projects we recently announced. I just want to remind you that these are part of our base CapEx and, therefore, not included in the $3.5 billion backlog. Now these projects are over $350 million for green and blue hydrogen infrastructure in South Korea, Germany and the United States. Just to pick on the example in South Korea. We are partnering with one of the largest industrial conglomerates to build out a liquid hydrogen infrastructure to fuel municipality buses there. 
We continue to evaluate a significant and growing number of opportunities from large megaprojects to very small ones. But irrespective of the size of the opportunity, we will always maintain our disciplined approach to pursuing projects that meet our investment criteria. This summarizes our midterm strategy and how we currently see the clean energy market. But this is something I'll provide more updates on in the future as it continues to evolve.  
Now before I hand over to Matt, I want to make one final point on our ESG initiatives. Simply said, ESG is embedded in our culture. It's part of our operating rhythm and it's part of our compensation philosophy. It has been an integral part of our values and forms the foundation of Linde's mission statement, making our world more productive. 
I'm pleased to say we are currently tracking ahead in many of the initiatives we laid out in early 2020, including carbon emission intensity reduction and increasing gender diversity, but this isn't enough. We know we need to do more. We are therefore in the process of thoughtfully developing more ambitious ESG goals, which I expect to share with you in a future call. But until then, you can be certain that we will continue to improve our performance in this area. So with that, I'd now hand over to Matt, who will take you through the financial results and our guidance. Matt?"

Please turn to Slide 9 for an overview of the first quarter results. Before I jump into the numbers, I'd like to remind you that we deconsolidated a joint venture in APAC, which reduces sales and operating profit by about 3%  but has no effect on EPS since we are maintaining a consistent ownership position. This deconsolidation is shown as a divestiture, and we provide further details in the APAC segment results, which you can find in the appendix.  
Total sales grew 7% from last year and were flat sequentially. Underlying sales increased 5% from prior year and 2% sequentially. Volumes continue to recover, growing 3% over last year and 1% over the fourth quarter. Sequentially, negative seasonal effects and temporary outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast from Storm Uri were more than offset by a broad-based increase in volumes. Industrial production levels have consistently risen in most geographies, which supports volume recovery in the packaged and merchant supply modes. And note that while Uri had a temporary negative effect on sales for the first quarter, profit impact was immaterial due to our contractual structure.  
Referring to our end market trends in the appendix, every end market grew sequentially and over prior year, except for food, mostly due to restaurant closures and seasonality in GIST, our distribution business in the U.K.  
Pricing improvements of 2% is in line with globally weighted inflation, since the majority of our contracts have mechanisms in place to adjust for local cost inflation. Operating profit increased 25% over prior year from a combination of higher pricing, incremental volumes and a lower cost base. Furthermore, operating margins expanded 320 basis points, which marks the seventh consecutive quarter that we have expanded operating margins more than 200 basis points. EPS of $2.49 grew 32% from last year and 8% sequentially. You can see the wider than normal growth rate differential between operating profit and EPS, which is mostly driven by the joint venture deconsolidation. We had another strong quarter in capital management, with operating cash flow up 57% and return on capital reaching 14.5%.  
ROC levels have been trending well as we continue to grow earnings by double-digit percent while maintaining a disciplined and focused capital allocation process.  
CapEx is down 5% from prior year as temporary declines in project backlog spending more than offset increases in growth projects categorized as base CapEx. Approximately 40% of base CapEx is for growth, including the clean energy projects Sanjiv mentioned as well as the majority of small on-site wins we announced yesterday.  
Overall, these results clearly validate our positive leverage to the economic recovery while offering significant downside protection as evidenced in 2020. Slide 10 provides an update on our capital management process. It starts with cash generation, which you can see on the left side. Linde employees have done a great job focusing on cash conversion and thus making more capital available for the company to deploy.  
Available operating cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less base CapEx, has exceeded $1.5 billion for the last 2 quarters. And while we continue to generate healthy levels of cash, how we spend it is equally important, which is shown on the right half of the slide.  
Our capital allocation process is simple and consistent. We have a mandate to maintain an A credit rating and raise the dividend every year. After which, our priority is to invest in growth that meets our criteria. And then any leftover cash is used for stock repurchases. The pie chart represents how we spent the first quarter operating cash, investing $0.8 billion to grow and returning $1.4 billion to shareholders. This approach provides balance, but more importantly, forms the foundation of the strategy and earnings outlook provided by Sanjiv.  
I'll wrap up with guidance, which you can find on Slide 11. The second quarter guidance range is $2.50 to $2.55. The midpoint represents an increase of 33% over 2020 and 38% over 2019. I believe it's important to provide the 2019 comparison to properly distinguish between true growth, which this demonstrates, from mere recovery which other companies may be showing. This guidance includes an estimated year-over-year FX tailwind of 4% since Q2 of 2020 was the low point on foreign currency weakness. 
Sequentially, this range assumes stable economic conditions with a moderate improvement related to normal seasonality. In other words, the Q2 guidance range does not assume any improvement in the underlying economy from Q1. Note that preliminary April results came in better than our internal estimates. So if these conditions persist, Q2 EPS would be at the upper end or above this range. The updated full year guidance range is $9.60 to $9.80 or $0.50 higher than what we provided last quarter. The midpoint of the range is 18% above 2020 and 32% above 2019. 
I'd like to explain how we approached full year guidance especially as it relates to the half year comparisons. At this point, we have updated full year for the better performance in Q1 and the latest Q2 outlook of which this first half year combined was approximately $0.50 better. 
However, we have not updated the second half guidance. In other words, we left the second half alone until we get a better sense of the recovery pace. Rest assured, we will capture any improvement in the economy as we have recently demonstrated. Furthermore, we will provide a more detailed update next quarter. However, today, we are refraining from adjusting the back half until we get more visibility. Of course, if economic conditions hold or improve, we will be above this full year range. But for now, we believe this is the most prudent approach given the global uncertainty. I'd now like to turn the call over for Q&A."

Today, we do see that differential between green hydrogen to gray and blue hydrogen. Obviously, blue hydrogen somewhere in the middle, providing a more immediate scalable option. But green hydrogen, for it to kind of get to a point of inflection where adoption really happens, essentially, 3 things need to happen. 
The first, regulators across the world need to get to a view on what carbon tax, what carbon pricing or other mechanisms that create that incentive to go and do something about it are put in place. We can talk about what that range might look like, if you like. But that's a necessity. The second is, you've got to see the technology evolve and get down to a point where you're seeing significant reduction in costs. There are 2 costs for green hydrogen, as you're well aware, Bob. One is obviously renewable energy becoming cheaper. I know there's a lot of work happening in that space. 
And equally, we're doing a lot of work on the second option, which is about making sure that our planned CapEx comes down. So working through ITM on the PEM option as an example, but also making sure that efficiencies around that, the membranes improve sufficiently to give us a little bit of lift there as well. So all of those 3 things need to happen, Bob, for really adoption to happen, the inflection point that I referenced earlier on."

And with family in India, I'm kind of acutely aware of how challenging the situation is there. I want to take maybe just a couple of minutes, P.J., before I get to your question to just talk briefly about how proud we are over here on our team in India who are currently working round the clock to support hospitals, patients, saving lives. Everything they do, it's kind of focused on that. The teams also kind of reworked their whole operating philosophy to produce more than 3,000 tonnes per day of medical oxygen. That's almost tenfold of what we were producing and delivering just 4 weeks ago. 
So a huge amount of work has gone in there. We've deployed about 1,200 drivers on the road, serving about 1,000 hospitals in the country. There's been phenomenal work being done on that. I thought it's appropriate that I just take a moment to kind of cover that. Of course, being a global corporation, Linde globally has been able to help as well. We've air lifted 40-plus ISO containers. They are now helping the supply chains in the country and another 40 to go in the days ahead. Governments have obviously taken on many of our ideas. You've seen the Oxygen Express that's going around India. 
Also, that's something that we've helped put in place and using the armed forces, in many cases, to move oxygen across various locations in the country. So a country in deep, deeply challenging situation, but we're doing all we can as is appropriate. I also want to just maybe quickly add a quick word of appreciation for our teams in Brazil, Mexico, other Lat Am countries. Obviously, they didn't get the same kind of press. But the reality is they were faced with similar challenges and have done enormously good work to support hospitals and patients. 
So I'm really proud that our teams across the world are doing their bit to support our communities through this pandemic. Now P.J., I'm going to kind of more specifically talk to your question on inflation. And our view on inflation, as you know, we price to a weighted average on inflation typically. And as we think about inflation, our kind of natural conclusion there is that we will see prices going up as inflation happens. 
And we are -- as you know, have a great track record of being able to do that consistently. In fact, even when inflation wasn't quite there, you've seen us perform on our pricing. Our history on pricing is positive if you go back 20 years as well. And that's kind of the DNA that the team carries to move forward on the pricing piece. So fully expect to see that happening as inflation does come into play."

But I would say this, and I've said it before, just look at the segments, right? When you look at the geographic segments of Americas, EMEA and APAC, there's nothing that is fundamentally different between those 3 segments. We do the same thing. It is a very homogeneous business. 
They supply across all 3 supply modes. They have end market distributions that aren't drastically different. So that kind of defines what the opportunity set is. And if you go back to 2018, Americas was 23%, EMEA was 17%. Now EMEA is over 25% and America is 28%. So you're seeing the improvement across the board, APAC as well, almost 25%, was 17%. This is part of what we're doing to run this business, and I don't see any temporary aspect. And I would say whichever segment is leading is kind of showing the way."

And then carbon capture and sequestration picking up, particularly in geographies which have oil and gas assets and, therefore, want to understand how best to manage the energy transition through this piece. 
To your exact point on which part of the value chain we see, I think in mobility, it tends to be a little bit of a balance between what we see around production versus distribution and dispensation. We have technologies across the entire value chain. So in many ways, we are really fortunate to have the ability to kind of be able to provide that holistic solution to our potential customers. On CCS, obviously, it tends to be a lot more on the production side, which is where the blue hydrogen piece, in particular, as a consequence of CCS, comes into play.

That's been traditionally how we've seen our pricing move.

So as you well know, the spread of our price less cost inflation of productivity is a very important metric that is part of our operating rhythm that we look at, at every country at the lowest levels of detail because that spread is very important, how we manage that spread as the compound decades go. And every country is different, right? 
Every country has different inflation profiles, but the spread is something we constantly look at. So given in the first quarter here, obviously, we have the price at the top of the house at 2%. On our cost front, they were lower, as you probably saw, especially on the fixed cost just due to some efficiencies we were able to achieve. We're also achieving efficiencies in the variable cost. So the spread was probably a little wider in this first quarter. 
But nevertheless, on a go-forward basis, we always have to make sure we manage that spread, and we feel quite confident in our ability to do it. And also the things, the large commodity inputs since we pass them through, they don't create as much issues on that as you might see in other types of industries. So for us, it's really managing a lot of the fixed costs and the operating costs and the SG&A, which is part of what we do with this rhythm."

There are -- the way we think about renewable power, and you're absolutely right. We are one of the largest consumers in most countries where we operate. And therefore, we have, if you like, the collective ability to go and have those conversations with our power suppliers. 
And now what tends to happen on renewable power, if I can just take a step back, is to tell you that the grid by itself and many of these suppliers, as a consequence of conversations that we're having with them, are actually moving and the level of renewable power within the grid itself is continuing to grow. So that's good that we are seeing action from these larger players. In addition to that, obviously, we then go out specifically and sign up PPAs with renewable power kind of developers who, in some cases on a one-on-one basis, in other cases on a shared basis, we would then get into long-term contracts with, often providing them support for their broader project as well. 
And in each one of these cases, because of our incumbency, we have well-established methodology as to how we get pricing on that renewable power, whether it's in the circumstances of a grid or whether it's on specific PPAs as well. So that is a competitive advantage, you're right. And obviously, our incumbency provides that, and it's something that we focus on quite a bit as we move ahead."

There is no linkage to that at all. Most of these units are VPSA units, which are slightly lower purity, typically going into industrial processes. We do that for pulp and paper. We've seen a fair amount of growth in pulp and paper. We are seeing growth in some other segments -- ancillary segments around metals as well and glass and many others in fact. So I mean it is a widespread portfolio that supports a large number of different industries.

I'm going to give you a quick view on productivity. So you've heard me say this before, and I think Matt kind of made a very good observation earlier on, which is that we are always going to be very, very focused on managing our cost base. Our total cash fixed cost is something we kind of discuss every month at the business reviews that we carry out. So adding cost back is something we kind of manage actively.
I think it doesn't necessarily translate into productivity because for productivity, we want to see that incremental action as well, which makes it tough. But it is in the DNA of the organization, Peter, and you've heard me talk kind of passionately about the fact that every individual in our organization has got a mandate to go out and look for productivity every day. It's thousands of projects, which add small benefits but actually flow into the entire productivity part that we put together. There's one other thing which I think is now enabling that or helping us accelerate that, and that's around digitalization. 
And again, hopefully, you've heard me speak about this as well before. We're using digitalization, not as a significant tool that's going to create Earth-shattering new discoveries for us, but it's something that we apply in our business to deal with pain points every day. Our organizational model is embedded within the organization. So digital kind of expertise is being built up within every business across the world, and we are encouraging them. And in fact, I track it every quarter to ask them what percentage of productivity is coming from digital work or initiatives that we put in place.

I think starting with -- when I think about operating cash flow kind of as a percentage of our EBITDA, we were almost high 80s this quarter. Normally, to your point, Q1 is seasonally lower. So I think it's a combination of a few things. I mean first of all, obviously, with EPS growing at 32%, half of the benefit just came from earnings. So as we continue to have strong earnings growth, that should flow right through the cash flow. 
The other half of the year-over-year improvement was mostly working capital as we had nets everywhere else. And we're just seeing strong performance around the world in terms of collections, management of payables, inventory, just managing the asset and liability base quite well. Engineering had a very strong working capital performance as well as they continue to manage their projects incredibly well under different -- difficult circumstances. 
As you look forward into the second half, I think it should just be a continuation of an earnings driven with tight working capital management efforts. So If we can continue to see kind of the strong results, that should flow through to cash. I mean cash is an integral part of our compensation. It's something that we track very diligently each month, and we're seeing the benefits, I think, of that effort, and we should continue to see the benefits of that effort looking forward."

First, as we mentioned, right now, the vast majority of these projects are falling under base CapEx. And we would anticipate to continue to see growth in base CapEx primarily around either distribution, infrastructure-type assets to support and some production assets, whether it be electrolyzers or other kinds of hydrogen -- smaller hydrogen-producing assets. So from that perspective, I would model that 40% or more growth portion of the base CapEx might accelerate related to these initiatives. 
If there are any backlog projects, they would likely be announced in terms of being additions to the backlog. But I would say from a CapEx spend and benefit, we're not changing our investment criteria, it's the same. How we approach these is the same. And so I would just model it, just like Sanjiv said, it's incremental to the greater than 10% EPS growth rate that we're looking to do. And what we find and can add into this should be accretive to that over the coming years here."

So again, I think it's a good opportunity for me to just mention that our team in Texas did an outstanding job. They've managed to ensure that we shut down and started up safely, quickly. We were able to support our customers. And even in some cases, some of the players who are not our customers to just make sure that they remain safe and helping them with their start-ups as well. 
So our customers really have actually started up and are operational now, whether it's refineries, chemicals, all of them back online. And we're seeing volumes back to pre-COVID levels in some cases as well, particularly on the chemical side. Our bulk customers, again, I think we saw a quick turnaround over there post the winter freeze and again, with some support from us, our customers are back up and running. We see levels back to January already in that space as well. Refinery is probably the most specific one where you know that they have a longer lead time to startups. 
Even there, we were quite pleased to see that they were up and running in 3 or 4 weeks. And today, hydrogen volumes are about 12%. I think they're about higher than where we were earlier in the year. So again, it's been pretty good in terms of how that overall piece has been managed. I guess the point that the guys in Texas said to me, which I think holds here as well, is we're used to seeing storms, hurricanes, freezes. This is not new. This is something that we work on every year, and we've got a team that fully understands that and getting plants back online is significantly important, making sure our customers have the product available to keep them safe and ready to go. 
Now contractually, obviously, we are well protected, as you've just remarked. So that's one of the reasons we don't see a significant exposure, while we see some top line movement. But again, from March to April, we've seen that uplift come back fairly quickly as well."

Linda employees once again produced stellar results in the second quarter, achieving multiple new records, including a 24.2% operating margin, a $2.7 earnings per share and 15.7% return on capital. Volumes grew 15",702,"Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Linda employees once again produced stellar results in the second quarter, achieving multiple new records, including a 24.2% operating margin, a $2.7 earnings per share and 15.7% return on capital. Volumes grew 15%, pricing increased 3%, along with global weighted inflation, and we continue to optimize the business through many productivity initiatives. I'm really proud of how the Linde team delivered industry-leading performance despite the many challenges we constantly face, and I expect to continue this performance for many years to come. 
Last quarter, I presented to you the Linde strategy, which outlines the levers that we use to grow EPS, more than 10% per year. Given the results so far, I think it's safe to say we are well on our track. That said, I believe it's also important to have a clear path to future revenue expansion, which I'd like to discuss on the next slide. 
So on Slide 3, you'll see that when previously I had highlighted to you that Linde has a unique advantage of being able to offer its customers a sale of gas or sale of plant option. Our engineering capabilities are a clear competitive advantage, allowing us to participate in almost every type of growth opportunity while maintaining our investment criteria. Going forward, we are therefore going to present the sale of gas and sale of plant backlog combined. This quarter, our total project backlog stands at approximately $7.5 billion, representing contractual growth with high-quality customers and secured cash flows. 
Now in addition to this project backlog, in parallel, we also invest around $1 billion per year on base business growth opportunities. These are great opportunities to deliver high-quality, long-term growth, but they are either under $5 million in spend or don't contain contractual fixed fee elements for secured incremental growth. Base growth projects typically also have shorter execution time, are margin accretive and support our network density strategy. Some examples include the clean energy projects we announced earlier this year, the hydrogen liquefier in the U.S. Gulf Coast that we recently started up, and of course, more than 25 small on-site projects that we have already won this year. We serve glass, pulp and paper, mining and other growing end markets with these small on sites. 
In addition, the business continues to leverage our dense network with winning new merchant and packaged accounts, which further enhances the quality of our business. As stated, we currently have approximately $7.5 billion of contractually secured growth projects, which we'll execute over the next 3 to 4 years, plus $1 billion per year of incremental base growth CapEx. The revenue expansion from these investments exclude organic growth already being captured from our existing dense supply network across a diverse spectrum of end markets. Of course, we've well demonstrated how we leverage this through the current economic recovery that you're seeing. As I sit here today, we are currently reviewing a pipeline of hundreds of prospective projects, not included in this backlog, which easily represent more than $10 billion of potential investment opportunities, including a significant number of electronics and clean energy projects, and of course, sale of plant projects. Both sale of gas and sale of plants are great ways for us to grow while maintaining our investment discipline. 
Given our strong execution capability, I remain bullish on Linda's outlook and growth prospects. Regardless of what happens with inflation or macroeconomic trends or the pace of secular growth drivers, we have a proven business model that can generate compound value growth for our shareholders today and decades into the future. Now before I hand over to Matt, I want to make a comment on our ESG goals. I mentioned to you in last quarter's call that we are developing new ambitious ESG goals, which we expected to share in the near future. We've been diligently working with our business leaders around the world, to determine these targets and more importantly to incorporate them in our operating rhythm. Based on that progress, I expect to disclose these new ESG goals before the end of the year. 
I'll hand over now to Matt, who will take you through the financial results and guidance. Matt?"

Sales of $7.6 billion are up 19% from 2020 and 5% sequentially. Versus prior year, volumes increased 15% across all supply modes and end markets. Manufacturing, chemicals and metals drove this increase, since Q2 2020 was the low point for cyclical markets. Sequentially, volumes increased 4%, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of volume expansion, demonstrating our leverage to the economic recovery. Price increased 3% versus prior year and 1% sequentially and as all geographic segments continue to manage inflation. This is also evident in the 2% energy cost pass-through related to on-site contracts. 
Operating profit of $1.8 billion increased 39% over prior year and 9% sequentially. Operating margin of 24.2% was 350 basis points over last year despite a 50 basis point headwind from cost pass-through. This represents the eighth quarter in a row, we have increased operating margin more than 200 basis points from a combination of volume expansion, pricing actions and productivity measures. EPS of $2.70 increased 42% from 2020 and 8% from the first quarter. We've also provided the Q2 2019 growth rate of 48%. 
As mentioned last quarter, I believe it's important to distinguish true growth which this clearly demonstrates from mere recovery. ROC, which is one of the most important metrics in this industry, rose to a record 15.7%. It has increased every quarter since 2018 from steady profit growth over a prudently managed capital base. In fact, Linde has consistently proven the ability to deliver industry-leading, high-quality growth by following a disciplined capital allocation model. 
Slide 5 provides more color on that capital allocation model, including overall cash management. You can see the progression of operating cash flow on the table to the left, with the first half up 27% over last year. Note that we had $300 million of higher cash taxes this quarter when compared to Q2 last year. Since this is only timing related, I expect operating cash flow to improve year-over-year and sequentially in the third quarter. To the right, you can see how we allocated capital for the first half of this year. Stated simply, we want to grow the business, invest back into the business and reward our shareholders with increasing dividends and share repurchases. I think the pie chart below confirms this approach. 
We invested $1.5 billion into the business and returned $3.2 billion back to shareholders. I'll wrap up with guidance, which you can find on Slide 6. This slide is similar to last quarter, including how we set the guidance ranges. Third quarter guidance is $2.60 to $2.70. This represents 21% to 26% growth over prior year and 34% to 39% growth over 2019. Compared to Q2, this assumes no sequential improvement in the underlying economy and a 1% foreign currency headwind. For full year 2021, we are raising prior guidance by $0.50 to a new range of $10.10 to $10.30. This $0.50 increase is from the Q2 outperformance and the higher Q3 guidance range. In other words, and consistent with last quarter, we have not updated the fourth quarter at this time. Rest assured, next call, we'll provide an updated and more meaningful fourth quarter guidance. And if volume trends are stable or improve, we'll be at the upper end or above this range. Until that time, we remain highly confident in our ability to grow 2021 EPS, at least, 23% from last year and 38% from 2019, while positioning Lindy for industry-leading, long-term value creation. 
I'd now like to hand the call over to Q&A."

And then a second question, sorry, if I'm asking quite a few things here.

On the sale of gas side, that proposal activity, particularly coming from electronics as an example, and, of course, a suite of keen energy projects and the more traditional markets as well, including chemicals and others.

So it is, as you rightly point out, a very fast-developing dynamic space, and we start to talk more and more about clean energy more broadly. But just talking about the specifics of what you've asked. So our view is when we think about our strategy, we believe local execution and locally driven strategies are where we see the most value creation in terms of our business model and in terms of how we kind of attempt to take that strategy to execution. We are demonstrating that with South Korea in a local market where we are putting a liquefier and building a whole ecosystem around liquid fueling for heavy heavy-duty vehicles. So that's kind of broadly our strategy. 
Now I must add to that, that with all of that, obviously, we also recognize as a portfolio approach that we would be taking to this, and we do expect to see that there will be some larger installations that would feed markets, which may not be entirely local, which might have some export content to it, but we do see the distributed bubble as being certainly both more effective and creating greater value but supplemented in cases by some larger production facilities where you have some obvious competitive advantages. I mean we've talked previously about how you could get in Northern Africa, as an example, very low-cost electricity that allows you to put a large complex green hydrogen production facility. And the best way to get that hydrogen to market, as an example, would be to then take it from that large complex and pipe it across to Europe, if you could. And again, you'd have to repurpose some of the existing pipelines and make sure that cost effectively gets to Europe for it to have some traction there. 
So that's one example where we think you would see changes like that happened. In Chile, with the desert, has a similar advantage of very high-quality so our ability to take that, put into renewable power, generate green hydrogen and then move it to markets close to it. Does that give the color you were looking for, Bob?"

Whilst the backlog itself pretty solid at the $7.5 billion, the size of the backlog itself hasn't really been growing. If anything, I think it was more like $9 billion or $10 billion a couple of years ago. you talked about those hundreds of projects worth potentially $10 billion. Can you talk about the potential timing of adding those into the backlog? As existing projects come online and then therefore, drop out of the backlog, do you expect to see growth in the backlog? Or actually, it will be more stable at current levels on a sort of net-net basis? 
And then the second question, similarly around the backlog, I was curious, Sanjiv, you mentioned that you're seeing project activity or potential project activity in traditional sort of industrial areas. I was curious to understand what areas and what you're seeing that pickup in activity? Yes -- and then I've got a next to it, but I'll put back."
318049,1673494112,2356528,"Linde plc, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Nicola.

So as you said, the backlog is $7.5 billion. It gets impacted by startups that we have. So we are going to have some startups later this year. And we'll see that impact flow through. You've actually got some press releases that we had recently around some of those as well. Now in terms of timing of the projects coming into the backlog, as you know, we don't possibly control that timing. More often than not Johan controls the timing because it kind of doesn't let us announce many of these wins. But notwithstanding that, you will see in the second half, an improvement in that backlog come through because we are very close on a couple of projects, which we think will be formally closed out, which is contracts signed before we can bring them on. 
Again, Nicola, you know this, but I'll just recap it. Our conditions of putting something in the backlog are very stringent. They have to be secured by a contract, it must be more than $5 million, obviously, for the larger projects, that doesn't matter, and it needs to have a guaranteed cash flow profile, which ensures that, that backlog then has incremental guarantee incremental growth. So those conditions have to be met and we see a number of projects that will flow into the backlog later this year and then some obviously in the early part of next year as well. So I feel reasonably confident on the developments that you're going to see in that backlog, both on the sale of gas and the sale of plant side. 
Now I'll move on to the proposal activity. So I'm going to talk about one area in particular where you see a significant amount of activity, and you've heard me reference this before, Nicola, so it won't come as a surprise, which is electronics. And really, you've been hearing in the press, obviously, a lot about chip shortages. But the reality is that, that industry has been looking at ramping up its production capabilities for about 12 months now, and there are a host of projects that are all in various stages of development by TSMC, by Samsung, by Intel, by Global Foundries, there's a long list of people who are going to be investing in that space. And therefore, a large part of our time at the moment in that proposal activity is being spent around the electronics area, in particular, Nicola. 
Now in addition to that, we're also seeing some chemicals projects. We're also seeing even -- and it might surprise some, but even in the steel area, we're seeing some projects. The one other area, Nicola, which kind of is really linked to clean energy, but where we are seeing refining, chemical, even steel companies engage actively with us is around reduction in their emissions, or in the case of refining, what can we do around carbon capture and and making, reducing their emissions, how can we help them create technical solutions. I've said this before in the last call that we have a full suite of technologies around this. We have the ability working with partners to provide a holistic solution to many of our customers in that space. And again, we're seeing a lot of activity pick up on that and move forward."

Obviously, regulation with . We've seen that happen very much in Europe. I think your point is absolutely valid that we see Europe provide the kind of penalties and incentives the sticks which are allowing momentum to build in that space quite actively and aggressively. So that's good to see. We are participating in that. Whether it's funding, whether it's other incentives, whether it's the broader coalition that is looking at contract for differences to make sure that we are leveraging facilities elsewhere to support European economies. 
I've also said -- and of course, just to make the point, in the U.S., we are encouraged to see progress happen in that area as well. Now you know that the U.S. currently offers a 45Q. Our view is that, that is inadequate for any substantial momentum to build up in this space, but I'm encouraged by conversations going on in the house and hopefully in the senate that will move some of the incentives and proposals forward in that space. So I'm looking forward to seeing developments there quite closely. So I guess the other couple of things that need to happen, which I think create the momentum that we need, and I am at the risk of repeating myself from the last call, we do need to see that the technology road maps ensure that the technology for either green and blue, which is currently available and scalable creates the cost curve that is necessary for large-scale adoption to happen. 
That remains -- I won't say that the challenge that has actively been worked on -- but there is a timing challenge to that, and it will take years before we get to your point where green, in particular, has the ability to have a cost-effective solution available at scale, good solutions that are available today. We provide many of those ourselves, but I recognize that there is still a scale up that is currently lacking in the green hydrogen space. 
And finally, I think we need to be working very closely with making sure that the endpoint consumption, so in this case, if we are talking about heavy-duty vehicles, buses or trucks or indeed trains and ferries, that technology development in that space is happening actively. Hence, the number of partnerships that we do to make sure that we're right in the middle of those developments and we are encouraging and promoting them as much as possible. So I know I've provided a both broader answer than you were looking for, but I think this was worth recapping because these are the things that are ensuring that the momentum that we see today sustains and you actually see investment in development in that space."

We review all the projects. The last review we had a couple of weeks ago was -- saw 240 projects across that whole range of opportunities in that space, adding up to what we call probability-weighted CapEx value of about $4.1 billion. So again, these are -- some of these are larger projects. Obviously, we see a large number of mobility projects, which tend to be somewhat smaller. 
But to your point, one of the areas where we're seeing both the increase in the number of projects as well as large size projects is the space of carbon capture. And beyond that, we then look at hydrogen and ammonia as being 2 elements, which kind of get added on downstream to that. So the answer is, yes, we're working in a number of different customers and players who are looking at the ammonia loop. Jeff, you may also be aware that Linde has its own ammonia loop technology out of Linde engineering.

But you've been seeing double-digit growth now in that business in the first quarter, you probably accelerated on what you saw in the first quarter in the second quarter? And they're still actually down, particularly dragged back by the hard goods. So I'm just wondering, are you taking some share? Or is it all about mix maybe regional? 
And then the second question is around the investments. Obviously, you're very excited with all the organic investment you have and the potential for that.

Anecdotally, obviously, people will tell you that we're taking share, but I don't particularly want to comment on that. That is anecdotal, but you can look at the numbers, and I think the comparison will kind of tell its own -- get you to the right conclusion. So again, very, very strong performance over there on both hardgoods and gases. 
If I move on to investments and talk a little bit about the acquisition piece. So one of the challenges, Peter, as you'll appreciate, given where we stand in our size and having come -- lived through 3 years of of regulatory approvals on the merger, we are very sensitized to how large acquisitions can happen. So we are left with a much smaller pool of opportunities there. We will do tuck-in acquisitions in most of our markets any day, a good high-quality tuck-in acquisition, we will go after, and we will do that as soon as we find them. And of course, they have to live up to our investment criteria requirements as you know well. The larger ones become a little more challenging, particularly as we've got to kind of understand the requirements from local regulatory environments or antitrust, et cetera. And that's where typically something large trips up. So do I expect to see us doing acquisitions moving forward? Yes. Will you see a large number of tuck-ins happen? Most likely where we find those opportunities come through, we will certainly pursue them all day long if we could."

And that's what we call cost pass-through. So we isolate cost pass-through. And obviously, what that is, it's a simple grossing up. So you'll see the sales and cost of goods rise equal dollar amounts. So therefore, it has no effect on our variable contribution or gross contribution dollars, but it will have a negative effect on your margin because you're simply doing a gross-up effect. So we isolate that out as cost pass-through that is primarily natural gas and electricity energy. So those components tend to drive that. Obviously, as inflation you're seeing in those type commodities rises we will pass them through, but they will dilute our margins. So for example, year-over-year, I mentioned while we're up to 350 bps on our margin. That includes a 50 basis point headwind related to this cost pass-through. So excluding that, we would have been up 400 basis points year-over-year. So we are passing it through as our contracts enable, but it will be dilutive. 
As far as operating cash flow, yes, to your point, the $300 million that was incremental year-over-year, it's about $250 million sequentially with the impact of taxes and that is purely timing just when payments were made. In addition, working capital probably was about $100-or-so million unfavorable. Part of that is growth, and we are growing, so we're consuming a bit of working capital. But when I look at our cash conversion cycles, our DSOs, they're quite good across the board. Another piece is simply engineering timing. As you saw, engineering was consuming a bit of their backlog, what that is on a cash cycle, you tend to have more of a negative downside. But as Sanjiv mentioned, we have a high degree of confidence of our entire backlog, including sale of plants. So we feel that's something looking forward will turn around. And I feel pretty good about where our Q3 cash flow will be and making some of this timing back up, both on working capital as well as cash taxes."

So when we are in a backlog stage, most of our costs are already locked in pretty much. So that should give you a sense of how we stand.

So that's a good lead in there. So let me first just describe that. So essentially, when we have projects, and I think small on-site is a great example to just illustrate the point. Here, we have long-term contracts, so these are contracted. We have kind of secured cash flows in there. But individually, these are less than $5 million each typically, what we call our small on-sites. And they have shorter execution time lines. They're accretive, good solid returns. These are projects we'd love to do every day. And the reason I particularly talk about it today also is because in the first half of this year, we did more than 25 of these projects already. We've signed up more than 25 small on-site projects already. Now that's a 50% jump over last year. Same period last year, we are more -- 50% higher than that. And I love these projects because great solid returns good, strong execution. These are packaged plants so we can go in there and work on them very quickly and which is why we get that execution advantage as well. 
And I think the other point to just make over here and while I -- most points, I think we think about the merger being over, and that's true. But here is an example of revenue synergies that we talked about. We never really kind of -- we never really put a number to it, but this is a good example of how the revenue synergies from the merger are flowing through. We brought in 2 suites of technologies giving us a really strong position in that space, and we're leveraging that actively in kind of winning these deals that you see us put through. Now all of these come through that base CapEx piece. So am I excited about that number of $1 billion? I am. There isn't a cap to it, and that flexes with the business does and what the needs of the market are. And clearly, we will flex that with what we see in the market demand. All it needs is, those investments have to meet our investment criteria. That's all it needs. Good quality projects, any day, any time, happy to do, small or big. I hope that answers."

And maybe just as a follow-up, and I might be reading more into this than I should. But now that you're combining sort of the sale of gas backlog and the sale of plant backlog, it feels to me you're sort of bringing the sale of plant business a little bit more to the front of the stage than perhaps it's been in the past. And I see clearly that, that's a lower-margin business, but it's obviously a CapEx-light business versus the sale of gas. So I'm just wondering, am I correct that you're kind of thinking about the engineering business having more prominence on a go-forward basis? And do you have a plan there to sort of improve the margins and the returns? Or is there more we're going to be hearing about it in the quarters and years to come?"

Let me just take a step back, if I may, and just talk about the concept of how we think about our business and opportunities, right? So the starting point for us is, we want to be able to participate in the whole range of opportunities that we see in the marketplace. And to do that, I have a unique competitive advantage, which I am going to leverage, which is the ability to offer an attractive sale of gas model or in some cases where that customer looking at those 2 models is not particularly keen on that to be able to offer and get the business with the sale of plant model, right? So either proposal for me works quite well. 
Now the profiles are a little bit different. You're right in saying that doing an EPC-type structure, for us is asset-light. It is ROC accretive, it's cash flow positive for us. So we do think our engineering capabilities and the fact that we have those capabilities, executing day-in and day-out at a tremendous level is a really strong competitive advantage that we have, and we want to make sure that we leverage that as much as we need to. Now I do want to just make sure that you understand and recognize that we aren't giving prominence to one or the other. These are 2 -- these are kind of 2 options I have, and I use those options where I need to and where I can exercise them and do what's best for the organization. Now there are 2 kind of underpinning principles in there. One, I want to be able to approach every opportunity in my space that I have the advantage and the ability to execute on. And two, I want to maintain discipline in my investment criteria. And I think this is that unique advantage that we get bringing the 2 together."

So the partnership with Snam has gone well, and we are like-minded in our view of how the market needs for hydrogen in Europe, in particular, Mainland Europe needs to be met. And that kind of common understanding and common appreciation of what needs to happen is critical for that partnership development to move forward to getting something substantial to happen. Now as with all the things, Kevin, these things take time. And there is, as you are aware, a lot of funding activity happening in Europe as we speak. And as part of that, I think we are waiting and watching to kind of see how that develops. So that's in terms of how the partnership itself is moving forward. 
I want to just take a bit of time and talk about your other part of the question, which is what do we see as elements that will either encourage or create barriers for some of these substantial developments to accelerate and get momentum. And here -- and unfortunately, Kevin, I'll be repeating myself a little bit here, but I said earlier on that to Nicola's question, that you need a couple of things to be happening in tandem, right? One, you need to see the regulatory environment with some steep come into place in Europe, we do have that. But I must admit, at the same time, that it is complex I won't give bureaucratic, but it's almost that. It has a number of administrative controls. It goes through a country process first, then at the European Union level and then some allocations will happen. There's a whole suite of activities that need to happen before that funding and incentives become actually available for you to be able to go out and make these substantial developments happen. So there is a whole piece that is just -- it's part of the process. 
On the technology side, the other piece that I mentioned, you need a road map where you can develop on the assumptions and Europe has kind of chosen the path of green. My view is that scale will happen on blue hydrogen before it happens on green. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that, that is true today and will be true for a number of years to come. Technology for scaling up on blue exists today. Linde provides that whole suite of technologies today to be able to do that. So on the green side, which is where Europe's kind of move forward and I won't say selected, but certainly leaned to us. We will need to see that technology development to scale happen. I think that is a technology road map that's kind of 3 to 5 years out. You need low-cost renewable energy, again, that's a development that's in progress not available everywhere in Europe, as you know, which is why this whole concept of Africa becomes so attractive -- Northern Africa, in particular. And you also need effective technology road map for the electrolysis to be able to bring that capital and efficiency up to a point. So capital down efficiency up to get to a point where you can then create a cost advantageous position for green. I see those as both work in progress. We are actively involved in all of those activities as we move forward, but it is still work in progress."

318049,1673494112,2356880,"Linde plc, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Linde employees once again produced stellar results in the second quarter, achieving multiple new records, including a 24.2% operating margin, a $2.7 earnings per share and 15.7% return on capital. Volumes grew 15",702,"Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Linde employees once again produced stellar results in the second quarter, achieving multiple new records, including a 24.2% operating margin, a $2.7 earnings per share and 15.7% return on capital. Volumes grew 15%, pricing increased 3%, along with global weighted inflation, and we continue to optimize the business through many productivity initiatives. I'm really proud of how the Linde team delivered industry-leading performance despite the many challenges we constantly face, and I expect to continue this performance for many years to come.
Last quarter, I presented to you the Linde strategy, which outlines the levers that we use to grow EPS, more than 10% per year. Given the results so far, I think it's safe to say we are well on our track. That said, I believe it's also important to have a clear path to future revenue expansion, which I'd like to discuss on the next slide.
So on Slide 3, you'll see that when previously I had highlighted to you that Linde has a unique advantage of being able to offer its customers a sale of gas or a sale of plant option. Our engineering capabilities are a clear competitive advantage, allowing us to participate in almost every type of growth opportunity while maintaining our investment criteria. Going forward, we are therefore going to present the sale of gas and sale of plant backlog combined. This quarter, our total project backlog stands at approximately $7.5 billion, representing contractual growth with high-quality customers and secured cash flows.
Now in addition to this project backlog, in parallel, we also invest around $1 billion per year on base business growth opportunities. These are great opportunities to deliver high-quality, long-term growth, but they are either under $5 million in spend or don't contain contractual fixed fee elements for secured incremental growth. Base growth projects typically also have shorter execution times, are margin accretive and support our network density strategy. Some examples include the clean energy projects we announced earlier this year, the hydrogen liquefier in the U.S. Gulf Coast that we recently started up, and of course, more than 25 small on-site projects that we have already won this year. We serve glass, bulking paper, mining and other growing end markets with these small on sites.
In addition, the business continues to leverage our dense network with winning new merchant and packaged accounts, which further enhances the quality of our business. As stated, we currently have approximately $7.5 billion of contractually secured growth projects, which we'll execute over the next 3 to 4 years, plus $1 billion per year of incremental base growth CapEx. The revenue expansion from these investments exclude organic growth already being captured from our existing dense supply network across a diverse spectrum of end markets. Of course, we've well demonstrated how we leverage this through the current economic recovery that you're seeing. As I sit here today, we are currently reviewing a pipeline of hundreds of prospective projects, not included in this backlog, which easily represent more than $10 billion of potential investment opportunities, including a significant number of electronics and clean energy projects, and of course, sale of plant projects. Both sale of gas and sale of plants are great ways for us to grow while maintaining our investment discipline.  
Given our strong execution capability, I remain bullish on Linde's outlook and growth prospects. Regardless of what happens with inflation or macroeconomic trends or the pace of secular growth drivers, we have a proven business model that can generate compound value growth for our shareholders today and decades into the future. Now before I hand over to Matt, I want to make a comment on our ESG goals. I mentioned to you in last quarter's call that we are developing new ambitious ESG goals, which we expected to share in the near future. We've been diligently working with our business leaders around the world, to determine these targets and more importantly to incorporate them in our operating rhythm. Based on that progress, I expect to disclose these new ESG goals before the end of the year.
I'll hand over now to Matt, who will take you through the financial results and guidance. Matt?"

Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of the second quarter results. Sales of $7.6 billion are up 19% from 2020 and 5% sequentially. Versus prior year, volumes increased 15% across all supply modes and end markets. Manufacturing, chemical",598,"Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of the second quarter results. Sales of $7.6 billion are up 19% from 2020 and 5% sequentially. Versus prior year, volumes increased 15% across all supply modes and end markets. Manufacturing, chemicals and metals drove this increase, since Q2 2020 was the low point for cyclical markets. Sequentially, volumes increased 4%, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of volume expansion, demonstrating our leverage to the economic recovery. Price increased 3% versus prior year and 1% sequentially and as all geographic segments continue to manage inflation. This is also evident in the 2% energy cost pass-through related to on-site contracts.
Operating profit of $1.8 billion increased 39% over prior year and 9% sequentially. Operating margin of 24.2% was 350 basis points over last year despite a 50 basis point headwind from cost pass-through. This represents the eighth quarter in a row, we have increased operating margin more than 200 basis points from a combination of volume expansion, pricing actions and productivity measures. EPS of $2.70 increased 42% from 2020 and 8% from the first quarter. We've also provided the Q2 2019 growth rate of 48%.  
As mentioned last quarter, I believe it's important to distinguish true growth which this clearly demonstrates from mere recovery. ROC, which is one of the most important metrics in this industry, rose to a record 15.7%. It has increased every quarter since 2018 from steady profit growth over a prudently managed capital base. In fact, Linde has consistently proven the ability to deliver industry-leading, high-quality growth by following a disciplined capital allocation model.
Slide 5 provides more color on that capital allocation model, including overall cash management. You can see the progression of operating cash flow on the table to the left, with the first half up 27% over last year. Note that we had $300 million of higher cash taxes this quarter when compared to Q2 last year. Since this is only timing related, I expect operating cash flow to improve year-over-year and sequentially in the third quarter. To the right, you can see how we allocated capital for the first half of this year. Stated simply, we want to grow the business, invest back into the business and reward our shareholders with increasing dividends and share repurchases. I think the pie chart below confirms this approach.
We invested $1.5 billion into the business and returned $3.2 billion back to shareholders. I'll wrap up with guidance, which you can find on Slide 6. This slide is similar to last quarter, including how we set the guidance ranges. Third quarter guidance is $2.60 to $2.70. This represents 21% to 26% growth over prior year and 34% to 39% growth over 2019. Compared to Q2, this assumes no sequential improvement in the underlying economy and a 1% foreign currency headwind. For full year 2021, we are raising prior guidance by $0.50 to a new range of $10.10 to $10.30. This $0.50 increase is from the Q2 outperformance and the higher Q3 guidance range. In other words, and consistent with last quarter, we have not updated the fourth quarter at this time. Rest assured, next call, we'll provide an updated and more meaningful fourth quarter guidance. And if volume trends are stable or improve, we'll be at the upper end or above this range. Until that time, we remain highly confident in our ability to grow 2021 EPS, at least, 23% from last year and 38% from 2019, while positioning Linde for industry-leading, long-term value creation.
I'd now like to hand the call over to Q&A."

So if I look at, say, Q2 2019 and then sort of adjust for the price and cost pass-through this quarter as just reported that sort of implies volumes are up about 3%, 4% versus that Q2 in 2019, but slightly down in Asia. Firstly, I guess, is that right? Does it maybe imply some further optionality in Asia Pacific? And can we use that sort of underlying 3% to 4% volume growth versus 2019 for the next couple of quarters?
And then a second question, sorry, if I'm asking quite a few things here. CapEx in the cash flow and also as a percentage of sales looks like it's been trending down for a while, but the project backlog looks really solid. How should we think about that? Or is it just the post-pandemic timing effect of investments?"

Why don't I jump into the CapEx piece, and then I'll ask Matt to just talk through the volumes and reconcile them. Just on CapEx, I think one of the reasons for providing that pipeline view today was to give you a sense of how we see that opportunity. I've said in the past, I've seen some improvement in proposal activity across both sale of gas and sale of plants. And on the sale of gas side, that proposal activity, particularly coming from electronics as an example, and, of course, a suite of clean energy projects and the more traditional markets as well, including chemicals and others. So I do expect to see that CapEx reflecting the pipeline opportunity that we just defined. So I don't see -- I mean, the changes are marginal anyway, but notwithstanding that. I see absolutely no concerns around how I expect that pipeline to flow into backlog."

So it is, as you rightly point out, a very fast-developing dynamic space, and we start to talk more and more about clean energy more broadly. But just talking about the specifics of what you've asked. So our view is when we think about our strategy, we believe local execution and locally driven strategies are where we see the most value creation in terms of our business model and in terms of how we kind of attempt to take that strategy to execution. We are demonstrating that with South Korea in a local market where we are putting a liquefier and building a whole ecosystem around liquid fueling for heavy -- heavy-duty vehicles. So that's kind of broadly our strategy.  
Now I must add to that, that with all of that, obviously, we also recognize as a portfolio approach that we would be taking to this, and we do expect to see that there will be some larger installations that would feed markets, which may not be entirely local, which might have some export content to it, but we do see the distributed model as being certainly both more effective and creating greater value but supplemented in cases by some larger production facilities where you have some obvious competitive advantages. I mean we've talked previously about how you could get in Northern Africa, as an example, very low-cost electricity that allows you to put a large complex green hydrogen production facility. And the best way to get that hydrogen to market, as an example, would be to then take it from that large complex and pipe it across to Europe, if you could. And again, you'd have to repurpose some of the existing pipelines and make sure that cost effectively gets to Europe for it to have some traction there.
So that's one example where we think you would see changes like that happened. Chile, with the desert, has a similar advantage of very high-quality solar ability to take that, put into renewable power, generate green hydrogen and then move it to markets close to it. Does that give the color you were looking for, Bob?"

Whilst the backlog itself is pretty solid at the $7.5 billion, the size of the backlog itself hasn't really been growing. If anything, I think it was more like $9 billion or $10 billion a couple of years ago. You talked about those hundreds of projects worth potentially $10 billion. Can you talk about the potential timing of adding those into the backlog? As existing projects come online and then therefore, drop out of the backlog, do you expect to see growth in the backlog? Or actually, it will be more stable at current levels on a sort of net-net basis?
And then the second question, similarly around the backlog, I was curious, Sanjiv, you mentioned that you're seeing project activity or potential project activity in traditional sort of industrial areas. I was curious to understand what areas and what you're seeing that pickup in activity? Yes -- and then I've got a next to it, but I'll pause there."

So as you said, the backlog is $7.5 billion. It gets impacted by startups that we have. So we are going to have some startups later this year. And we'll see that impact flow through. You've actually got some press releases that we had recently around some of those as well. Now in terms of timing of the projects coming into the backlog. As you know, we don't possibly control that timing. More often than not Juan controls the timing because he kind of doesn't let us announce many of these wins. But notwithstanding that, you will see in the second half, an improvement in that backlog come through because we are very close on a couple of projects, which we think will be formally closed out, which is contracts signed before we can bring them on.
Again, Nicola, you know this, but I'll just recap it. Our conditions of putting something in the backlog are very stringent. They have to be secured by a contract, it must be more than $5 million, obviously, for the larger projects that doesn't matter, and it needs to have a guaranteed cash flow profile, which ensures that, that backlog then has incremental -- guarantee an incremental growth. So those conditions have to be met, and we see a number of projects that will flow into the backlog later this year and then some obviously in the early part of next year as well. So I feel reasonably confident on the developments that you're going to see in that backlog, both on the sale of gas and the sale of plant side.
Now I'll move on to the proposal activity. So I'm going to talk about one area in particular where you see a significant amount of activity, and you've heard me reference this before, Nicola, so it won't come as a surprise, which is electronics. And really, you've been hearing in the press, obviously, a lot about chip shortages. But the reality is that, that industry has been looking at ramping up its production capabilities for about 12 months now, and there are a host of projects that are all in various stages of development by TSMC, by Samsung, by Intel, by GLOBALFOUNDRIES, there's a long list of people who are going to be investing in that space. And therefore, a large part of our time at the moment in that proposal activity is being spent around the electronics area, in particular, Nicola.
Now in addition to that, we're also seeing some chemicals projects. We're also seeing even -- and it might surprise some, but even in the steel area, we're seeing some projects. The one other area, Nicola, which kind of is really linked to clean energy, but where we are seeing refining, chemical, even steel companies engage actively with us is around reduction in their emissions, or in the case of refining, what can we do around carbon capture and making, reducing their emissions, how can we help them create technical solutions. I've said this before in the last call that we have a full suite of technologies around this. We have the ability working with partners to provide a holistic solution to many of our customers in that space. And again, we're seeing a lot of activity pick up on that and move forward."

I thin",487,"So Nicola, you've heard me say this before that for decarbonization, more broadly, and the hydrogen economy, particularly to pick up, we need a couple, 3 things to happen. Obviously, regulation with TEEP. We've seen that happen very much in Europe. I think your point is absolutely valid that we see Europe provide the kind of penalties and incentives, the guidance sticks which are allowing momentum to build in that space quite actively and aggressively. So that's good to see. We are participating in that. Whether it's IPCEI funding, whether it's other incentives, whether it's the broader coalition that is looking at contract for differences to make sure that we are leveraging facilities elsewhere to support European economies. 
I've also said -- and of course, just to make the point, in the U.S., we are encouraged to see progress happen in that area as well. Now you know that the U.S. currently offers a 45Q. Our view is that, that is inadequate for any substantial momentum to build up in this space, but I'm encouraged by conversations going on in the house and hopefully in the senate that, that will move some of the incentives and proposals forward in that space. So I'm looking forward to seeing developments there quite closely. So I guess the other couple of things that need to happen, which I think create the momentum that we need, and I am at the risk of repeating myself from the last call, we do need to see that the technology road maps ensure that the technology for either green and blue, which is currently available and scalable creates the cost curve that is necessary for large-scale adoption to happen. 
That remains -- I won't say that's a challenge that has actively been worked on -- but there is a timing challenge to that, and it will take years before we get to your point where green, in particular, has the ability to have a cost-effective solution available at scale, good solutions that are available today. We provide many of those ourselves, but I recognize that there is still a scale up that is currently lacking in the green hydrogen space. 
And finally, I think we need to be working very closely with making sure that the endpoint consumption, so in this case, if we are talking about heavy-duty vehicles, buses or trucks or indeed trains and ferries that technology development in that space is happening actively.

Just to give you a sense of where we stand on the hydrogen piece. So as you know, I mentioned this before on a previous call that we run our Linde Hydrogen Council. We meet every month. We review all the projects. The last review we had a couple of weeks ago was -- saw 240 projects across that whole range of opportunities in that space, adding up to what we call probability-weighted CapEx or value of about $4.1 billion. So again, these are -- some of these are larger projects. Obviously, we see a large number of mobility projects, which tend to be somewhat smaller.
But to your point, one of the areas where we're seeing both the increase in the number of projects as well as large size projects is the space of carbon capture. And beyond that, we then look at hydrogen and ammonia as being 2 elements, which kind of get added on downstream to that. So the answer is, yes, we're working in a number of different customers and players who are looking at the ammonia loop. Jeff, you may also be aware that Linde has its own ammonia loop technology out of Linde Engineering. So we've done a number of these ammonia loops elsewhere including in the Middle East, in Eastern Europe and in the U.S. So we have that unique advantage of being able to tie both or all of those technologies in and provide those solutions, which makes it very attractive to many of our customers."

The first question is around -- it's actually following on from the first question you had about the market share. Particularly looking at the U.S. packaged gas business because I know there's differences in mix, I know the biggest competitor out there has a lot of hardgoods, a lot of construction. But you've been seeing double-digit growth now in that business in the first quarter, you probably accelerated on what you saw in the first quarter, in the second quarter? And they're still actually down, particularly dragged back by the hardgoods. So I'm just wondering, are you taking some share, or is it all about mix maybe regional.
And then the second question is around the investments. Obviously, you're very excited with all the organic investment you have and the potential for that. I'm just wondering on the potential acquisition line. Are you just not seeing many potential targets that fit the criteria on return given what you can do internally with your money?"

So I have to admit, Peter, I am thrilled with the U.S. packaged gas business in the way that, that team is really moving forward at the moment. With that we see double-digit growth, both on gas and hardgoods. We see strong sequential growth on both of those elements as well. So I know I've read some of our competitors talking about that space. But the reality is, we are certainly growing very strongly in that space, and I see us kind of moving forward. Anecdotally, obviously, people will tell you that we're taking share, but I don't particularly want to comment on that. That is anecdotal, but you can look at the numbers, and I think the comparison will kind of tell its own -- get you to the right conclusion. So again, very, very strong performance over there on both hardgoods and gases. 
If I move on to investments and talk a little bit about the acquisition piece. So one of the challenges, Peter, as you'll appreciate, given where we stand in our size and having come -- lived through 3 years of regulatory approvals on the merger, we are very sensitized to how large acquisitions can happen. So we are left with a much smaller pool of opportunities there. We will do tuck-in acquisitions in most of our markets any day, a good high-quality tuck-in acquisition, we will go after, and we will do that as soon as we find them. And of course, they have to live up to our investment criteria requirements as you know well. The larger ones become a little more challenging, particularly as we've got to kind of understand the requirements from local regulatory environments or antitrust, et cetera. And that's where typically something larger trips up. 
So do I expect to see us doing acquisitions moving forward? Yes. Will you see a large number of tuck-ins happen? Most likely where we find those opportunities come through, we will certainly pursue them all day long if we could."

And that's what we call cost pass-through. So we isolate cost pass-through. And obviously, what that is, it's a simple grossing up. So you'll see the sales and cost of goods rise equal dollar amounts. So therefore, it has no effect on our variable contribution or gross contribution dollars, but it will have a negative effect on your margin because you're simply doing a gross-up effect. So we isolate that out as cost pass-through that is primarily natural gas and electricity energy. So those components tend to drive that. Obviously, as inflation you're seeing in those type commodities rises, we will pass them through, but they will dilute our margins. 
So for example, year-over-year, I mentioned while we're up to 350 bps on our margin that includes a 50 basis point headwind related to this cost pass-through. So excluding that, we would have been up 400 basis points year-over-year. So we are passing it through as our contracts enable, but it will be dilutive. 
As far as operating cash flow, yes, to your point, the $300 million that was incremental year-over-year, it's about $250 million sequentially with the impact of taxes and that is purely timing just when payments were made. In addition, working capital probably was about $100-or-so million unfavorable. Part of that is growth, and we are growing, so we're consuming a bit of working capital. But when I look at our cash conversion cycles, our DSOs, they're quite good across the board. Another piece is simply engineering timing. As you saw, engineering was consuming a bit of their backlog, what that is on a cash cycle, you tend to have more of a negative downside. But as Sanjiv mentioned, we have a high degree of confidence of our entire backlog, including sale of plants. So we feel that's something looking forward will turn around. And I feel pretty good about where our Q3 cash flow will be and making some of this timing back up, both on working capital as well as cash taxes."

So that's a good lead in there. So let me first just describe that. So essentially, when we have projects, and I think small on-site is a great example to just illustrate the point. Here, we have long-term contracts, so these are contracted. We have kind of secured cash flows in there. But individually, these are less than $5 million each typically, what we call our small on-sites. And they have shorter execution time lines. They're accretive, good solid returns. These are projects we'd love to do every day. And the reason I want to particularly talk about it today also is because I think in the first half of this year, we did 20 -- more than 25 of these projects already. 
We've signed up more than 25 small on-site projects already. Now that's a 50% jump over last year. Same period last year, we are more -- 50% higher than that.

And I think the other point to just make over here and while I -- most points, I think we think about the merger being over, and that's true. But here is an example of revenue synergies that we talked about. We never really kind of -- we never really put a number to it, but this is a good example of how the revenue synergies from the merger are flowing through. We brought in 2 suites of technologies giving us a really strong position in that space, and we're leveraging that actively in kind of winning these deals that you see us put through. 
Now all of these come through that base CapEx piece. So am I excited about that number of $1 billion? I am. There isn't a cap to it, and that flexes with what the business does and what the needs of the market are. And clearly, we will flex that with what we see in the market demand. All it needs is, those investments have to meet our investment criteria. That's all it needs. Good quality projects, any day, any time, happy to do, small or big. I hope that answers."

And maybe just as a follow-up, and I might be reading more into this than I should. But now that you're combining sort of the sale of gas backlog and the sale of plant backlog, it feels to me you're sort of bringing the sale of plant business a little bit more to the front of the stage than perhaps it's been in the past. And I see clearly that, that's a lower-margin business, but it's obviously a CapEx-light business versus the sale of gas. So I'm just wondering, am I correct that you're kind of thinking about the engineering business having more prominence on a go-forward basis? And do you have a plan there to sort of improve the margins and the returns? Or is there more we're going to be hearing about it in the quarters and years to come?"

Let me just take a step back, if I may, and just talk about the concept of how we think about our business and opportunities, right? So the starting point for us is, we want to be able to participate in the whole range of opportunities that we see in the marketplace. And to do that, I have a unique competitive advantage, which I am going to leverage, which is the ability to offer an attractive sale of gas model or in some cases where that customer looking at those 2 models is not particularly keen on that to be able to offer and get the business with the sale of plant model, right? So either proposal for me works quite well. 
Now the profiles are a little bit different. You're right in saying that doing an EPC-type structure, for us is asset-light. It is ROC accretive, it's cash flow positive for us. So we do think our engineering capabilities and the fact that we have those capabilities, executing day-in and day-out at a tremendous level is a really strong competitive advantage that we have, and we want to make sure that we leverage that as much as we need to. Now I do want to just make sure that you understand and recognize that we aren't giving prominence to one or the other. These are 2 -- these are kind of 2 options I have, and I use those options where I need to and where I can exercise them and do what's best for the organization. 
Now there are 2 kind of underpinning principles in there. One, I want to be able to approach every opportunity in my space that I have the advantage and the ability to execute on. And two, I want to maintain discipline in my investment criteria. And I think this is that unique advantage that we get bringing the 2 together."

So the partnership with Snam has gone well, and we are like-minded in our view of how the market needs for hydrogen in Europe, in particular, Mainland Europe needs to be met. And that kind of common understanding and common appreciation of what needs to happen is critical for that partnership development to move forward to getting something substantial to happen. Now as with all good things, Kevin, these things take time. And there is, as you are aware, a lot of funding activity happening in Europe as we speak. And as part of that, I think we are waiting and watching to kind of see how that develops. So that's in terms of how the partnership itself is moving forward. 
I want to just take a bit of time and talk about your other part of the question, which is what do we see as elements that will either encourage or create barriers for some of these substantial developments to accelerate and get momentum. And here -- and unfortunately, Kevin, I'll be repeating myself a little bit here, but I said earlier on that -- to Nicola's question, that you need a couple of things to be happening in tandem, right? One, you need to see the regulatory environment with some TEEP come into place in Europe, we do have that. But I must admit, at the same time that it is complex. I won't say bureaucratic, but it's almost that. It has a number of administrative controls. It goes through a country process first, then at the European Union level and then some allocations will happen. There's a whole suite of activities that need to happen before some of that funding and incentives become actually available for you to be able to go out and make these substantial developments happen. So there is a whole piece that is just -- it's part of the process. 
On the technology side, the other piece that I mentioned, you need a road map where you can develop on the assumptions and Europe has kind of chosen the path of green. My view is that scale will happen on blue hydrogen before it happens on green. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that, that is true today and will be true for a number of years to come. Technology for scaling up on blue exists today. Linde provides that whole suite of technologies today to be able to do that. So on the green side, which is where Europe's kind of move forward and I won't say selected, but certainly leaned towards. We will need to see that technology development to scale happen. I think that is a technology road map that's kind of 3 to 5 years out. 
You need low-cost renewable energy, again, that's a development that's in progress not available everywhere in Europe, as you know, which is why this whole concept of Africa becomes so attractive -- Northern Africa, in particular. And you also need effective technology road map for the electrolysis to be able to bring that capital and efficiency up to a point. So capital down efficiency up to get to a point where you can then create a cost advantageous position for green. I see those as both work in progress. We are actively involved in all of those activities as we move forward, but it is still work in progress."

Linde employees delivered another solid quarter, continuing Q2's record EPS performance, despite increasingly challenging market conditions. Operating cash flow and return on capital reached record levels, and our project backlog nearly doubled, providing a strong foundation for high-quality, long-term growth. 
We also stepped up our commitment to reducing our greenhouse gases emissions footprint, and Sanjiv will share that road map with you. But frankly, this isn't something new. It's what we committed to our shareholders since the merger and had been delivering on ever since, irrespective of the macro environment. 
Most of you know this, but I think it bears repeating: our operating culture runs deep at Linde, our people take great pride in demonstrating continuous improvement across the key operating metrics in their business. The best day of the month for our management team is when we review the operating performance of each of our regional business units. 
This is what we do for fun in Danbury, among other things. While I'm sure you've seen the announcement earlier this week where I will become the Chairman of the Board, and Sanjiv will become CEO effective March 1. His appointment is the culmination of a diligent 3-year succession planning process, in which Sanjiv clearly demonstrated he was the right choice to lead this company going forward. 
I will continue to provide guidance, both from the perspective of a Director and a significant shareholder. But my primary responsibility shifts to chairing the Board of Directors, while Sanjiv takes over day-to-day management of the company. 
Supporting Sanjiv is a highly capable and experienced leadership team. I have been CEO for 15 years, and I have never felt better about how the company is positioned. Obviously, our strategy is working well and the team is executing at a high level. 
Some say we are a well-oiled machine. I wouldn't disagree. We are a company for all seasons, and I'm confident Linde's best days lie ahead. Before handing off to Sanjiv, I would like to take a moment and thank Wolfgang Reitzle for his partnership and bringing our highly successful merger to fruition, and our directors and investors for their continuing support. 
Lastly, I want to thank our employees worldwide for creating the leading industrial gases and engineering company in the world. I'll now hand the call over to Sanjiv."

I'm honored to be given the opportunity to lead this outstanding company into the future. I appreciate your confidence and support over the years. Before I jump into the slides, I wanted to build on Steve's comment of a seamless leadership transition. 
Here at Linde, we are proud of our industry-leading performance, which starts with living our core values while maintaining a disciplined execution culture. As CEO, I fully intend to build upon our foundation. 
My focus will be on areas that are aligned with the interest of our shareholders: profitable growth, optimize the business, cash generation and, of course, the truth serum for our industry, ROC. Linde will remain focused on the things that create value for Linde owners such as strong pricing and productivity culture, an active commitment to sustainability, a disciplined investment philosophy, a shareholder-friendly capital policy, and of course, pursuing high-quality and sustainable growth initiatives with emphasis on ROC. 
Ultimately, it's about being the best-performing industrial gases and engineering company in the world. Stated differently, you can expect a seamless transition with minimal change. 
Now with that said, let's move on to Slide 3 for an update on our growth initiatives. Last quarter, I mentioned some key growth drivers, including the secured project backlog, accretive base CapEx investments and the strength of our growth in low-capital intensity areas such as health care, food and beverage, engineering and our packaged gas business. 
Today, I'm happy to report that our project backlog has increased from $7.5 billion to $13.4 billion or up 81% sequentially from the last quarter. You will recall, this backlog only includes contractually secured incremental growth with fixed payments to ensure targeted returns. 
We're also beginning to see a return of the capital cycle, especially in upstream operations, such as natural gas production. That bodes well for our overall pipeline of opportunities. 
On top of that, the electronics sector continues to be very active. We recently announced a $600 million investment -- sale of gas investment indeed to supply a world-class fab in Phoenix, Arizona. This is supply only the first phase of this project, and we expect to see further opportunities as that area builds out. 
Overall, I'm pleased to see how the entire Linde team has come together and is leveraging our combined strengths to secure high-quality growth opportunities through our leading high-density industrial gas network combined with the world-class engineering capabilities. 
This backlog, combined with our supply network density, enables profitable and secured growth for years to come. Now before moving to the quarterly results, I want to update you on Linde's new and more ambitious greenhouse gas emission goals. 
A good way to stop this is to first explain the role our products play in people's lives and the overall economy. You'll find this on Slide 4. We make products that are critical for society, products such as medical oxygen for hospitals, ultra high-purity nitrogen for semiconductors, liquid nitrogen for food freezing, crypton to insulate windows and hydrogen to produce cleaner fuels, to give you just a few examples. 
In order to make these products, we expect to have a total of 39 million metric tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions this year. As you know, the production of gases require significant amounts of electricity. When such electricity is generated using hydrocarbons, we're penalized for those indirect emissions called Scope 2 emissions. 
We also have Scope 1 emissions, which are significantly lower than our Scope 2 emissions, but are significant nonetheless. Now these emissions are largely as a result of using natural gas to make hydrogen, which is used by refiners to produce cleaner fuels. 
Our gases play a critical role in the economy. In addition to saving lives, improving energy efficiency, increasing shelf life, our products also help our customers eliminate or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
In 2020, we generated a total of 37 million metric tonnes of emissions to make products that helped our customers avoid more than twice our emissions or 85 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent. In other words, without Linde's products, there would be significantly higher net carbon emissions in our world. 
At Linde, we have been doing our part to support our planet for many decades, but we know we need to do more. In 2019, we set a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of Linde 35% by 2028. We are well ahead of that goal and expect to exceed it, which is, of course, good news. 
But an intensity goal doesn't fully address the absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. So we are determined to continue on our mission of making our world more productive, enabling our customers to decarbonize and commit to reducing our own carbon footprint. 
With that in mind, I'd like to announce Linde's new medium- and long-term emission goals, which you will find on Slide 5. The first goal is to achieve a 35% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by the year 2035 or simply 35 by 35. 
To achieve this goal, we must materially reduce our Scope 1 emissions, which are driven by hydrogen production. We will do this by focusing our efforts on carbon capture and sequestration, developing blue and green hydrogen production and progressively transitioning to a zero-emission fleet. 
Our Scope 2 emissions are related to electricity consumption. Today, we consume approximately 45 terawatt hours of power, a 1/3 of which is from renewable and low-carbon sources. In order to achieve the 35 by 35 goal, we will triple, triple our renewable and low-carbon power sourcing by 2035 through new PPAs and by supporting renewable energy projects with offtake agreements and even co-investment. 
To put this goal in perspective, the amount of renewable energy we were planned to purchase is equivalent of all the power consumed annually in New York City. That's a big number. 
Of course, in addition to that, we will continue improving the energy efficiency of our plants as well. These goals are being embedded across the entire global organization, being reviewed as part of our operating rhythm and will be incorporated into our annual variable compensation. 
This is what gives me the confidence in our ability to deliver these goals, which is no different than how we would approach anything of importance in our company. Now in addition to the 35 by 35 goal, we are also committed to pursuing our goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2050. We will do our part to achieve this goal, but we also need strong policy support and regulatory support. 
Let me summarize this journey on Slide 6. We have defined a road map to reach climate neutrality. The road map is underpinned by numerous initiatives and milestones, which will be embedded into our operating system, providing us the greatest opportunity for success. 
Going forward, we will continue to share our progress, ensuring accountability and transparency for our stakeholders. 
I'll now turn it over to Matt to walk you through the numbers."
318049,1684484326,2415774,"Linde plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of the third quarter results. Sales of $7.7 billion increased 12% over last year, and 1% from the second quarter. Cost pass-through, which represents the contractual billing of energy cost variances,",741,"Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of the third quarter results. Sales of $7.7 billion increased 12% over last year, and 1% from the second quarter. Cost pass-through, which represents the contractual billing of energy cost variances, primarily in the on-site business, rose 3% over last year and 2% sequentially. 
Recall that cost pass-through has no effect on profit dollars, but will impact profit margins as we gross up or down sales and variable costs. Foreign exchange was a 2% tailwind versus prior year, but a 1% headwind sequentially, as most currencies have recently devalued against the U.S. dollar. 
Excluding these items, underlying sales grew 11% over prior year and 1% sequentially. The 8% volume increase over last year was broad-based across all geographies and end markets, as we continue to see recovery from the pandemic. 
Sequentially, volumes are flat as contribution from project start-ups were mostly offset by lower volumes in China. Pricing levels are up 3% from last year and 1% from the second quarter, as we continue to adjust merchant and packaged gas product pricing in line with local inflation. 
Note that some of these contracts have lagging recovery mechanisms, which may not take effect for 2 to 6 months, depending upon the terms and conditions. 
Operating margin of 23.6% is 150 basis points above 2020, but 60 basis points below the high mark set in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of cost pass-through, operating margin would have increased 220 basis points above last year and had a negligible decline sequentially. 
As mentioned, merchant and package cost recovery can lag 1 to 2 quarters. So going forward, I expect continued pricing momentum. 
EPS of $2.73 is up 27% over last year from higher volumes and price over a relatively stable cost base. As both Steve and Sanjiv mentioned, Linde has a strong productivity culture, which enables consistent profit growth, irrespective of the economic climate. 
This is also evident in the 16.7% return on capital, which represents another record as profit continues to grow double-digit percent over a flat capital base. The reason we've been able to maintain such a steady capital base is due to a combination of disciplined capital management and healthy cash generation, which I'll cover on Slide 8. 
You can see to the left, our operating cash progression resulting in a record level of $2.6 billion in the third quarter. The 3 main drivers are stronger earnings, timing benefits from last quarter and engineering contract prepayments. In light of the record sale of plant backlog, I anticipate further project repayments into the next few quarters. 
As far as how we allocated year-to-date cash, the pie chart to the right shows $2.3 billion invested into the business and $4.8 billion distributed back to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. 
Note that investments exclude sale of plan, since we are paid in advance for engineering projects, which means that we are committing much larger amounts toward contractually secured growth than what's shown on this chart. In addition to generating significant surplus cash we have access to very attractive capital through the debt markets. 
In September, we issued almost EUR 2 billion at 5-, 12- and 30-year maturities, with all-in coupons of 0%, 0.38% and 1%, respectively. Overall, the combination of excess cash generation and low-cost incremental debt gives us a high degree of confidence to maintain shareholder-friendly allocation policies over the long term. 
I'll wrap things up with guidance on Slide 9. The fourth quarter EPS guidance range of $2.60 to $2.70 is 13% to 17% above last year and 38% to 43% above 2019. Consistent with prior quarters, we believe it's important to distinguish true multiyear growth from mere recovery of 2020 recessionary conditions. 
Versus the third quarter, this range represents a sequential decrease due to normal seasonal declines plus an estimated 1% foreign currency headwind. Underlying volumes are assumed to be roughly in line with the third quarter, but if current conditions hold, I'd expect to be at the upper end of this range. 
This quarterly update results in a new full year guidance of $10.52 to $10.62, which represents a growth rate of 28% to 29% over 2020 and 43% to 45% over 2019. 
In summary, another solid quarter despite some challenging conditions. And regardless of the macro, we remain confident in Linde's ability to continue delivering industry-leading performance.

I agree with you that there's been significant and continuing momentum in the space. And I'm very pleased to suggest that we are seeing a reflection of that in the activities that we are actively pursuing. I'll start off by just describing what the opportunity pipeline looks like because that's reflective of the level of activity that Linde is seeing and then talk a little bit about the particular areas where we see some of that momentum reflected now. 
So starting over the projects that we're looking at. As you know, we run this monthly call on the Hydrogen Council that Linde runs internally. We've got about 260 projects in our pipeline. We've got a probability weighted sort of conservatively probability weighted number in terms of investment decisions of up to $4-plus billion now. And these are decisions we expect to see happen in the next 3 years or so. 
In the past, you've heard me say that we expect to see us investing about $1 billion a year roughly in this space. And then on top of that, there may be some mega projects that come along as well. So that's just to give you a sense of the level of activity that there is happening around that space. 
Now remember, and I've said this before, Bob, so you'll kind of recall Linde has a unique position in what is happening in the evolving space around clean energy. We've kind of described to you previously, under decarbonization, we look at carbon solutions and we look at hydrogen. In the hydrogen space, we obviously are very mindful and interested in the developments around blue hydrogen. 
We see that as a very important transition in this clean energy road map that lies ahead. And this is where we are seeing significant pickup in terms of activity. We are currently involved in a number of projects, which have a range of investments and those are progressing well. And again, for projects in this space to make sense, you need 3 things to be happening. 
You need the technology provider, in this case, that is us, for carbon capture. You need partnerships to ensure that you're then looking at sequestration effectively with partners who have long-standing experience and knowledge of that space. We're currently actively pursuing those as well. 
And of course, third, very importantly, you need an offtaker. You need a partner who is willing to stay in the game and actually offtake the blue hydrogen that comes off that and is able to create some value as a result of that. 
For us, those 3 things are very important. And again, I'm pleased to say that we're seeing those partnerships actually take -- gather a lot of momentum as we move forward. I'll kind of stop there for a moment and give you -- see if that answered your question."

Most of them don't even understand that we have a colorless molecule that obviously is now defined by very, very many colors. But putting that aside in terms of experience and expertise. The reality is there will be a number of players who will make a difference in this space. And as part of that, you will see a range of outcomes. 
You will see us competing where we need to, and you will see us partnering with a number of those as well. This is an area that requires strong partnerships for that initial momentum and the ecosystem development to really happen. And I see that development happened where we are kind of speaking to a range of partners across different areas helping move this along. 
So I don't particularly kind of see this as a space that you're going to see the intensity of competition being any different to what we see otherwise."

And I think from an investor standpoint, maybe even more from the way the transition was handled, almost picture perfect. So thank you, guys, all for that. I guess my question is around Lincare and maybe the medical business in general. 
If you go back before COVID started and just kind of analyze how that business has developed with COVID as kind of a driver, how do you see that business structurally different today? And how much has it grown through that period relative to the rest of the business?"

So we think of our health care business in",549,"Duffy, thanks. Let me get into it. And I'll start off by just taking a step back and outlining the health care space that we operate in and also reminding everyone that we have strong leadership in that space. 
So we think of our health care business in 2 different areas. We look at hospital care, where we are the primary provider of medical gases to hospitals, and of course, a home care business, where as you referenced, Lincare is a very, very important player in the U.S., but we obviously have smaller home care businesses elsewhere in the world as well. 
So thinking structurally about that business, let me just kind of say to you, there are 2 things happening as we speak. Obviously, you've heard us talk about how we've -- how that business is supported and saved lives and supported hospitals and patients at home over the last 18-plus months now. 
So clearly, it's played a very important role. Lincare, in particular, in the U.S. was almost seen as a second line of defense supporting COVID patients at home through the respiratory offerings that we have. What has happened as a consequence of the pandemic is that a number of regulators and governments have, in the best way to describe it is, woken up to the realities of how they need to manage this more professionally in terms of storage, in terms of piping, in terms of infrastructure necessary for these high levels of medical gases and oxygen, in particular, to be delivered to their infrastructure and network. 
We have been participating in many of those conversations. In fact, most governments have reached out to us seeking support and help in structuring those conversations, and we are obviously leading many of those conversations across the world today where we are helping governments and regulators make sure that they have a well thought through infrastructure program and a development process around how they will manage this going forward. 
A kind of pandemic preparedness a little bit late in the day, but nonetheless important to make sure for the future. The reason I mentioned this is because this means as we move forward, we're going to see continuing activity in this space, we will be participating in those activities and expecting a level of growth out of that. 
We've said this before, Duffy, you've heard us describe mid-single-digit growth for our health care business overall, and I still maintain that we will see that. Obviously, in the Link are world, in particular, tuck-in acquisition is something that we are very interested and excited about. 
So we'll continue to see those come through, adding on to that mid-single digit or contributing to that mid-single digit that I referenced earlier on as well. So I do see this a solid secular growth trend. I see it progressing with a strong mid-single-digit growth that I described earlier on, and I see us seeing kind of areas in the world where we will see that probably grow it -- not probably, will grow at a higher pace, Asia being 1 such example. 
Again, because of the strength of our footprint there, we have the ability to make sure that we leverage that footprint for that incremental growth in Asia as an example."

So that's a pretty strong contributor right there for you.

I was wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing on the ground there in terms of sort of direct and indirect impacts from the energy control measures, I guess, both in terms of today -- the impact today and in terms of -- with respect to future investment opportunities? 
And then the second question was on engineering, and congrats on this very big project. I think you used to talk about kind of mid -- or low to mid-teens through the cycle kind of margin. But we've been tracking above that for some time now. 
And so I was wondering whether there's any reason to assume that this new business would be at a different margin to what we've been seeing in the recent past?"

So starting with China, yes, to your point, we did see some volume curtailments as you would expect, with the power outages. We do feel very confident about our customer base. They're still paying the MTOP. These are Tier 1 customers. This is something you've seen, as you probably know, in prior times in China when there are some centrally managed slowdown. 
So from that perspective, yes, there were reductions on a sequential basis. Now if you look at the APAC segment, you actually see volumes are up 2% sequentially, and the primary driver there is because our backlog pretty much offset any of that China sequential decline. 
And then the rest of our APAC business still performed quite well on growth, including some seasonal growth that we tend to see in the South Pacific. So from that perspective, yes, we had some of that. We anticipate a little bit of that to continue here into the fourth quarter. 
So when we talked about volumes assumed to be flat sequentially into our guidance range, it does take into account some continuing just volume softness based on this. But overall, we feel very good about our asset base. We see this as temporary. And to some extent, we tend to come out stronger on these things with our customer base. So we'll see how that plays out. 
On the engineering, you're exactly right, I mean, we have been operating kind of mid-teens or a little better. And as you can imagine, as you know, this business has pretty much a negative working capital. So what you see on the margins can be a pretty good indication of the type of returns you get or can even be a little better just based on the cash profile. 
So very good business that we have. We're very excited to have this backlog. It will contribute to growth. We tend to focus more on the E&P side as well, which helps with the risk management. So from this perspective, we still see margins kind of in this, I'll call it, low- to mid-teens, and we'll see how it plays out though over the cycle. You will always have timing in how you recognize the percent completion. 
So quarter-to-quarter, it's always tough to gauge on any particular one. But over the multiyear process, we still think that kind of low double-digit to mid-teens is still a reasonable estimate through this business as it kind of goes through the cycles."

So from that perspective, we tend not to really have much risk to the production volumes given that it's not really anything I would be overly concerned with. 
In fact, if anything, what we've seen, especially on our more industrial customers, they tend to run in harder. You could think steel, you could think refining, given the environment they're in and the margins that they're making on some of these products. 
As far as the merchant and package -- realizing package, it's a high rent business, so the volatility of the customers' demand will really only affect the gas molecules. And what we're seeing, especially in Americas and parts of Europe still seeing pretty strong growth across that package business. So I think that's been quite good. 
But on the merchant side, no, we really haven't seen any significant negative changes. It's been up pretty much across the board. And you could imagine the customers want to produce, right? They want to make as much product as they can in this environment, given their opportunity to get some pricing. 
So from that perspective, we haven't seen any material effect on that. There may be some small pockets, but nothing that's coming up to the aggregate level."

Now I don't really -- as I mentioned earlier on, we're going into the planning cycle on 2022. I have to say one of the variables as we think about this is, how does inflation play out and how do energy costs play out in the year ahead? I don't really want to be forecasting that, to be honest. 
But what I do want to give you is some assurance on the pricing, which then clearly then flows into the margin piece and addresses your question, which is you can expect us to always be keeping pace with inflation, global inflation, and that really is a reflection of how we will do that management around the pass-through elements, in particular, and pricing beyond that. 
And that's what will then come back through the leverage we have down to the operating margin that you'll see.

I think as we go forward, I don't like to ever hear the word peak margins because I don't never believe in peak margins. And when we say our best days are ahead, you got to keep in mind that we are going through a period where there's been a tremendous amount of cost that came through the system, mostly in the form of power. If you were to look at EMEA, for example, costs increased 25% to 30% between Q2 and Q3. 
So that's a lot of cost that comes at you at once. We instantly pass that through, as Matt mentioned, on the on-site piece, but it takes a few months up to 6 months to be able to recover all of that through the merchant and the packaged business. 
But if you think going forward over time, and you've heard us describe this model before, we take the top line, and we're able to leverage that through pricing and productivity to deliver increased EBIT margins over the long term. And we've been able to do that for many years, and that's really going to be the model that we will be in going forward, especially as we clear this immediate wave of cost inflation that's coming through the system, and we deal with that in a very positive way in the coming quarters."

With respect to the 50-50 comment, if you think about -- when we book projects, they typically are in the hundreds of millions of dollar range. So if you look at the TSMC project, that $600 million of capital investment that would be tied for our largest with Samsung. So when we see gas, it tends to be -- that's a very big project. 
And clearly, we landed some very large projects, third-party projects with Linde Engineering, and that obviously shifted the weighting in terms of whatever that is, 75%, 80% of the total backlog is -- third-party sales is driven by these very large projects. 
Matt alluded to this. These very large projects have very strong contractual terms. They're very high-quality contracts, I will say. We have cash flows that -- incoming cash flows that certainly are well ahead of our cost outlays as we work through these projects. So they're excellent projects, and we're delighted to have them."

So David, this is Matt. That's not a number we're going to provide publicly. But I think if you look at kind of the sequential margin profile and you adjust for the stated cost pass-through, that obviously associates itself with the on-site business. Some of those differentials could -- of the remaining amount are things that we would want to be going chasing related to some timing related. 
And as you can imagine, EMEA has a much larger package and merchant percent than on-site. So that will also play into having a larger proportion of cost that need to be captured on a delay. And 1 thing I just want to be clear on is, this lag is normal. This lag is inherent in the industry. 
We have faced this lag since our inception going back decades. It just so happens in this particular quarter, the movement of the energy prices, the movement of some of these numbers are faster in a shorter time period. So given that, you're going to have some recovery, that will be next quarter and the quarter after. 
But EMEA would be probably disproportionately larger than most other regions with that lag, just given the packaged and merchant exposure."

And then lastly, so if you're getting, I don't know, $480 million into your cash flow statement from prepayments, but I take it that, that then will -- you'll fund that with capital expenditures later on. So in a certain sense, your cash flow from operations is overstated. Can you talk about those issues?"

So just to make sure we level-set and get the accounting correct. This is sale of plant, so this never touches CapEx. This is under percent completion accounting. So what happens is the backlog that we have actually translates essentially 1:1 to sales, $1 backlog equals $1 sales. 
And as we construct it, it goes to inventory and then when we meet the criteria, it's released out of inventory to sales. So therefore, it never actually hits CapEx, given the nature of how the structure works. And then as the prepayments come in, they sit on the balance sheet as a liability. 
And then obviously, we work and deliver the performed work, which then goes against that liability to relieve that liability as we deliver. So this is a classic percent completion accounting style. So given that -- and maybe let's talk about the cash flow real quick. In this business, in this industry of engineering and percent completion, when you're in a declining backlog, what tends to happen is your cash outflows are obviously higher than your inflows because you are delivering on the work, the engineering, the procurement and you basically think of like a book-to-bill ratio, right? 
So as your book-to-bill ratio starts to drop and drop and drop, you're going to have more cash outflow than inflow. Now that trend is reversed. So we've actually had more outflow than inflow over the last few quarters because we were building off a backlog that was shrinking. 
Now it has grown dramatically, that process is reversing. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have a few quarters. We expect some prepayments given the size and increase of this. And then we'll work them down over the next several years as the outflows go, but you still have more backlog that if you win, it can mitigate that. 
So that's how to think about this. It's not in CapEx. That's why I said in the prepared remarks, the growth that we have is much greater than what's being shown in CapEx because of this delivery. And as Sanjiv had mentioned, we're going to be probably mid-single digit in terms of our contribution. So hopefully, that makes sense, but I can hand it off to Sanjiv to talk about the project."

So Jeff, let me just kind of talk through the project a little bit and give you a little bit of color on that. So we have the $6 billion incremental 2 large wins that we're talking about are the reason why you're seeing this significant buildup in our backlog. 
We are very happy with these projects, I have to tell you. They are with a very high-quality customer. I am going to name the customer now just for you, which is Gazprom. It's a customer with whom we have excellent relationships. We have got great experience thus far. We have got solid contract terms, which makes us pretty comfortable around taking on these large projects. 
Also, as Matt kind of referenced, strong cash flows. I want to remind you also that these cash flows tend to come in, the inflows are ahead of any commitments we make. So we tend to be net positive as far as our cash curves are concerned. And of course, it's in an area where we've got good experience of execution. So again, you put all of that together, that's kind of the projects. 
Now what are we building? Let me just give you a little bit of color on that. So we are building some GPPs. So these are gas processing plants for Gazprom at the site called Ust-Luga. And we're also building a separate project also at that same site, which is a separate win, but an important one also is an LNG plant for them. 
I expect natural gas developments will continue given the energy kind of challenges that the world is seeing. And this is kind of a major milestone as Gazprom have continued down the path of investing in that space."

So I think when you think about the sustainability targets that we've put out there, 35 by 35, there as -- you have to think about the framework within which this is happening. So clearly, there are activities that we can undertake and we are undertaking today, which will continue to move in that direction. 
These are efficiency programs. This is about fleet replacement, et cetera. So there are a number of initiatives that are ongoing and will continue to -- we'll continue to work towards, which will execute towards that. But it's also correct to say that even today, there are government initiatives of the government incentives available. So we're not suggesting that there is a complete void over here and then we need a complete kind of remake of that. 
In the U.S., we have the 45Q that is being effectively utilized to look at investment profiles like this. Now I have to be honest and tell you that much rather that 45Q, which currently provides $45 to $50 per tonne of CO2, be anywhere between $90 to $110 per CO2. That's where I would see the inflection point with momentum for development of these projects would significantly ramp up because there'd be an economic case for it. 
In Europe, clearly, there's the ETS, the trading scheme that is currently valuing CO2 anywhere between EUR 60 to EUR 65 per tonne. So again, as we see that move forward, where there is a plan similarly in Canada and South Korea and Australia, I could name a number of countries where these incentives or penalties are coming into play today. 
So we're working in that environment. We think that more support is necessary. But there isn't a complete lack of support. So a number of our projects will be relying on the support infrastructure that's available through the incentives and penalties to leverage all that to continue down that decarbonization trend. And of course, as we look longer term to carbon neutrality in our assumption when we think about our road map, clearly, we've got some levels of support available. 
They range anywhere between $100 to $200 per tonne of CO2 in equivalent terms, longer term to make sure that we get to that level of the neutrality that we're talking about -- climate neutrality that we're talking about as being the goal that we achieved by then."

It's $50, the low carbon fuel standard in California provide some support, too. 
But as we look forward to really make meaningful strides of decarbonization, you're going to need a stronger carbon price. That's our view."

So I've said before that when people think about what hydrogen is most appropriate, one of the things you have to think about is the strength individual countries have, the assets that they have, where countries today have -- hydrocarbon assets have natural gas as an asset. 
We firmly believe that they will pursue the path of blue hydrogen because that is the most meaningful way to kind of move forward on this transition. The reason it's meaningful is because it's to scale. It can be done today, and we're not waiting for technology developments to happen. 
And I'll talk about ITM in a minute, but you'll hear me reflect that comment over there as well. So the answer is where we see that natural gas resource available in the U.S. and Canada, Australia, Russia, Middle East, we believe -- we know that those countries are actively pursuing, and we are looking at a number of counterparties over there as partners looking at some of those developments ourselves. 
So -- and the Slide 18 gives you a sense that Linde Engineering's technology portfolio allows us to be able to flex any technical solution. We are uniquely positioned to provide that technical solution for blue hydrogen output, whether it's using an SMR, whether it's using an ATR or whether it's using gasifier. We have the ability and technology to provide the technology packages, execute them and operate them ourselves because of the expertise we have. 
So that's as far as blue hydrogen is concerned, and I do see a lot of momentum building up in that space, and we are very active in that space as well. 
Let's talk about ITM and order kind of intake and backlog going forward. Now you're asking me to project 5 years out. I have to tell you, the only thing I'm going to project 5 years out is to tell you that the technology road map that we have going with ITM through our joint venture with them is to make sure that, that product scales up and that product then has the capital efficiency and operating efficiency in scale up to be able to then execute projects of a reasonable size. 
I'm going to give you a very quick example of that. So today, as we are building as you know, you've heard us announce this before. We're building a 24-megawatt electrolyzer complex there. Those 24 megawatts will come from 2-megawatt modules. That's the largest PEM electrolyzer module available in the world today. 
We're working with ITM to scale that up. We are hoping to scale that up based on our technology road map in literally months to 5 megawatts and then beyond that to 20 megawatts, et cetera. 
At that point in time, a 100-megawatt module, again, projects that we are actively working on today that are getting some preferential positioning as far as some European funding is concerned as well. Those will then move from 50 units of 2 megawatts, which you can imagine on the most efficient structure, to maybe 5 units or 20 units of 5 megawatts or 5 units of 20 megawatts as scale-up happens along the way. 
So the fact that, that scale up is happening, the fact that the technology road map is providing that capital efficiency and economies of scale is happening right now and preparing us for what's likely to happen in the next 5 years, I don't want to speculate at this stage as to what that likely backlog might look like 5 years down the road, but clearly, I'm encouraged by the developments I see."

So I'm looking with some eagerness to that coming through and getting an understanding of how that -- how those rules come into play. But that would be encouraging. Clearly, we believe that there is an opportunity here for us to move forward. 
Steve mentioned to you in the past that if we get hydrogen, blue or green, green, obviously more challenged in this reference, at about between $1 to $2 per kg, it's at that point that you see an inflection point and you see widespread adoption of technologies utilizing hydrogen and really hydrogen becoming a reasonable fuel in the portfolio fuels we'll have, we'll always have fossil fuel, at least for many decades ahead.

So yes, just to build on that, I mean, if you were to look at the cost of hydrogen today and you were to use the U.S. Gulf Coast, which obviously, we produce a lot of hydrogen, we use a lot of hydrogen in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Gray hydrogen is about $1.30 a kilogram, and that's at $5.50 natural gas. Carbon capture would add another $0.40, $0.50, maybe you're in the $1.7 range sort. And if you think about green, it's like about $4.5 a kilogram. 
And out of that, probably $2.50, you call it, is the renewable power cost. And so if renewable power was free, then you would still have $2. And we all know renewable power isn't free. So we have some work to do to bring those costs down in terms of capital costs, operating costs. And as you were to work that down below that $2 number, then you've got a chance to have something competitive. 
So you need the combination of low-cost renewable, low-cost capital, lower cost operate low-cost capital and better efficiencies and then you can drive that number lower. And I would say ideally below $2, but certainly in that range would be is what's needed."

Linde employees delivered another solid quarter, continuing Q2's record EPS performance, despite increasingly challenging market conditions. Operating cash flow and return on capital reached record levels, and our project backlog nearly doubled, providing a strong foundation for high-quality, long-term growth.  
We also stepped up our commitment to reducing our greenhouse gases emissions footprint, and Sanjiv will share that road map with you. But frankly, this isn't something new. It's what we committed to our shareholders since the merger and had been delivering on ever since, irrespective of the macro environment.  Most of you know this, but I think it bears repeating: our operating culture runs deep at Linde, our people take great pride in demonstrating continuous improvement across the key operating metrics in their business. The best day of the month for our management team is when we review the operating performance of each of our regional business units.  
This is what we do for fun in Danbury, among other things. While I'm sure you've seen the announcement earlier this week where I will become the Chairman of the Board, and Sanjiv will become CEO effective March 1. His appointment is the culmination of a diligent 3-year succession planning process, in which Sanjiv clearly demonstrated he was the right choice to lead this company going forward.  I will continue to provide guidance, both from the perspective of a Director and a significant shareholder. But my primary responsibility shifts to chairing the Board of Directors, while Sanjiv takes over day-to-day management of the company.  
Supporting Sanjiv is a highly capable and experienced leadership team. I have been CEO for 15 years, and I have never felt better about how the company is positioned. Obviously, our strategy is working well and the team is executing at a high level.  Some say we are a well-oiled machine. I wouldn't disagree. We are a company for all seasons, and I'm confident Linde's best days lie ahead. Before handing off to Sanjiv, I would like to take a moment and thank Wolfgang Reitzle for his partnership and bringing our highly successful merger to fruition, and our directors and investors for their continuing support.  
Lastly, I want to thank our employees worldwide for creating the leading industrial gases and engineering company in the world. I'll now hand the call over to Sanjiv."

I'm honored to be given the opportunity to lead this outstanding company into the future. I appreciate your confidence and support over the years. Before I jump into the slides, I wanted to build on Steve's comment of a seamless leadership transition.  Here at Linde, we are proud of our industry-leading performance, which starts with living our core values while maintaining a disciplined execution culture. 
As CEO, I fully intend to build upon our foundation.  My focus will be on areas that are aligned with the interest of our shareholders: profitable growth, optimize the business, cash generation and, of course, the truth serum for our industry, ROC. Linde will remain focused on the things that create value for Linde owners such as strong pricing and productivity culture, an active commitment to sustainability, a disciplined investment philosophy, a shareholder-friendly capital policy, and of course, pursuing high-quality and sustainable growth initiatives with emphasis on ROC.  Ultimately, it's about being the best-performing industrial gases and engineering company in the world. Stated differently, you can expect a seamless transition with minimal change.  
Now with that said, let's move on to Slide 3 for an update on our growth initiatives. Last quarter, I mentioned some key growth drivers, including the secured project backlog, accretive base CapEx investments and the strength of our growth in low-capital intensity areas such as health care, food and beverage, engineering and our packaged gas business.  
Today, I'm happy to report that our project backlog has increased from $7.5 billion to $13.4 billion or up 81% sequentially from the last quarter. You will recall, this backlog only includes contractually secured incremental growth with fixed payments to ensure targeted returns.  We're also beginning to see a return of the capital cycle, especially in upstream operations, such as natural gas production that bodes well for our overall pipeline of opportunities.  
On top of that, the electronics sector continues to be very active. We recently announced a $600 million investment -- sale of gas investment indeed to supply a world-class fab in Phoenix, Arizona. This will supply only the first phase of this project, and we expect to see further opportunities as that area builds out.  Overall, I'm pleased to see how the entire Linde team has come together and is leveraging our combined strengths to secure high-quality growth opportunities through our leading high-density industrial gas network combined with the world-class engineering capabilities.  This backlog, combined with our supply network density, enables profitable and secured growth for years to come. 
Now before moving to the quarterly results, I want to update you on Linde's new and more ambitious greenhouse gas emission goals.  A good way to stop this is to first explain the role our products play in people's lives and the overall economy. You'll find this on Slide 4. We make products that are critical for society, products such as medical oxygen for hospitals, ultra high-purity nitrogen for semiconductors, liquid nitrogen for food freezing, krypton to insulate windows and hydrogen to produce cleaner fuels to give you just a few examples.  
In order to make these products, we expect to have a total of 39 million metric tons of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions this year. As you know, the production of gases require significant amounts of electricity. When such electricity is generated using hydrocarbons, we're penalized for those indirect emissions called Scope 2 emissions.  We also have Scope 1 emissions, which are significantly lower than our Scope 2 emissions, but are significant nonetheless. Now these emissions are largely as a result of using natural gas to make hydrogen, which is used by refiners to produce cleaner fuels.  
Our gases play a critical role in the economy. In addition to saving lives, improving energy efficiency, increasing shelf life, our products also help our customers eliminate or reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In 2020, we generated a total of 37 million metric tons of emissions to make products that helped our customers avoid more than twice our emissions or 85 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. In other words, without Linde's products, there would be significantly higher net carbon emissions in our world.  
At Linde, we have been doing our part to support our planet for many decades, but we know we need to do more. In 2019, we set a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of Linde 35% by 2028. We are well ahead of that goal and expect to exceed it, which is, of course, good news.  But an intensity goal doesn't fully address the absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. So we are determined to continue on our mission of making our world more productive, enabling our customers to decarbonize and commit to reducing our own carbon footprint.  
With that in mind, I'd like to announce Linde's new medium- and long-term emission goals, which you will find on Slide 5. The first goal is to achieve a 35% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by the year 2035 or simply 35 by 35.  To achieve this goal, we must materially reduce our Scope 1 emissions, which are driven by hydrogen production. We will do this by focusing our efforts on carbon capture and sequestration, developing blue and green hydrogen production and progressively transitioning to a zero-emission fleet.  
Our Scope 2 emissions are related to electricity consumption. Today, we consume approximately 45 terawatt hours of power, a 1/3 of which is from renewable and low-carbon sources. In order to achieve the 35 by 35 goal, we will triple, triple our renewable and low-carbon power sourcing by 2035 through new PPAs and by supporting renewable energy projects with offtake agreements and even co-investment.  To put this goal in perspective, the amount of renewable energy we were planned to purchase is equivalent of all the power consumed annually in New York City. That's a big number.  
Of course, in addition to that, we will continue improving the energy efficiency of our plants as well. These goals are being embedded across the entire global organization, being reviewed as part of our operating rhythm and will be incorporated into our annual variable compensation.  This is what gives me the confidence in our ability to deliver these goals, which is no different than how we would approach anything of importance in our company. Now in addition to the 35 by 35 goal, we are also committed to pursuing our goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2050. We will do our part to achieve this goal, but we also need strong policy support and regulatory support.  
Let me summarize this journey on Slide 6. We have defined a road map to reach climate neutrality. The road map is underpinned by numerous initiatives and milestones, which will be embedded into our operating system, providing us the greatest opportunity for success.  Going forward, we will continue to share our progress, ensuring accountability and transparency for our stakeholders.  
I'll now turn it over to Matt to walk you through the numbers."
318049,1684484326,2415959,"Linde plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Linde plc","Executives","Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of the third quarter results. Sales of $7.7 billion increased 12% over last year, and 1% from the second quarter. Cost pass-through, which represents the contractual billing of energy cost variances,",741,"Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of the third quarter results. Sales of $7.7 billion increased 12% over last year, and 1% from the second quarter. Cost pass-through, which represents the contractual billing of energy cost variances, primarily in the on-site business, rose 3% over last year and 2% sequentially.  Recall that cost pass-through has no effect on profit dollars, but will impact profit margins as we gross up or down sales and variable costs. Foreign exchange was a 2% tailwind versus prior year, but a 1% headwind sequentially, as most currencies have recently devalued against the U.S. dollar.  
Excluding these items, underlying sales grew 11% over prior year and 1% sequentially. The 8% volume increase over last year was broad-based across all geographies and end markets, as we continue to see recovery from the pandemic.  Sequentially, volumes are flat as contribution from project start-ups were mostly offset by lower volumes in China. Pricing levels are up 3% from last year and 1% from the second quarter, as we continue to adjust merchant and packaged gas product pricing in line with local inflation.  
Note that some of these contracts have lagging recovery mechanisms, which may not take effect for 2 to 6 months, depending upon the terms and conditions.  Operating margin of 23.6% is 150 basis points above 2020, but 60 basis points below the high mark set in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of cost pass-through, operating margin would have increased 220 basis points above last year and had a negligible decline sequentially.  As mentioned, merchant and package cost recovery can lag 1 to 2 quarters. So going forward, I expect continued pricing momentum. 
EPS of $2.73 is up 27% over last year from higher volumes and price over a relatively stable cost base. As both Steve and Sanjiv mentioned, Linde has a strong productivity culture, which enables consistent profit growth, irrespective of the economic climate.  This is also evident in the 16.7% return on capital, which represents another record as profit continues to grow double-digit percent over a flat capital base. 
The reason we've been able to maintain such a steady capital base is due to a combination of disciplined capital management and healthy cash generation, which I'll cover on Slide 8.  You can see to the left, our operating cash progression resulting in a record level of $2.6 billion in the third quarter. The 3 main drivers are stronger earnings, timing benefits from last quarter and engineering contract prepayments. In light of the record sale of plant backlog, I anticipate further project repayments into the next few quarters.  
As far as how we allocated year-to-date cash, the pie chart to the right shows $2.3 billion invested into the business and $4.8 billion distributed back to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.  Note that investments exclude sale of plant since we are paid in advance for engineering projects, which means that we are committing much larger amounts toward contractually secured growth than what's shown on this chart. 
In addition to generating significant surplus cash we have access to very attractive capital through the debt markets. In September, we issued almost EUR 2 billion at 5-, 12- and 30-year maturities, with all-in coupons of 0%, 0.38% and 1%, respectively. Overall, the combination of excess cash generation and low-cost incremental debt gives us a high degree of confidence to maintain shareholder-friendly allocation policies over the long term.  
I'll wrap things up with guidance on Slide 9. The fourth quarter EPS guidance range of $2.60 to $2.70 is 13% to 17% above last year and 38% to 43% above 2019. Consistent with prior quarters, we believe it's important to distinguish true multiyear growth from mere recovery of 2020 recessionary conditions. Versus the third quarter, this range represents a sequential decrease due to normal seasonal declines plus an estimated 1% foreign currency headwind. Underlying volumes are assumed to be roughly in line with the third quarter, but if current conditions hold, I'd expect to be at the upper end of this range.  This quarterly update results in a new full year guidance of $10.52 to $10.62, which represents a growth rate of 28% to 29% over 2020 and 43% to 45% over 2019.  
In summary, another solid quarter despite some challenging conditions. And regardless of the macro, we remain confident in Linde's ability to continue delivering industry-leading performance.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A."

I agree with you that there's been significant and continuing momentum in the space. And I'm very pleased to suggest that we are seeing a reflection of that in the activities that we are actively pursuing. I'll start off by just describing what the opportunity pipeline looks like because that's reflective of the level of activity that Linde is seeing and then talk a little bit about the particular areas where we see some of that momentum reflected now.  
So starting over the projects that we're looking at. As you know, we run this monthly call on the Hydrogen Council that Linde runs internally. We've got about 260 projects in our pipeline. We've got a probability weighted sort of conservatively probability weighted number in terms of investment decisions of up to $4-plus billion now. And these are decisions we expect to see happen in the next 3 years or so.  In the past, you've heard me say that we expect to see us investing about $1 billion a year roughly in this space. And then on top of that, there may be some mega projects that come along as well. 
So that's just to give you a sense of the level of activity that there is happening around that space. Now remember, and I've said this before, Bob, so you'll kind of recall, Linde has a unique position in what is happening in the evolving space around clean energy. We've kind of described to you previously, under decarbonization, we look at carbon solutions and we look at hydrogen. In the hydrogen space, we obviously are very mindful and interested in the developments around blue hydrogen.  
We see that as a very important transition in this clean energy road map that lies ahead. And this is where we are seeing significant pickup in terms of activity. We are currently involved in a number of projects, which have a range of investments and those are progressing well. And again, for projects in this space to make sense, you need 3 things to be happening. You need the technology provider. in this case, that is us, for carbon capture. You need partnerships to ensure that you're then looking at sequestration effectively with partners who have long-standing experience and knowledge of that space. We're currently actively pursuing those as well.  
And of course, third, very importantly, you need an offtaker. You need a partner who is willing to stay in the game and actually offtake the blue hydrogen that comes off that and is able to create some value as a result of that.  For us, those 3 things are very important. And again, I'm pleased to say that we're seeing those partnerships actually take -- gather a lot of momentum as we move forward. I'll kind of stop there for a moment and give you -- see if that answered your question."

Most of them don't even understand that we have a colorless molecule that obviously is now defined by very, very many colors. But putting that aside in terms of experience and expertise, the reality is there will be a number of players who will make a difference in this space. And as part of that, you will see a range of outcomes.  
You will see us competing where we need to, and you will see us partnering with a number of those as well. This is an area that requires strong partnerships for that initial momentum and the ecosystem development to really happen.

I guess my question is around Lincare and maybe the medical business in general.  If you go back before COVID started and just kind of analyze how that business has developed with COVID as kind of a driver, how do you see that business structurally different today? And how much has it grown through that period relative to the rest of the business?"

So we think of our health care business in 2",548,"Duffy, thanks. Let me get into it. And I'll start off by just taking a step back and outlining the health care space that we operate in and also reminding everyone that we have strong leadership in that space.  So we think of our health care business in 2 different areas. We look at hospital care, where we are the primary provider of medical gases to hospitals, and of course, a home care business, where as you referenced, Lincare is a very, very important player in the U.S., but we obviously have smaller home care businesses elsewhere in the world as well.  
So thinking structurally about that business, let me just kind of say to you, there are 2 things happening as we speak. Obviously, you've heard us talk about how we've -- how that business is supported and saved lives and supported hospitals and patients at home over the last 18-plus months now.  So clearly, it's played a very important role. Lincare, in particular, in the U.S. was almost seen as a second line of defense supporting COVID patients at home through the respiratory offerings that we have. 
What has happened as a consequence of the pandemic is that a number of regulators and governments have, in the best way to describe it is, woken up to the realities of how they need to manage this more professionally in terms of storage, in terms of piping, in terms of infrastructure necessary for these high levels of medical gases and oxygen, in particular, to be delivered to their infrastructure and network.  
We have been participating in many of those conversations. In fact, most governments have reached out to us seeking support and help in structuring those conversations, and we are obviously leading many of those conversations across the world today where we are helping governments and regulators make sure that they have a well thought through infrastructure program and a development process around how they will manage this going forward.  
A kind of pandemic preparedness a little bit late in the day, but nonetheless important to make sure for the future. The reason I mentioned this is because this means as we move forward, we're going to see continuing activity in this space. We will be participating in those activities and expecting a level of growth out of that.  We've said this before, Duffy, you've heard us describe mid-single-digit growth for the health care business overall, and I still maintain that we will see that. 
Obviously, in the Lincare world, in particular, tuck-in acquisition is something that we are very interested and excited about.  So we'll continue to see those come through, adding on to that mid-single digit or contributing to that mid-single digit that I referenced earlier on as well. So I do see this a solid secular growth trend. I see it progressing with a strong mid-single-digit growth that I described earlier on, and I see us seeing kind of areas in the world where we will see that probably grow at -- not probably, will grow at a higher pace, Asia being one such example. Again, because of the strength of our footprint there, we have the ability to make sure that we leverage that footprint for that incremental growth in Asia as an example."

I guess, both in terms of today -- the impact today and in terms of -- with respect to future investment opportunities?  
And then the second question was on engineering, and congrats on this very big project. I think you used to talk about kind of mid- -- or low to mid-teens through the cycle kind of margin.

So starting with China, yes, to your point, we did see some volume curtailments as you would expect with the power outages. We do feel very confident about our customer base. They're still paying the MTOPs. These are Tier 1 customers. This is something you've seen, as you probably know, in prior times in China when there are some centrally managed slowdown.  So from that perspective, yes, there were reductions on a sequential basis. Now if you look at the APAC segment, you actually see volumes are up 2% sequentially and the primary driver there is because our backlog pretty much offset any of that China sequential decline.  And then the rest of our APAC business still performed quite well on growth, including some seasonal growth that we tend to see in the South Pacific. So from that perspective, yes, we had some of that. We anticipate a little bit of that to continue here into the fourth quarter.  
So when we talked about volumes assumed to be flat sequentially into our guidance range, it does take into account some continuing just volume softness based on this. But overall, we feel very good about our asset base. We see this as temporary. And to some extent, we tend to come out stronger on these things with our customer base. So we'll see how that plays out.  
On the engineering, you're exactly right, I mean, we have been operating kind of mid-teens or a little better. And as you can imagine, as you know, this business has pretty much a negative working capital. So what you see on the margins can be a pretty good indication of the type of returns you get or can even be a little better just based on the cash profile.  
So very good business that we have. We're very excited to have this backlog. It will contribute to growth. We tend to focus more on the E&P side as well, which helps with the risk management. So from this perspective, we still see margins kind of in this, I'll call it, low- to mid-teens, and we'll see how it plays out though over the cycle. You will always have timing in how you recognize the percent completion.  So quarter-to-quarter, it's always tough to gauge on any particular one. But over the multiyear process, we still think that kind of low double-digit to mid-teens is still a reasonable estimate through this business as it kind of goes through the cycles."

So from that perspective, we tend not to really have much risk to the production volumes given that it's not really anything I would be overly concerned with.  In fact, if anything, what we've seen, especially on our more industrial customers, they tend to run in harder. You could think steel, you could think refining, given the environment they're in and the margins that they're making on some of these products.  
As far as the merchant and package -- realizing package, it's a high rent business, so the volatility of the customers' demand will really only affect the gas molecules. And what we're seeing, especially in Americas and parts of Europe still seeing pretty strong growth across that package business. So I think that's been quite good.  
But on the merchant side, no, we really haven't seen any significant negative changes. It's been up pretty much across the board. And you could imagine the customers want to produce, right? They want to make as much product as they can in this environment, given their opportunity to get some pricing.  So from that perspective, we haven't seen any material effect on that. There may be some small pockets, but nothing that's coming up to the aggregate level."

I don't really want to be forecasting that, to be honest.  
But what I do want to give you is some assurance on the pricing, which then clearly then flows into the margin piece and addresses your question, which is you can expect us to always be keeping pace with inflation, global inflation, and that really is a reflection of how we will do that management around the pass-through elements, in particular, and pricing beyond that.  And that's what will then come back through the leverage we have down to the operating margin that you'll see. So hopefully, we'll come back and tell you in January what we think is the outlook for 2022 with a bit more precision.

We instantly pass that through, as Matt mentioned, on the on-site piece, but it takes a few months up to 6 months to be able to recover all of that through the merchant and the packaged business.

Over the time, we should be able to march the return on capital number up a little higher. 
With respect to the 50-50 comment, if you think about -- when we book sale of gas projects, they typically are in the hundreds of millions of dollar range. So if you look at the TSMC project, that's $600 million of capital investment that would be tied for our largest with Samsung. So when we see sale of gas, it tends to be -- that's a very big project. 
And clearly, we landed some very large projects, third-party projects with Linde Engineering, and that obviously shifted the weighting in terms of whatever that is, 75%, 80% of the total backlog is -- third-party sales is driven by these very large projects. 
Matt alluded to this. These very large projects have very strong contractual terms. They're very high-quality contracts, I will say.

Some of those differentials could -- of the remaining amount are things that we would want to be going chasing related to some timing related. 
And as you can imagine, EMEA has a much larger package and merchant percent than on-site. So that will also play into having a larger proportion of cost that need to be captured on a delay. And one thing I just want to be clear on is, this lag is normal. This lag is inherent in the industry. 
We have faced this lag since our inception going back decades. It just so happens in this particular quarter, the movement of the energy prices, the movement of some of these numbers are faster in a shorter time period. So given that, you're going to have some recovery, that will be next quarter and the quarter after.

So just to make sure we level-set and get the accounting correct. This is sale of plant, so this never touches CapEx. This is under percent completion accounting. So what happens is the backlog that we have actually translates essentially 1:1 to sales, $1 backlog equals $1 sales. 
And as we construct it, it goes to inventory and then when we meet the criteria, it's released out of inventory to sales. So therefore, it never actually hits CapEx, given the nature of how the structure works. And then as the prepayments come in, they sit on the balance sheet as a liability. 
And then obviously, we work and deliver the performed work, which then goes against that liability to relieve that liability as we deliver. So this is a classic percent completion accounting style. So given that -- and maybe let's talk about the cash flow real quick. In this business, in this industry of engineering and percent completion, when you're in a declining backlog, what tends to happen is your cash outflows are obviously higher than your inflows because you are delivering on the work, the engineering, the procurement and you basically think of like a book-to-bill ratio, right? 
So as your book-to-bill ratio starts to drop and drop and drop, you're going to have more cash outflow than inflow. Now that trend is reversed. So we've actually had more outflow than inflow over the last few quarters because we were building off a backlog that was shrinking. Now it has grown dramatically, that process is reversing. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have a few quarters. We expect some prepayments given the size and increase of this. And then we'll work them down over the next several years as the outflows go, but you still have more backlog that if you win, it can 
mitigate that. 
So that's how to think about this. It's not in CapEx. That's why I said in the prepared remarks, the growth that we have is much greater than what's being shown in CapEx because of this delivery. And as Sanjiv had mentioned, we're going to be probably mid-single digit in terms of our contribution. So hopefully, that makes sense, but I can hand it off to Sanjiv to talk about the project."

We are very happy with these projects, I have to tell you. They are with a very high-quality customer. I am going to name the customer now just for you, which is Gazprom. It's a customer with whom we have excellent relationships. We have got great experience thus far. We have got solid contract terms, which makes us pretty comfortable around taking on these large projects. 
Also, as Matt kind of referenced, strong cash flows. I want to remind you also that these cash flows tend to come in, the inflows are ahead of any commitments we make. So we tend to be net positive as far as our cash curves are concerned. And of course, it's in an area where we've got good experience of execution. So again, you put all of that together, that's kind of the projects. 
Now what are we building? Let me just give you a little bit of color on that. So we are building some GPPs. So these are gas processing plants for Gazprom at the site called Ust-Luga. And we're also building a separate project also at that same site, which is a separate win, but an important one also is an LNG plant for them. I expect natural gas developments will continue given the energy kind of challenges that the world is seeing. And this is kind of a major milestone as Gazprom have continued down the path of investing in that space."

So clearly, there are activities that we can undertake and we are undertaking today, which will continue to move in that direction. 
These are efficiency programs. This is about fleet replacement, et cetera. So there are a number of initiatives that are ongoing and will continue to -- we'll continue to work towards, which will execute towards that. But it's also correct to say that even today, there are government initiatives and government incentives available. So we're not suggesting that there is a complete void over here and then we need a complete kind of remake of that. 
In the U.S., we have the 45Q that is being effectively utilized to look at investment profiles like this. Now I have to be honest and tell you that much rather that 45Q, which currently provides $45 to $50 per ton of CO2, be anywhere between $90 to $110 per CO2. That's where I would see the inflection point with momentum for development of these projects would significantly ramp up because there'd be an economic case for it. 
In Europe, clearly, there's the ETS, the trading scheme that is currently valuing CO2 anywhere between EUR 60 to EUR 65 per ton. So again, as we see that move forward, where there is a plan similarly in Canada and South Korea and Australia, I could name a number of countries where these incentives or penalties are coming into play today. 
So we're working in that environment. We think that more support is necessary. But there isn't a complete lack of support. So a number of our projects will be relying on the support infrastructure that's available through the incentives and penalties to leverage all that to continue down that decarbonization trend. And of course, as we look longer term to carbon neutrality in our assumption when we think about our road map, clearly, we've got some levels of support available. 
They range anywhere between $100 to $200 per ton of CO2 in equivalent terms, longer term to make sure that we get to that level of the neutrality that we're talking about -- climate neutrality that we're talking about as being the goal that we achieve by then."

If you think about decarbonization and the cost of capturing and the cost of sequestration, it can vary $80 to $120, something like that. And to really tip the scales in terms of capital investment to decarbonize, you're going to need something like that in terms of a carbon price. So up until now, the 45Q can work in certain projects. It's $50, the low carbon fuel standard in California provide some support, too. But as we look forward to really make meaningful strides of decarbonization, you're going to need a stronger carbon price. That's our view."

So I've said before that when people think about what hydrogen is most appro",642,"P.J., the way I'm going to answer that question is to kind of take you back a step and just to remind you of some of the messaging that we provided in the previous earnings call. So I've said before that when people think about what hydrogen is most appropriate, one of the things you have to think about is the strength individual countries have, the assets that they have, where countries today have -- hydrocarbon assets have natural gas as an asset, we firmly believe that they will pursue the path of blue hydrogen because that is the most meaningful way to kind of move forward on this transition. The reason it's meaningful is because it's to scale. It can be done today, and we're not waiting for technology developments to happen. 
And I'll talk about ITM in a minute, but you'll hear me reflect that comment over there as well. So the answer is where we see that natural gas resource available in the U.S. and Canada, Australia, Russia, Middle East, we believe -- we know that those countries are actively pursuing, and we are looking at a number of counterparties over there as partners looking at some of those developments ourselves. 
So -- and the Slide 18 gives you a sense that Linde Engineering's technology portfolio allows us to be able to flex any technical solution. We are uniquely positioned to provide that technical solution for blue hydrogen output, whether it's using an SMR, whether it's using an ATR or whether it's using POx gasifier. We have the ability and technology to provide the technology packages, execute them and operate them ourselves because of the expertise we have. So that's as far as blue hydrogen is concerned, and I do see a lot of momentum building up in that space, and we are very active in that space as well.
 
Let's talk about ITM and order kind of intake and backlog going forward. Now you're asking me to project 5 years out. I have to tell you, the only thing I'm going to project 5 years out is to tell you that the technology road map that we have going with ITM through our joint venture with them is to make sure that, that product scales up and that product then has the capital efficiency and operating efficiency in scale up to be able to then execute projects of a reasonable size. 
I'm going to give you a very quick example of that. So today, as we are building Leuna as you know, you've heard us announce this before. We're building a 24-megawatt electrolyzer complex there. Those 24 megawatts will come from 2-megawatt modules. That's the largest PEM electrolyzer module available in the world today. We're working with ITM to scale that up. We are hoping to scale that up based on our technology road map in literally months to 5 megawatts and then beyond that to 20 megawatts, et cetera. 
At that point in time, a 100-megawatt module, again, projects that we are actively working on today that are getting some preferential positioning as far as some European funding is concerned as well. Those will then move from 50 units of 2 megawatts, which you can imagine on the most efficient structure, to maybe 5 units or 20 units of 5 megawatts or 5 units of 20 megawatts as scale-up happens along the way. 
So the fact that, that scale up is happening, the fact that the technology road map is providing that capital efficiency and economies of scale is happening right now and preparing us for what's likely to happen in the next 5 years. I don't want to speculate at this stage as to what that likely backlog might look like 5 years down the road, but clearly, I'm encouraged by the developments I see."

So I'm looking with some eagerness to that coming through and getting an understanding of how that -- how those rules come into play. But that would be encouraging. Clearly, we believe that there is an opportunity here for us to move forward. 
Steve mentioned to you in the past that if we get hydrogen, blue or green, green, obviously more challenged in this reference, at about between $1 to $2 per kg, it's at that point that you see an inflection point and you see widespread adoption of technologies utilizing hydrogen and really hydrogen becoming a reasonable fuel in the portfolio fuels we'll have. We'll always have fossil fuel, at least for many decades ahead. But it will be a more important part of that portfolio of fuels and energy basket as it will. Steve, do you want to add something?"

So yes, just to build on that, I mean, if you were to look at the cost of hydrogen today and you were to use the U.S. Gulf Coast, which obviously, we produce a lot of hydrogen, we use a lot of hydrogen in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Gray hydrogen is about $1.30 a kilogram, and that's at $5.50 natural gas. Carbon capture would add another $0.40, $0.50, maybe you're in the $1.7 range sort. And if you think about green, it's like about $4.5 a kilogram. 
And out of that, probably $2.50, you call it, is the renewable power cost. And so if renewable power was free, then you would still have $2. And we all know renewable power isn't free. So we have some work to do to bring those costs down in terms of capital costs, operating costs. And as you were to work that down below that $2 number, then you've got a chance to have something competitive. 
So you need the combination of low-cost renewable, low-cost capital, lower cost -- operate low-cost capital and better efficiencies and then you can drive that number lower. And I would say ideally below $2, but certainly in that range would be is what's needed."

We have a record backlog of projects, I'm sure we'll talk about. We also were able to hit record return on capital. 
So you mentioned a little pressure on the margin. So our EBIT margin was 23.6%. And if you go back 3 years ago when we started the merger, it was 17.1% for the baseline year. So we've been able to grow margins 200 basis points per year. We were 23.6% Q3. We're 24.2% Q2. What's the difference? It's the pass-through. And so we have long-term contracts about 30% of our business. And as the power costs go up, we're immediately able to pass that through to our customers through those contracts. 
So you increased the revenue dollars, the EBIT dollars stay the same, but it has a dilutive effect on EBIT percent. So actually, the EBIT percent is flat quarter-to-quarter. Now we also saw some cost inflation in the rest of our business. It's generally power cost is the way we look at it. Q2 to Q3 in Europe, power costs went up 25% to 30%, which is a tremendous number. And over the next couple of quarters, we'll be able to offset all of that through our merchant liquid contracts. And so they're not instantaneous pass-through. They take a matter of months. So over the next 2 quarters, we'll recover all of that. 
And then the question really becomes what should we expect going forward. And after we recover all of this, our operating model or the formula that we usually think about is whatever top line growth we have, and I think it's going to be very strong in the future, we're able to take that plus good pricing, good price management, that's always been our history, good productivity.

And so you add base volume growth in the EPS that we'll get from that plus pricing, and we'll talk about clean energy later a little bit -- it's a kicker later on. But you can see we're setting up very well for the next 4 years actually because we've got visibility into where 5% of the EPS growth is going to come from. And if you go back and think about us historically, that was more like a 2% contribution from the backlog number, so we're plus 3 points to that."
