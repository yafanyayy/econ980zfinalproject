I want to welcome Chris Stevens to his first Sealed Air conference call. Chris, we're excited to have you on our team. 
Throughout 2020, the pandemic presented new challenges for all of us around the world. Our purpose, which you can see here on Slide 3, is guiding us in the pandemic and has become even more clear. We are in the business to protect, to solve critical packaging challenges and to leave our world better than we found it. Our employees delivered, and I'm proud of our team's tremendous commitment to our customers and our business throughout this pandemic. 
On today's call, I'll recap our performance in 2020. I'll share how we're accelerating growth in an uncertain environment and the exciting opportunities we see ahead. Our global markets are evolving, and we're leading the way with automation, digital and sustainability. Jim will review our financial results in more detail, and Chris will provide our 2021 outlook. I'll close the call, and we'll end with Q&A. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 for a recap of our 2020 results. Our strong sales performance in the fourth quarter, coupled with continued execution of Reinvent SEE allowed us to exceed our 2020 commitments. In 2020, we delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% on 2% sales growth, resulting in 130 basis points of margin expansion and an operating leverage of 77%. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.19, and we generated strong free cash flow of $556 million, which is 73% above last year. 
Automation, digital and sustainability are driving growth in 2021 and beyond. This is being fueled by our Reinvent SEE business transformation. We want to point out on Slide 4 that we are sharing with you the long-term direction that we are taking our business and the performance we expect to deliver. As we shared before, we're serving a stable market that grows at 1% to 3% a year. We're looking to accelerate this growth to 2% to 4% on our base business and another 100 basis points with automation. With our Reinvent SEE operating system, on 3% to 5% organic sales growth, we expect to deliver over 30% operating leverage and create world-class returns. 
Let's turn to Slide 5, our movie real slide, which pictorially shows some new solutions powered by our iconic brands. You can see a play button on this slide, which is to encourage you to visit our website, where you will find current new stories with more to come. In 2020, approximately 63% of our sales were derived from packaging proteins, other foods, liquids and fluids, medical and life sciences. Since March 2020, there's been an imbalance across the food industry with strong demand in the retail channel, offset by continued softness in foodservice from the stay-at-home pandemic environment. Food processors are working hard to meet increased retail demand, but they're still challenged with labor shortages. Our customers are focused on safety, productivity and labor shortages, and we are responding with automated solutions to solve those challenges. This has resulted in another strong quarter in food packaging equipment and volume growth in our retail formats. 
In the fourth quarter, growth in retail formats and equipment was largely offset by continued declines in products with high exposure to foodservice. We expect this market segment to recover later this year and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of that recovery with new sustainable innovations. For example, for proteins, we've optimized materials and process for our Cryovac barrier bags to make them recyclable while maintaining our industry-leading standards for food preservation and food safety. For liquids and fluids, we have automated solutions that disrupt rigid containers and expand our bag and box offerings for soups, sauces, condiments and beverages. The combination of our automated equipment, service, barrier bag and pouches, and packaging process extend shelf life, minimizes material waste and lowers total cost of ownership. 
Approximately 37% of our sales serve e-commerce, retail, logistics, electronics and industrials. Sales to e-commerce, retail and logistics were up double digits in the second half of 2020. Automated equipment, including the portfolio acquired from Automated Packaging Systems, mailers, Bubble Wrap inflatables and our new paper-based solutions were our fastest-growing portfolios in 2020. 
In Q4, we also experienced increased demand for our temperature assurance packaging solution that ensures the safe and secure distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. In 2021, we expect continued growth from our e-commerce and fulfillment solutions, particularly the offerings designed to automate the packaging process, minimize waste and increase throughput. It was encouraging to see in the fourth quarter, our sales to the industrial sector were up modestly, largely due to strength in consumer electronics and a rebound in automotive. 
Now turning to Slide 6 for an update on our SEE automated solutions strategy, which is driving growth for the next phase of our Reinvent SEE business transformation. You can see on this chart that we expect equipment sales to grow more than 15% in 2021 to over $250 million. Our pipeline for automated equipment continues to strengthen, and we are confident in our organic target of over $500 million by 2025. When you factor in a 3x-plus solutions multiplier, including growth in parts and service from the installed base and the flow through of materials, these results in a $5 billion plus potential opportunity over the 10-year equipment life cycle. 
As I mentioned before, we are solving our customers' most critical needs for safety, productivity and labor scarcity with our touchless automated solutions. We are prioritizing these projects to those that create less than a 3-year payback for our customers. 
With SEE automation, we're taking an integrated solutions approach by eliminating waste, simplifying the process, removing people from harm's way and automating. Our customers are recognizing the tremendous value we are creating by integrating our full system. We brought new solutions to market, and we'll continue to do that for our customers and our own operations as we lead the way to a more touchless digital environment. 
Let me now turn to Slide 7 and share how we are successfully navigating through this pandemic. Our local, regional and corporate crisis management teams remain active, and business continuity plans are still in effect. We've been proactive with our zero-harm mentality. And thanks to the dedication of our people, we've had minimal disruption to our operations. 
We are investing in digital capabilities and finding new ways to do business online. Our investments in smart packaging and digital printing are unlocking new growth opportunities by enabling our customers to increase their brand equity, enhance consumer experiences and create significant supply chain efficiencies. 
I'll now pass the call to Jim to review our results in more detail."

Let's turn to Slide 8 for a review of our year-over-year net sales growth by region. In the fourth quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 3% as reported and 3% in constant dollars. In constant dollars, North America, our largest regio",1822,"Thank you, Ted. Let's turn to Slide 8 for a review of our year-over-year net sales growth by region. In the fourth quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 3% as reported and 3% in constant dollars. In constant dollars, North America, our largest region, representing 58% of our sales, increased 3%. South America was up 13%, largely due to U.S. dollar index pricing and volume growth of 4%. Constant dollar sales in Asia Pacific were up 4%, and EMEA was up 1%. 
On Slide 9, you can see our full year 2020 results. Net sales totaled $4.9 billion, up 2% as reported and 4% in constant dollars. Similar to the quarterly results, we delivered constant dollar sales growth across all regions and exceeded our most recent outlook by approximately $50 million, most of which was driven by volume growth in protective. Starting in the first quarter 2021, for reporting purposes, we will be consolidating North America and South America into 1 region, the Americas. This will align with our new 1 Sealed Air regional structure and organizational changes that went into effect in January. 
On Slide 10, here, you see our organic sales volume and pricing trends by segment and region. In the fourth quarter, overall volume increased 3%. Protective volumes accelerated into year-end, delivering 7% growth, up from 4% growth last quarter. As expected, we also saw modest volume growth in food after a couple of quarters of low single-digit percent declines. 
By region, volumes in North America, South America and APAC were up 4%. Protective volumes were up across all regions due to e-commerce and fulfillment strength and growth in our industrial portfolios in North America and APAC. Food delivered volume growth in North America and South America due to strength in retail formats and equipment. This volume growth in food was offset by declines in EMEA and APAC where foodservice softness and COVID-related restrictions outweighed solid retail demand. 
On Slide 11, we present our year-over-year consolidated sales and adjusted EBITDA bridges for the fourth quarter and full year. As mentioned, sales in the quarter were up 3% with volume contributing $42 million to the top line. For the full year, sales were up 2%, including $22 million in volume growth and $172 million contribution from acquisitions, of which $166 million was from Automated Packaging Systems that closed in August 2019. Currency translation negatively impacted 2020 sales by $82 million or about 2%, mostly due to year-over-year declines in Latin American currencies and the euro. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $279 million increased $8 million or 3% compared to last year with margin down 10 basis points to 20.8%. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA of $1.051 billion increased $86 million or 9% compared to 2019 with margin increasing up 130 basis points to 21.4%. Higher volume contributed $12 million to adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. For the year, volume had a negative $14 million impact on adjusted EBITDA due to unfavorable product mix in both reporting segments. 
Reinvent SEE benefits totaled $17 million in the quarter and $118 million in 2020. We've had a positive impact on price/cost spread and operating costs throughout the year. In the quarter, as anticipated, price/cost spread was $7 million unfavorable due to higher input costs. For the full year, price/cost spread contributed $28 million to adjusted EBITDA. Half of this favorability was driven by Reinvent SEE actions. 
Operating costs included labor and other nonraw material cost inflation of about $13 million in the quarter and $53 million for the full year. We incurred $3 million of year-over-year incremental spending related to COVID-19 in the fourth quarter and $16 million for the year. These impacts were mostly offset by lower travel spending with the remote work environment. 
In addition, Reinvent SEE productivity benefits totaled $15 million in the quarter and $104 million for the year. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.89. This compared to $0.78 in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $3.19, an increase of 13% over 2019. The adjusted tax rate in 2020 was 24.5%, down from 26% in 2019. This year's lower tax rate was favorably impacted by the new U.S. GILTI regulations, which were issued in the third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12. Here, we provide an update on Reinvent SEE, which continues to progress and is driving structural operating leverage in the business. Our reinvent commercial work stream is robust and providing a solid platform for driving revenue growth in the markets we serve. As Ted mentioned, we are seeing strong growth in our automated equipment order pipeline and look forward to capturing those opportunities in 2021. 
In 2020, as mentioned, we realized $118 million of year-over-year overall Reinvent SEE benefits to adjusted EBITDA. In 2021, we now expect $65 million of additional benefits with roughly 50% flow-through from actions taken in 2020. Reinvent SEE benefits realized since late 2018 when the transformation was launched are now expected to be approximately $355 million, $105 million higher than originally targeted. 
Cash restructuring payments associated with Reinvent SEE were $74 million in 2020 with an estimated $40 million remaining in 2021 as Reinvent SEE transitions from a restructuring phase to the company's continuous improvement business operating system. The total cash cost of Reinvent SEE is now expected to be approximately $205 million, which is $10 million less than what we originally expected. 
Turning to segment results on Slide 13, starting with food. In the fourth quarter, food net sales increased modestly on a constant dollar basis to $757 million. Net sales for the year were up 1% in constant dollars to just over $2.8 billion. This performance was in line with our guidance. 
Equipment, parts and service sales, which currently represent about 8% of the food segment, were up 11% in the quarter and 8% for the year. Across the globe, our meat processing customers are upgrading aged assets to improve efficiency, enhance employee safety and reduce labor dependency in their plants. We are seeing meaningful capacity expansions to support market growth, particularly in South America for exports, and in Asia and Eastern Europe, where countries are increasing domestic production of multiple types of proteins. 
Cryovac materials, which comprise the remainder of the food segment sales, were down approximately 1% in the quarter. While the trend was still below prior year levels, it improved 200 basis points from the third quarter. 
Growth in retail applications, which accounted for just over 40% of food sales in the fourth quarter, was largely offset by continued declines in barrier bags and pouches. Adjusted EBITDA in food of $170 million in the quarter was essentially flat compared to last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased $18 million to $648 million with margins up 110 basis points to 22.9%. Our full year performance was attributable to Reinvent SEE productivity benefits and favorable price/cost spread. This was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and currency translation. 
On Slide 14, we highlight results from our protective segment. In constant dollars, protective net sales increased 7% to $584 million in the quarter and 9% to $2.1 billion for the full year. This performance exceeded the guidance we provided on our third quarter earnings call. In the fourth quarter, volume trends in both North America and APAC accelerated to 8% and 11%, respectively. EMEA volume turned positive for the first time in 2020, delivering 2% growth. The segment's growth was largely driven by double-digit increases in e-commerce and fulfillment. It was also encouraging to see favorable volume trends in industrials in both North America and APAC. Keep in mind, approximately 55% of our protective sales are derived from industrial end markets, and the remaining 45% is coming from e-commerce and fulfillment. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $115 million increased $8 million or 8% in the quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA of $408 million was up $58 million or 17%. In 2020, margin was up 130 basis points to 19.6%. Protective's full year performance was attributable to Reinvent SEE benefits and contribution from the Automated Packaging Systems acquisition, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. 
Now let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 15. In 2020, we generated $556 million of free cash flow compared to $321 million in 2019 and our previously provided guidance of approximately $450 million. The significant year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, the impact of the Novipax settlement last year, lower Reinvent SEE restructuring and associated payments and lower CapEx due to pandemic-related project delays. 
Trade working capital was a source of cash at $14 million in 2020, relatively consistent with 2019. Our trade working capital, which includes advance payments, the conversion cycle for this was better than anticipated and improved approximately 2 days compared to 2019. This was largely attributable to an improvement in days sales outstanding. Our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow for the year was very strong at 53%. 
Slide 16 highlights our net leverage, liquidity and debt maturity profile. We ended the year with leverage at 3.1x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis. This is down from 3.6x at the end of 2019. With a strong balance sheet, $1.7 billion of liquidity and no debt maturities until August 2022, we have good financial flexibility to support growth of the business. 
On Slide 17, we outlined our capital allocation strategy. We ended 2020 with an ROIC of approximately 15%, which is top quartile in the packaging industry and well above our weighted average cost of capital. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to maintain a strong balance sheet while driving continued attractive returns on invested capital. We are investing in capacity to support growth initiatives, and we're accelerating innovation with disruptive products and technologies. Approximately 40% of our organic CapEx is currently focused on growth, including breakthrough production processes, automation and digital. 
SEE ventures includes selective minority investments in early-stage technologies, focused on automation, digital and sustainability. These investments will help accelerate our strategy and will complement our internal innovation efforts across Sealed Air. For example, in the fourth quarter, we increased our investment to $8 million in Plastic Energy, an industry-leading start-up company with advanced recycling technology. And in early 2018, we invested a similar amount in Pharmapacks, a leading e-commerce enablement platform. We recorded a $15 million gain on this investment in the fourth quarter. This gain was treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. 
Regarding shareholder returns, we paid cash dividends in 2020 of $100 million, which represented a dividend payout ratio of 20%. And starting in the third quarter, we reinitiated share repurchases with 821,000 shares acquired in the second half of 2020 at a cost of $33 million. 
Let me now turn the call over to Chris to provide our outlook for 2020. Welcome, Chris. It's great to have you on board."
382724,700518579,2200567,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim.

It's an exciting time to join the Sealed Air team. I'm happy to be here. Since joining in early January, I have spent a great deal of time working with Ted and the team, executing my 100-day game plan focused on people, process and results. I have met virtually with many of our leaders and teams around the world and had the opportunity to tour a few of our facilities in a safe way. There is more to learn and many more people to meet and places to visit. But in my short time, you could see the passion and commitment by the Sealed Air team to drive success and continue to execute to exceed customer expectations. 
So let's turn to Slide 18 to review our 2021 outlook. We anticipate net sales to increase 4.5% to 6.5% as reported or $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. On a constant dollar basis, net sales are expected to increase 2.5% to 4.5%, driven by favorable volume and price in both food and protected. We expect food to deliver 2% to 4% constant dollar growth and protective to deliver 3% to 5%. Automated equipment and sustainable solutions are expected to drive growth in food and protected in 2021. In food, we expect the retail channel and protein exports to remain strong. We also expect the foodservice industry to recover as we progress through the year. In protective, we expect continued growth in e-commerce and fulfillment and the industrial end markets to gradually improve. We expect favorable currency translation in 2021 sales and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2%, mainly due to the euro and the Australian and New Zealand dollars. 
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $1.1 billion to $1.13 billion. At the midpoint, this would imply a modest increase in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to 2020. Margins are being impacted by higher input costs and continued COVID-related expenses. To help alleviate higher raw material and freight costs, we initiated market price increases in Q4 with more actions going into effect this quarter. Also, keep in mind that our formulas in food North America are typically on a 6-month lag and are expected to turn favorable midyear. 
We expect adjusted EPS to be $3.25 to $3.40. Given the current impact of higher material costs and the timing of pricing actions, many driven by formulas, we expect 2021 adjusted EPS to be split approximately 45% first half, 55% second half versus what we realized in 2020, which was a split of 47% first half, 53% second half. Our outlook assumes approximately 157 million average shares outstanding and an adjusted tax rate of 26% to 27%. 
The higher adjusted tax rate is primarily due to the absence of a valuation reserve release that benefited the rate in 2020. For free cash flow, we expect to generate $500 million to $550 million. This is net of capital expenditures, approximately $210 million or 4% of sales and Reinvent SEE restructuring associated payments of approximately $40 million. The year-over-year anticipated decline in free cash flow is largely attributable to higher trade working capital from sales growth and higher employee bonus payments in 2021 given the strong performance in 2020. 
Let me now pass the call to Ted for closing remarks."

I guess first off, maybe on the food segment, growth in the grocery channel has been elevated through the course of the pandemic. There's some tierization of consumption in packaged food, will just be at a higher volume baseline relative to pre-COVID levels.

Ghansham, yes, if we look at where we are with food and just to recap, basic look at the foodservice side that is getting hit with us and reproduces the bags, and tying into the restaurants, as we all know what's happening there. But on the retail format, that's changing dramatically. And so what we're seeing is -- if you look at our movie real slide on Slide 5, we see that shift. We have e-commerce actually on the right side where we talk about protective. That's the shift that we see happening very, very quickly in the retail formats, to your question. 
If you go to a grocery store, we all see it, you see people packing next to you. And those packers, we're already working with customers and some of the start-ups on where e-groceries is going. So what is that doing to the packaging format, to your question. Bringing our Darfresh line, Darfresh entree, how do we actually package that, that's now by a pick and pack, but actually, that's going to be going into cobots and robots. So we actually see that format moving quite aggressively. 
Also, we see the market still moving on to sustainability. Those secular trends of automation, fresh food and food safety is going to even drive harder as we go into those formats in the grocery stores. So our leading barrier bag right now, we're working on new barrier materials that not only are lighter in weight. We're looking with recyclability with our investment with Plastic Energy. They want the PVDC out. So we've actually new designs already coming in that we're going to use chlorine-free material because the chemical recycling plants don't want that. We had an announcement with Plastic Energy and Tesco. And so we're leading the way in that. So these new formats, we think we're well positioned for. 
In the fourth quarter and going next year, we're dealing with still the pandemic, so that shift is happening as we speak, but we definitely think there's an opportunity. 
The other part of our protein side as we talk about that bag and the box and pouches. We are definitely seeing that slowed with the QSRs. But we are -- that's where we're seeing a lot of opportunity to actually go into the liquids and fluids business. So actually excited. We think we have a lot of opportunity. We've got to get through some of these headwinds with our markets in the pandemic, but we think we're well positioned in the food side of our business for that new format that just seeing in The Wall Street Journal today, it's heartening, saying that they think this pandemic will be with us forever. So once again, we're planning for the worst, hoping for the best. But we think our portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of that new normal that's coming in 2021 and beyond."

When we talk about Reinvent benefits, we're talking about those productivity actions that we're driving within our factories. And we talked in the call about how we delivered $118 million last year. And this year, we're coming down to $65 million. Our plan is to continue to drive those benefits at a level higher than our inflation. If you look at our wage inflation, across the enterprise, it's roughly $50 million. So what you're seeing that kind of offsets part of those Reinvent benefits is that. So the flow-through, if you look at the benefits and the inflation, it's about $15 million, not the full $65 million. Now having said that, I've been around now Sealed Air for 1.5 years. And I continue to be very encouraged by the continuous improvement culture, the high-performance culture that we have here in Sealed Air. And I think we thought after the 3-year restructuring transition that we would just kind of be on par. It would be an inflation finder, not add value, if you will, above inflation. I think that we're well positioned. The pipeline for Reinvent is very strong. We're saying $65 million next year. Hopefully, we beat that. We've got 50% of that is flow through from actions we've already taken in 2020. So we're well positioned to deliver that. And we'll continue to drive actions that will allow us to add more to it in 2022 and beyond. Hopefully, that helps clarify a little bit of the math."

I guess my question is around volume growth and translating that into your operating leverage target and return on capital, if you could give us a target there. So Ted, if you could talk about some of the key platforms that you're working on. Darfresh Entree, you're mentioning to Gansham, some of the sustainability-driven products. What would you say you're expecting in terms of growth for those products in 2021? And how does the growth in these products and e-commerce factor into your operating leverage target, which is now 30% plus. I think a couple of years ago, last time you talked about it, it was more like a 40%. And in turn, we like the return on capital discussion that you have in the deck and how you calculated it. What kind of target, if you have 30% plus of -- in terms of margin, what kind of ROIC target should we expect over the next 2 to 3 to 4 years?"

So I'll try to unpack it and actually build off of Jeff's question that Jim went through the financials because it ties into the operating model that we talked about on Slide 4. So what we're going into, and we're looking at very current state of what happened in the fourth quarter, the operating leverage in the fourth quarter was actually below the target of where we've been driving, less than 20% operating leverage. But for the year, 77%. So well, what's going on with our portfolio in this tumultuous market, we've had huge spikes, but then we've also had parts of the portfolio go down. So now if we look at operating leverage, take a look at our top 3 product lines. So if we look at food, what's going on with bags? What's going on with bags is affected by all those restaurants being shut down. Bags are flat to down. Our highest-margin product, so there's actually a deleverage on the portfolio. There's a lot of things that are going up. Great progress with Darfresh Entree. Great progress with some of the sustainable products. But if you look at net-net in the fourth quarter, and then we had some rising input costs. Did we get ahead on the pricing that we talked about? So if you look at that in the quarter, then you play that through to 2021, you say, huh, that leverage in the midpoint is below that 30%. It's a 25% because we've got to get through this first half by what we know in the pandemic. So we look on the protective side, wow, how many -- I've been here 3 years now and seeing that growth, can you grow that protect? Yes, we can. Yes, we will. Well, we're dealing with our largest product line in that portfolio. It's dependent on the industrial rebound with our Instapak. So deleveraging, really heavy. So we have all these ups, and with that major down on both sides of the business is delevering. So is it where we want to be for the year? 70% -- 7%, that's good. So what we wanted to give you was where we're taking the business and where this engine is gone. So we left out a 3-year plan. And that's what we're going to do. We're going to put it with very stable markets. Though even in pandemic, some go way up and some go down. So net-net, we think we can beat that stable market that we serve. We think with our innovations and sustainability, we can take that to 2 to 4. And the excitement is where we're taking automation to take that to 3 to 5 
Well, then to the second part of your question, you asked about leverage. Hey, Ted, when you came in, you did your assessment of this business, hey, you thought you could leverage at 40%. Well, we did pretty well. We actually -- if you look at our last 3-year average, we leveraged way over that 40% to 50%, but we also had restructuring in that number. So we're now building off a base of almost 260 basis points higher than we started. And there is a greater sign next to the 30%, but that's where we think the model is going. 
And then to your last part of your question was on ROIC. We shared with you day one when we got here, we are going to change the guardrails on this business. We are going to measure leverage. And I believe it. This is part of the mantra, ""You get what you measure."" So we put operating leverage in there. It's all the way through. But we also put in ROIC, day 1, all of our investments, the capital. We look at a return on investment, and you can now see, you get what you measure. Through this tumultuous market, our ROIC has moved up. But George, the last part of your question, ""Where are you going to take your ROIC?"" Our investors know that we're way over our cost of capital, want to put assets on this engine and generate value. And that's where we mentioned in there. That's what we're driving. This high-powered, value-creation engine is going to be driving these assets that we put on place far above our cost of capital. But it's not about taking that to 15 to 17. It's driving growth on this engine, and that's where we're taking it. So again, why on Slide 3, we feel confident the engine is in place. It's moving despite the tumultuous markets that we face. We feel confident, and we wanted our investors to know this is where we're going. And we're quite confident we're going to get there despite the market that we're dealing with really hard in the first half of 2021."

But basically, you're exactly right. It's more than just resin. As we've -- since I've been here, we've been talking about resin. Our team does an excellent job, and part of our Reinvent is to really focus with multiple different suppliers on the resin. And we have specialty resins. So how can we beat the market, and we think we will do that. But what has happened with resins, there's no secret. It has gone up significantly with what the chemical industry is doing. So we've been ahead of that on the price, especially with protective. We went out with price in the fourth quarter. 
But the second part of your -- and also the formulas are coming. We have that 6-month lag there. But we believe we're ahead of it. We are the leader in the market. We can lead with price. We don't talk to our customers about price. We are actually embedded with our customers and actually bringing automation in on how we can solve this problem together. So I just want to highlight that. 
But the second part of your question, you're exactly right. We're seeing it beyond it's the freight costs that have gone up significantly and other input costs. So we're managing that. And we're using price to stay ahead of it. But the issue that we have to really work with our customers is look at maybe different product portfolio and look at automation. But the other piece that we're not giving up with this rising input cost is the sustainability side. So we're also continuously looking at our material change on recycled content. Is it more challenging? Absolutely. But believe on the price side, we're going to lead. We're going to get our costs right, and we're going to be driving automation. And by the way, automation internally as well as externally, we think we're going to be ahead, get through this. It's tough, though. Right now, fourth quarter, first half of 2021, you're exactly right. It's a tough market on there on input costs. I don't know, Jim, do you want to add anything to that?"

I mean I think the other piece of the was question what are we expecting in terms of the back half of the year, the current environment or are we expecting relief? As everyone knows, the cost curve on inputs across 2020 was increasing across the year. So as we plan the business, we're certainly planning for the materials, the resins to be at a high level that they are now, and we're initiating the price actions that Ted talked about. We're very comfortable, even in this environment, we can manage the spread, the price/cost spread very well. Over the course of our range of guidance, certainly, on the low end, you could see input cost exceeding our ability to price. And a big part of that is timing. How is the timing of the raw materials coming in, and how quickly can we get the price in place? Many of our pricing -- much of our pricing in North America is formula-based on the food side. So we won't get that right away. But certainly, we have mechanisms to deal with it. 
And then the final piece of the question was on other raw materials. So think about resin, polyethylene, ethylene representing about 50% of our overall resin buy. And resins in total are about half of our total input cost. The other half is only inflating in low single digits. So again, the takeaway, I think, Ted, is what you said, we're managing both the input side and the price side very well."

As you noted, Phil, we did have negative price/cost spread in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, it was about $7 million.

Which is why when Chris talked about the adjusted EPS guidance for the full year, he said kind of expect 45% coming in the first half of the year and 55% in the back half of the year. We're thinking about that cadence of price/cost spread being a little bit more challenged in the first half as we get pricing into the business. Right now, volumes are very robust. We feel good about our ability to get price. We're not doing anything than anyone else is doing. And as Ted said, we're focused on doing what we can to differentiate ourselves and really be more value sellers than just pass-through resin. And then the only other thing I would say is we continue to drive reinvent above our inflation. We got $15 million spread as we talked about earlier. We're going to continue to drive that.

I just want to make sure because our customers are listening right now. We are going to handle this together with them. And if we even have to move the portfolio, so I do think we're very different than our competitors. We have a very unique portfolio that we can respond in a much better way on this pricing situation with resins than we've ever done before.

So my answer to that would be we're reinventing on how we grow the business. So the restructuring side on the cost, you're exactly right. But the portfolio change is a big part of this difference that where we're going. We're moving from being a product-driven business to be a market-driven business. So 2020 was a pivotal year for us. That portfolio shifted dramatically. So we're pointing that portfolio to the secular trends in the industry that we believe are going to be there post-pandemic. What does that mean? Automation. How do you put more stuff in a package more effectively, more efficiently, safely, securely, that is what we're focused on. So we think that can drive our portfolio across food, product, across the region significantly, and that's what we're focused on. But we have to do it more efficiently. So we've invested -- part of our investments have been in innovation and our R&D. And as Jim even mentioned, we're giving visibility, what we're doing with SEE ventures. If we can't develop it fast enough, we have that innovation rate on top of the team, and we're going to move. We're going to move this portfolio faster to innovate faster to satisfy those secular trends. And that's what the exciting part of this packaging business. It's a stable market. It's us up -- it's up to us to move the organization, because you use the word organization a lot, to move this organization to where the growth is. And I think 2020 was a pivotal year to show us that we can do it. It takes time. And by the way, I'm dealing with our scientists and all the time and getting FDA approval. Our products are unique. We're testing. If you came to our innovation center, we're testing things, but we're doing it now virtually. But we've got to move faster. So the innovation is one of the keys that I believe is that next phase that's happening in 2020, but we got to drive it even faster to support that 3% to 5% growth that we're going after. I definitely believe we're going to get it. 
And the final piece that I will mention, it's got to be sustainable. So some of the churn, and that's a term we use internally, why are you seeing some of the growth for the innovations? And this is where our team says that I'm too tough on them. It's because the churn is we're now actually bringing sustainable solutions like Bubble Wrap on demand. The Bubble Wrap, if you looked at our facilities, the dramatic shift on that is now we have Bubble Wrap in our portfolio with 90% recycled content. We did that in less than a year. So that's part of our Bubble Wrap portfolio, but it's fully redesigned with recycled content. 
So I'm quite excited about that 3% to 5% growth that we can make and leverage it at over 30%."

And I shared with you with Jim, a friend in need is a friend indeed. So I'd like to use this as an opportunity to thank Jim again when you put me on the spot there on your conference. 
So if we look at that portfolio in protective, in e-commerce, we talked about. I just want to say it again, e-commerce is affecting food, too. But for right now, let's go to your question. So the industrial piece, as you highlighted, the 55%, that said, negative deleverage that we've had. We had slight growth in the fourth quarter, which is good. I have the example on here, if we look at our movie real slide. What's going on with industrial? We saw automotive. We have seen automotive turn. We haven't seen it turn at the same levels, but we did see positive. 
So here's an example of what does automation mean, and this is actually a tire solution. So what are we going to do? We're going to go package tires. We're going to be working with the customers, which, by the way, they get huge penalties because those tires roll off e-commerce conveyor systems. So we designed the shrink tunnel. We're going to put the tires in the shrink tunnel. By the way, it's a few hundred thousand dollars. But we were going to do even more. We're going to put the full system in for a couple of million dollars. So we're going to wrap those tires. By the way, they're going to have paper and plastic. So they don't roll off. We're going to shrink them and we're going to wrap them, so they won't -- they don't want to have anybody who know it's inside. And so the materials, they're going to flow through that are going to be at 2x the cost of the system. So that's a solution that we're bringing right now as we speak into that industrial automotive segment. So we see that picking back up. And boy, does that leverage nicely. Just like our bags business, that's the industrial side of our business that leverages quite nicely. So that's a link of industrial with e-commerce, et cetera. So the industrial piece is beyond that. We've also seen a pickup on the electronics and in the industrial side. 
Also on the protected, you see that we're kind of merging on the market, as we do with our Autobag system, we're actually using the Autobag system now package of food. So it's in our protective versus food portfolio. But again, it's -- I'm talking about where that automation is coming in. And by the way, on the top of the slide, it's personal. We have pet care up there. For all of you in staying at home, that is an area that really had a pickup in the business with pet care. Pet food, pet accessories, that's going. We're packaging that stuff that you're getting at home right now. That's going through our side pouch Autobag system. So just giving you a little color and flavor. We're going after that industrial piece. It's coming back. But right now, in 2020, it was a wait on 2020, an opportunity in 2021. 
So with that, operator, that's the close for our call today. I want to thank everyone. I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. And thanks again, Jim. I know you'll be watching. And Chris, really excited to have you on board. So thanks, everyone. And we'll see you next quarter. Take care."

I want to welcome Chris Stephens to his first Sealed Air conference call. Chris, we're excited to have you on our team.
Throughout 2020, the pandemic presented new challenges for all of us around the world. Our purpose, which you can see here on Slide 3, is guiding us in the pandemic and become even more clear. We are in the business to protect, to solve critical packaging challenges, and to leave our world better than we found it. Our employees delivered, and I'm proud of our team's tremendous commitment to our customers and our business throughout this pandemic.
On today's call, I'll recap our performance in 2020. I'll share how we're accelerating growth in an uncertain environment and the exciting opportunities we see ahead. Our global markets are evolving, and we're leading the way with automation, digital and sustainability. Jim will review our financial results in more detail, and Chris will provide our 2021 outlook. I'll close the call, and we'll end with Q&A.
Let's turn to Slide 4 for a recap of our 2020 results. Our strong sales performance in the fourth quarter, coupled with continued execution of Reinvent SEE allowed us to exceed our 2020 commitments. In 2020, we delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% on 2% sales growth, resulting in 130 basis points of margin expansion and an operating leverage of 77%. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.19, and we generated strong free cash flow of $556 million, which is 73% above last year.
Automation, digital and sustainability are driving growth in 2021 and beyond. This is being fueled by our Reinvent SEE business transformation. We want to point out on Slide 4 that we are sharing with you the long-term direction that we are taking our business and the performance we expect to deliver. As we shared before, we're serving a stable market that grows at 1% to 3% a year. We're looking to accelerate this growth to 2% to 4% on our base business and another 100 basis points with automation. With our Reinvent SEE operating system, on 3% to 5% organic sales growth, we expect to deliver over 30% operating leverage and create world-class returns.
Let's turn to Slide 5, our movie reel slide, which pictorially shows some new solutions powered by our iconic brands. You can see a play button on this slide, which is to encourage you to visit our website, where you will find current new stories with more to come. In 2020, approximately 63% of our sales were derived from packaging proteins, other foods, liquids and fluids, medical and life sciences.
Since March 2020, there's been an imbalance across the food industry with strong demand in the retail channel, offset by continued softness in food service from the stay-at-home pandemic environment. Food processors are working hard to meet increased retail demand, but they're still challenged with labor shortages. Our customers are focused on safety, productivity and labor shortages, and we are responding with automated solutions to solve those challenges. This has resulted in another strong quarter in food packaging equipment and volume growth in our retail formats.
In the fourth quarter, growth in retail formats and equipment was largely offset by continued declines in products with high exposure to food service. We expect this market segment to recover later this year and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of that recovery with new sustainable innovations. For example, for proteins, we've optimized materials and processes for our Cryovac barrier bags to make them recyclable while maintaining our industry-leading standards for food preservation and food safety. For liquids and fluids, we have automated solutions that disrupt rigid containers and expand our bag and box offerings for soups, sauces, condiments and beverages. The combination of our automated equipment, service, barrier bags and pouches and packaging process extend shelf life, minimizes material waste and lowers total cost of ownership.
Approximately 37% of our sales serve e-commerce, retail, logistics, electronics and industrials. Sales to e-commerce, retail and logistics were up double digits in the second half of 2020. Automated equipment, including the portfolio acquired from Automated Packaging Systems, mailers, Bubble Wrap inflatables and our new paper-based solutions were our fastest-growing portfolios in 2020.
In Q4, we also experienced increased demand for our temperature assurance packaging solution that ensures the safe and secure distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. In 2021, we expect continued growth from our e-commerce and fulfillment solutions, particularly the offerings designed to automate the packaging process, minimize waste and increase throughput. It was encouraging to see in the fourth quarter, our sales to the industrial sector were up modestly, largely due to strength in consumer electronics and a rebound in automotive.
Now turning to Slide 6 for an update on our SEE automated solutions strategy, which is driving growth for the next phase of our Reinvent SEE business transformation. You can see on this chart that we expect equipment sales to grow more than 15% in 2021 to over $250 million. Our pipeline for automated equipment continues to strengthen, and we are confident in our organic target of over $500 million by 2025. When you factor in a 3x-plus solutions multiplier, including growth in parts and service from the installed base and the flow-through of materials, these results in a $5 billion-plus potential opportunity over the 10-year equipment life cycle.
As I mentioned before, we are solving our customers' most critical needs for safety, productivity and labor scarcity with our touchless automated solutions. We are prioritizing these projects to those that create less than a 3-year payback for our customers. With SEE automation, we're taking an integrated solutions approach by eliminating waste, simplifying the process, removing people from harm's way and automating. Our customers are recognizing the tremendous value we are creating by integrating our full system. We brought new solutions to market, and we'll continue to do that for our customers and our own operations as we lead the way to a more touchless digital environment.
Let me now turn to Slide 7 and share how we are successfully navigating through this pandemic. Our local, regional and corporate crisis management teams remain active, and business continuity plans are still in effect. We've been proactive with our zero-harm mentality. And thanks to the dedication of our people, we've had minimal disruption to our operations.
We are investing in digital capabilities and finding new ways to do business online. Our investments in smart packaging and digital printing are unlocking new growth opportunities by enabling our customers to increase their brand equity, enhance consumer experiences and create significant supply chain efficiencies.
I'll now pass the call to Jim to review our results in more detail."
382724,700518579,2200645,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ted. Let's turn to Slide 8 for a review of our year-over-year net sales growth by region. In the fourth quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 3% as reported and 3% in constant dollars. In constant dollars, North America, our largest regio",1823,"Thank you, Ted. Let's turn to Slide 8 for a review of our year-over-year net sales growth by region. In the fourth quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 3% as reported and 3% in constant dollars. In constant dollars, North America, our largest region, representing 58% of our sales, increased 3%. South America was up 13%, largely due to U.S. dollar index pricing and volume growth of 4%. Constant dollar sales in Asia Pacific were up 4%, and EMEA was up 1%.
On Slide 9, you can see our full year 2020 results. Net sales totaled $4.9 billion, up 2% as reported and 4% in constant dollars. Similar to the quarterly results, we delivered constant dollar sales growth across all regions and exceeded our most recent outlook by approximately $50 million, most of which was driven by volume growth in protective. Starting in the first quarter 2021, for reporting purposes, we will be consolidating North America and South America into one region, the Americas. This will align with our new one Sealed Air regional structure and organizational changes that went into effect in January.
On Slide 10, here, you see our organic sales volume and pricing trends by segment and region. In the fourth quarter, overall volume increased 3%. Protective volumes accelerated into year-end, delivering 7% growth, up from 4% growth last quarter. As expected, we also saw modest volume growth in food after a couple of quarters of low single-digit percent declines.
By region, volumes in North America, South America and APAC were up 4%. Protective volumes were up across all regions due to e-commerce and fulfillment strength and growth in our industrial portfolios in North America and APAC. Food delivered volume growth in North America and South America due to strength in retail formats and equipment. This volume growth in food was offset by declines in EMEA and APAC where food service softness and COVID-related restrictions outweighed solid retail demand.
On Slide 11, we present our year-over-year consolidated sales and adjusted EBITDA bridges for the fourth quarter and full year. As mentioned, sales in the quarter were up 3% with volume contributing $42 million to the top line. For the full year, sales were up 2%, including $22 million in volume growth and $172 million contribution from acquisitions, of which $166 million was from Automated Packaging Systems that closed in August 2019.
Currency translation negatively impacted 2020 sales by $82 million or about 2%, mostly due to year-over-year declines in Latin American currencies and the euro. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $279 million increased $8 million or 3% compared to last year with margin down 10 basis points to 20.8%. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA of $1.051 billion increased $86 million or 9% compared to 2019 with margin increasing 130 basis points to 21.4%. Higher volume contributed $12 million to adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. For the year, volume had a negative $14 million impact on adjusted EBITDA due to unfavorable product mix in both reporting segments.
Reinvent SEE benefits totaled $17 million in the quarter and $118 million in 2020. We've had a positive impact on price/cost spread and operating costs throughout the year. In the quarter, as anticipated, price/cost spread was $7 million unfavorable due to higher input costs. For the full year, price/cost spread contributed $28 million to adjusted EBITDA. Half of this favorability was driven by Reinvent SEE actions.
Operating costs included labor and other non raw material cost inflation of about $13 million in the quarter and $53 million for the full year. We incurred $3 million of year-over-year incremental spending related to COVID-19 in the fourth quarter and $16 million for the year. These impacts were mostly offset by lower travel spending with the remote work environment. In addition, Reinvent SEE productivity benefits totaled $15 million in the quarter and $104 million for the year. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.89. This compared to $0.78 in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $3.19, an increase of 13% over 2019. The adjusted tax rate in 2020 was 24.5%, down from 26% in 2019. This year's lower tax rate was favorably impacted by the new U.S. GILTI regulations, which were issued in the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 12. Here, we provide an update on Reinvent SEE, which continues to progress and is driving structural operating leverage in the business. Our Reinvent commercial work stream is robust and providing a solid platform for driving revenue growth in the markets we serve. As Ted mentioned, we are seeing strong growth in our automated equipment order pipeline and look forward to capturing those opportunities in 2021.
In 2020, as mentioned, we realized $118 million of year-over-year overall Reinvent SEE benefits to adjusted EBITDA. In 2021, we now expect $65 million of additional benefits with roughly 50% flow-through from actions taken in 2020. Reinvent SEE benefits realized since late 2018 when the transformation was launched are now expected to be approximately $355 million, $105 million higher than originally targeted. Cash restructuring payments associated with Reinvent SEE were $74 million in 2020 with an estimated $40 million remaining in 2021 as Reinvent SEE transitions from a restructuring phase to the company's continuous improvement business operating system. The total cash cost of Reinvent SEE is now expected to be approximately $205 million, which is $10 million less than what we originally expected.
Turning to segment results on Slide 13, starting with food. In the fourth quarter, food net sales increased modestly on a constant dollar basis to $757 million. Net sales for the year were up 1% in constant dollars to just over $2.8 billion. This performance was in line with our guidance. Equipment, parts and service sales, which currently represent about 8% of the food segment, were up 11% in the quarter and 8% for the year. Across the globe, our meat processing customers are upgrading aged assets to improve efficiency, enhance employee safety and reduce labor dependency in their plants. We are seeing meaningful capacity expansions to support market growth, particularly in South America for exports, and in Asia and Eastern Europe, where countries are increasing domestic production of multiple types of proteins.
Cryovac materials, which comprise the remainder of the food segment sales, were down approximately 1% in the quarter. While the trend was still below prior year levels, it improved 200 basis points from the third quarter. Growth in retail applications, which accounted for just over 40% of food sales in the fourth quarter, was largely offset by continued declines in barrier bags and pouches.
Adjusted EBITDA in food of $170 million in the quarter was essentially flat compared to last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased $18 million to $648 million with margins up 110 basis points to 22.9%. Our full year performance was attributable to Reinvent SEE productivity benefits and favorable price/cost spread. This was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and currency translation.
On Slide 14, we highlight results from our protective segment. In constant dollars, protective net sales increased 7% to $584 million in the quarter and 9% to $2.1 billion for the full year. This performance exceeded the guidance we've provided on our third quarter earnings call. In the fourth quarter, volume trends in both North America and APAC accelerated to 8% and 11%, respectively. EMEA volume turned positive for the first time in 2020, delivering 2% growth. The segment's growth was largely driven by double-digit increases in e-commerce and fulfillment. It was also encouraging to see favorable volume trends in industrials in both North America and APAC. Keep in mind, approximately 55% of our protective sales are derived from industrial end markets, and the remaining 45% is coming from e-commerce and fulfillment.
Adjusted EBITDA of $115 million increased $8 million or 8% in the quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA of $408 million was up $58 million or 17%. In 2020, margin was up 130 basis points to 19.6%. Protective's full year performance was attributable to Reinvent SEE benefits and contribution from the Automated Packaging Systems acquisition, partially offset by unfavorable product mix.
Now let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 15. In 2020, we generated $556 million of free cash flow compared to $321 million in 2019 and our previously provided guidance of approximately $450 million. The significant year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, the impact of the Novipax settlement last year, lower Reinvent SEE restructuring and associated payments and lower CapEx due to pandemic-related project delays.
Trade working capital was a source of cash at $14 million in 2020, relatively consistent with 2019. Our trade working capital, which includes advance payments, the conversion cycle for this was better than anticipated and improved approximately 2 days compared to 2019. This was largely attributable to an improvement in days sales outstanding. Our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow for the year was very strong at 53%.
Slide 16 highlights our net leverage, liquidity and debt maturity profile. We ended the year with leverage at 3.1x on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis. This is down from 3.6x at the end of 2019. With a strong balance sheet, $1.7 billion of liquidity and no debt maturities until August 2022, we have good financial flexibility to support growth of the business.
On Slide 17, we outlined our capital allocation strategy. We ended 2020 with an ROIC of approximately 15%, which is top quartile in the packaging industry and well above our weighted average cost of capital. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to maintain a strong balance sheet while driving continued attractive returns on invested capital. We are investing in capacity to support growth initiatives, and we're accelerating innovation with disruptive products and technologies. Approximately 40% of our organic CapEx is currently focused on growth, including breakthrough production processes, automation and digital.
SEE ventures includes selective minority investments in early-stage technologies focused on automation, digital and sustainability. These investments will help accelerate our strategy and will complement our internal innovation efforts across Sealed Air. For example, in the fourth quarter, we increased our investment to $8 million in Plastic Energy, an industry-leading start-up company with advanced recycling technology. And in early 2018, we invested a similar amount in Pharmapacks, a leading e-commerce enablement platform. We recorded a $15 million gain on this investment in the fourth quarter. This gain was treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted EBITDA in the quarter.
Regarding shareholder returns, we paid cash dividends in 2020 of $100 million, which represented a dividend payout ratio of 20%. And starting in the third quarter, we reinitiated share repurchases with 821,000 shares acquired in the second half of 2020 at a cost of $33 million.
Let me now turn the call over to Chris to provide our outlook for 2020. Welcome, Chris. It's great to have you on board."

It's an exciting time to join the Sealed Air team, and I'm happy to be here. Since joining in early January, I have spent a great deal of time working with Ted and the team, executing my 100-day game plan focused on people, process and results. I have met virtually with many of our leaders and teams around the world and had the opportunity to tour a few of our facilities in a safe way. There is more to learn and many more people to meet and places to visit. But in my short time, you could see the passion and commitment by the Sealed Air team to drive success and continue to execute to exceed customer expectations.
So let's turn to Slide 18 to review our 2021 outlook. We anticipate net sales to increase 4.5% to 6.5% as reported or $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. On a constant dollar basis, net sales are expected to increase 2.5% to 4.5%, driven by favorable volume and price in both food and protected. We expect food to deliver 2% to 4% constant dollar growth and protected to deliver 3% to 5%. Automated equipment and sustainable solutions are expected to drive growth in food and protected in 2021. In food, we expect the retail channel and protein exports to remain strong. We also expect the food service industry to recover as we progress through the year. In protective, we expect continued growth in e-commerce and fulfillment and the industrial end markets to gradually improve. We expect favorable currency translation in 2021 sales and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2%, mainly due to the euro and the Australian and New Zealand dollars.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $1.1 billion to $1.13 billion. At the midpoint, this would imply a modest increase in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to 2020. Margins are being impacted by higher input costs and continued COVID-related expenses. To help alleviate higher raw material and freight costs, we initiated market price increases in Q4 with more actions going into effect this quarter. Also keep in mind that our formulas in food North America are typically on a 6-month lag and are expected to turn favorable midyear.
We expect adjusted EPS to be $3.25 to $3.40. Given the current impact of higher material costs and the timing of pricing actions, many driven by formulas, we expect 2021 adjusted EPS to be split approximately 45% first half, 55% second half versus what we realized in 2020, which was a split of 47% first half, 53% second half. Our outlook assumes approximately 157 million average shares outstanding and an adjusted tax rate of 26% to 27%. The higher adjusted tax rate is primarily due to the absence of a valuation reserve release that benefited the rate in 2020.
For free cash flow, we expect to generate $500 million to $550 million. This is net of capital expenditures, approximately $210 million or 4% of sales and Reinvent SEE restructuring associated payments of approximately $40 million. The year-over-year anticipated decline in free cash flow is largely attributable to higher trade working capital from sales growth and higher employee bonus payments in 2021 given the strong performance in 2020.
Let me now pass the call to Ted for closing remarks."

If you go to a grocery store, we all see it, you see people packing next to you. And those packers, we're already working with customers and some of the start-ups on where e-groceries is going. So what is that doing to the packaging format, to your question. Bringing our Darfresh line, Darfresh On Tray, how do we actually package that, that's now by a pick and pack, but actually, that's going to be going into cobots and robots. So we actually see that format moving quite aggressively.
Also, we see the market still moving on to sustainability. Those secular trends of automation, fresh food and food safety is going to even drive harder as we go into those formats in the grocery stores. So our Cryovac leading barrier bag right now, we're working on new barrier materials that not only are lighter in weight. We're looking with recyclability with our investment with Plastic Energy. They want the PVdC out. So we've actually new designs already coming in that we're going to use chlorine-free material because the chemical recycling plants don't want that. We had an announcement with Plastic Energy and Tesco. And so we're leading the way in that. So these new formats, we think we're well positioned for.
In the fourth quarter and going next year, we're dealing with still the pandemic, so that shift is happening as we speak, but we definitely think there's an opportunity. The other part of our protein side as we talk about that bag and the box and pouches. We are definitely seeing that slowed with the QSRs. But we are -- that's where we're seeing a lot of opportunity to actually go into the liquids and fluids business.
So actually excited. We think we have a lot of opportunity. We've got to get through some of these headwinds with our markets in the pandemic, but we think we're well positioned in the food side of our business for that new format that just seeing in The Wall Street Journal today, it's heartening, saying that they think this pandemic will be with us forever. So once again, we're planning for the worst, hoping for the best. But we think our portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of that new normal that's coming in 2021 and beyond."

I know you're new to the name. When we talk about Reinvent benefits, we're talking about those productivity actions that we're driving within our factories. And we talked in the call about how we delivered $118",264,"Jeff, this is Jim Sullivan. Let me clarify. I know you're new to the name. When we talk about Reinvent benefits, we're talking about those productivity actions that we're driving within our factories. And we talked in the call about how we delivered $118 million last year. And this year, we're coming down to $65 million. Our plan is to continue to drive those benefits at a level higher than our inflation. If you look at our wage inflation, across the enterprise, it's roughly $50 million. So what you're seeing that kind of offsets part of those Reinvent benefits is that. So the flow-through, if you look at the benefits and the inflation, it's about $15 million, not the full $65 million.
Now having said that, I've been around now Sealed Air for 1.5 years. And I continue to be very encouraged by the continuous improvement culture, the high-performance culture that we have here in Sealed Air. And I think we thought after the 3-year restructuring transition that we would just kind of be on par. It would be an inflation fighter, not add value, if you will, above inflation. I think that we're well positioned. The pipeline for Reinvent is very strong. We're saying $65 million next year. Hopefully, we beat that. We've got -- 50% of that is flow-through from actions we've already taken in 2020. So we're well positioned to deliver that. And we'll continue to drive actions that will allow us to add more to it in 2022 and beyond. Hopefully, that helps clarify a little bit of the math."

I guess my question is around volume growth and translating that into your operating leverage target and return on capital, if you could give us a target there. So Ted, if you could talk about some of the key platforms that you're working on. Darfresh On Tray, you're mentioning to Ghansham, some of the sustainability-driven products. What would you say you're expecting in terms of growth for those products in 2021? And how does the growth in these products and e-commerce factor into your operating leverage target, which is now 30% plus? I think a couple of years ago, last time you talked about it, it was more like a 40%. And in turn, we like the return on capital discussion that you have in the deck and how you calculated it. What kind of target, if you have 30% plus in terms of ROI -- in terms of margin, what kind of ROIC target should we expect over the next 2 to 3 to 4 years?"

A lot in that question, but very thoughtful. So I'll try to unpack it and actually build off of Jeff's question that Jim went through the financials because it ties into the operating model that we talked about on Slide 4. So what we're go",824,"Thanks, George. A lot in that question, but very thoughtful. So I'll try to unpack it and actually build off of Jeff's question that Jim went through the financials because it ties into the operating model that we talked about on Slide 4. So what we're going into, and we're looking at very current state of what happened in the fourth quarter, the operating leverage in the fourth quarter was actually below the target of where we've been driving, less than 20% operating leverage. But for the year, 77%.
So well, what's going on with our portfolio in this tumultuous market, we've had huge spikes, but then we've also had parts of the portfolio go down. So now if we look at operating leverage, take a look at our top 3 product lines. So if we look at food, what's going on with bags? What's going on with bags is affected by all those restaurants being shut down. Bags are flat to down. Our highest-margin product, so there's actually a deleverage on the portfolio. There's a lot of things that are going on. Great progress with Darfresh On Tray. Great progress with some of the sustainable products. But if you look at net-net in the fourth quarter, and then we had some rising input costs. Did we get ahead on the pricing that we talked about?
So if you look at that in the quarter, then you play that through to 2021, you say, huh, that leverage in the midpoint is below that 30%. It's at 25% because we've got to get through this first half by what we know in the pandemic. So we look on the protective side. Wow, how many -- I've been here 3 years now and seeing that growth, can you grow that protective? Yes, we can. Yes, we will. Well, we're dealing with our largest product line in that portfolio. It's dependent on the industrial rebound with our Instapak.
So deleveraging, really heavy. So we have all these ups, and with that major down on both sides of the business is delevering. So is it where we want to be for the year, 70% -- 7%, that's good. So what we wanted to give you was where we're taking the business and where this engine is gone. So we left out a 3-year plan. And that's what we're going to do. We're going to put it with very stable markets. Though even in the pandemic, some go way up and some go down. So net-net, we think we can beat that stable market that we serve. We think with our innovations and sustainability, we can take that to 2 to 4. And the excitement is where we're taking automation to take that to 3 to 5.
Well then, to the second part of your question, you asked about leverage. ""Hey, Ted, when you came in, you did your assessment of this business. Hey, you thought you could leverage at 40%."" Well, we did pretty well. We actually -- if you look at our last 3-year average, we leveraged way over that 40% to 50%, but we also had restructuring in that number. So we're now building off a base of almost 260 basis points higher than we started. And there is a greater sign next to the 30%, but that's where we think the model is going.
And then to your last part of your question was on ROIC. We shared with you day 1 when we got here, we are going to change the guardrails on this business. We are going to measure leverage. And I believe it. And this is part of the mantra, ""You get what you measure."" So we put operating leverage in there. It's all the way through. But we also put in ROIC, day 1, all of our investments, the capital. We look at a return on investment, and you can now see, you get what you measure. Through this tumultuous market, our ROIC has moved up.
But George, the last part of your question, ""Where are you going to take your ROIC?"" Our investors know that we're way over our cost of capital, want to put assets on this engine and generate value. And that's where we mentioned in there. That's what we're driving. This high-powered value creation engine is going to be driving these assets that we put on place far above our cost of capital. But it's not about taking that to 15 to 17. It's driving growth on this engine, and that's where we're taking it. So again, why on Slide 3, we feel confident. The engine is in place. It's moving despite the tumultuous markets that we face. We feel confident, and we wanted our investors to know this is where we're going. And we're quite confident we're going to get there despite the market that we're dealing with really hard in the first half of 2021."

But basically, you're exactly right. It's more than just resin. As we've -- since I've been here, we've been talking about resin. Our team does an excellent job, and part of our Reinvent is to really focus with multiple different suppliers on the resin. And we have specialty resins. So how can we beat the market, and we think we will do that. But what has happened with resins, there's no secret. It has gone up significantly with what the chemical industry is doing. So we've been ahead of that on the price, especially with protective. We went out with price in the fourth quarter.
But the second part of your -- and also the formulas are coming. We have that 6-month lag there. But we believe we're ahead of it. We are the leader in the market. We can lead with price. We don't talk to our customers about price. We are actually embedded with our customers and actually bringing automation in on how we can solve this problem together. So I just want to highlight that.
But the second part of your question, you're exactly right. We're seeing it beyond. It's the freight costs that have gone up significantly and other input costs. So we're managing that. Again, we're using price to stay ahead of it. But the issue that we have to really work with our customers is look at maybe different product portfolio and look at automation. But the other piece that we're not giving up with this rising input cost is the sustainability side.
So we're also continuously looking at our material change on recycled content. Is it more challenging? Absolutely. But believe on the price side, we're going to lead. We're going to get our costs right, and we're going to be driving automation. And by the way, automation internally as well as externally, we think we're going to be ahead, get through this. It's tough, though. Right now, fourth quarter, first half of 2021, you're exactly right. It's a tough market on there on input costs. I don't know, Jim, if you want to add anything to that. Or..."

I mean I think the other piece of the was question what are we expecting in terms of the back half of the year, the current environment or are we expecting relief? As everyone knows, the cost curve on inputs across 2020 was increasing across the year. So as we plan the business, we're certainly planning for the materials, the resins to be at a high level that they are now, and we're initiating the price actions that Ted talked about. We're very comfortable, even in this environment, we can manage the spread, the price/cost spread very well. Over the course of our range of guidance, certainly, on the low end, you could see input cost exceeding our ability to price. And a big part of that is timing. How is the timing of the raw materials coming in, and how quickly can we get the price in place? Many of our pricing -- much of our pricing in North America is formula-based on the food side. So we won't get that right away. But certainly, we have mechanisms to deal with it.
And then the final piece of the question was on other raw materials. So think about resin, polyethylene representing about 50% of our overall resin buy, and resins in total are about half of our total input cost. The other half is only inflating in low single digits. So again, the takeaway, I think, Ted, is what you said, we're managing both the input side and the price side very well."

Any handholding you could provide in terms of price/cost in the next few quarters? How material it would be relative, let's say, fourth quarter?

As you noted, Phil, we did have negative price/cost spread in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, it was about $7 million. And we would expect that the first half of the year will continue to be a little bit challenged that way. Which is why when Chris talked about the adjusted EPS guidance for the full year, he said kind of expect 45% coming in the first half of the year and 55% in the back half of the year. We're thinking about that cadence of price/cost spread being a little bit more challenged in the first half as we get pricing into the business.
Right now, volumes are very robust. We feel good about our ability to get price. We're not doing anything than anyone else isn't doing. And as Ted said, we're focused on doing what we can to differentiate ourselves and really be more value sellers than just pass-through resin. And then the only other thing I would say is we continue to drive Reinvent above our inflation. We got $15 million spread as we talked about earlier. We're going to continue to drive that. And I think there's some upside there that will help us mitigate some of the raw material pressures that we see."

I just want to make sure because our customers are listening right now. We are going to handle this together with them. And if we even have to move the portfolio, so I do think we're very different than our competitors. We have a very unique portfolio that we can respond in a much better way on this pricing situation with resins than we've ever done before.

So my answer to that would be we're reinventing on how we grow the business. So the restructuring side on the cost, you're exactly right. But the portfolio change is a big part of this difference that where we're going. We're moving from being a product-driven business to be a market-driven business. So 2020 was a pivotal year for us. That portfolio shifted dramatically. So we're pointing that portfolio to the secular trends in the industry that we believe are going to be there post-pandemic. What does that mean? Automation. How do you put more stuff in a package more effectively, more efficiently, safely, securely, that is what we're focused on. So we think that can drive our portfolio across food, product, across the region significantly, and that's what we're focused on.
But we have to do it more efficiently. So we've invested -- part of our investments have been in innovation and our R&D. And as Jim even mentioned, we're giving visibility, what we're doing with SEE ventures. If we can't develop it fast enough, we have that innovation rate on top of the team, and we're going to move. We're going to move this portfolio faster to innovate faster to satisfy those secular trends. And that's what the exciting part of this packaging business, it's a stable market. It's us up -- it's up to us to move the organization, because you use the word organization a lot, to move this organization to where the growth is. And I think 2020 was a pivotal year to show us that we can do it. It takes time.
And by the way, I'm dealing with our scientists and all the time and getting FDA approval. Our products are unique. We're testing. If you came to our innovation center, we're testing things, but we're doing it now virtually. But we've got to move faster. So the innovations is one of the keys that I believe is that next phase that's happening in 2020, but we got to drive it even faster to support that 3% to 5% growth that we're going after. I definitely believe we're going to get it.
And the final piece that I will mention, it's got to be sustainable. So some of the churn, and that's a term we use internally, why are you seeing some of the growth for the innovations? And this is where our team says that I'm too tough on them. It's because the churn is we're now actually bringing sustainable solutions like Bubble Wrap on demand. The Bubble Wrap, if you looked at our facilities, the dramatic shift on that is now we have Bubble Wrap in our portfolio with 90% recycled content. We did that in less than a year. So that's part of our Bubble Wrap portfolio, but it's fully redesigned with recycled content. So I'm quite excited about that 3% to 5% growth that we can make and leverage it at over 30%."

So if we look at that portfolio in protective, in e-commerce, we talked about. I just want to say it again, e-commerce is affecting food, too. But for right now, let's go to your question. So the industrial piece, as you highlighted, the 55%, that said, negative deleverage that we've had. We had slight growth in the fourth quarter, which is good. I have the example on here, if we look at our movie reel slide. What's going on with industrial? We saw automotive. We have seen automotive turn. We haven't seen it turn at the same levels, but we did see positive.
So here's an example of what does automation mean, and this is actually a tire solution. So what are we going to do? We're going to go package tires. We're going to be working with the customers, which, by the way, they get huge penalties because those tires roll off e-commerce conveyor systems. So we designed a shrink tunnel. We're going to put the tires in the shrink tunnel. By the way, it's a few hundred thousand dollars. But we were going to do even more. We're going to put the full system in for a couple of million dollars. So we're going to wrap those tires. By the way, they're going to have paper and plastic so they don't roll off. We're going to shrink them and we're going to wrap them, so they won't -- they don't want to have anybody who know it's inside. And so the materials, they're going to flow through that are going to be at 2x the cost of the system.
So that's a solution that we're bringing right now as we speak into that industrial automotive segment. So we see that picking back up. And boy, does that leverage nicely. Just like our bags business, that's the industrial side of our business leverages quite nicely. So that's a link of industrial with e-commerce, et cetera. So the industrial piece is beyond that. We've also seen a pickup on the electronics, that's in the industrial side.
Also on the protective, you see that we're kind of merging on the market. As we do with our Autobag system, we're actually using the Autobag system now to package food. So it's in our protective versus food portfolio. But again, it's -- I'm talking about where that automation is coming in. And by the way, on the top of the slide, it's personal. We have pet care up there. For all of you in staying at home, that is an area that really had a pickup in the business with pet care. Pet food, pet accessories, that's going. We're packaging that stuff that you're getting at home right now. But that's going through our side pouch Autobag system. So just giving you a little color and flavor. We're going after that industrial piece. It's coming back. But right now, in 2020, it was a wait on 2020, an opportunity in 2021.
So with that, operator, that's the close for our call today. I want to thank everyone. I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. And thanks again, Jim. I know you'll be watching. And Chris, really excited to have you on board. So thanks, everyone. And we'll see you next quarter. Take care."

As you can see on Slide 3, our purpose, we are in the business to protect to solve critical packaging challenges and to make our world better than we found it. Our purpose is clear and continues to guide us. 
On today's call, I'll recap our first quarter 2021 performance. I'll share how we are managing through the current environment, how our global markets are evolving and the growth opportunities we see ahead. We're leading the way with automation, digital and sustainability. Chris will review our financial results and outlook in more detail. I will end with closing remarks before opening the call for Q&A. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 for a review of our first quarter 2021 results. Net sales increased 8% with strength in e-commerce, automated equipment, food retail and industrials. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6%. Volume growth and Reinvent SEE productivity improvements more than offset material inflation and supply disruption costs. EBITDA margins were 21.2%, a modest decline compared to last year. Our operating leverage of 16% was impacted by the inflationary environment and timing of our price actions and formula pass-throughs. This near-term pressure is expected to continue through the second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.78, up 7%. We generated free cash flow of $36 million, which compares to the use of cash of $8 million in the first quarter last year. We are raising our 2021 outlook across all key metrics to reflect our first quarter results, top line momentum and operating leverage improvement in the second half. 
Looking beyond 2021, on Slide 5. We want to reiterate the objectives of our SEE operating model. Automation, digital and sustainability is expected to drive above-market growth. Our organic sales target is 3% to 5% or approximately 200 basis points above our addressable market growth. We serve a stable market that historically has grown 1% to 3% a year. With innovation and sustainability, we expect to accelerate growth on our basis business to 2% to 4% and add another 100 basis points of growth with automation. Our operating leverage target is over 30%, which translates into adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% to 7% per year. With our capital allocation strategy in place, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share growth of greater than 10% and free cash flow conversion greater than 50%. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, our movie real slide, which pictorially shows some of our new solutions powered by our iconic brands. You can see a play button on the slide, which is to encourage you to visit our website, where you will find exciting success stories. Our automated and sustainable packaging solutions maximize food safety, protect goods, minimize waste and deliver savings to our customers through increased productivity. 
In the first quarter, we had strong growth across our protective end markets, led by e-commerce, retail and consumer goods, logistics, medical and life sciences and the recovery in industrials. We're leading a dramatic shift to a touchless, automated environment in fulfillment centers, resulting in double-digit growth in our automated solutions portfolio further enabled by our APS acquisition. In consumer goods and logistics, we're capitalizing on global e-commerce growth. In medical and life sciences, we're playing a key role in the global COVID-19 vaccine distribution and benefiting from growth in online shipments of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. Our industrial markets, including general manufacturing, electronics and transportation has gained momentum since year-end, particularly in Asia Pacific and Europe, where we have a high exposure to electronics and automotive end markets. 
In the Americas, we experienced favorable trends despite the winter storm supply disruptions. There continues to be an imbalance across the food industry, with strong demand in the retail channel, offset by softness in food service. We were encouraged by our performance given the end market environment and the tough year-over-year comparable, particularly in North America. We saw strong growth in our automated equipment and favorable trends in retail applications across all proteins, including cheese and seafood. Going forward, we expect food service to recover at restaurants, sporting events, conferences and other large public venues reopen. 
On a global basis, our meat packing customers are investing in automation and materials that improve productivity, enhance employee safety and address their sustainability goals. We are at the table, staying connected online with our customers, demonstrating our new automated touchless and sustainable solutions. 
In Europe, we're gaining momentum with our industry-leading Cryovac barrier bags optimized for recyclability. We're experiencing an increase in demand from quick service restaurants. They're investing in new Cryovac auto pouch solutions for soups, sauces, condiments, wine and spirits. Our high-performance sustainable materials are integrated with automated equipment and services, disrupting the rigid container market. 
Now turning to Slide 7 for an update on SEE automation touchless solutions. Equipment, systems and services sales were up 18% in the quarter and accounted for 8% of our net sales. We are on track to achieve approximately $425 million or 12% growth in 2021, of which more than $250 million will come from equipment and systems. Our sales pipeline for automated equipment is strong, and we are confident in our organic target of over $500 million by 2025. When you factor in a 3x plus solutions multiplier, including growth in parts and service from the installed base and the flow-through of materials, this results in a $5 billion-plus potential growth opportunity over the 10-year solutions life cycle. We're working closely with our customers to prioritize projects to create less than a 3-year payback. We're creating tremendous value for our customers and are excited to lead the way to a more touchless digital environment. 
Now let me turn to Slide 8 and share how we're leading through this pandemic. We are investing in our own e-commerce platform to drive our transformation to a digitally driven world-class company. Our smart and intelligent packaging value proposition is enabled by our proprietary digital printing technology. This is enabling unique designs on high-speed packaging systems in multiple colors, food-grade ink and even invisible inks that with our unique SEE marks will enable blockchain tracking to billions of packages. Our vision is to digitally connect sustainable packages inside our facilities, to our customers and to consumers' homes through e-commerce. 
I will now pass the call to Chris to review our results in more detail. Chris?"

Food was flat in co",1349,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. 
In the first quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 8% as reported, up 6% in constant dollars. Food was flat in constant dollars versus last year on a tough comp, and Protective accelerated 14%. 
Our fastest-growing region was Asia Pacific, which delivered 12% constant dollar growth; EMEA increased 7%, which is the highest organic growth rate for the region in the last 4 years; and our largest region, the Americas, was up 4%. 
On Slide 10, you see organic sales volume and pricing trends by segment and by region. In the first quarter, overall volume growth was up 5%. Volumes in Food were flat with favorable trends in Asia Pacific and EMEA, offsetting a 2% decline in the Americas. Protective volumes were up 13%, with double-digit volume growth in all regions. 
As Ted indicated, on a global basis, strength in e-commerce, automation and food retail and improving trends in industrials more than offset softness in food service. 
Q1 price was favorable 1%, mainly due to U.S. dollar-based index pricing in Latin America. Most of the pricing actions corresponding to the current raw material and supply chain environment are taking hold in the second quarter, and formula pass-throughs largely in Food North America are just beginning to turn. 
On Slide 11, we present our consolidated sales and adjusted EBITDA walks for the first quarter. Having discussed sales results, let me comment on our adjusted EBITDA performance. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $268 million, up 6% compared to last year and margins of 21.2%, down 40 basis points. You can see on our EBITDA walk that higher volume and operational benefits offset higher input costs. 
Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $0.78 compared to $0.73 in Q1 2020. Our adjusted tax rate was 27.6%, essentially in line with last year's adjusted rate in the same period. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 155 million. 
Turning to Slide 12. Here, we provide an update on Reinvent SEE. In 2021, we remain on track to realize approximately $65 million of Reinvent SEE benefits, with roughly 50% flow-through from actions taken in 2020. Our commercial work stream is accelerating innovation and driving new customer wins in core and adjacent markets. As Ted noted, we are seeing strong growth in our equipment order pipeline in both Food and Protective. 
Turning to segment results on Slide 13, starting with Food. In Q1, Food net sales of $702 million were flat on a constant dollar basis, similar to the year-over-year trends we experienced in the fourth quarter. Cryovac back materials were down slightly due to low single-digit declines in barrier bags and pouches, which combined represents nearly 50% of segment sales and have the highest exposure to food service. This was offset by modest growth in case-ready and roll stock retail applications, which represents just over 40% of the segment. Equipment, parts and service sales, which accounts for approximately 7% of the segment, were up approximately 10% in the quarter. Our customers around the world are investing in their processing plants to upgrade aged assets and drive productivity. We are also seeing equipment opportunities in Asia and Eastern Europe, where emerging countries are focusing on domestic production of multiple types of proteins. Adjusted EBITDA in Food of $157 million in Q1 was essentially flat compared to last year, with margins at 22.3%, down 30 basis points given higher input costs and timing of pricing. 
On Slide 14, we highlight Protective segment results. In constant dollars, net sales increased 14% to $565 million. Fulfillment, which is largely driven by e-commerce growth, was up approximately 20% on a global basis with similar growth trends across all regions. Industrial was up high single digits, driven by end market strength in general manufacturing, electronics and automotive. We leveraged our broad portfolio and global scale to meet increasing demand despite supply disruptions. 
I also want to highlight approximately 55% of our Protective sales are derived from industrial end markets and the remaining 45% from fulfillment and e-commerce. Adjusted EBITDA of $110 million increased $17 million or 18% in Q1, with margins at 19.5%, up 30 basis points. 
Now let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 15. In the first 3 months of 2021, we generated $36 million of free cash flow compared to a use of cash of $8 million in the same period a year ago, largely driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, lower restructuring payments and a $24 million tax refund we received in the quarter associated with the retroactive application of the revised U.S. GILTI regulations. 
On Slide 16, we outline our capital allocation strategy. We will maintain a strong balance sheet while driving attractive returns on invested capital and supporting our profitable growth initiatives. On this slide, I want to highlight our organic growth investments. We are focusing our CapEx on breakthrough processes, automation, digital and sustainability. With SEE Ventures, we are investing in early-stage disruptive technologies and business models that are expected to accelerate our strategy and innovation efforts across Sealed Air. 
As it relates to returning capital to shareholders, in Q1, we were an active buyer of our stock. We repurchased 4 million shares for $177 million, reflecting confidence in our vision, strategy and execution. We have approximately $500 million for additional share buyback remaining under current Board authorization. And you can see in the takeaway, we updated our financial policy leverage ratio objective to be a 3.5x or below from previously communicated 3.5 to 4.0x. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 to review our updated 2021 outlook. We are raising our guidance across all key metrics, reflecting strong Q1 performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. For net sales, we now estimate $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion or 7% to 9% as reported growth and 6% to 8% in constant dollars. This compares to our previous guidance of $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion or constant dollar growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. The higher sales guidance reflects increased volume growth in Protective and additional price in both segments, given the current supply chain environment. 
In Food, we now expect constant dollar growth of 4% to 6% as compared to previous guidance of 2% to 4%. And in Protective, we now expect constant dollar growth of 8% to 10%, which compares to previous guidance of 3% to 5%. 
On a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA is now expected to grow 7% to 9%. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion, a $20 million increase at the midpoint from previously provided guidance. Higher sales from volume and price are expected to offset increased material and supply disruption costs. 
In terms of currency, we now expect favorable FX translation on 2021 sales and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5%. 
We are raising our 2021 outlook for adjusted EPS to $3.40 to $3.55, and we continue to expect approximately 45-55 first half, second half percentage split. Our outlook now assumes approximately 154 million average shares outstanding, a 3 million share reduction from our prior guidance, reflecting our share repurchases in the first quarter. We continue to estimate an adjusted tax rate of 26% to 27%. 
And lastly, our revised free cash flow outlook of $520 million to $570 million reflects the higher range for adjusted EBITDA. There is no change to our outlook for 2021 CapEx of approximately $210 million and Reinvent SEE restructuring associated payments of approximately $40 million. 
As you can see on this slide, we wanted to provide a few variables as it relates to our 2021 guidance range. The low end of our range would suggest a slower recovery in food service and supply chain headwinds persisting longer than anticipated. The high-end implies continued strength in equipment, e-commerce and food retail, along with an acceleration of the industrial rebound and overperformance of our SEE operating engine. 
With that, let me now pass the call back to Ted for closing remarks. Ted?"

And Chris, if you want to go through the bridge if we need to. As far as what surprised us, I actually have to say our European team, what's going on on e-commerce, exceeded expectation, extremely strong. E-commerce, it just continues to go. As we know in the pandemic, everybody is using e-commerce and your packages are showing up at home, and we continue to do quite well. Also, we saw with our medical pickup there with the vaccine, what we're doing on packaging, some really interesting solutions, pickup, that was stronger than anticipated. 
On the industrial side, we saw the industrial pickup in Europe. We saw a pickup in Asia. It's still flat to slightly down in the U.S. So we didn't see the industrial pickup, so that might tie into the second part of your question on the second half of the year. And then the real issue in Protective was automation. Really exciting, the penetration with APS and what that did. Our bookings are up significantly with our equipment. In APS, which is in the Protective side, so quite strong. 
And then to the second part of your question, we see that continuing for the second half of the year. We've got some challenges there, as you asked about pricing. We saw the pricing going up. While we saw our costs going up in the fourth quarter, we had price increases. We've already done 3. So what happened in the first quarter with Yuri and the supply chain with our input costs going up, definitely surprised us by kept going up. So we didn't get totally on top of all of the price on that, but we think we have opportunity to catch up. The second quarter, though, still going to be tough on the resin side, but net-net, quite pleased with how the Protective is working and actually quite excited. We think we even have more opportunities in the second half, especially with industrial coming back in the second half of the year. We think we see some strong growth continuing."

When we looked at the midpoint at what we communicated in February versus what we're communicating in May, take out that midpoint, $150 million. As you noted, given the top line beat in Protective in Q1 and our confidence, as Ted was commenting in terms of our full year, that increase on the volume side is all driven on protected. The other half of that increase of that $150 million reflects the pricing actions that have basically been already in place. And some of that spot pricing in terms of what happened real time, a good portion of that coming through our formula-based pricing, which we're starting to see the beginning of that being the early part of the second quarter here in April, going into May. So we're going to start seeing the benefits of that turn. However, just specific to the second quarter, one of the things that we wanted to highlight, as we did last time, was given the EPS range between first half and second half, given that material dynamic and, that said, we're still on track. Even though we had a good beat, feel very good about the first quarter in terms of our performance, and we're raising our full year guidance, that 45-55 split between first half and second half is what we still anticipate. Thanks for your questions."

So Ted, you had talked a lot about all the things you're doing on the Food side of the business and how the customer is excited about the automation solutions that you're bringing. Yet we're not yet seeing the volume growth in that segment. When do you think we'll see the Food volumes turn positively for Sealed Air over the course of 2021? And why haven't we been seeing it so far? 
And then for both you and Chris, if we look at Slide 17, and we talk about the revenue guide increase, which is $150 million, there's only about a $20 million improvement in EBITDA, which is a low relative incremental margin. Why wouldn't we see an incremental margin pickup on the $150 million that's more commensurate with the 30%-plus that you typically target, especially since you said the revenue growth was coming from Protective where margins have been surprising on the upside and pricing, which is pure margin?"

I was, I think, a bunch in there, but I'll try to unpack piece. And Chris, you can work. First of all, let's talk about what we're seeing in Food. And if you look -- stay on Slide 17, where we asked, if we looked at the first quarter, what's going on with Food, we're still in this pandemic environment where the food service is down year-over-year as we're still in the stay-at-home environments with restaurants, et cetera, being down and also the quick service. We're seeing a pickup there, but that's still down. What that does to the portfolio on to leverage, our largest product lines, 2 of them, and actually, most profitable, are bags and pouches that are affected. So actually, in the quarter, the bags and pouches were actually slightly down. So it actually has a deleveraging effect. 
So to your question then on the second half of the business, as we see this recovery coming back, we would expect that would leverage quite nicely into that 30% leverage as we look for that growth. The top line question that you asked, when we increased our guidance, you're exactly right. We actually -- if you take the beat, that's a 13% leverage on the rates. So we've got to get through the second quarter. We got input costs going up substantially that we're trying to manage on the price. As you know, on the Food, we have that lag going back with our formula prices. So really, Q2 is going to be seen. Can we get that catch-up, where you will see that nice leverage coming through. But right now in the guide, we don't have the leverage returning until the second half of the year on the Food side."

That contribution margin on the incremental volume, we're seeing a nice flow-through, 30-plus percent. It's really the dynamic of the material headwind that is impacting the overall PG ratio, as we referred to it, in terms of the contribution of bottom line relative to the top line. 
And then as I mentioned before, in terms of that full year guidance of up $150 million, on the midpoint of sales, half being by volume, half being on the price side. That price side is good because it's going to -- it's offsetting material headwinds. So we're hoping to get the price/cost spread near 0 by the end of the year, and that's what our guidance reflects. And so that's how we're looking at the full year. The dynamic between us having our lowest quarter kind of in Q2, given the material headwinds and pricing starting to kick in, that's what kind of drives our 45-55 in terms of giving some color on first half, second half."

So I was hoping just on a volume basis across Food, Protective in the major geographies, you could kind of help us think about volumes relative to 2019 levels as we think about kind of how the company exits COVID. 
And the second part of the question is around the equipment kind of side and just maybe talk about your kind of sales pipeline and funnel just as you kind of are working on automation projects with customers and kind of the confidence level on the $250 million of equipment sales this year, which would seem to imply a pretty meaningful acceleration in growth over the next 3 quarters."

How about -- let me jump on my favorite subject of automation first, and then Chris could help going through some of your volume questions, if you can add some color there. Good questions, Adam. On the automation, is definitely something we're quite excited about. So if you look at Slide 7, we're trying to lay out where we're taking automation is what we're calling touchless. So as you highlighted, we have $250 million there. We feel pretty confident that we're on track with that. If you unpack the equipment just in the equipment piece, in the first quarter, that's almost up 30% on our equipment sales. And just looking at APS, which is the big driver of equipment, our APS bookings are up 60%. So we're seeing a very healthy pipeline, and we're seeing that through both Food and Protective. So that we feel quite confident, and you get to that $500 million, as you obviously see, we're expecting to double that business. So we think we're on track with that and the growth rates. And we see that to continue through the second quarter and in the second half of the year. 
I also want to highlight that it's really connected to the automation is that large fleet. We actually have -- it's an incredible number, over 100,000 pieces of equipment out there in our fleet. And as we're really changing the strategy to be an equipment company, really focused on the automation, it's also taking care of that fleet. So that other part is that parts and services out there and staying connected to that installed base, we think we have some more upside on that potential. 
So automation and where the final piece of your question, what does this mean to our customers? This is what the pandemic is really driving in this touchless system that we're talking about. How do we make a meat packing plan safer? How do we take people out of harm's way? How do we bring a much higher level of automation and security to the process? We had one of our largest meat packing customers with us in Simpsonville just last week, where we're actually showing our automated systems and the largest meat packing plant -- meat packaging plant in the world of how we're going to extend our touchless system into their plants. So really excited about the opportunity we have in equipment to keep that going and growing. And I'm very confident we're going to exceed the expectations of this chart."

And again, that gets back to our kind of full year guide, that volume increase, a part of our $150 million of our midpoint increase, half being volume, half being price.

So clearly, a pretty volatile environment, just thinking of material inflation starting in the fourth quarter of last year really continuing through April. We're hopeful that we've seen a little bit of steadiness in terms of how we're currently thinking about it. Our full year guidance assumes things start to level off. We entered the year  anticipating raw materials being up roughly 5%. Our latest is now we're thinking it's going to be in the 10% category. Although we all read about increases, 20%, 30%, 40% even significantly, a lot of what we buy, especially resins, which has not had as dramatic of an increase, although we are seeing it. 
Freight is the other item that we experienced in the quarter. We're doing everything we can to satisfy customer demand. So air freight, unfortunately, has been driving not only getting product to us but getting product to our customers, mostly on the input side, where we've incurred incremental roughly $3 million to $4 million of incremental cost to make sure we can satisfy the demand on whatever that's coming towards our way. But again, going back to the full year, we're assuming it starts to level off. We've reflected that in our updated guidance for the full year."

However, as we think about first half, second half, we expect that to rebound as we have full-fledged pricing in place with formula-based pricing as well as other price increases that we have announced and are starting to kick in. We expect that to turn in the second half of the year. And again, that really just drives us. What we're trying to provide is just color as how we're going into this year, thinking this 45-55 first half, second half split on EPS and just trying to provide investors kind of a good view of how we're managing through it. And I would suggest that our ability to manage through Q1 to deliver these kind of results. We know it's coming. It is coming, and we've been planning for it in terms of what the impact is on Q2.

So I now know that that was your prediction or maybe your predilection. So we see it going past April 1 on the cost side. 
But on the growth on Protective, what we're excited about is just highlight just a couple of things. One is our presence of where we are and how quickly we've been adapting to portfolio. We're growing our paper products at double digit. We've introduced new paper products that are going and doing quite well. Our equipment business, we already highlighted. Equipment business is up almost 30% just the equipment, and that's across the board, Food and Protective. We're also seeing, as we shifted, as I highlighted, to the different markets and the movement with the e-commerce. We're really being quite aggressive in getting the right product at the right price. And then I also got to bring in sustainability. We are definitely seeing the sustainable issue coming forward with, do you want paper, do you want plastics? Either one, how do we make that sustainable? So we're seeing some good opportunities. 
And the last one, that I think we even have more opportunity on the second half on the Protective side with the return of the industrial market. We did not see that as strong in the U.S. We saw it stronger in Europe. So we think we still have some upside opportunity. And that also ties into keeping that leverage going because that's where we leverage, both on the Food, getting the bags back and getting that Instapak volume back. We'll leverage quite nicely to get us back over that -- our leverage targets at the back end of the year."

Looking forward, just getting to your point in terms of our ability to operate and execute in this environment, recognizing we are a good cash generator, and our cash flow generation being able to, over time, reduce that debt, but at the same time, not lose sight of the investments we want to make, which, first and foremost, is invest in ourselves in terms of where the organic growth opportunities are. As you saw, we were an active buyer of our stock in the first quarter. Average share price is roughly $44 per share. We felt it was clearly a good opportunistic time to get back in the market, given how we ended the year on the cash side of the equation. But we don't want to -- we definitely don't want to lose sight of the fact that we've got a pipeline of opportunities on the M&A front. Earlier comment was made in terms of success of the APS acquisition, which absolutely has been. So the pipeline is there. We will continue to look at just where we are for availability, the end markets, the environment we're in, to deploy capital on M&A as we continue to grow. Would we maybe go above that leverage ratio? Potentially, but we want to work that back down the 3.5 or less over, I would call it, a reasonable period of time, call it, 12, 18 months. And that's why we felt it was appropriate, given the cash generation, all the benefits of Reinvent SEE and the progress being made over the past 2 or 3 years. We don't need to necessarily stay in this 3.5 to 4.0x. We can stay below 3.5 and continue to have a much -- a lot of availability to reinvest in ourselves as well as look at opportunities for M&A."

Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov.  
We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You will find important information on our use of these measures and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in our earnings release. Included in the appendix of today's presentation, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that correspond to the non-U.S. GAAP measures as we reference throughout the presentation.  
I will now turn the call over to Ted. Operator, please turn to the next slide. Ted?"

We had a solid start to the year despite the ongoing pandemic and winter storm Uri impacting the global supply chain. Our team has been doing a great job leveraging our supply network to ensure business continuity.  
As you can see on Slide 3, our purpose, we are in the business to protect, to solve critical packaging challenges and to make our world better than we found it. Our purpose is clear and continues to guide us.  
On today's call, I'll recap our first quarter 2021 performance. I'll share how we are managing through the current environment, how our global markets are evolving and the growth opportunities we see ahead. We're leading the way with automation, digital and sustainability. Chris will review our financial results and outlook in more detail. I will end with closing remarks before opening the call for Q&A.
Let's turn to Slide 4 for a review of our first quarter 2021 results. Net sales increased 8% with strength in e-commerce, automated equipment, food retail and industrials. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6%. Volume growth and Reinvent SEE productivity improvements more than offset material inflation and supply disruption costs. EBITDA margins were 21.2%, a modest decline compared to last year. Our operating leverage of 16% was impacted by the inflationary environment and timing of our price actions and formula pass-throughs. This near-term pressure is expected to continue through the second quarter. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.78, up 7%. We generated free cash flow of $36 million, which compares to the use of cash of $8 million in the first quarter last year. We are raising our 2021 outlook across all key metrics to reflect our first quarter results, topline momentum and operating leverage improvement in the second half.  
Looking beyond 2021, on Slide 5. We want to reiterate the objectives of our SEE operating model. Automation, digital and sustainability is expected to drive above-market growth. Our organic sales target is 3% to 5% or approximately 200 basis points above our addressable market growth. We serve a stable market that historically has grown 1% to 3% a year. 
With innovation and sustainability, we expect to accelerate growth on our basis business to 2% to 4% and add another 100 basis points of growth with automation. Our operating leverage target is over 30%, which translates into adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% to 7% per year.  With our capital allocation strategy in place, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share growth of greater than 10% and free cash flow conversion greater than 50%.  
Let's turn to Slide 6, our movie real slide, which pictorially shows some of our new solutions powered by our iconic brands. You can see a play button on the slide, which is to encourage you to visit our website, where you will find exciting success stories. Our automated and sustainable packaging solutions maximize food safety, protect goods, minimize waste and deliver savings to our customers through increased productivity.  
In the first quarter, we had strong growth across our protective end markets, led by e-commerce, retail and consumer goods, logistics, medical and life sciences and the recovery in industrials. We're leading a dramatic shift to a touchless, automated environment in fulfillment centers, resulting in double-digit growth in our automated solutions portfolio further enabled by our APS acquisition. 
In consumer goods and logistics, we're capitalizing on global e-commerce growth. In medical and life sciences, we're playing a key role in the global COVID-19 vaccine distribution and benefiting from growth in online shipments of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. Our industrial markets, including general manufacturing, electronics and transportation has gained momentum since year-end, particularly in Asia Pacific and Europe, where we have a high exposure to electronics and automotive end markets.
In the Americas, we experienced favorable trends despite the winter storm supply disruptions. There continues to be an imbalance across the food industry, with strong demand in the retail channel, offset by softness in food service. We were encouraged by our performance given the end market environment and the tough year-over-year comparable, particularly in North America. We saw strong growth in our automated equipment and favorable trends in retail applications across all proteins, including cheese and seafood. Going forward, we expect food service to recover at restaurants, sporting events, conferences and other large public venues reopen.  
On a global basis, our meat-packing customers are investing in automation and materials that improve productivity, enhance employee safety and address their sustainability goals. We are at the table, staying connected online with our customers, demonstrating our new automated touchless and sustainable solutions. In Europe, we're gaining momentum with our industry-leading Cryovac Barrier Bags optimized for recyclability. 
We're experiencing an increase in demand from quick service restaurants. They're investing in new Cryovac Auto Pouch solutions for soups, sauces, condiments, wine and spirits. Our high-performance sustainable materials are integrated with automated equipment and services disrupting the rigid container market. 
Now turning to Slide 7. For an update on SEE Automation touchless solutions. Equipment, systems and services sales were up 18% in the quarter and accounted for 8% of our net sales. We are on track to achieve approximately $425 million or 12% growth in 2021, of which more than $250 million will come from equipment and systems. Our sales pipeline for automated equipment is strong, and we are confident in our organic target of over $500 million by 2025. 
When you factor in a 3x plus solutions multiplier, including growth in parts and service from the installed base and the flow-through of materials, this results in a $5 billion-plus potential growth opportunity over the 10-year solutions life cycle.  We're working closely with our customers to prioritize projects to create less than a 3-year payback. We're creating tremendous value for our customers and are excited to lead the way to a more touchless digital environment.
Now let me turn to Slide 8 and share how we're leading through this pandemic. We are investing in our own e-commerce platform to drive our transformation to a digitally driven world-class company. Our smart and intelligent packaging value proposition is enabled by our proprietary digital printing technology. This is enabling unique designs on high-speed packaging systems in multiple colors, food-grade ink and even invisible links that with our unique SEE Marks will enable blockchain tracking to billions of packages. Our vision is to digitally connect sustainable packages inside our facilities, to our customers and to consumers' homes through e-commerce.
I will now pass the call to Chris to review our results in more detail. Chris?"

Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. In the first quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 8% as reported, up 6% in constant dollars. Food was flat in co",1348,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. 
In the first quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 8% as reported, up 6% in constant dollars. Food was flat in constant dollars versus last year on a tough comp, and Protective accelerated 14%.  Our fastest-growing region was Asia Pacific, which delivered 12% constant dollar growth; EMEA increased 7%, which is the highest organic growth rate for the region in the last 4 years; and our largest region, the Americas, was up 4%.
On Slide 10, you see organic sales volume and pricing trends by segment and by region. In the first quarter, overall volume growth was up 5%. Volumes in Food were flat with favorable trends in Asia Pacific and EMEA, offsetting a 2% decline in the Americas. Protective volumes were up 13%, with double-digit volume growth in all regions.  As Ted indicated, on a global basis, strength in e-commerce, automation and food retail and improving trends in industrials more than offset softness in food service.
Q1 price was favorable 1%, mainly due to U.S. dollar-based index pricing in Latin America. Most of the pricing actions corresponding to the current raw material and supply chain environment are taking hold in the second quarter, and formula pass-throughs largely in food, North America, are just beginning to turn.
On Slide 11, we present our consolidated sales and adjusted EBITDA walks for the first quarter. Having discussed sales results, let me comment on our adjusted EBITDA performance. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $268 million, up 6% compared to last year and margins of 21.2%, down 40 basis points. You can see on our EBITDA walk that higher volume and operational benefits offset higher input costs.
Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $0.78 compared to $0.73 in Q1 2020. Our adjusted tax rate was 27.6%, essentially in line with last year's adjusted rate in the same period. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 155 million.
Turning to Slide 12. Here, we provide an update on Reinvent SEE. In 2021, we remain on track to realize approximately $65 million of Reinvent SEE benefits, with roughly 50% flow-through from actions taken in 2020. Our commercial work stream is accelerating innovation and driving new customer wins in core and adjacent markets. As Ted noted, we are seeing strong growth in our equipment order pipeline in both Food and Protective.
Turning to segment results on Slide 13, starting with Food. In Q1, Food net sales of $702 million were flat on a constant dollar basis, similar to the year-over-year trends we experienced in the fourth quarter. Cryovac materials were down slightly due to low single-digit declines in barrier bags and pouches, which combined represents nearly 50% of segment sales and have the highest exposure to food service. This was offset by modest growth in case-ready and roll stock retail applications, which represents just over 40% of the segment. 
Equipment, parts and service sales, which accounts for approximately 7% of the segment, were up approximately 10% in the quarter. Our customers around the world are investing in their processing plants to upgrade aged assets and drive productivity. We are also seeing equipment opportunities in Asia and Eastern Europe, where emerging countries are focusing on domestic production of multiple types of proteins. Adjusted EBITDA in Food of $157 million in Q1 was essentially flat compared to last year, with margins at 22.3%, down 30 basis points given higher input costs and timing of pricing.
On Slide 14, we highlight Protective segment results. In constant dollars, net sales increased 14% to $565 million. Fulfillment, which is largely driven by e-commerce growth, was up approximately 20% on a global basis with similar growth trends across all regions. Industrial was up high single digits, driven by end market strength in general manufacturing, electronics and automotive. We leveraged our broad portfolio and global scale to meet increasing demand despite supply disruptions.
I also want to highlight approximately 55% of our Protective sales are derived from industrial end markets and the remaining 45% from fulfillment and e-commerce. Adjusted EBITDA of $110 million increased $17 million or 18% in Q1, with margins at 19.5%, up 30 basis points.
Now let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 15. In the first 3 months of 2021, we generated $36 million of free cash flow compared to a use of cash of $8 million in the same period a year ago, largely driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, lower restructuring payments and a $24 million tax refund we received in the quarter associated with the retroactive application of the revised U.S. GILTI regulations. 
On Slide 16, we outline our capital allocation strategy. We will maintain a strong balance sheet while driving attractive returns on invested capital and supporting our profitable growth initiatives. On this slide, I want to highlight our organic growth investments. We are focusing our CapEx on breakthrough processes, automation, digital and sustainability. With SEE Ventures, we are investing in early-stage disruptive technologies and business models that are expected to accelerate our strategy and innovation efforts across Sealed Air.
As it relates to returning capital to shareholders, in Q1, we were an active buyer of our stock. We repurchased 4 million shares for $177 million, reflecting confidence in our vision, strategy and execution. We have approximately $500 million for additional share buyback remaining under current Board authorization. And you can see in the takeaway, we updated our financial policy leverage ratio objective to be 3.5x or below from previously communicated 3.5 to 4.0x.
Let's turn to Slide 17 to review our updated 2021 outlook. We are raising our guidance across all key metrics, reflecting strong Q1 performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. For net sales, we now estimate $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion or 7% to 9% as reported growth and 6% to 8% in constant dollars. This compares to our previous guidance of $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion or constant dollar growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. The higher sales guidance reflects increased volume growth in Protective and additional price in both segments, given the current supply chain environment.  
In Food, we now expect constant dollar growth of 4% to 6% as compared to previous guidance of 2% to 4%. And in Protective, we now expect constant dollar growth of 8% to 10%, which compares to previous guidance of 3% to 5%.  On a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA is now expected to grow 7% to 9%. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion, a $20 million increase at the midpoint from previously provided guidance. Higher sales from volume and price are expected to offset increased material and supply disruption costs.
In terms of currency, we now expect favorable FX translation on 2021 sales and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.5%.  We are raising our 2021 outlook for adjusted EPS to $3.40 to $3.55, and we continue to expect approximately 45:55 first half, second half percentage split. Our outlook now assumes approximately 154 million average shares outstanding, a 3 million share reduction from our prior guidance, reflecting our share repurchases in the first quarter. We continue to estimate an adjusted tax rate of 26% to 27%.
And lastly, our revised free cash flow outlook of $520 million to $570 million reflects the higher range for adjusted EBITDA. There is no change to our outlook for 2021 CapEx of approximately $210 million and Reinvent SEE restructuring associated payments of approximately $40 million.
As you could see on this slide, we wanted to provide a few variables as it relates to our 2021 guidance range. The low end of our range would suggest a slower recovery in food service and supply chain headwinds persisting longer than anticipated. The high end implies continued strength in equipment, e-commerce and food retail, along with an acceleration of the industrial rebound and overperformance of our SEE operating engine.
With that, let me now pass the call back to Ted for closing remarks. Ted?"

And Chris, if you want to go through the bridge if we need to. As far as what surprised us, I actually have to say our European team of what's going on, on e-commerce, exceeded expectation, extremely strong. E-commerce, it just continues to go. As we know in the pandemic, everybody is using e-commerce and your packages are showing up at home, and we continue to do quite well. Also, we saw with our medical pickup there with the vaccine, what we're doing on packaging, some really interesting solutions, pickup, that was stronger than anticipated.
On the industrial side, we saw the industrial pickup in Europe. We saw a pickup in Asia. It's still flat to slightly down in the U.S. So we didn't see the industrial pickup, so that might tie into the second part of your question on the second half of the year. And then the real issue in Protective was automation. Really exciting, the penetration with APS and what that did. Our bookings are up significantly with our equipment in APS, which is in the Protective side, so quite strong.
And then to the second part of your question, we see that continuing for the second half of the year. We've got some challenges there, as you asked about pricing. We saw the pricing going up. While we saw our costs going up in the fourth quarter, we had price increases. We've already done 3. So what happened in the first quarter with Uri and the supply chain with our input costs going up, definitely surprised us by kept going up. So we didn't get totally on top of all of the price on that, but we think we have opportunity to catch up. The second quarter, though, still going to be tough on the resin side, but net-net, quite pleased with how the Protective is working and actually quite excited. We think we even have more opportunities in the second half, especially with industrial coming back in the second half of the year. We think we see some strong growth continuing."

Maybe, Josh, just to kind of elaborate on your -- on the full year comment. When we looked at the midpoint at what we communicated in February versus what we're communicating in May, take out that midpoint, $150 million. As you noted, given the top line beat in Protective in Q1 and our confidence, as Ted was commenting in terms of our full year, that increase on the volume side is all driven on Protective.  The other half of that increase of that $150 million reflects the pricing actions that had basically been already in place. And some of that spot pricing in terms of what happened real time, a good portion of that coming through our formula-based pricing, which we're starting to see the beginning of that being the early part of the second quarter here in April, going into May.  So we're going to start seeing the benefits of that turn. 
However, just specific to the second quarter, one of the things that we wanted to highlight, as we did last time, was given the EPS range between first half and second half, given that material dynamic, and that said, we're still on track. Even though we had a good beat, feel very good about the first quarter in terms of our performance, and we're raising our full year guidance, that 45:55 split between first half and second half is what we still anticipate. Thanks for your question."

So Ted, you had talked a lot about all the things you're doing on the Food side of the business and how the customer is excited about the automation solutions that you're bringing. Yet we're not yet seeing the volume growth in that segment. When do you think we'll see the Food volumes turn positively for Sealed Air over the course of 2021? And why haven't we been seeing it so far?
And then for both you and Chris, if we look at Slide 17, and we talk about the revenue guide increase, which is $150 million, there's only about a $20 million improvement in EBITDA, which is a low relative incremental margin. Why wouldn't we see an incremental margin pickup on the $150 million that's more commensurate with the 30%-plus that you typically target, especially since you said the revenue growth was coming from Protective where margins have been surprising on the upside and pricing, which is pure margin?"

And we'll see if we could unpack that. It was very clever. It was, I think, a bunch in there, but I'll try to unpack piece. And Chris, you can work.

It was, I think, a bunch in there, but I'll try to unpack piece. And Chris, you can work. First of all, let's talk about what we're seeing in Food. And if you look -- stay on Slide 17, where he asked, and if we looked at the first quarter, what's going on with Food, we're still in this pandemic environment where the food service is down year-over-year as we're still in the stay-at-home environments with restaurants, et cetera, being down and also the quick service. We're seeing a pickup there, but that's still down. What that does to the portfolio on to leverage our largest product lines, 2 of them, and actually, most profitable, are bags and pouches that are affected. So actually, in the quarter, the bags and pouches were actually slightly down. So it actually has a deleveraging effect. 
So to your question then on the second half of the business, as we see this recovery coming back, we would expect that would leverage quite nicely into that 30% leverage as we look for that growth. The top line question that you asked, when we increased our guidance, you're exactly right. We actually -- if you take the beat, that's a 13% leverage on the rates. So we've got to get through the second quarter. We got input costs going up substantially that we're trying to manage on the price. As you know, on the Food, we have that lag going back with our formula prices. So really, Q2 is going to be, see, can we get that catch-up, where you will see that nice leverage coming through. But right now in the guide, we don't have the leverage returning until the second half of the year on the Food side."

That contribution margin on the incremental volume, we're seeing a nice flow-through, 30-plus percent. It's really the dynamic of the material headwind that is impacting the overall PG ratio, as we referred to it, in terms of the contribution of bottom line relative to the top line.
And then, as I mentioned before, in terms of that -- the full year guidance of up $150 million, on the midpoint of sales, half being by volume, half being on the price side. That price side is good because it's going to -- it's offsetting the material headwinds. So we're hoping to get the price/cost spread near 0 by the end of the year, and that's what our guidance reflects. And so that's how we're looking at the full year. The dynamic between us having our lowest quarter kind of in Q2, given the material headwinds and pricing starting to kick in, that's what kind of drives our 45:55 in terms of giving some color on first half, second half."

And the second part of the question is around the equipment kind of side and just maybe talk about your kind of sales pipeline and funnel just as you kind of are working on automation projects with customers and kind of the confidence level on the $250 million of equipment sales this year, which would seem to imply a pretty meaningful acceleration in growth over the next 3 quarters."

How about -- let me jump on my favorite subject of automation first, and then Chris could help going through some of your volume questions, where he can add some color there. Good questions, Adam. On the automation, is definitely something we're quite excited about. So if you look at Slide 7, we're trying to lay out where we're taking automation is what we're calling touchless. So as you highlighted, we have $250 million there. We feel pretty confident that we're on track with that. 
If you unpack the equipment just in the equipment piece, in the first quarter, that's almost up 30% on our equipment sales. By just looking at APS, which is the big driver of equipment, our APS bookings are up 60%. So we're seeing a very healthy pipeline, and we're seeing that through both Food and Protective. So that we feel quite confident, and to get to that $500 million, as you obviously see, we're expecting to double that business. So we think we're on track with that and the growth rates. And we see that to continue through the second quarter and in the second half of the year.
I also want to highlight that's really connected to the automation is that large fleet. We actually have -- it's an incredible number, over 100,000 pieces of equipment out there in our fleet. And as we're really changing the strategy to be an equipment company, really focused on the automation, it's also taking care of that fleet. So that other part is that parts and services out there and staying connected to that installed base, we think we have some more upside on that potential.
So automation and where the final piece of your question, what does this mean to our customers? This is what the pandemic is really driving in this touchless system that we're talking about. How do we make a meat-packing plant safer? How do we take people out of harm's way? How do we bring a much higher level of automation and security to the process? We had one of our largest meat-packing customers with us in Simpsonville just last week, where we're actually showing our automated systems in the largest meat-packing plant -- meat packaging plant in the world of how we're going to extend our touchless system into their plant. So really excited about the opportunity we have in equipment to keep that going and growing. And I'm very confident we're going to exceed the expectations of this chart."

And again, that gets back to our kind of full-year guide, that volume increase, a part of our $150 million of our midpoint increase, half being volume, half being price. That volume is really driven by what's going on in Protective."

So clearly, a pretty volatile environment, just thinking of material inflation starting in the fourth quarter of last year really continuing through April. We're hopeful that we've seen a little bit of steadiness in terms of how we're currently thinking about it. Our full year guidance assumes things start to level off. We entered the year anticipating raw materials being up roughly 5%. Our latest is now we're thinking it's going to be in the 10% category. Although we all read about increases, 20%, 30%, 40% even significantly, a lot of what we buy, speciality resins, which has not had as dramatic of an increase, although we are seeing it.
Freight is the other item that we experienced in the quarter. We're doing everything we can to satisfy customer demand. So air freight, unfortunately, has been driving not only getting product to us but getting product to our customers, mostly on the input side, where we've incurred incremental -- roughly $3 million to $4 million of incremental cost to make sure we can satisfy the demand on whatever that's coming towards our way. But again, going back to the full year, we're assuming it starts to level off. We've reflected that in our updated guidance for the full year."

So we actually expect our price/cost spread to be a little bit worse in the second quarter than the first. However, as we think about first half, second half, we expect that to rebound as we have full-fledged pricing in place with formula-based pricing as well as other price increases that we have announced and are starting to kick in. We expect that to turn in the second half of the year. 
And again, that really just drives us. What we're trying to provide is just color as how we're going into this year, thinking this 45:55 first half, second half split on EPS and just trying to provide investors kind of a good view of how we're managing through it. And I would suggest that our ability to manage through Q1 to deliver these kind of results. We know it's coming, it is coming, and we've been planning for it in terms of what the impact is on Q2. Internally, we're managing and measuring our ability from a price point of view, the stickiness of that price in the markets we serve as well as with the customer impact. So just staying very close to it. I can tell you at the top of mind for us, as a company across the entire company, just talking about how to manage this dynamic, doing the best we can to leverage our really supply chain, global supply chain network and being able to satisfy demand as we move forward."

So I now know that, that was your prediction or maybe your predilection. So we see it going past April 1 on the cost side.
But on the growth on Protective, what we're excited about is just -- highlight just a couple of things. One is our presence of where we are and how quickly we've been adapting to portfolio. We're growing our paper products at double-digit. We've introduced new paper products that are going and doing quite well. Our equipment business, we already highlighted. Equipment business is up almost 30% just the equipment, and that's across the board, Food and Protective. We're also seeing, as we shifted, as I highlighted, to the different markets and the movement with the e-commerce. We're really being quite aggressive in getting the right product at the right price. And then I also got to bring in sustainability. We are definitely seeing the sustainable issue coming forward with, do you want paper, do you want plastics. Either one, how do we make that sustainable? So we're seeing some good opportunities.
And the last one, that I think we even have more opportunity on the second half on the Protective side with the return of the industrial market. We did not see that as strong in the U.S. We saw it stronger in Europe. So we think we still have some upside opportunity. And that also ties into keeping that leverage going because that's where we leverage, both on the Food, getting the bags back and getting that Instapak volume back. We'll leverage quite nicely to get us back over that -- our leverage targets at the back end of the year."

I think just from a -- just thinking through the leverage ratio, ending year-end last year at 3.1, we ended this quarter at 3.2. Looking forward, just getting to your point in terms of our ability to operate and execute in this environment. Recognizing we are a good cash generator, and our cash flow generation being able to over time reduce that debt, but at the same time not lose sight of what the investments we want to make, which, first and foremost, is invest in ourselves in terms of where the organic growth opportunities are. As you saw, we were an active buyer of our stock in the first quarter. Average share price is roughly $44 per share. 
We felt it was clearly a good opportunistic time to get back in the market, given how we ended the year on the cash side of the equation. But we don't want to -- we definitely don't want to lose sight of the fact that we've got a pipeline of opportunities on the M&A front. Earlier, comment was made in terms of success of the APS acquisition, which absolutely has been. So the pipeline is there. We will continue to look at just where we are for availability, the end markets, the environment we're in, to deploy capital on M&A as we continue to grow. Would we maybe go above that leverage ratio, potentially, but we want to work that back down the 3.5 or less over, I would call it, a reasonable period of time, call it, 12, 18 months. And that's why we felt it was appropriate, given the cash generation, all the benefits of Reinvent SEE and the progress being made over the past 2 or 3 years. We don't need to necessarily stay in this 3.5 to 4.0x. We can stay below 3.5 and continue to have a much -- a lot of availability to reinvest in ourselves as well as look at opportunities for M&A."

We're working through very exciting and challenging times as we transform SEE. We're accelerating our strategy to take us to world-class in everything we do. As you can see on Slide 3, we're in the business to protect, to solve critical packaging challenges and to make our world better than we founded. 
On today's call, I'll recap our second quarter 2021 performance. I'll share our strategy for growth in automation, digital and sustainability within our global markets. Chris will review our financial results and outlook in more detail. I will then end with closing remarks and before opening the call for Q&A. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 for a review of our second quarter 2021 results. Net sales increased 15%, with 9% volume growth led by strength in Americas, in Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Adjusted EBITDA increased 1%, and margins were under pressure at 19.8% compared to 22.6% last year. This year, we experienced higher volumes, additional productivity gains and pricing actions against dramatic inflationary cost pressures and supply disruption. Also, relative to last year, we had pandemic-induced surges in essential products and minimize expenses due to lockdowns. 
On a per share basis, earnings of $0.79 were up $0.03 compared to last year. We generated free cash flow of $102 million in the first 6 months of the year, which compared to $129 million in the first half of last year. We are raising our full year sales and adjusted EPS outlook and reiterating our prior guidance for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
Our SEE Operating Engine is delivering. Sales growth and productivity gains mitigated the adverse supply environment in the second quarter. This engine, coupled with expected price realization, is enabling us to maintain our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year and drive continuous improvement going forward. 
I want to highlight our SEE operating model on Slide 5, which clearly defines where we're taking SEE in the future and what you should expect us to deliver. Our organic sales target is built up in a historically stable packaging market that grows 1% to 3%. We've been adding to this base with our innovations in automation, digital and sustainability to take us to an organic sales growth target of 3% to 5%. Our operating leverage target is over 30%, which drives adjusted EBITDA growth to 5% to 7%. 
We're targeting adjusting earnings per share growth of greater than 10% and free cash flow conversion of more than 50%. Our SEE operating model delivers significant cash for our disciplined capital allocation. 
We are fueling growth opportunities with our investments in innovation and CapEx. Through SEE ventures investments, we're utilizing our balance sheet to incubate disruptive technologies and new business models to accelerate our future growth. We're also returning value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program and recently increased our dividend by 25%. Our approach to capital allocation reflects our confidence in our vision, strategy and execution of our SEE Operating Engine. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, which highlights our market-driven solutions powered by our iconic brands. We encourage you to visit our website where you can read about our innovation and customer success stories. 
We create measurable value for our customers through automated and sustainable solutions that are designed to maximize food safety, minimize waste, protect goods and deliver productivity savings. In the second quarter, we had strong growth across our end markets. We are leading a dramatic shift to a touchless automated environment for all customers, resulting in more than 30% growth in our SEE Automation portfolio. We're ahead of our plan to double our equipment business in the next 3 years. 
For our food customers, our SEE Automation growth is a result of our integrated touchless systems with our high-performance Cryovac materials. Bookings for Autobag and [ Autobox ] equipment were up more than 50% in the first half of the year, and we're investing more than $30 million in capacity expansion to help meet the strong demand for our equipment solutions. 
Our automated solutions address labor shortages, productivity and employee safety. We're at the table with our customers, providing connectivity from our operations to theirs, which is helping all of us exceed our sustainability commitments. Restaurants, sporting events, conferences and other large public menus are cautiously reopening. Our solutions with high exposure to food service returned to growth for the first time since Q1 2020. 
We are seeing growth in our Cryovac barrier bags utilized across all proteins, including cheese and seafood and Cryovac pouches for soups, sauces, beverages and other liquids. Our industrial markets were up double digits in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa regions compared to last year when there were pandemic-related shutdowns. We continue to capitalize on global e-commerce growth and increased demands for recyclable materials, fiber-based solutions and automated packaging that minimizes waste. 
In medical, pharma and life sciences, we play a key role in the COVID-19 vaccine distribution benefit from growth in online shipments of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. 
Now turning to Slide 7 for an update on SEE Automation. In the first half of the year, equipment, systems and service sales were up 26% and accounted for 8% of our net sales. We're on track to achieve approximately $425 million or 12% growth in 2021, of which more than $250 million will come from equipment and systems. 
Our bookings for automated equipment are strong. We're confident in our ability to exceed $500 million by 2025. When you factor in a 3x plus solutions multiplier, including growth in parts and service from the installed base and the flow-through of materials, this results in a $5 billion plus potential growth opportunity over the 10-year solutions life cycle. The solutions multiple is why we are so excited about SEE Automation. 
Let me now turn to Slide 8 and talk about sustainability. Sustainability is in everything we do and fueling our growth. We are making significant progress on our 2025 sustainability pledge with nearly 50% of our solutions already designed for recyclability. Our innovation strategy is focused on maintaining the high-quality standards that our customers are accustomed to in food safety, minimizing waste and protecting goods. We are continuously optimizing our high-performance materials and incorporating more recycled and/or renewable content to drive circularity and make sustainability more affordable. We're also collaborating and investing with partners on mechanical and advanced recycling. 
As part of SEE ventures, we recently joined the Close Loop Circulars Plastic Fund. This fund invests in scalable recycling technology, equipment upgrades and infrastructure solutions to advance the recovery of plastics in the U.S. and Canada. 
You can see a handful of our solutions designed for recyclability on this slide with many more shared on our website. 
Earlier this year, we established a net 0 carbon emissions goal across our operations by 2040. We're taking many actions to reduce our energy consumption, such as investing in touchless automation, upgrading air compression systems and utilizing LED lighting. We're also investing in renewable energy sources, including solar and wind. Between 2012 and 2020, our greenhouse gas emissions intensity decreased by a remarkable 50%. We'll share more details in our upcoming annual sustainability report that will be available on our website in the early fall. 
I'll now pass the call to Chris to review our results in more detail. Chris?"
382724,1671863630,2360613,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. In the second quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 15% as reported, up 11% in constant dollars. Food was up 6% i",1440,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. 
In the second quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 15% as reported, up 11% in constant dollars. Food was up 6% in constant dollars versus last year, and Protective increased 20%. EMEA and the Americas were both up double digits: EMEA up 16%; and the Americas up 13%. APAC was flat versus last year with a modest decline in volumes, offset by favorable price. 
On Slide 10, you see organic sales volume and pricing trends by segment and by region. In the second quarter, overall volume growth was up 9% on favorable price of 3%. 
Let's start with volumes. Food volumes were up 4%, with the Americas up 7% and EMEA up 2%. This was offset by a 3% decline in APAC, largely related to Australia herd rebuilding. Protective volumes were up 15%, with the Americas up 13% and EMEA up 36%, while APAC had a modest decline. 
Q2 price was favorable 3%. You can see that Protective had 5% in favorable pricing, and Food was 1% due to timing of pricing actions and formula pass-throughs. We have implemented several price increases and expect 2021 price realization to be $275 million. 
On Slide 11, we present our consolidated sales and adjusted EBITDA walk. Having already discussed sales, let me comment on our adjusted EBITDA performance in Q2. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $263 million, up 1% compared to last year and margins of 19.8%, down 280 basis points, reflecting the impact of the current inflationary environment and supply chain disruptions. We are leveraging our higher volumes at 40% as we experienced a more favorable product mix. Despite favorable pricing in the quarter, you can see how higher input costs weighed on our EBITDA performance with an unfavorable price/cost spread of $36 million. 
Operational costs increased approximately $13 million relative to last year. This increase reflects investments to support growth, inflation on labor and indirect material costs as well as the normalization of spend in the quarter. This was partially offset by $13 million in Reinvent SEE productivity benefits. 
We expect our price/cost spread to improve sequentially in the third quarter. However, we do not expect to see positive price/cost spread until Q4. 
Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $0.79 compared to $0.76 in Q2 2020. Our adjusted tax rate was 25.6%, reflecting a more favorable mix of foreign earnings. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 153 million. We exited the quarter with 150 million shares outstanding. 
Turning to Slide 12. Here, we provide an update on Reinvent SEE. We have achieved 8 -- $28 million of benefits in the first half of the year and remain on track to realize approximately $65 million in 2021. Our commercial work stream is accelerating innovation and driving new customer wins in core and adjacent markets. 
Turning to segment results on Slide 13, starting with Food. In Q2, Food net sales of $737 million were up 6% on a constant dollar basis. Cryovac barrier bags and pouches returned to growth, increasing approximately 10% and accounting for nearly 50% of the segment sales. This growth reflects the beginning of food service recovery relative to last year when protein plants and restaurants, sporting events and other large venues were shut down. Sales in case-ready and roll stock retail applications, which accounts for just over 40% of segment sales, were down low single digits as supply disruptions impacted our results. In addition, this is against the backdrop of tough comps given the surge in demand from shutdowns a year ago. 
Equipment parts sales and sales -- and service sales, which accounts for 8% of the segment, were up nearly 40% in the quarter. We are experiencing increased demand for our automated solutions as our customers around the world invest in their processing plants to upgrade aged equipment and drive productivity. 
Adjusted EBITDA in Food of $158 million in Q2 declined 6% compared to last year, with margins at 21.5%, down 360 basis points. This decline was related to elevated input costs, supply disruptions and the timing of pricing actions. 
On Slide 14, we highlight Protective segment results. In constant dollars, net sales increased 20% to $592 million. Industrial was up approximately 30% relative to last year when automobile and general manufacturers were forced to temporarily shut down their operations. 
Fulfillment, which is largely driven by e-commerce growth, was up approximately 10% on a global basis, led by double-digit growth in automated equipment, inflatable solutions, paper and temperature assurance. We leveraged our broad portfolio and global scale to meet increased demand despite ongoing supply issues, such as industry-related chip shortages out of Asia. The $30 million investments in capacity that Ted referenced earlier will help us meet increased customer demands for automation equipment. 
As a reminder, approximately 55% of our Protective sales are derived from industrial end markets, and the remaining [ 45% ] from fulfillment and e-commerce. Adjusted EBITDA of $107 million increased 17% from Q2 with margins at 18.1%, down 100 basis points versus last year. Higher sales and productivity gains helped mitigate higher input and supply disruption costs. 
Now let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 15. In the first half of 2021, we generated $102 million of free cash flow. Relative to the same period last year, higher earnings and lower restructuring payments were offset by higher employee-related costs and CapEx investments to support growth and innovation. 
On Slide 16, we outline our capital allocation strategy. We will maintain a strong balance sheet while driving attractive returns on invested capital and supporting profitable growth initiatives. In addition, we have a healthy acquisition pipeline that aligns with our growth strategy. 
On this slide, I want to highlight our growth investments. We are focusing our CapEx on breakthrough processes, automation, digital and sustainability. With SEE Ventures, we have invested approximately $40 million in early-stage disruptive technologies and business models that are expected to accelerate our strategy and innovation efforts. 
As it relates to returning capital to shareholders, in Q2, we were an active buyer of our stock. We repurchased 6.1 million shares for $299 million during the first 6 months of 2021, reflecting confidence in our vision, strategy and execution. And as Ted noted, today, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program, continuing our commitment to return value to shareholders. This new program has no expiration date and replaces the previous authorization. 
During the second quarter, we also announced an increase to our quarterly cash dividend of 25%. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 to review our updated 2021 outlook. We are raising our net sales guidance, reflecting strong first half sales performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. For net sales, we estimate $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion or 10% to 12% as reported growth and 8% to 10% in constant dollars compared to our previously provided $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion range. At the midpoint, the $150 million increase in constant dollar sales largely reflects additional pricing. We continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion. On a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow 7% to 9%. Higher sales are expected to help offset increased material and supply disruption costs. 
Given the timing of pricing actions, we anticipate a modest sequential improvement in EBITDA in Q3 with a more meaningful improvement in Q4. We are raising our 2021 outlook for adjusted EPS to $3.45 to $3.60, and we continue to expect a 45-55 first half, second half percentage split. 
Our outlook assumes 153 million average shares outstanding, 1 million reduction from our prior guidance, given share repurchases in the first half, and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 26%. And lastly, our free cash flow outlook continues to be $520 million to $570 million. There is no change to our outlook for 2021 CapEx of approximately $210 million and Reinvent SEE restructuring and associated payments of approximately $40 million. 
As you can see on the slide, we wanted to provide a few variables as it relates to our 2021 guidance range. The low end of our range would assume the magnitude and duration of material inflation and supply chain headwinds persist longer than anticipated and a slower pace of food service recovery. The high end implies market and geographic share gains, continued strength in automation, industrials, e-commerce and food and overperformance of our SEE Operating Engine. 
With that, let me now pass the call back to Ted for closing remarks. Ted?"

But Ghansham, before we get to your question for everybody on the call, I did want to add some clarity to the Q&A and make a brief comment. Late yesterday, we announced that we received notification from the SEC staff that our previously disclosed investigation has concluded as it relates to Sealed Air and that the SEC does not intend to recommend any enforcement action against the company. 
As I'm sure everybody can appreciate, our comments are limited to the SEC documents that were filed publicly, including in our press release and Form 10-Q, which we're going to file later with the SEC. Throughout this process, though, I just want to highlight, we fully cooperated with the SEC's investigation, and we are pleased to put this matter behind us. 
So let's get back to your question, Ghansham. And Chris, if you can handle the first part, and I'll [indiscernible]"

Ghansham, are you still there? Okay. Let's continue on. So I think you mentioned just in terms of Page 17 for our overall slide, if I recall, you said that Slide 17, which provides an update on our outlook on net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. 
As we see overall performance in terms of the top line, very strong growth in the quarter, as we mentioned. If I was to change -- if we were just to kind of reflect what we said in the May time frame and bridge it to what we view now in terms of top line growth, we increased -- last quarter, we increased the top line by $150 million, and we mentioned that 50% of that was going to be price, and 50% of that was going to be volume. This quarter, we're going up another incremental $150 million, mostly driven by price with a small amount of volume improvement. 
What we're most strengthful for is the Protective side of our business, especially out of EMEA, where we saw extremely strong growth, as we commented in our prepared remarks. So that gave us confidence coming off first quarter, second quarter, first half of the year, leading into the next year to increase our guidance of $150 million. And that's how we feel pretty good about the performance. 
And the execution in terms of the bottom line, we talked about the price increases -- multiple price increases that are necessary in light of this significant inflationary environment that we are in, multiple price increases throughout the year to make up for that difference, hoping to close that gap in the second half. 
And I did want to comment that our third quarter, we do expect a slight improvement to 2Q. But as I mentioned, that fourth quarter is where we'd see the bigger lift when formula-based pricing and other pricing actions kick in, in a more meaningful way."

So if you look at Slide 8, we talk about what's going on with sustainability. And as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, about our investment with Close Loop. And we're excited about -- we made previous investments, and you've heard us talk about our SEE Ventures. We're investing in sustainability, using our balance sheet to go side-by-side with some really interesting investments that are out there. 
What we like about Close Loop is it lines exactly where we're going. They focus on sustainability. They're focusing on the carbon footprint and taking -- is taking the process from a linear process where you make a product and then it ends up into the ocean or landfill, how do you bring circularity to bring that waste back and recycle it, whether it's chemical recycling, et cetera. But the other part we like about their strategy is that they also connected to earnings growth. So they focus on the circular economy, how do we do that in a way to drive earnings. 
Also, our investment allows us to see what other interesting incubating technologies that they're looking at so we can see inside and be early investors some pretty exciting technology in this space, recycled products and businesses that are out there. So we're going to be investing side-by-side, but it really ties into our strategy of linking sustainability to our carbon-neutral goals, but then also that we're in the business to protect. And in the business part is how we're connecting it to the earnings. Okay. Next question, operator?"

And maybe you can help frame by business, by region kind of how volumes are tracking relative to prepandemic 2019 levels and where you see kind of the opportunities and risks over the balance of the year. 
And then just to confirm on the pricing side. So it implies about 9% pricing year-over-year in the back half, I presume more fourth quarter weighted. Can you just maybe clarify for us kind of how we should think about the raw material cost trajectory through the second half?"

Maybe I'll take the second part first because what we've seen just coming off the announcement we made yesterday in terms of the press release overall pricing, if we go back to the first quarter call, we talked about an incremental headwind on resins and chemicals primarily this material inflation heading our way, roughly $150 million. What we're seeing now is more like $300-plus million. And as a result, we have implemented multiple price increases, more to come, as we communicated. The realization of that price increase, as I -- in my prepared remarks, talking about just the overall -- it's the second half -- that $150 million increase to the full year guidance mostly is driven by price. 
Your -- first part of your question is just overall volumes. The strength of Protective really can be commented in terms of the Americas, and specifically, EMEA has been extremely strong. Some of that being on unfavorable comps completely -- clearly towards the second half of the year. But as we look at the second half, the momentum that's moving into that part of the year, we just see Protective continue to be strengthened. And there's no one particular area. It's kind of across the board. I don't know, Ted, if you have anything to add as it relates to overall volume for the second half, but it seems to be, again, leading the Americas and leading out of EMEA, with Asia Pac catching up in the second half."

And Adam, you can see how Chris and I are tag team, and Chris will tell you, make sure we do what we say we're going to do. And I'll give you a little bit of the excitement that we'll get through this journey is we put in the press release, we",525,"Sure. Good. And Adam, you can see how Chris and I are tag team, and Chris will tell you, make sure we do what we say we're going to do. And I'll give you a little bit of the excitement that we'll get through this journey is we put in the press release, we went directly to our customers as well about our price increase. So it's pretty significant. What we've swallowed through the engine right now, it's going through the engine. We'll -- we'd like to get through this in the second quarter, but significant input costs. But behind that, the engine is working. The productivity and the leverage behind that, as Chris highlighted, were leveraging at 40%. But that input cost, we've got to get through, and we think we'll get through it by the end of the year. We're not going to tell you which quarter because we don't know, but we are aggressively working that model that we showed on Slide 5, that will happen. And that's the guide where we're showing you where we're going in 2022 now and beyond. So some of the specifics that we're driving, it's really using our automation to get that through and help our customers. 
So just -- I'll give you a little bit of detail. If you look at Slide 7 where we look at our whole portfolio -- I'm sorry. Go to Slide 6. So if you look at our portfolio of products, of what's going to -- we do 30 billion packages. So if you just think about that with our whole portfolio, and you took that 30 billion, this $5 billion company take equipment away. So we're talking about the average price for our package is around $0.16. Well, with this dramatic input cost, that's going to go from $0.16 to $0.18. Oh, and by the way, we're going to make it sustainable. And by the way, we're going digital. So we're going to actually take that probably up from $0.16 to $0.20, and we're being very transparent with the market, that's coming. So what do we do? We got to drive automation. So the automation is where our growth is coming where we can save our customers millions to afford those few cents per packaging. 
So as we get through this, and we swallow this incredible inflationary period, we are spending a huge amount of time with our customers in driving the automation. And to hit that sales growth number and our whole portfolio beyond Protective and Food, that we are going to be driving the automation, digital and sustainable solutions. And you can see in the numbers that we're excited by going through this double digit, up 30% more, even the bookings, which we're tracking and tracing, up significantly. So we're investing there heavily. We're working with our customers. We will swallow this inflationary period. The timing of it, we don't know exactly. But for sure, by the end of the year, we think we're going to do quite well, and we'd like to end on that model. The model will continue to perform going into next year."

But going back into your detail on how we're doing this with our customers, and remember, the customers are listening to this call with us as well. So the -- I've been very direct and through this -- even this past quarter, been meeting with the CEOs of some of our major customers literally around the world, most of those being virtual. So we've been very open. The package -- our pricing is going up on the materials. So to your question on the pricing side of it, we want to share with them again the package pricing is going to go up a few cents. But where the real savings for them, it's millions of how do we automate their operations. And their issues right now are labor scarcity, the safety of COVID, how can we get in there and fully automate. So take these -- there are millions of packages and save that money. So we're not talking to them about actually the price increase. We're talking about how we can save them money, knowing that those materials are going to be more expensive. 
At the table with them, we're also learning even more challenges that they're having. We're not the only ones that are experiencing higher input costs to our customers. So again, we're going even further into their facilities and actually bringing our ops teams into -- with our customers to show them how we could potentially help them, make their facilities more productive, safer and driving the level of automation. So yes, it's a pricing discussion, very direct, but it's really how can we save them money. 
So I'll keep pointing to Slide 7 and that this is how we're selling that automation story to our customers. 
The second part of your question, I'll start and maybe if Chris wants to add more detail. Your question is, is that -- is the equipment and the automation story coming in the Protective side? Absolutely, especially with fulfillment centers. We're seeing the automation come into these high-volume fulfillment centers very aggressively. 
What we used to do in the old model is we would get that equipment away even with our iconic Bubble Wrap. We actually can make Bubble Wrap on demand by the push of a button and do -- and create the Bubble Wrap right in the fulfillment center. But really, the growth in Protective has been with Autobag. The acquisition that we've made with Autobag and what they're doing with automation has been tremendous for us, especially in this environment, bringing our Autobag systems into the fulfillment center so that you can actually load the package more effectively and efficiently and bring those high-value materials around the package is where the growth right now through the pandemic is really, really strong, and we think more to come. And we're taking that to our Food business as well. 
So to our customers, they think industrial is what we do because if you look at food plant, they actually call that an industrial operation. So just sharing with you, it covers all of our customers. The short answer on the pricing is we've got to save them more money, so we got to work harder. And automation is a great story to be at the table through these challenging times."

We have opportunities to exceed that 4 25. Clearly, we want to make sure it's in our performance. And hopefully, we'll hear a quarter from now talking about how that expectation for '21 is actually going to be greater than that 4 25. We got a good pipeline of opportunity."

We feel good about being able to maintain the current range, but the dynamic there is driving incremental volume and driving productivity is going to help offset our view of the full year price/cost spread to be net negative. You mentioned $25 million, exactly right. We kind of view it as this $25 million to $30 million of negative price/cost spread for the full year based on what we know today. 
So as I mentioned, just driving that volume -- incremental volume growth in terms of bottom line performance and productivity to try to help offset that is how we overcome that to maintain our EBITDA range. And we stay committed to that as of now through the first half, obviously, of the year."

And Jeff, as you mentioned, in terms of being able to recoup that inflationary headwind leading into the next year, we will have that favorable. We expect, assuming no additional pressure from an inflationary environment, that we're going to recoup some of that material cost inflation going into next year given formula-based pricing. 
But specific to your question around the second half of the year, maybe thinking through Food's contribution as well as Protective's contribution or what that whole dynamic is between material cost inflation and price/cost spread, we see both segments being under pressure in the third quarter, as I mentioned earlier. Some improvement from Q2, clearly. But as you look to the fourth quarter, you see both segments contributing positively from a price/cost spread. 
For food, clearly, more benefit from formula-based pricing, but we're also implementing price on the nonformula. And Protective, given the pricing actions we've taken, will start to materialize as well. So you got this big lift in Q4 as we see the price benefit of the actions -- the price/cost spread benefit of the actions we've taken on price."

And again, if you remember, year-over-year, the first half, what we're competing with that tough comp of second quarter last year when -- during when the shutdowns hit, the bag business on Food was really, really strong. Boy, we leveraged nicely on bags. But behind that, we had food service pretty much shut down with restaurants, and that's the pouch business as we go into our liquids and the tomato paste, et cetera. So we had those 2 things work. So we see that moving in the second quarter, we just can't tell you the timing on it. So we see the fluids and the pouch business, which is extremely attractive business to us, picking up, and we will be gaining on that in the second half, and again, going into next year. So Food is really a tale of 2 markets, but it's also the same with the Protective where we had the industrial and e-commerce. So that is shifting in the quarter. 
But behind all that, I just want to continually highlight the engine is working on driving the productivity on both of those internally. So that's giving us our confidence to drive -- getting through this, driving it through the end of the year and into 2022."

And again, I'll just go back to my comments in terms of the pricing, mostly formula-based pricing as well as other pricing actions kind of hitting -- they've been hitting in Q3, but they're going to show a big lift in Q4 based on our expectation. 
Kind of ending the quarter, a little early to tell because the inflationary environment, just as we were here 90 days ago, if you will, talking about the full year '21, extremely dynamic environment. It's -- right now, our projections -- our estimates for the full year show a nice improvement in Q4 for purposes of margin, without a doubt. The sustainability of those margins going into 2022. We'll have to assess based on the inflationary environment. 
As you know, our business ranges from 20%, 21% to 23%, 24% EBITDA margin, just depending on the dynamics in a particular quarter. What we're trying to drive for, not only in that incremental volume growth and the leverage off of that, is getting back to our operating model is to be able to drive EBITDA margins approaching 24%, 25% over time given the Operating Engine in terms of the ability to generate cash and fuel it back into the business.

We're giving you the leverage behind what's going on with the engine behind this input cost, and it was actually leveraging at [ 40% ], even higher than our target, as you see, of the 30%.

So again, that sounds like a broken record, but we're in the face of it. We're acting to it. We're managing to it. We're driving -- we're doing everything we can to try to minimize the impact to maintain that full year guidance. 
Our expectation is that we're still in this inflationary environment. We do expect it to continue, call it, for another month or 2. But I'll tell you, that makes us nervous a little bit even make that statement because of the dynamic we've seen over the past 3 months. We will react to it accordingly, of course, in terms of driving productivity and pricing actions as necessary. But we're hopeful that this thing starts to plateau, kind of level out. And we continue to kind of move forward. 
But internally, when you think about our risks and opportunities, and as we share -- we like to share with investors when we put on our guidance slide, kind of the downside as well as the upside to our outlook, you can see the downside, clearly, still is that dramatic material inflation continues, the supply disruptions, et cetera. But we'll manage through it. 
But let me focus on the positives. The positives are the global reach of our company, the share gains, the opportunity, we already talked about the equipment piece of it in terms of what we're doing and how we're driving. We hope to exceed that 4 25, as I mentioned before. And then between Ted and myself, just continuing to reiterate the operating engine. The backbone that we have in place to drive productivity is there. It's real. It's happening, and we'll continue to pursue it. 
Regarding the Delta variant and the implications that has on our business, I kind of view it as every weeks and new week -- almost every day is a new day as we hear more about it. It has us clearly concerned. And one side of the business potentially may do better as it relates to the retail food side, if you will. We did see some early signs of recovery on the service side. We're hoping that, that food service -- hopefully, that continues, but time will tell. Time will tell."

There were some issues. Again, it's the year-over-year comparables. We had a really strong second quarter a year ago. In the guidance that we have, again, similar to the previous question that Adam had, we do have the philosophy of under promise over deliver. So we have -- our Asia team is being aggressive on how do we drive growth in such a large region. But right now, in our guidance, we have a tepid number out there, but we think we have an opportunity. 
Really, it's the same issue, though. It's what can we do in automation. We're driving some significant wins. Those will materialize. Some of them, you don't see because they're in the bookings. And the bookings -- the good news, why we have confidence we can now see those bookings numbers are up that will be realized. And so we see some opportunity in Asia Pacific. It's a huge opportunity for us, especially, same thing, the industrial, e-commerce and the Food business, if you're reading what's going on with the African swine fever, huge industrial growth opportunity as China is converting from that wet to dry some of those huge pork plants, those industrial plants that we're connected with are under construction, are being built, will they be realized this year? No. But we see lots of opportunity in Asia Pacific. 
As far as our portfolio, when it's only 15%, it's not moving the needle, but we're excited about the opportunity to get Asia Pacific more into our numbers for the future. So we've got some work to do there. Good question."

We're accele",1254,"Thank you, Lori, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest in SEE and hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. 
We're working through very exciting and challenging times as we transform SEE. We're accelerating our strategy to take us to world-class in everything we do. As you can see on Slide 3, we're in the business to protect, to solve critical packaging challenges and to make our world better than we found it.
On today's call, I'll recap our second quarter 2021 performance. I'll share our strategy for growth in automation, digital and sustainability within our global markets. Chris will review our financial results and outlook in more detail. I will then end with closing remarks and before opening the call for Q&A.
Let's turn to Slide 4 for a review of our second quarter 2021 results. Net sales increased 15% with 9% volume growth, led by strength in Americas, in Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Adjusted EBITDA increased 1%, and margins were under pressure at 19.8% compared to 22.6% last year. This year, we experienced higher volumes, additional productivity gains and pricing actions against dramatic inflationary cost pressures and supply disruption. Also, relative to last year, we had pandemic-induced surges in essential products and minimized expenses due to lockdowns. On a per-share basis, earnings of $0.79 were up $0.03 compared to last year. We generated free cash flow of $102 million in the first 6 months of the year, which compared to $129 million in the first half of last year. We are raising our full year sales and adjusted EPS outlook and reiterating our prior guidance for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.
Our SEE Operating Engine is delivering sales growth and productivity gains mitigated the adverse supply environment in the second quarter. This engine, coupled with expected price realization, is enabling us to maintain our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year and drive continuous improvement going forward. 
I want to highlight our SEE operating model on Slide 5, which clearly defines where we're taking SEE in the future and what you should expect us to deliver. Our organic sales target is built up in a historically stable packaging market that grows 1% to 3%. We've been adding to this base with our innovations in automation, digital and sustainability to take us to an organic sales growth target of 3% to 5%. Our operating leverage target is over 30%, which drives adjusted EBITDA growth to 5% to 7%. We're targeting adjusting earnings per share growth of greater than 10% and free cash flow conversion of more than 50%. Our SEE operating model delivers significant cash for our disciplined capital allocation.
We are fueling growth opportunities with our investments in innovation and CapEx. Through SEE Ventures investments, we're utilizing our balance sheet to incubate disruptive technologies and new business models to accelerate our future growth. We're also returning value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program and recently increased our dividend by 25%. Our approach to capital allocation reflects our confidence in our vision, strategy and execution of our SEE Operating Engine.
Let's turn to Slide 6, which highlights our market-driven solutions powered by our iconic brands. We encourage you to visit our website where you can read about our innovation and customer success stories. We create measurable value for our customers through automated and sustainable solutions that are designed to maximize safety, minimize waste, protect goods and deliver productivity savings. In the second quarter, we had strong growth across our end markets. We are leading a dramatic shift to a touchless, automated environment for all customers, resulting in more than 30% growth in our SEE automation portfolio. We're ahead of our plan to double our equipment business in the next 3 years.
For our food customers, our SEE Automation growth is a result of our integrated touchless systems with our high-performance Cryovac materials. Bookings for AUTOBAG and auto box equipment were up more than 50% in the first half of the year, and we're investing more than $30 million in capacity expansion to help meet the strong demand for our equipment solutions.
Our automated solutions address labor shortages, productivity and employee safety. We're at the table with our customers, providing connectivity from our operations to theirs, which is helping all of us exceed our sustainability commitments. Restaurants, sporting events, conferences and other large public menus are cautiously reopening. Our solutions with high exposure to food service returned to growth for the first time since Q1 2020.
We are seeing growth in our Cryovac Barrier Bags utilized across all proteins, including cheese and seafood; and Cryovac pouches for soups, sauces, beverages and other liquids. Our industrial markets were up double digits in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa regions compared to last year when there were pandemic-related shutdowns. We continue to capitalize on global e-commerce growth and increased demands for recyclable materials, fiber-based solutions and automated packaging that minimizes waste. In medical, pharma and life sciences, we play a key role in the COVID-19 vaccine distribution benefit from growth in online shipments of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals.
Now turning to Slide 7 for an update on SEE Automation. In the first half of the year, equipment, systems and service sales were up 26% and accounted for 8% of our net sales. We're on track to achieve approximately $425 million or 12% growth in 2021, of which more than $250 million will come from equipment and systems. Our bookings for automated equipment are strong. We're confident in our ability to exceed $500 million by 2025. When you factor in a 3x plus solutions multiplier, including growth in parts and service from the installed base and the flow-through of materials, this results in a $5 billion plus potential growth opportunity over the 10-year solutions life cycle. The solutions multiple is why we are so excited about SEE Automation.
Let me now turn to Slide 8 and talk about sustainability. Sustainability is in everything we do and fueling our growth. We are making significant progress on our 2025 sustainability pledge with nearly 50% of our solutions already designed for recyclability. Our innovation strategy is focused on maintaining the high-quality standards that our customers are accustomed to in food safety, minimizing waste and protecting goods. We are continuously optimizing our high-performance materials and incorporating more recycled and/or renewable content to drive circularity and make sustainability more affordable. We're also collaborating and investing with partners on mechanical and advanced recycling.
As part of SEE Ventures, we recently joined the Closed Loop Circulars Plastics Fund. This fund invests in scalable recycling technology, equipment upgrades and infrastructure solutions to advance the recovery of plastics in the U.S. and Canada. You can see a handful of our solutions designed for recyclability on this slide with many more shared on our website.
Earlier this year, we established a net-zero carbon emissions goal across our operations by 2040. We're taking many actions to reduce our energy consumption, such as investing in touchless automation, upgrading air compression systems and utilizing LED lighting. We're also investing in renewable energy sources, including solar and wind. Between 2012 and 2020, our greenhouse gas emissions intensity decreased by a remarkable 50%. We'll share more details in our upcoming annual sustainability report that will be available on our website in the early fall.
I'll now pass the call to Chris to review our results in more detail. Chris?"
382724,1671863630,2360844,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. In the second quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 15% as reported, up 11% in constant dollars. Food was up 6% in",1434,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. In the second quarter, net sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 15% as reported, up 11% in constant dollars. Food was up 6% in constant dollars versus last year, and protective increased 20%. EMEA and the Americas were both up double digits: EMEA up 16%; and the Americas up 13%. APAC was flat versus last year with a modest decline in volumes, offset by favorable price. 
On Slide 10, you see organic sales volume and pricing trends by segment and by region. In the second quarter, overall volume growth was up 9% on favorable price of 3%. Let's start with volumes. Food volumes were up 4%; with the Americas, up 7%; and EMEA up 2%. This was offset by a 3% decline in APAC, largely related to Australia herd rebuilding. Protective volumes were up 15%; with the Americas, up 13%; and EMEA up 36%, while APAC had a modest decline. 
Q2 price was favorable 3%. You can see that Protective had 5% in favorable pricing, and Food was 1% due to timing of pricing actions and formula pass-throughs. We have implemented several price increases and expect 2021 price realization to be $275 million. 
On Slide 11, we present our consolidated sales and adjusted EBITDA walks. Having already discussed sales, let me comment on our adjusted EBITDA performance in Q2. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $263 million, up 1% compared to last year, and margins of 19.8%, down 280 basis points, reflecting the impact of the current inflationary environment and supply chain disruptions. We are leveraging our higher volumes at 40% as we experienced a more favorable product mix. Despite favorable pricing in the quarter, you can see how higher input costs weighed on our EBITDA performance with an unfavorable price/cost spread of $36 million. 
Operational costs increased approximately $13 million relative to last year. This increase reflects investments to support growth, inflation on labor and indirect material costs as well as the normalization of spend in the quarter. This was partially offset by $13 million in Reinvent SEE productivity benefits. We expect our price/cost spread to improve sequentially in the third quarter. However, we do not expect to see positive price/cost spread until Q4.
Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $0.79 compared to $0.76 in Q2 2020. Our adjusted tax rate was 25.6%, reflecting a more favorable mix of foreign earnings. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 153 million. We exited the quarter with 150 million shares outstanding. 
Turning to Slide 12. Here, we provide an update on Reinvent SEE. We have achieved $28 million of benefits in the first half of the year and remain on track to realize approximately $65 million in 2021. Our commercial work stream is accelerating innovation and driving new customer wins in core and adjacent markets.
Turning to segment results on Slide 13, starting with Food. In Q2, Food net sales of $737 million were up 6% on a constant dollar basis. Cryovac Barrier Bags and pouches returned to growth, increasing approximately 10% and accounting for nearly 50% of the segment sales. This growth reflects the beginning of food service recovery relative to last year when protein plants and restaurants, sporting events and other large venues were shut down. Sales in case-ready and roll stock retail applications, which accounts for just over 40% of segment sales, were down low single digits as supply disruptions impacted our results. 
In addition, this is against the backdrop of tough comps given the surge in demand from shutdowns a year ago. Equipment parts and sales -- and service sales, which accounts for 8% of the segment, were up nearly 40% in the quarter. We are experiencing increased demand for our automated solutions as our customers around the world invest in their processing plants to upgrade aged equipment and drive productivity. 
Adjusted EBITDA in Food of $158 million in Q2 declined 6% compared to last year with margins at 21.5%, down 360 basis points. This decline was related to elevated input costs, supply disruptions and the timing of pricing actions.
On Slide 14, we highlight Protective segment results. In constant dollars, net sales increased 20% to $592 million. Industrial was up approximately 30% relative to last year when automobile and general manufacturers were forced to temporarily shut down their operations. Fulfillment, which is largely driven by e-commerce growth, was up approximately 10% on a global basis, led by double-digit growth in automated equipment, inflatable solutions, paper and temperature assurance. We leveraged our broad portfolio and global scale to meet increased demand despite ongoing supply issues, such as industry-related chip shortages out of Asia. The $30 million investments in capacity that Ted referenced earlier will help us meet increased customer demands for automation equipment. As a reminder, approximately 55% of our Protective sales are derived from industrial end markets and the remaining 45% from fulfillment and e-commerce. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $107 million increased 17% from Q2 with margins at 18.1%, down 100 basis points versus last year. Higher sales and productivity gains helped mitigate higher input and supply disruption costs. 
Now let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 15. In the first half of 2021, we generated $102 million of free cash flow. Relative to the same period last year, higher earnings and lower restructuring payments were offset by higher employee-related costs and CapEx investments to support growth and innovation. 
On Slide 16, we outline our capital allocation strategy. We will maintain a strong balance sheet while driving attractive returns on invested capital and supporting profitable growth initiatives. In addition, we have a healthy acquisition pipeline that aligns with our growth strategy. 
On this slide, I want to highlight our growth investments. We are focusing our CapEx on breakthrough processes, automation, digital and sustainability. With SEE Ventures, we have invested approximately $40 million in early-stage disruptive technologies and business models that are expected to accelerate our strategy and innovation efforts. 
As it relates to returning capital to shareholders, in Q2, we were an active buyer of our stock. We repurchased 6.1 million shares for $299 million during the first 6 months of 2021, reflecting confidence in our vision, strategy and execution. And as Ted noted, today, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program, continuing our commitment to return value to shareholders. This new program has no expiration date and replaces the previous authorization. During the second quarter, we also announced an increase to our quarterly cash dividend of 25%. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 to review our updated 2021 outlook. We are raising our net sales guidance, reflecting strong first half sales performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. For net sales, we estimate $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion or 10% to 12% as-reported growth and 8% to 10% in constant dollars compared to our previously provided $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion range. At the midpoint, the $150 million increase in constant dollar sales largely reflects additional pricing. 
We continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion. On a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow 7% to 9%. Higher sales are expected to help offset increased material and supply disruption costs. Given the timing of pricing actions, we anticipate a modest sequential improvement in EBITDA in Q3 with a more meaningful improvement in Q4. 
We are raising our 2021 outlook for adjusted EPS to $3.45 to $3.60, and we continue to expect a 45-55 first half, second half percentage split. Our outlook assumes 153 million average shares outstanding, 1 million reduction from our prior guidance, given share repurchases in the first half, and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 26%. 
And lastly, our free cash flow outlook continues to be $520 million to $570 million. There is no change to our outlook for 2021 CapEx of approximately $210 million and Reinvent SEE restructuring and associated payments of approximately $40 million. 
As you can see on the slide, we wanted to provide a few variables as it relates to our 2021 guidance range. The low end of our range would assume the magnitude and duration of material inflation and supply chain headwinds persist longer than anticipated and a slower pace of food service recovery. The high end implies market and geographic share gains; continued strength in automation, industrials, e-commerce and food; and overperformance of our SEE Operating Engine. 
With that, let me now pass the call back to Ted for closing remarks. Ted?"

But Ghansham, before we get to your question for everybody on the call, I did want to add some clarity to the Q&A and make a brief comment. Late yesterday, we announced that we received notification from the SEC staff that our previously disclosed investigation has concluded as it relates to Sealed Air and that the SEC does not intend to recommend any enforcement action against the company. As I'm sure everybody can appreciate, our comments are limited to the SEC documents that were filed publicly, including in our press release and Form 10-Q, which we're going to file later with the SEC. Throughout this process, though, I just want to highlight, we fully cooperated with the SEC's investigation, and we are pleased to put this matter behind us. 
So let's get back to your question, Ghansham. And Chris, if you can handle the first part, and I'll handle the second."

So I think you mentioned just in terms of Page 17 for our overall slide, if I recall, you said that Slide 17, which provides an update on our outlook on net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS",330,"Sure. Ghansham, are you still there? Okay. Let's continue on. So I think you mentioned just in terms of Page 17 for our overall slide, if I recall, you said that Slide 17, which provides an update on our outlook on net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. As we see overall performance in terms of the top line, very strong growth in the quarter, as we mentioned. If I was to change -- if we were just to kind of reflect what we said in the May time frame and bridge it to what we view now in terms of top line growth, we increased -- last quarter, we increased the top line by $150 million. And we mentioned that 50% of that was going to be price, and 50% of that was going to be volume. This quarter, we're up -- we're going up another incremental $150 million, mostly driven by price with a small amount of volume improvement.
What we're most strengthful for is the Protective side of our business, especially out of EMEA, where we saw extremely strong growth, as we commented in our prepared remarks. So that gave us confidence coming off first quarter, second quarter, first half of the year, leading into the next year to increase our guidance $150 million. And that's how we feel pretty good about the performance. 
And the execution in terms of the bottom line, we talked about the price increases -- multiple price increases that are necessary in light of this significant inflationary environment that we are in, multiple price increases throughout the year to make up for that difference, hoping to close that gap in the second half. 
And I did want to comment that our third quarter, we do expect a slight improvement to 2Q. But as I mentioned, that fourth quarter is where we'd see the bigger lift when formula-based pricing and other pricing actions kick in, in a more meaningful way."

And we're excited about -- we made previous investments, and you've heard us talk about our SEE Ventures. We're investing in sustainability, using our balance sheet to go side by side with some really interesting investments that are out there. 
What we like about Closed Loop is it lines exactly where we're going. They focus on sustainability. They're focusing on the carbon footprint and taking -- is taking the process from a linear process where you make a product and then it ends up into the ocean or landfill. How do you bring circularity to bring that waste back and recycle it, whether it's chemical recycling, et cetera? 
But the other part we like about their strategy is that they also connected to earnings growth, so they focus on the circular economy. How do we do that in a way to drive earnings?
Also, our investment allows us to see what other interesting incubating technologies that they're looking at, so we can see inside and be early investors some pretty exciting technology in this space, recycled products and businesses that are out there. 
So we're going to be investing side by side, but it really ties into our strategy of linking sustainability to our carbon-neutral goals but then also that we're in the business to protect. And in the business part is how we're connecting it to the earnings, okay?"

And then just to confirm on the pricing side. So it implies about 9% pricing year-over-year in the back half, I presume more fourth quarter weighted. Can you just maybe clarify for us kind of how we should think about the raw material cost trajectory through the second half?"

Maybe I'll take the second part first because what we've seen just coming off the announcement we made yesterday in terms of the press release overall pricing, if we go back to the first quarter call, we talked about an incremental headwind on resins and chemicals. Primarily, this material inflation heading our way, roughly $150 million. What we're seeing now is more like $300-plus million. And as a result, we have implemented multiple price increases. More to come, as we communicated. The realization of that price increase, as I -- in my prepared remarks, talking about just the overall -- it's the second half -- that $150 million increase to the full year guidance mostly is driven by price. 
Your first part of your question is just overall volumes. The strength of Protective really can be commented in terms of the Americas. And specifically, EMEA has been extremely strong. Some of that being on unfavorable comps completely -- clearly towards the second half of the year. But as we look at the second half, the momentum that's moving into that part of the year, we just see Protective continue to be strengthened. And there's no one particular area. It's kind of across the board. 
I don't know, Ted, if you have anything to add as it relates to overall volume for the second half. But it seems to be, again, leading the Americas and leading out of EMEA with Asia Pac catching up in the second half."

Chris will tell you, make sure we do what we say we're going to do. And I'll give you a little bit of the excitement that we'll get through this journey is we put in the press release, we went directly to our customers as well about our price increase. So it's pretty significant. What we've swallowed through the engine right now, it's going through the engine. We'll -- we'd like to get through this in the second quarter but significant input costs. But behind that, the engine is working. The productivity and the leverage behind that, as Chris highlighted, were leveraging at 40%. But that input costs, we've got to get through, and we think we'll get through it by the end of the year. We're not going to tell you which quarter because we don't know, but we are aggressively working that model that we showed on Slide 5. That will happen, and that's the guide where we're showing you where we're going in 2022 now and beyond. So some of the specifics that we're driving, it's really using our automation to get that through and help our customers. 
So just -- I'll give you a little bit of detail. If you look at Slide 7 where we look at our whole portfolio. Go -- I'm sorry. Go to Slide 6. So if you look at our portfolio of products, of what's going to -- we do 30 billion packages. So if you just think about that with our whole portfolio and you took that 30 billion, this $5 billion company, take equipment away, so we're talking about the average price for our package is around $0.16. Well, with this dramatic input cost, that's going to go from $0.16 to $0.18. Oh, and by the way, we're going to make it sustainable. And by the way, we're going digital. So we're going to actually take that probably up from $0.16 to $0.20, and we're being very transparent with the market that's coming. So what do we do? We got to drive automation. So the automation is where our growth is coming, where we can save our customers millions to afford those few cents per packaging.
So as we get through this and we swallow this incredible inflationary period, we are spending a huge amount of time with our customers in driving the automation. And to hit that sales growth number and our whole portfolio beyond Protective and Food that we are going to be driving the automation, digital and sustainable solutions, and you can see in the numbers that we're excited by going through this double digit, up 30% more; even the bookings, which we're tracking and tracing, up significantly. 
So we're investing there heavily. We're working with our customers. We will swallow this inflationary period. The timing of it, we don't know exactly. But for sure, by the end of the year, we think we're going to do quite well, and we'd like to end on that model. The model will continue to perform going into next year."

And are you finding that it is one for one?
And then kind of the related part 2 is you gave us color on your automation sales and the initiatives there in Food. Could you remind us, I don't remember hearing it, what the automation performance was in -- for Protective in the quarter, and overall, how that's helping you drive more operating leverage across both businesses?"

But going back into detail on how we're doing this with our customers -- and remember, the customers are listening to this call with us as well. So the -- I've been very direct and through this -- even this past quarter been meeting with the CEOs of some of our major customers literally around the world, most of those being virtual. So we've been very open. 
The package -- our pricing is going up on the materials. So to your question on the pricing side of it, we want to share with them again that package pricing is going to go up a few cents. But where the real savings for them, it's millions of how do we automate their operations. And their issues right now are labor scarcity, the safety of COVID, how can we get in there and fully automate. So take these -- there are millions of packages and save that money. So we're not talking to them about actually the price increase. We're talking about how we can save them money, knowing that those materials are going to be more expensive.
At the table with them, we're also learning even more challenges that they're having. We're not the only ones that are experiencing higher input costs to our customers. So again, we're going even further into their facilities and actually bringing our ops teams into -- with our customers to show them how we could potentially help them make their facilities more productive, safer and driving the level of automation. So yes, it's a pricing discussion, very direct, but it's really how can we save them money. So I'll keep pointing to Slide 7, and that this is how we're selling that automation story to our customers. 
The second part of your question, I'll start and maybe if Chris wants to add more detail. Your question is, is that -- is the equipment and the automation story coming in the Protective side. Absolutely, especially with fulfillment centers. We're seeing the automation come into these high-volume fulfillment centers very aggressively. 
What we used to do in the old model is we would give that equipment away, even with our iconic Bubble Wrap. We actually can make Bubble Wrap on demand by the push of a button and create the Bubble Wrap right in the fulfillment center. But really, the growth in Protective has been with AUTOBAG. The acquisition that we've made with AUTOBAG and what they're doing with automation has been tremendous for us, especially in this environment, bringing our AUTOBAG systems into the fulfillment center so that you can actually load the package more effectively and efficiently and bring those high-value materials around the package is where the growth right now through the pandemic is really, really strong, and we think more to come. And we're taking that to our Food business as well.
So to our customers, they think industrial is what we do because if you look at food plant, they actually call that an industrial operation. So just sharing with you, it covers all of our customers. The short answer on the pricing is we got to save them more money, so we got to work harder, and automation is a great story to be at the table through these challenging times."

The first quarter call, we talked about trying to drive pricing actions through productivity, et cetera, to mitigate the concern on our EBITDA performance.

You mentioned $25 million, exactly right. We kind of view it as this $25 million to $30 million of negative price/cost spread for the full year based on what we know today.
So as I mentioned, just driving that volume -- incremental volume growth in terms of bottom line performance and productivity to try to help offset that is how we overcome that to maintain our EBITDA range. And we stay committed to that as of now through the first half, obviously, of the year."

We expect, assuming no additional pressure from an inflationary environment, that we're going to recoup some of that material cost inflation going into next year given formula-based pricing.
But specific to your question around the second half of the year, maybe thinking through Food's contribution as well as Protective's contribution or what that whole dynamic is between material cost inflation and price/cost spread, we see both segments being under pressure in the third quarter, as I mentioned earlier. Some improvement from Q2, clearly. But as you look to the fourth quarter, you see both segments contributing positively from a price/cost spread. 
For Food, clearly, more benefit from formula-based pricing, but we're also implementing price on the non-formula. And Protective, given the pricing actions we've taken, will start to materialize as well. So you got this big lift in Q4 as we see the price benefit of the actions -- the price/cost spread benefit of the actions we've taken on price."

And again, if you remember, year-over-year, the first half, what we're competing with that tough comp of second quarter last year when -- during when the shutdowns hit, the bag business on Food was really, really strong. Boy, we leveraged nicely on bags. But behind that, we had food service pretty much shut down with restaurants. And that's the pouch business as we go into our liquids and the tomato paste, et cetera. So we had those 2 things work, so we see that moving in the second quarter. We just can't tell you the timing on it. So we see the fluids and the pouch business, which is extremely attractive business to us, picking up. And we will be gaining on that in the second half, and again, going into next year. So Food is really a tale of 2 markets, but it's also the same with the Protective where we had the industrial and e-commerce. So that is shifting in the quarter. 
But behind all that, I just want to continually highlight the engine is working on driving the productivity on both of those internally. So that's giving us our confidence to drive -- getting through this, driving it through the end of the year and into 2022."

Kind of ending the quarter, a little early to tell because the inflationary environment, just as we were here 90 days ago, if you will, talking about the full year '21, extremely dynamic environment. It's -- right now, our projections -- our estimates for the full year show a nice improvement in Q4 for purposes of margin, without a doubt. The sustainability of those margins going into 2022, we'll have to assess based on the inflationary environment.
As you know, our business ranges from 20%, 21% to 23%, 24% EBITDA margin, just depending on the dynamics in a particular quarter. What we're trying to drive for, not only in that incremental volume growth and the leverage off of that, is getting back to our operating model is to be able to drive EBITDA margins approaching 24%, 25% over time given the Operating Engine in terms of the ability to generate cash and fuel it back into the business.

We're driving -- we're doing everything we can to try to minimize the impact we feel there to maintain that full year guidance. 
Our expectation is that we're still in this inflationary environment. We do expect it to continue, call it, for another month or 2. But I'll tell you, that makes us nervous a little bit, even make that statement, because of the dynamic we've seen over the past 3 months. We will react to it accordingly, of course, in terms of driving productivity and pricing actions as necessary. But we're hopeful that this thing starts to plateau, kind of level out, and we continue to kind of move forward. 
But internally, when you think about our risks and opportunities, and as we share -- we like to share with investors when we put on our guidance slide kind of the downside as well as the upside to our outlook. You can see the downside, clearly, still is that dramatic material inflation continues, the supply disruptions, et cetera, but we'll manage through it. 
But -- so let me focus on the positives. The positives are the global reach of our company, the share gains, the opportunity. We already talked about the equipment piece of it in terms of what we're doing and how we're driving. We hope to exceed that $425 million, as I mentioned before, and then between Ted and myself, just continuing to reiterate the operating engine. The backbone that we have in place to drive productivity is there. It's real. It's happening, and we'll continue to pursue it.
Regarding the Delta variant and the implications that has on our business, I kind of view it as every week is a new week. Almost every day is a new day as we hear more about it. It has us clearly concerned. And one side of the business potentially may do better as it relates to the retail food side, if you will. We did see some early signs of recovery on the service side.

So we have -- our Asia team is being aggressive on how do we drive growth in such a large region. But right now, in our guidance, we have a tepid number out there, but we think we have an opportunity. 
Really, it's the same issue, though. It's what can we do in automation. We're driving some significant wins. Those will materialize. Some of them, you don't see because they're in the bookings. And the bookings, the good news why we have confidence, we can now see those bookings numbers are up that will be realized. And so we see some opportunity in Asia Pacific. 
It's a huge opportunity for us, especially, same thing, the industrial, e-commerce. And the Food business, if you're reading what's going on with the African swine fever, huge industrial growth opportunity as China is converting from that wet to dry. Some of those huge pork plants, those industrial plants that we're connected with are under construction, are being built. Will they be realized this year? No. But we see lots of opportunity in Asia Pacific.
As far as our portfolio, when it's only 15%, it's not moving the needle, but we're excited about the opportunity to get Asia Pacific more into our numbers for the future. So we've got some work to do there. Good question."

We appreciate your interest in SEE and hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. 
We're working through very exciting and challenging times as we continue to transform SEE. You can see on Slide 3, our strategy to become a world-class digitally-driven company, automating sustainable packaging solutions. 
On today's call, I'll recap our third quarter 2021 performance. I'll share our strategy for growth in automation, digital and sustainability within our global core markets. Chris will review our financial results and outlook in more detail. I will end with closing remarks before opening the call for Q&A. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 for a review of our third quarter 2021 results. Net sales increased 13% in constant dollars with volume growth of 5% and price realization of 8%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4%. Higher volumes and pricing efforts helped mitigate inflationary pressures and supply disruptions, yet our industry-leading margins were still under pressure at 19.2% compared to 21% last year. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings of $0.86 were up $0.04 compared to last year. We generated free cash flow of $223 million in the first 9 months of the year, which compared with $292 million in the first 9 months of last year. 
Our SEE operating engine is performing. SEE touchless automation and sustainable packaging solutions are generating demand, growth and delivering productivity savings. 
I want to highlight our SEE operating model on Slide 5, which defines we're taking SEE in what you should expect us to deliver. Our innovations in automation, digital and sustainability continue to gain momentum and are driving our growth above our traditional packaging markets. We are targeting adjusted earnings per share growth of greater than 10% and free cash flow conversion of more than 50%. 
Our SEE operating model generates significant cash from our purpose-driven approach to capital allocation. To fuel our growth, we're increasing our CapEx investments for innovation and touchless automation. 
SEE Ventures investments. We're using our balance sheet to incubate disruptive technologies and new business models to accelerate our pace of innovation and speed to market. 
We continue to return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We further strengthened our capital structure with a $600 million new bond issuance in the third quarter. For SEE, this is our first secured investment-grade bond in the company's history. The proceeds were used to pay down existing debt. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, which highlights our market-driven solutions powered by our iconic brands. We encourage you to visit our website where you can read about our innovation and customer success stories. 
We create measurable value for our customers through automated and sustainable solutions that are designed to maximize food safety, minimize waste, protect goods and deliver productivity savings. 
Sales in our automation portfolio, which includes equipment, services and spare parts have increased approximately 20% year-to-date, accounting for 8% of our total sales. Autobag systems are our fastest-growing [ auto ] solution with year-to-date sales up more than 25% and bookings up approximately 50%. 
For proteins, equipment, spare parts and service sales are up double digits year-to-date. Our protein automation pipeline continues to grow across all regions with major food producers committing to our SEE touchless automation future. 
Our automated equipment and service sales have a strong pull-through for our high performance sustainable materials. 
Our unique approach to automation is strengthened with our digital solutions. Through our SEE Smart smart packaging enabled with our patented digital printing, we are creating touchless digital connectivity from our operations to our customers and to consumers' homes. This level of connectivity is transformational for our customers. It enables us to be embedded into our customers' operations where we can drive significant savings to their bottom line. Our customers are buying into our automation future. 
In addition to growth in automation, the recovery in food service and our innovations in fluids are driving increased demand for high-performance, sustainable Cryovac barrier bags, pouches and case-ready applications across all regions. In the quarter, our fastest-growing food solutions was our Cryovac pouches designed for fluids and liquids with double-digit sales growth. 
We continue to benefit from the industrial recovery and strength in automation designed for e-commerce fulfillment. We're seeing significant shift in our fulfillment portfolio towards automation and sustainable solutions. 
In industrials, we delivered mid- to high single-digit volume growth. In fulfillment, we experienced double-digit volume growth in automation, paper systems and temperature assurance solutions. 
Although we face global supply challenges across our business, our team is doing a nice job of minimizing disruptions and delivering on increased demands. 
I also want to highlight that we recently launched a new innovative Bubble Wrap on-demand inflator system designed for industrial and fulfillment customers. You can see the illustration of this system on the right side of this slide. It features smart technology that recognizes the type of film that's loaded and easily switches between material types, whether it's in simple cushioning, pouches or air fill ups. 
SEE is becoming an automation company. On Slide 7, you can see how we are making this happen. For the full year, we expect to exceed our $425 million sales target or over 12% growth in equipment, system and services. We're confident in our ability to exceed our 2025 target of over $750 million, which is more than $500 million will come from equipment and systems. 
Over the last 12 months, our bookings are up significantly, even though supply disruptions persist. The pandemic accelerated demand for automation. As I noted earlier, we're highlighting the success of our Autobag systems portfolio with bookings up approximately 50% year-to-date and more than 60% since the start of the pandemic. This accelerated systems demand will drive up to 7x future pull-through for materials and services over the equipment life cycle. 
We currently are experiencing a significant increase in Autobag material orders and we're investing in innovation and capacity expansions to meet this increased demand. 
Our year-over-year bookings growth in [ Autobox ] is also notable. Our touchless automation value proposition resonates with customers as we're generating significant operational savings in taking our strategic partnerships to the next level. 
Let me now turn to Slide 8 and talk about sustainability. Sustainability is in everything we do, and it starts with our purpose-driven culture and values to how we innovate and invest to generate growth. Sustainability is core to our responsible sourcing of raw materials, our carbon footprint as well as our efforts to advance circularity of packaging materials with our customers and suppliers. You can see on this slide our environmental goals and our sustainability pledge. Our long-term targets are ambitious and lead the industry towards a better future. 
As it relates to climate change, we are doing our part with an ambitious pledge to achieve net zero carbon emissions across our operations by 2040. We continue to take actions in our own facilities to reduce energy consumption with incremental investments in touchless automation and renewable energy sources. 
We are making significant progress on our 2025 sustainability pledge with approximately 50% of our solutions already designed for recyclability, which have reached approximately 20% recycled and/or renewable content in those solutions. We designed our high-performance materials with recyclability in mind to make sustainability more affordable and to create a pathway for a circular economy. 
You can see on this slide how touchless automation is transforming our operations, our customers' operations and enabling a circular economy. We are innovating in smart packaging, incorporating digital technology in delivering supply chain efficiency, sustainability and brand engagement with our customers. 
We are excited to share that in early October, we published our global impact report that highlights our ESG priorities and commitments, related initiatives, our progress and performance. We highlight how SEE is shaping the future of the packaging industry and progressing towards our bold environmental targets. 
I'll now pass the call to Chris to review our results in more detail. Chris?"

Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. In Q3, net sales totaled $1.4 billion, up 14% as reported, up 13% in constant dollars. Food was up 12% in constant dollar",1266,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. In Q3, net sales totaled $1.4 billion, up 14% as reported, up 13% in constant dollars. Food was up 12% in constant dollars versus last year, and protective increased 13%. The Americas and EMEA were both up double digits, with Americas up 14% and EMEA up 13%. APAC was up 6% versus last year. 
On Slide 10, you see organic sales volume and pricing trends by segment and by region. In Q3, overall volume growth was up 5% with favorable price of 8%. 
Let's start with volumes. Food volumes were up 6%, with growth across all regions. Americas, up 5%; EMEA, 6% and APAC, 7%. Protective volumes were up 4%, led by EMEA with 16% growth, followed by APAC up 4% and Americas essentially flat to prior year. Q3 price was favorable 8% with protective at 10% and food at 7%. Formula based pass-throughs primarily in Food North America are now better aligned with input costs. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect to realize more than $275 million in price given additional pricing announcements since our last call as well as timing of formula-based pricing. 
As we head into 2022, we will be announcing additional price increases effective December 1 in response to continued inflationary pressures. This increase will vary based on region and product offering, and will average between 5% and 10%. 
We are engaging directly with our customers to meet increased demand with automation and alternative solutions that drive productivity savings. 
On Slide 11, we present our consolidated sales and adjusted EBITDA loss. Having already discussed sales, let me comment on our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance of $271 million, which was up 4% compared to last year. Margins of 19.2% were down 180 basis points. 
Despite favorable pricing in the quarter, you can see how the inflationary environment and supply challenges weighed on our results with an unfavorable price/cost spread of $18 million. Operational costs decreased approximately $3 million relative to last year with Reinvent SEE productivity gains and a $5 million benefit related to an indirect tax recovery in Brazil. Our SEE operating engine is performing with 40% leverage on higher volumes. 
In the month of September, price/cost spread turned favorable. In Q4, we expect this favorable trend to continue. Adjusted earnings per diluted share in Q3 was $0.86 compared to $0.82 in Q3 2020. Our adjusted tax rate was 24.9% compared to 20.6% in Q3 2020. The prior year tax rate included the benefit of U.S. GILTI regulations issued in 2020. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 151 million. 
Turning to Slide 12. Here, we provide an update on Reinvent SEE, which is now the foundation of our SEE operating engine. We achieved $43 million of benefits in the first 9 months of the year and remain on track to realize approximately $65 million in 2021. 
Turning to segment results on Slide 13, starting with food. In Q3, food net sales of $797 million were up 12% in constant dollars. Cryovac barrier bags and pouches were up for the second consecutive quarter versus last year, and combined, accounted for nearly 50% of the segment sales. Sales in case-ready and roll stock applications were also up as food service recovers and retail demand remained strong. 
Equipment parts and service sales, which account for 7% of the segment were up low single digits in the quarter. As Ted noted, we are experiencing strong demand in protein automation and continue to build our pipeline. Adjusted EBITDA of $169 million in Q3 increased 11% compared to last year, with margins at 21.2%, down 40 basis points. Higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity gains offset elevated costs. 
On Slide 14, we highlight protective segment results. In constant dollars, net sales increased 13% to $609 million. Relative to last year, industrial was up more than 15% and fulfillment, up approximately 7%. 
We faced supply chain disruptions throughout the quarter and leveraged our broad portfolio and global footprint to meet customer demands where possible. 
As a reminder, approximately 55% of our protective sales are derived from industrial end markets and the remaining 45% from fulfillment and e-commerce. Adjusted EBITDA of $103 million decreased 5.5% in Q3 with margins at 16.9%, down 350 basis points versus last year. We incurred transitory headwinds, including nonmaterial inflation and labor challenges, which more than offset higher volumes and pricing actions. 
Let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 15. In the first 9 months of 2021, we generated $223 million of free cash flow. Relative to the same period last year, higher earnings and lower restructuring payments were offset by the impact of higher employee-related costs, cash tax payments and CapEx investments to support growth and innovation. 
On Slide 16, we outlined our purpose-driven capital allocation strategy focused on creating economic value. We maintain a strong balance sheet while driving attractive returns on invested capital and supporting profitable growth initiatives. 
As Ted mentioned, I want to highlight that during Q3, we executed a $600 million 5-year senior secured bond at 1.573%. The proceeds of this offering were used to pay down $425 million senior unsecured notes at 4.875% due in 2022 and $175 million prepayable term loan debt. 
To support our growth initiatives, we are focusing our CapEx on touchless automation, digital and sustainability. We are expanding our capacity and equipment to align with customer demands and support continued growth. We are investing in smart packaging and digital printing and see opportunities to expand our presence in attractive growth markets and geographies. We are managing our product portfolio with discipline to ensure alignment with our growth strategy. 
As it relates to returning capital to shareholders, we have repurchased 6.6 million shares or $329 million year-to-date September, reflecting confidence in our future growth. At quarter end, we have approximately $970 million remaining under our authorized repurchase program. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 to review our updated 2021 outlook given our performance year-to-date through September. For net sales, we now estimate approximately $5.5 billion or up approximately 12% as-reported growth to reflect the favorable demand environment and pricing actions. This compares to our previous range of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. We expect a favorable currency impact of approximately 1.5%. 
Given the current environment, we now anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.12 billion to $1.14 billion. On a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow 6.5% to 8.5%. This compares to our previous guide of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion. 
For adjusted EPS, we expect to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.60, the higher end of our previous guidance. This assumes depreciation and amortization of $230 million and adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 26% and approximately 152.5 million average shares outstanding. 
And lastly, our outlook for free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $520 million to $540 million. There is no change to our outlook for 2021 CapEx of approximately $210 million and Reinvent SEE restructuring and associated payments of approximately $40 million. 
For cash taxes, we anticipate approximately $110 million, which is net of a $24 million tax refund associated with the retroactive application of the revised U.S. GILTI regulations. 
As we close out the year and enter 2022, we are executing on our growth strategy, driving productivity and aligning our business with our SEE operating model. 
With that, let me now pass the call back to Ted for closing remarks. Ted?"

We recognize there's a lot of good things going on in automation. If I'm remembering the numbers correctly, where are you seeing the deceleration? 
And relatedly, within protective, you called out supply chain headwinds, and it's notable that EBIT was down in the quarter, even though you did a really good job relative to 2Q and 1Q on price/cost. Can you quantify what was going on in protective relative to the growth rate there?"

So if you look at equipment, and if I can point to our deck on the equipment slide, which is Slide 7, if you unpack what's going on with equipment year-to-date, as you highlighted, we highlighted it up over 20%. In the quarter, there was a little bit of on the actual shipments, on the sales, there was some slowdown. It was less than -- it was high single digit, but the slowdown was due to comps from last year, but also supply disruptions. 
As you're dealing with other equipment companies, you're out there -- don't want to go through all those issues, but they're real and getting the equipment installed, et cetera, et cetera. So what we're really focusing on -- and by the way, we're working with our customers on all those issues, but we're really focusing on as we really transform this into an equipment company is what are the bookings? How are the bookings doing? 
The bookings are still very, very strong. And they're strong across the board. So not worried about that. We got a lot of issues in place. And actually, again, we're using the equipment story to handle the situations with our customers because their #1 issue is labor shortage. So we are right there with them and solving that. So actually, when we talk about some of our thoughts on 2022, you'll see why this is what we're quite confident this momentum will build forward. 
The second part of the question, I might try to get Chris to tag team on that, and that is what's going on with the bridge, with the protective and food."

I just want to check in to see if it's on both segments? Or is it just skewed towards one? 
And then with protective, comparisons get quite a bit more difficult from a volume standpoint, 4Q onwards. Obviously, there's considerable supply chain constraints, auto OEM and just industrial markets in general. How do you sort of see that playing out?

Look, just kind of calibrate it that way. It's not a huge number. We're just glad to see it be positive and pretty much reflected both in food and protective. 
And that momentum, we expect to continue. So our guide, if you will, assumes that we're going to get incremental to our sequential improvement from Q3, roughly $40 million to potentially $50 million of incremental price to be expected to be able to achieve the midpoint of our guide for full year and then how that relates back to fourth quarter. 
And then maybe your specific question relative to protective. Volumes continue to be strong. I've made my comments earlier in terms of the margin profile. We're doing everything we can to be able to meet that demand heading into Q4. So it's great to get that volume. We'd like to see better margin improvement. 
But at the same time, we recognize that this is a temporary kind of transitory type of challenges that we're working through. And our supply chain team is doing the best they can to get product to our facilities to be able to satisfy that demand.

I mean, our midpoint last quarter's call in terms of the top line and then as we move forward in terms of adjusting and tightening that range specifically, around $5.5 billion for the full year, is driven by volume. So it's our expectation of volume. Although we're hopeful to be able to achieve better than that $275 million, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that's hopefully what we'll see. 
We're counting on it in terms of our EBITDA range guidance for the full year. But we would expect to be at or better than that $275 million. So the teams have done a nice job working that. Literally, partnering with our customers to make sure that demand is satisfied. Everyone recognizes the environment we're in relative to these inflationary pressures, and we're working our best with customers to be able to satisfy their demand at the same time as we commented, help their operations from a productivity point of view."

If you go to our Slide 5 with what's happening in the fourth quarter and on price, which has been the big issue for us. We've had three quarters we've been chasing those input costs. So we -- as Chris highlighted in his prepared remarks, we saw a turn in September. So that's what's giving us confidence to hit that -- our fourth quarter and really building into the momentum into 2022. 
So if you look at our slide, you could see where we're giving you, this is where the model is driving. So to unpack that a little bit for you, if you look at our organic sales, that's been strong this year. We're looking to that momentum to continue to be strong and actually exceed that going into next year. And then you had price on top of that. So you see some strong volumes into 2022. 
And then the conversion on that on the earnings is going to be with the price now going positive in the quarter, you're going to see a pretty significant change in our profitability in the fourth quarter compared to the first three quarters being ahead on the price. You'll see not only our operating leverage on the volume that we've been consistently hitting well over that 30%, you're going to see the price coming in as well. 
Going into 2022, we're still going to have some supply constraints, and we still think we're going to have those inflationary pressures. So they're happening. It's going to be a little bit different than the resin because we do think that should be starting to flatten but just to catch up on all the other inflationary costs. But we still think we're going to be ahead. And we think our EBITDA growth percentage is going to outweigh our sales. 
So we're going to have some margin expansion going into next year and then that flows with getting over 10% on EPS and our cash generation. So we're seeing this momentum in the fourth quarter being led by price, taking us into a strong 2022."

So if we look at our Slide 8, I believe, or Slide 8, when we talk about what are we doing in sustainability, what are we doing with automation. So if you look at this picture of what we do, we have roughly 1 billion pounds of resin. And plus add to 250 million pounds of paper that go in to produce 30 billion packages. So that's the big picture of what we do. 
So to your question on disruptive technology, we're bringing automation into our facilities. We're actually bringing some pretty unique operations, creating some touchless systems that are enabling us to change how we make a product. 
In this example that we have here on this slide, this is where we're taking, in our food business, instead of taking our -- creating the bag, we fold them up into a box. We're now fully automating that and putting it into a high-density roll. So actually we're finishing -- making the bag in our customers' operations. 
So this one example here, this is a -- order that's coming in is we're actually able to now go to a high-density roll, finish making the bag in our customers' operations. We're eliminating in this one example 87,000 boxes a year. So it's dramatic carbon footprint change. Dramatic environmental change, but also the productivity and it's saving customers' labor, which is significant. So very disruptive. 
And then now we're bringing our high-performance materials into the system, introducing some of the digital technology actually, printing right there now in our customers' facilities versus where we used to print in our plants. So this is orders in process, and this is where our future is going to be. 
And then you could see taking it all the way to the consumer in the home, bringing our digital technology so that you can see through the package, know what material is made out of, know what's going on with the protein inside. So pretty excited about making this happen. And this is -- this reality is happening as we speak, especially right now in the protein market. So I'll turn to your Reinvent SEE."

Given the successful program, you're right, pretty much coming up towards the end of the program in '21. Don't expect meaningful carryover into '22.

Meaning every year, the productivity generation of the company to exceed inflation is the goal. 
We're going through our planning period right now for 2022. Not to say we won't be too inconsistent with our SEE operating model in terms of how you think about our performance over time. So we plan on updating investors in the February time frame when we close out '21 and provide more specific guidance relative to 2022. 
But I would comment, there's nothing that we're seeing as a major concern kind of heading into 2022. We're working through these transitory costs. We're getting the favorability of price, as we mentioned, driving productivity in our operations. Feeling good about where we are in terms of the turn, but there's more work to do. So there's a lot going on with the operations right now.

So those will be building up over the cadence of the next 1 to 2 years, and we'll see that. 
Now the rest of the portfolio, and that's where we gave you a little bit of a detail on the -- our automation slide where we wanted to unpack Autobag and actually show you what's going on with Autobag is we looked at our acquisition of automated packaging systems. 
Because we're now looking like an equipment company, we are tracking bookings. And we actually gave a signal to the team. Actually, not within the signal, a direct demand, over 9 months ago, we're going to have to double our capacity, and this is with Autobag. So just unpacking that. We do some food with the Autobag as well so -- which I'm pleased to see that we're all -- we are catching up. We are behind because the book-to-bill is higher than we would like. Our lead times are longer than we'd like. But we're seeing that, and we even went public with our CapEx announcement there, over $30 million, we are catching up. 
And again, going into 2022, we think this will be able to support that significantly strong growth rate that we have for equipment. So I think we're well on our way to exceed the target to get over that $750 million over the next 3 years, 5 years, 4 years, whatever it is. 
But -- so it does -- you are right. These are long-term projects, which actually is exciting because we're embedded with our customers. We're working with their layouts. How do we get our equipment in place and actually embed it into those systems. So long answer simple, the big stuff, the big systems, the multimillion dollar systems are probably 2 to 3 years in planning and execution. But the Autobag systems, those are a matter of less than 3 months, and they should be in weeks and that's what we're working on."

But -- so -- but in the quarter, some of the issues that I mentioned already is we're getting some of those equipment installed on a sales basis, in the quarter, we had some starts and stops. So we think we'll have some recovery in that in the fourth quarter, but still very strong. 
The bookings though, are up significantly. So could the bookings even be higher? Probably. That's why we got to add capacity because those lead times are stretching. So to the cadence and to where you asked the question about labor, right now, this is the hottest thing out there in the market today. Can we help our customers with their labor shortages and automation is the answer. So lots of investment going on in place. We're working with our customers. Taking care of these supply shortages. 
But I want to separate one thing that you said just to understand why we are so excited about our equipment strategy equipment is one piece. The pull-through of the materials is the other aspect of this. So not only had we -- and Autobag specifically, we've had to invest into the material side of that as well. So our materials are up because the pull through, we're actually going to be selling materials faster. 
The last piece on the equipment is we mentioned equipment plus systems. So these large systems that we're selling not only do we have the equipment. Some traditional equipment we've had in the past, some new equipment, but also it's full systems. So we're putting in robotics. We're putting in conveyance systems. We're putting in WMS systems with our customers. 
So the dollar amount is much higher. And we're making the margin is on the savings of the full system. So it's much different than we've done in the past. And we're going to give better and better visibility on how we measure this and how we forecast it going forward."

If we turn to just 2022, just to give some high-level thoughts, the volume -- the operating model that we're driving to this 3% to 5%, given the favorable dynamic we expect to see on price/cost spread, we would expect to have that organic growth in that 3% to 5% category. But then you add on top of that, what we would expect in terms of price being greater than the material inflation or get the price benefit of that. So we're more in the 6% to 7% growth as we see it right now for 2022. 
Now going through the planning period, this assumes -- has a lot of assumptions for material availability, working through these transitory items, which we're working through. But we feel good about the volumes. The underlying volume is there. Getting the labor in place, getting through these disruptions and continue to execute is where we're focused."

Firstly, just building on what you just mentioned about next year, organic sales being a little bit higher than normal because of price/cost.

Firstly, just building on what you just mentioned about next year, organic sales being a little bit higher than normal because of price/cost. Does this mean also we should assume that your EBITDA growth should be at the top end of the 5% to 7% growth rate next year or even above it? 
And also just briefly on capital allocation. You have $300 million in cash -- in free cash flow coming through Q4 based on the full year guidance. What are your thoughts now that we saw you slow down buybacks with regard to M&A or starting -- or going back to repurchase shares even more?"
382724,1684980285,2421324,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Sure, Salvator. Thanks for your question. So just EBITDA performance for the full year, given our updated guidance for 2021. And then as we think about 2022, early stages, really just focus on the EBITDA margin expansion. The fact that we expect to be fav",327,"Sure, Salvator. Thanks for your question. So just EBITDA performance for the full year, given our updated guidance for 2021. And then as we think about 2022, early stages, really just focus on the EBITDA margin expansion. The fact that we expect to be favorable on that price/cost spread heading into 2022, given the volume growth. And we're converting -- today, we're converting incremental volumes close to 40%. So having that good momentum makes us feel good about it. 
However, a lot of assumptions built into what I just said, and we're working through to make sure we have a good profile. But I can tell you that internally, how we're driving is to convert that incremental volume of greater than 30%. You've heard us say that in the past. And margin expansion may be a little bit challenging, but we're driving roughly 21% EBITDA margin business is what we're targeting in terms of our thoughts. 
Then you mentioned the second item, just relative to the cash generation that we have expected for the full year. As we kind of commented a small number, we had an incremental share repurchase in the quarter. So the amount of, I'll call it, dry powder we have to deploy in the business. And I'll let Ted comment as well because we just put out a press release this morning since we finalized it on the [ Reflectix ] divestiture which we expect to get roughly after-tax proceeds between $40 million and $50 million for that. 
So the cash proceeds to use to redeploy into the business will be available to us and as we execute on that share repurchases an item. As we know, we've recently increased the dividend. We're very optimistic that the pipeline of opportunities for M&A will be there. Of course, that takes the other side to agree. So we'll work through it. So maybe Ted, some color on capital allocation and the excess cash we'll have."

So -- and that's what we're communicating. Always trying to be transparent. If you go to our capital allocation Slide 16, where, again, purpose-driven. And if you look in this section, we talk about invest and acquire, there's an implied word invest, acquire and divest to accelerate growth. 
So as we look at our product portfolio, we're continuously analyzing our portfolio, where does it match. And can we use our portfolio to actually fuel our growth. So this -- the [ Reflectec ] is a nice business. It focuses though, on HVAC and construction. Not something that is connected to our strategy, but a very nice business. So the buyer is getting a nice business. And we're going to take those proceeds and continue to invest where we're taking the business and driving into our automation, digital and sustainability growth plans. 
So the other piece in here is we look at our capital allocation, as Chris talked to, we're being very opportunistic. We talked about the share repurchase. I've mentioned before our stocks hit a new low. So we're also communicating with those investors that have come in. And this model is generating close to $2 billion of cash over the next 3 years. 
So being purpose-driven, where we put that cash is going to be how do we fuel this growth going forward. So good question and one up just to the employees that are going to Reflectix. We really appreciate what you did and to the buyer. You got a great business. And it's all part of optimizing our portfolio."

But can we maybe just think about where things are -- where the confidence level is particularly high and maybe some of those end markets that are -- that have maybe been more challenged or a bit more of a cautionary. So on the positive side, I would think about e-commerce in the U.S. Maybe, inversely red meat in Brazil or in Australia, industrial kind of production base protective businesses in Europe. I'm just trying to think about where at the high and low end of the spectrum you're most and a little bit more watchful on the volume outlook?"

How do we grow by geography? And how do we grow it by market? So I'll just give some quick thoughts and then some -- the secular trends that we're focused on, which I'm always going back to, it's this first thing is automation, and that applies to the whole portfolio because what's being driven is these labor shortages. 
As we package, again, our $30 billion packages that we do a year, that we're covering all markets. This labor challenge is ubiquitous. It's everywhere. So now going into some of the markets or the geographies that we think we have this year, maybe we're a little behind on, we think we have some potential is we're pretty bullish on what's going to happen with the turnaround with the European, Middle East and Africa. 
Had a tough catch-up on the cost going up faster than the price, we think we're going to get that. We have some really interesting innovations that are going into the European market, especially on that other challenge of sustainability, introducing some paper products into e-commerce. We do very well with our Bubble Wrap, our pillows, et cetera. And we're investing in some pretty interesting technology on the paper side for -- that's going to show up in e-commerce, being really pulled quickly into the European markets, but that's going to be global. 
So we see that's exciting for 2022 growth. 
On the food side, we see our expansion beyond proteins. Obviously, fresh red meat where we do really well. But the growth in that 22% part of our portfolio is going to be on the automation, and we're really excited that we're seeing some of those big automation opportunities actually now going forward. Some of the equipment of some of those should be hitting in 2022. So that's globally all over the world. 
And then the other piece is going -- taking food beyond fresh red meat. You heard us talk about the liquids and fluids being up over 20%. So bringing the Cryovac pouch to that. But as you see in this slide, if you look at our market slide, you'll see going into liquids, such as spirits, is wine. But next to that is a $1 million piece of equipment that's actually filling those pouches that we're putting into a box and creating a full system, those are some exciting markets that we're going after. 
You look at the side pouch system we have, actually packaging food. And you would have called out we would not -- we would have called that a protective business in the past, but that's where we're becoming really market-driven with these great products and systems. And so we see some expansion into the parts of the food business where we didn't play before, especially on equipment side, where we may have done the pouches, but now we can do full equipment and again, saving our customers significant amounts of money on their productivity and again, labor shortages where they just can't get the labor right now. 
So going into 2022, we think we've got lots of opportunities. Again, just to close the call, the momentum of the fourth quarter, building it to 2022, We're excited about the future, and I want to thank everybody for the time on the call. 
And operator, I think that's it for us today, and look forward to when we talk next. Thank you."

We appreciate your interest in SEE and hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. 
We're working through very exciting and challenging times as we continue to transform SEE. You can see on Slide 3, our strategy to become a world-class digitally-driven company, automating sustainable packaging solutions. 
On today's call, I'll recap our third quarter 2021 performance. I'll share our strategy for growth in automation, digital and sustainability within our global core markets. Chris will review our financial results and outlook in more detail. I will end with closing remarks before opening the call for Q&A. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 for a review of our third quarter 2021 results. Net sales increased 13% in constant dollars with volume growth of 5% and price realization of 8%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4%. Higher volumes and pricing efforts helped mitigate inflationary pressures and supply disruptions, yet our industry-leading margins were still under pressure at 19.2% compared to 21% last year. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings of $0.86 were up $0.04 compared to last year. We generated free cash flow of $223 million in the first 9 months of the year, which compared with $292 million in the first 9 months of last year. 
Our SEE operating engine is performing. SEE Touchless Automation and sustainable packaging solutions are generating demand, growth and delivering productivity savings. 
I want to highlight our SEE operating model on Slide 5, which defines where we're taking SEE and what you should expect us to deliver. Our innovations in automation, digital and sustainability continue to gain momentum and are driving our growth above our traditional packaging markets. We are targeting adjusted earnings per share growth of greater than 10% and free cash flow conversion of more than 50%. 
Our SEE operating model generates significant cash from our purpose-driven approach to capital allocation. To fuel our growth, we're increasing our CapEx investments for innovation and Touchless Automation. 
Through SEE Ventures' investments, we're using our balance sheet to incubate disruptive technologies and new business models to accelerate our pace of innovation and speed to market. 
We continue to return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We further strengthened our capital structure with a $600 million new bond issuance in the third quarter. For SEE, this is our first secured investment-grade bond in the company's history. The proceeds were used to pay down existing debt. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, which highlights our market-driven solutions powered by our iconic brands. We encourage you to visit our website where you can read about our innovation and customer success stories. 
We create measurable value for our customers through automated and sustainable solutions that are designed to maximize food safety, minimize waste, protect goods and deliver productivity savings. 
Sales in our automation portfolio, which includes equipment, services and spare parts have increased approximately 20% yzear-to-date, accounting for 8% of our total sales. AUTOBAG systems are our fastest-growing automated solution with year-to-date sales up more than 25% and bookings up approximately 50%. 
For proteins, equipment, spare parts and service sales are up double digits year-to-date. Our protein automation pipeline continues to grow across all regions with major food producers committing to our SEE Touchless Automation future. 
Our automated equipment and service sales have a strong pull-through for our high performance sustainable materials. Our unique approach to automation is strengthened with our digital solutions. Through our SEE Mark smart packaging enabled with our patented digital printing, we are creating touchless digital connectivity from our operations to our customers and to consumers' homes. This level of connectivity is transformational for our customers. It enables us to be embedded into our customers' operations where we can drive significant savings to their bottom line. Our customers are buying into our automation future. 
In addition to growth in automation, the recovery in food service and our innovations in fluids are driving increased demand for high-performance, sustainable CRYOVAC barrier bags, pouches and case-ready applications across all regions. In the quarter, our fastest-growing food solutions was our CRYOVAC pouches designed for fluids and liquids with double-digit sales growth. 
We continue to benefit from the industrial recovery and strength in automation designed for e-commerce fulfillment. We're seeing significant shift in our fulfillment portfolio towards automation and sustainable solutions. 
In industrials, we delivered mid- to high single-digit volume growth. In fulfillment, we experienced double-digit volume growth in automation, paper systems and temperature assurance solutions. 
Although we face global supply challenges across our business, our team is doing a nice job of minimizing disruptions and delivering on increased demands. 
I also want to highlight that we recently launched a new innovative BUBBLE WRAP on-demand inflator system designed for industrial and fulfillment customers. You can see the illustration of this system on the right side of this slide. It features smart technology that recognizes the type of film that's loaded and easily switches between material types, whether it's inflatable cushioning, pouches or air pillows. 
SEE is becoming an automation company. On Slide 7, you can see how we are making this happen. For the full year, we expect to exceed our $425 million sales target or over 12% growth in equipment, system and services. We're confident in our ability to exceed our 2025 target of over $750 million, which is more than $500 million will come from equipment and systems. 
Over the last 12 months, our bookings are up significantly, even though supply disruptions persist. The pandemic accelerated demand for automation. As I noted earlier, we're highlighting the success of our AUTOBAG systems portfolio with bookings up approximately 50% year-to-date and more than 60% since the start of the pandemic. This accelerated systems demand will drive up to 7x future pull-through for materials and services over the equipment life cycle. 
We currently are experiencing a significant increase in AUTOBAG material orders and we're investing in innovation and capacity expansions to meet this increased demand. 
Our year-over-year bookings growth in AUTOBAG is also notable. Our Touchless Automation value proposition resonates with customers as we're generating significant operational savings in taking our strategic partnerships to the next level. 
Let me now turn to Slide 8 and talk about sustainability. Sustainability is in everything we do, and it starts with our purpose-driven culture and values to how we innovate and invest to generate growth. Sustainability is core to our responsible sourcing of raw materials, our carbon footprint as well as our efforts to advance circularity of packaging materials with our customers and suppliers. You can see on this slide our environmental goals and our sustainability pledge. Our long-term targets are ambitious and lead the industry towards a better future. 
As it relates to climate change, we are doing our part with an ambitious pledge to achieve net zero carbon emissions across our operations by 2040. We continue to take actions in our own facilities to reduce energy consumption with incremental investments in Touchless Automation and renewable energy sources. 
We are making significant progress on our 2025 sustainability pledge with approximately 50% of our solutions already designed for recyclability, which have reached approximately 20% recycled and/or renewable content in those solutions. We designed our high-performance materials with recyclability in mind to make sustainability more affordable and to create a pathway for a circular economy. 
You can see on this slide how Touchless Automation is transforming our operations, our customers' operations and enabling a circular economy. We are innovating in smart packaging, incorporating digital technology in delivering supply chain efficiency, sustainability and brand engagement with our customers. 
We are excited to share that in early October, we published our global impact report that highlights our ESG priorities and commitments, related initiatives, our progress and performance. We highlight how SEE is shaping the future of the packaging industry and progressing towards our bold environmental targets. 
I'll now pass the call to Chris to review our results in more detail. Chris?"

Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. In Q3, net sales totaled $1.4 billion, up 14% as reported, up 13% in constant dollars. Food was up 12% in constant dollar",1267,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 9 to review our quarterly net sales growth by segment and by region. In Q3, net sales totaled $1.4 billion, up 14% as reported, up 13% in constant dollars. Food was up 12% in constant dollars versus last year, and Protective increased 13%. The Americas and EMEA were both up double digits, with Americas up 14% and EMEA up 13%. APAC was up 6% versus last year. 
On Slide 10, you see organic sales volume and pricing trends by segment and by region. In Q3, overall volume growth was up 5% with favorable price of 8%. 
Let's start with volumes. Food volumes were up 6%, with growth across all regions. Americas, up 5%; EMEA, 6%; and APAC, 7%. Protective volumes were up 4%, led by EMEA with 16% growth, followed by APAC up 4% and Americas essentially flat to prior year. Q3 price was favorable 8% with Protective at 10% and Food at 7%. Formula-based pass-throughs, primarily in Food North America, are now better aligned with input costs. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect to realize more than $275 million in price given additional pricing announcements since our last call as well as timing of formula-based pricing. 
As we head into 2022, we will be announcing additional price increases effective December 1 in response to continued inflationary pressures. This increase will vary based on region and product offering, and will average between 5% and 10%. 
We are engaging directly with our customers to meet increased demand with automation and alternative solutions that drive productivity savings. 
On Slide 11, we present our consolidated sales and adjusted EBITDA [ walks ]. Having already discussed sales, let me comment on our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance of $271 million, which was up 4% compared to last year. Margins of 19.2% were down 180 basis points. 
Despite favorable pricing in the quarter, you can see how the inflationary environment and supply challenges weighed on our results with an unfavorable price/cost spread of $18 million. Operational costs decreased approximately $3 million relative to last year with Reinvent SEE productivity gains and a $5 million benefit related to an indirect tax recovery in Brazil. Our SEE operating engine is performing with 40% leverage on higher volumes. 
In the month of September, price/cost spread turned favorable. In Q4, we expect this favorable trend to continue. Adjusted earnings per diluted share in Q3 was $0.86 compared to $0.82 in Q3 2020. Our adjusted tax rate was 24.9% compared to 20.6% in Q3 2020. The prior year tax rate included the benefit of U.S. GILTI regulations issued in 2020. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 151 million. 
Turning to Slide 12. Here, we provide an update on Reinvent SEE, which is now the foundation of our SEE operating engine. We achieved $43 million of benefits in the first 9 months of the year and remain on track to realize approximately $65 million in 2021. 
Turning to segment results on Slide 13, starting with Food. In Q3, Food net sales of $797 million were up 12% in constant dollars. CRYOVAC barrier bags and pouches were up for the second consecutive quarter versus last year, and combined, accounted for nearly 50% of the segment sales. Sales in case-ready and roll stock applications were also up as food service recovers and retail demand remained strong. 
Equipment parts and service sales, which account for 7% of the segment were up low single digits in the quarter. As Ted noted, we are experiencing strong demand in protein automation and continue to build our pipeline. Adjusted EBITDA of $169 million in Q3 increased 11% compared to last year, with margins at 21.2%, down 40 basis points. Higher volumes, favorable pricing and productivity gains offset elevated costs. 
On Slide 14, we highlight Protective segment results. In constant dollars, net sales increased 13% to $609 million. Relative to last year, industrial was up more than 15% and fulfillment, up approximately 7%. We faced supply chain disruptions throughout the quarter and leveraged our broad portfolio and global footprint to meet customer demands where possible. 
As a reminder, approximately 55% of our Protective sales are derived from industrial end markets and the remaining 45% from fulfillment and e-commerce. Adjusted EBITDA of $103 million decreased 5.5% in Q3 with margins at 16.9%, down 350 basis points versus last year. We incurred transitory headwinds, including nonmaterial inflation and labor challenges, which more than offset higher volumes and pricing actions. 
Let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 15. In the first 9 months of 2021, we generated $223 million of free cash flow. Relative to the same period last year, higher earnings and lower restructuring payments were offset by the impact of higher employee-related costs, cash tax payments and CapEx investments to support growth and innovation. 
On Slide 16, we outlined our purpose-driven capital allocation strategy focused on creating economic value. We maintain a strong balance sheet while driving attractive returns on invested capital and supporting profitable growth initiatives. 
As Ted mentioned, I want to highlight that during Q3, we executed a $600 million 5-year senior secured bond at 1.573%. The proceeds of this offering were used to pay down $425 million senior unsecured notes at 4.875% due in 2022 and $175 million prepayable term loan debt. 
To support our growth initiatives, we are focusing our CapEx on Touchless Automation, digital and sustainability. We are expanding our capacity and equipment to align with customer demands and support continued growth. We are investing in smart packaging and digital printing and see opportunities to expand our presence in attractive growth markets and geographies. We are managing our product portfolio with discipline to ensure alignment with our growth strategy. 
As it relates to returning capital to shareholders, we have repurchased 6.6 million shares or $329 million year-to-date September, reflecting confidence in our future growth. At quarter end, we have approximately $970 million remaining under our authorized repurchase program. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 to review our updated 2021 outlook given our performance year-to-date through September. For net sales, we now estimate approximately $5.5 billion or up approximately 12% as-reported growth to reflect the favorable demand environment and pricing actions. This compares to our previous range of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. We expect a favorable currency impact of approximately 1.5%. 
Given the current environment, we now anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.12 billion to $1.14 billion. On a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow 6.5% to 8.5%. This compares to our previous guide of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion. 
For adjusted EPS, we expect to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.60, the higher end of our previous guidance. This assumes depreciation and amortization of $230 million and adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 26% and approximately 152.5 million average shares outstanding. 
And lastly, our outlook for free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $520 million to $540 million. There is no change to our outlook for 2021 CapEx of approximately $210 million and Reinvent SEE restructuring and associated payments of approximately $40 million. 
For cash taxes, we anticipate approximately $110 million, which is net of a $24 million tax refund associated with the retroactive application of the revised U.S. GILTI regulations. 
As we close out the year and enter 2022, we are executing on our growth strategy, driving productivity and aligning our business with our SEE operating model. 
With that, let me now pass the call back to Ted for closing remarks. Ted?"

We recognize there's a lot of good things going on in automation. If I'm remembering the numbers correctly, where are you seeing the deceleration? 
And relatedly, within Protective, you called out supply chain headwinds, and it's notable that EBIT was down in the quarter, even though you did a really good job relative to 2Q and 1Q on price/cost. Can you quantify what was going on in protective relative to the growth rate there?"

So if you look at equipment, and if I can point to our deck on the equipment slide, which is Slide 7. If you unpack what's going on with equipment year-to-date, as you highlighted, we highlighted it up over 20%. In the quarter, there was a little bit of on the actual shipments, on the sales, there was some slowdown. It was less than -- it was high single digit, but the slowdown was due to comps from last year, but also supply disruptions. 
As you're dealing with other equipment companies who are out there and don't want to go through all those issues, but they're real and getting the equipment installed, et cetera, et cetera. So what we're really focusing on -- and by the way, we're working with our customers on all those issues, but we're really focusing on as we really transform this into an equipment company is what are the bookings? How are the bookings doing? 
The bookings are still very, very strong. And they're strong across the board. So not worried about that. We got a lot of issues in place. And actually, again, we're using the equipment story to handle the situations with our customers because their #1 issue is labor shortages. So we are right there with them in solving that. So actually, when we talk about some of our thoughts on 2022, you'll see why this is why we're quite confident this momentum will build forward. 
The second part of the question, I might try to get Chris to tag team on that, and that is what's going on with the bridge with the Protective and Food."

So those transitory impacts higher freight costs, think about the labor challenges, et cetera, to get that volume out, we have experienced some headwinds.

So maybe I'd just take the price/cost spread because in my prepared remarks, we talked about that September, we did see that favorable turn. So we're finally catching up as it relates to price relative to the input cost increases that we've experienced all year, pretty evenly split. It's not a huge number. Look, just kind of calibrate it that way. It's not a huge number. We're just glad to see it be positive and pretty much reflected both in Food and Protective. 
That momentum, we expect to continue. So our guide, if you will, assumes that we're going to get incremental to our sequential improvement from Q3, roughly $40 million to potentially $50 million of incremental price to be expected to be able to achieve the midpoint of our guide for full year and then how that relates back to fourth quarter. 
And then maybe your specific question relative to Protective. Volumes continue to be strong. I've made my comments earlier in terms of the margin profile. We're doing everything we can to be able to meet that demand heading into Q4. So it's great to get that volume, granted we'd like to see better margin improvement. But at the same time, we recognize that this is a temporary kind of transitory type of challenges that we're working through. And our supply chain team is doing the best they can to get product to our facilities to be able to satisfy that demand. So that kind of answers your delivery question in terms of being able to deliver on our customers' needs."

We're counting on it in terms of our EBITDA range guidance for the full year. But we would expect to be at or better than that $275 million. So the teams have done a nice job working that. Literally, partnering with our customers to make sure that demand is satisfied. Everyone recognizes the environment we're in relative to these inflationary pressures, and we're working our best with customers to be able to satisfy their demand at the same time as we commented, help their operations from a productivity point of view."

If you go to our Slide 5 with what's happening in the fourth quarter and on price, which has been the big issue for us. We've had three quarters we've been chasing those input costs. So we -- as Chris highlighted in his prepared remarks, we saw it turn in September. So that's what's giving us confidence to hit that -- our fourth quarter and really building into the momentum into 2022. 
So if you look at our slide, you could see what we're giving you, this is where the model is driving. So to unpack that a little bit for you, if you look at our organic sales, that's been strong this year. We're looking to that momentum to continue to be strong and actually exceed that going into next year. And then you had price on top of that. So you see some strong volumes into 2022. 
And then the conversion on that, on the earnings is going to be with the price now going positive in the quarter, you're going to see a pretty significant change in our profitability in the fourth quarter compared to the first three quarters being ahead on the price. You'll see not only our operating leverage on the volume that we've been consistently hitting well over that 30%, you're going to see the price coming in as well. 
Going into 2022, we're still going to have some supply constraints, and we still think we're going to have those inflationary pressures. So they're happening. It's going to be a little bit different than the resin because we do think that should be starting to flatten but just to catch up on all the other inflationary costs. But we still think we're going to be ahead. And we think our EBITDA growth percentage is going to outweigh our sales. 
So we're going to have some margin expansion going into next year and then that flows with getting over 10% on EPS and our cash generation. So we're seeing this momentum in the fourth quarter being led by price, taking us into a strong 2022."

So if we look at our Slide 8, I believe, our Slide 8, when we talk about what are we doing in sustainability, what are we doing with automation. So if you look at this picture of what we do, we have roughly 1 billion pounds of resin. And plus add to 250 million pounds of paper that go in to produce 30 billion packages. So that's the big picture of what we do. 
So to your question on disruptive technology, we're bringing automation into our facilities. We're actually bringing some pretty unique operations, creating some touchless systems that are enabling us to change how we make a product. 
In this example that we have here on this slide, this is where we're taking, in our Food business, instead of taking our -- creating the bag, we fold them up into a box. We're now fully automating that and putting it into a high-density roll. So actually we're finishing -- making the bag in our customers' operations. 
So in this one example here, this is a -- order that's coming in is we're actually able to now go to a high-density roll, finish making the bag in our customers' operations. We're eliminating in this one example 87,000 boxes a year. So it's dramatic carbon footprint change. Dramatic environmental change, but also the productivity and it's saving customers' labor, which is significant. So very disruptive. 
And then now we're bringing our high-performance materials into the system, introducing some of the digital technology, actually printing right there now in our customers' facilities versus where we used to print in our plants. So this is orders in process, and this is where our future is going to be. 
And then you could see taking it all the way to the consumer in the home, bringing our digital technology so that you can see through the package, know what material it's made out of, know what's going on with the protein inside. So pretty excited about making this happen. And this is -- this reality is happening as we speak, especially right now in the protein market. So we'll turn to your Reinvent SEE question."

So we plan on updating investors in the February time frame when we close out '21 and provide more specific guidance relative to 2022. 
But I would comment, there's nothing that we're seeing as a major concern kind of heading into 2022. We're working through these transitory costs. We're getting the favorability of price, as we mentioned, driving productivity in our operations. Feeling good about where we are in terms of the turn, but there's more work to do.

Now the rest of the portfolio, and that's where we gave you a little bit of a detail on the -- our automation slide where we wanted to unpack AUTOBAG and actually show you what's going on with AUTOBAG is we looked at our acquisition of automated packaging systems. 
Because we're now looking like an equipment company, we are tracking bookings. And we actually gave a signal to the team. Actually, [ not within the signal ], a direct demand, over 9 months ago, we're going to have to double our capacity, and this is with AUTOBAG. So just unpacking that. We do some food in with the AUTOBAG as well so -- which I'm pleased to see that we're all -- we are catching up. We are behind because the book-to-bill is higher than we would like. Our lead times are longer than we'd like. But we're seeing that, and we even went public with our CapEx announcement there, over $30 million, we are catching up. 
And again, going into 2022, we think this will be able to support that significantly strong growth rate that we have for equipment. So I think we're well on our way to exceed the target to get over that $750 million over the next 3 years, 5 years, 4 years, whatever it is. 
But -- so it does -- you are right. These are long-term projects, which actually is exciting because we're embedded with our customers. We're working with their layouts. How do we get our equipment in place and actually embedded into those systems. So long answer simple, the big stuff, the big systems, the multimillion dollar systems are probably 2 to 3 years in planning and execution. But the AUTOBAG systems, those are a matter of less than 3 months, and they should be in weeks and that's what we're working on."

Obviously, this has been stressed a lot during the call. As the labor shortage continues to persist, and I would argue, has gotten worse over the last few months, what has been the cadence in your machinery bookings? Have you seen an acceleration in those sales bookings corresponding to the deteriorating labor situation? 
And then relatedly, you mentioned that machinery sales have been impacted by a shortage of materials. Just provide some more color around what some of the gating factors are there, did that worsen during the quarter? And what are you seeing regarding that shortage thus far in 4Q?"

You're going to hear us using the language as an ex-equipment guy myself, you're going to hear us using language like choppy and -- because these",398,"Okay. Good. So again, if we take a look at that slide, we talk about the equipment business and the cadence. You're going to hear us using the language as an ex-equipment guy myself, you're going to hear us using language like choppy and -- because these are bigger numbers that are coming in, and they come in at different times. So as our pipeline grows, we'll have a smoothing of this. 
But -- so -- but in the quarter, some of the issues that I mentioned already is we're getting some of those equipment installed on a sales basis, in the quarter, we had some starts and stops. So we think we'll have some recovery in that in the fourth quarter, but still very strong. 
The bookings though, are up significantly. So could the bookings even be higher? Probably. That's why we got to add capacity because those lead times are stretching. So to the cadence and to where you asked the question about labor, right now, this is the hottest thing out there in the market today. Can we help our customers with their labor shortages and automation is the answer. So lots of investment going on in place. We're working with our customers, taking care of these supply shortages. 
But I want to separate one thing that you said just to understand why we are so excited about our equipment strategy. Equipment is one piece, the pull-through of the materials is the other aspect of this. So not only had we -- and AUTOBAG specifically, we've had to invest into the materials side of that as well. So our materials are up because the pull through, we're actually going to be selling materials faster. 
The last piece on the equipment is we mentioned equipment plus systems. So these large systems that we're selling not only do we have the equipment. Some traditional equipment we've had in the past, some new equipment, but also it's full systems. So we're putting in robotics. We're putting in conveyance systems. We're putting in WMS systems with our customers. 
So the dollar amount is much higher. And we're making the margin is on the savings of the full system. So it's much different than we've done in the past. And we're going to give better and better visibility on how we measure this and how we forecast it going forward."

What we're going to see in the next few months is more of what we already have in place coming through with more of our discrete mailers, discrete products. So right now, it's more on the material issues to getting those taken care of on those bottlenecks. 
As far as going into next year, it's going to be our new stuff that's going to help us with comps this year. Can we get those new products out there? Can we get the automation out there? And can we also get some of our geographic issues taken care of? We're investing in our geographies around the world. So to handle that comp for next year, which we feel pretty good about, I'll let Chris talk a little bit about 2022, we think we can maintain those volumes and the incremental volumes on the Protective side as well as the Food."

Just to add to Ted's highlights, relative to maybe the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter, given supply disruptions, think about labor challenges, et cetera. Our teams, when we assessed it for Q3, we felt we were kind of roughly $20 million of opportunity lost, if you will, as it relates to these disruptions in Q3. 
As that same specific question relative to Q4, a little bit less, but still kind of in this, call it, $15 million range. So we're -- there were tens of millions of dollars, unfortunately, being -- not necessarily lost. Some of it's going to move to the right, but it's definitely impacting our performance, even though our performance is very good. So kind of working through these supply challenges. 
If we turn to just 2022, just to give some high-level thoughts, the volume -- the operating model that we're driving to this 3% to 5%, given the favorable dynamic we expect to see on price/cost spread, we would expect to have that organic growth in that 3% to 5% category. But then you add on top of that, what we would expect in terms of price being greater than the material inflation or get the price benefit of that. So we're more in the 6% to 7% growth as we see it right now for 2022. 
Now going through the planning period, this assumes -- has a lot of assumptions for material availability, working through these transitory items, which we're working through. But we feel good about the volumes. The underlying volume is there. Getting the labor in place, getting through these disruptions and continue to execute is where we're focused."

Firstly, just building on what you just mentioned about next year, organic sales being a little bit higher than normal because of price/cost. Does this mean also we should assume that your EBITDA growth should be at the top end of the 5% to 7% growth rate next year or even above it? 
And also just briefly on capital allocation. You have $300 million in cash -- in free cash flow coming through in Q4 based on the full year guidance. What are your thoughts now that we saw you slow down buybacks with regard to M&A or restarting the -- or going back to repurchase shares even more?"

So maybe just EBITDA performance for the full year, given our updated guidance for 2021. And then as we think about 2022, early stages, really just focus on the EBITDA margin expansion. The fact that we expect to",327,"Sure, Salvator. Thanks for your question. So maybe just EBITDA performance for the full year, given our updated guidance for 2021. And then as we think about 2022, early stages, really just focus on the EBITDA margin expansion. The fact that we expect to be favorable on that price/cost spread heading into 2022, given the volume growth. And we're converting -- today, we're converting incremental volumes close to 40%. So having that good momentum makes us feel good about it. 
However, a lot of assumptions built into what I just said, and we're working through to make sure we have a good profile. But I can tell you that internally, how we're driving is to convert that incremental volume of greater than 30%. You've heard us say that in the past. And margin expansion may be a little bit challenging, but we're driving roughly 21% EBITDA margin business is what we're targeting in terms of our thoughts. 
Then you mentioned the second item, just relative to the cash generation that we have expected for the full year. As we kind of commented a small number, we had an incremental share repurchase in the quarter. So the amount of, I'll call it, dry powder we have to deploy in the business -- and I'll let Ted comment as well because we just put out a press release this morning since we finalized it on the Reflectix divestiture which we expect to get, roughly after-tax proceeds, between $40 million and $50 million for that. 
So the cash proceeds to use to redeploy into the business will be available to us and as we execute on that share repurchases an item. As we know, we've recently increased the dividend. We're very optimistic that the pipeline of opportunities for M&A will be there. Of course, that takes the other side to agree. So we'll work through it. But maybe, Ted, some color on capital allocation and the excess cash we'll have."

So just specifically in the press release just did hit on our Reflectix business. So -- and that's what we're communicating. Always trying to be transparent. If you go to our capital allocation Slide 16, we're, again, purpose-driven. And if you look",277,"Yes. So just specifically in the press release just did hit on our Reflectix business. So -- and that's what we're communicating. Always trying to be transparent. If you go to our capital allocation Slide 16, we're, again, purpose-driven. And if you look in this section, we talk about invest and acquire, there's an implied word invest, acquire and divest to accelerate growth. 
So as we look at our product portfolio, we're continuously analyzing our portfolio, where does it match. And can we use our portfolio to actually fuel our growth. So this -- the Reflectix is a nice business. It focuses though on HVAC and construction. Not something that is connected to our strategy, but a very nice business. So the buyer is getting a nice business. And we're going to take those proceeds and continue to invest where we're taking the business and driving into our automation, digital and sustainability growth plans. 
So the other piece in here as we look at our capital allocation, as Chris talked to, we're being very opportunistic. We talked about the share repurchase. I've mentioned before our stocks hit a new low. So we're also communicating with those investors that are coming in. And this model is generating close to $2 billion of cash over the next 3 years. 
So being purpose-driven, where we put that cash is going to be how do we fuel this growth going forward. So good question. And I  want to -- just to the employees that are going to Reflectix, we really appreciate what you did. And to the buyer, you got a great business. And it's all part of optimizing our portfolio."

But can we maybe just think about where things are -- where the confidence level is particularly high and maybe some of those end markets that are -- that have maybe been more challenged or a bit more of a caution area. So on the positive side, I would think about e-commerce in the U.S. Maybe inversely, red meat in Brazil or in Australia, industrial kind of production base protective businesses in Europe. I'm just trying to think about where at the high and low end of the spectrum you're most and a little bit more watchful on the volume outlook."

So I'll just give some quick thoughts and then some",598,"Okay. I'll do the first part. Yes, I mean, it's a good question. Again, as we're looking to grow the business, how do we grow it by product? How do we grow by geography? And how do we grow it by market? So I'll just give some quick thoughts and then some -- the secular trends that we're focused on, which I'm always going back to, it's this first thing is automation, and that applies to the whole portfolio because what's being driven is these labor shortages. 
As we package, again, our $30 billion packages that we do a year, that we're covering all markets. This labor challenge is ubiquitous. It's everywhere. So now going into some of the markets or the geographies that we think we have this year, maybe we're a little behind on, we think we have some potential is we're pretty bullish on what's going to happen with the turnaround with the European, Middle East and Africa. 
Had a tough catch-up on the cost going up faster than the price, we think we're going to get that. We have some really interesting innovations that are going into the European market, especially on that other challenge of sustainability, introducing some paper products into e-commerce. We do very well with our BUBBLE WRAP, our pillows, et cetera. And we're investing in some pretty interesting technology on the paper side for -- that's going to show up in e-commerce, being really pulled quickly into the European markets, but that's going to be global. So we see that's exciting for 2022 growth. 
On the Food side, we see our expansion beyond proteins. Obviously, fresh red meat where we do really well. But the growth in that 22% part of our portfolio is going to be on the automation, and we're really excited that we're seeing some of those big automation opportunities actually now going forward. Some of the equipment, some of those should be hitting in 2022. So that's globally all over the world. 
And then the other piece is going -- taking Food beyond fresh red meat. You heard us talk about the liquids and fluids being up over 20%. So bringing the CRYOVAC pouch to that. But as you see in this slide, if you look at our market slide, you'll see going into liquids, such as spirits, is wine. But next to that is a $1 million piece of equipment that's actually filling those pouches that we're putting into a box and creating a full system, those are some exciting markets that we're going after. 
You look at the side pouch system we have, actually, packaging food. And you would have called out -- we would, not you. We would have called that a Protective business in the past, but that's where we're becoming really market-driven with these great products and systems. And so we see some expansion into the parts of the Food business where we didn't play before, especially on equipment side, where we may have done the pouches, but now we can do full equipment and again, saving our customers significant amounts of money on their productivity and again, labor shortages where they just can't get the labor right now. 
So going into 2022, we think we've got lots of opportunities. Again, just to close the call, the momentum of the fourth quarter building into 2022, we're excited about the future, and I want to thank everybody for their time on the call. 
And operator, I think that's it for us today, and look forward to when we talk next. Thank you."
