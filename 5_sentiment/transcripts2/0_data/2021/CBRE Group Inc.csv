Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with the",489,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with the presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our fourth quarter results and expectations for the future. After their comments, we'll open up the call for questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2021 outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment, financial performance, including profitability and margins and the effects of both cost savings initiatives in COVID-19 and the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only, and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue; certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. 
Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our fourth quarter 2020 and full year financial results. During the fourth quarter, total revenue and fee revenue fell about 3% and 7%, respectively, driven by constrained transaction activity in Advisory Services. Lower revenue was more than offset by prudent cost management and the continued benefit of transformation initiatives that improve both our cost structure and operational agility. Overall, adjusted EPS grew nearly 10% to $1.45. GAAP EPS of $0.93 includes around $0.28 of transformation initiative costs. Importantly, GAAP EPS in the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.67 tax benefit, primarily from legal entity restructuring. Excluding these unusual items in both periods, GAAP EPS would have been up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Now for insights on results and our longer-term strategy, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to Bob."

As you've seen, we ended 2020 on a high note, with adjusted EPS for the quarter reaching an all-time high and adjusted EBITDA growing 9%. This capped the year of significant challenges stemming from COVID, but also one that brought to the forefront CBRE's competitive advantages, our ability to capture often overlook industry opportunities and the resiliency we've built into the business over the past decade. This resilience has allowed us to offset the steep decline in sales and lease transactions and the pandemic's unique effects on the office market. 
Today, CBRE is more diversified than ever before across 4 key dimensions: property types, lines of business, geographic markets and clients. A few examples will bring definition to this. While office remains an important property type for us, its negative effects have been tempered by our large and growing presence in industrial, data centers and multifamily. Leasing is a key line of business for us that has been under pressure. However, other lines of business, such as GSE financing, investment management and facilities management, have all continued to grow. Geographically, New York, London and San Francisco are key markets for us, but our presence in Asia is robust and growing, and our significant activity in Europe and second-tier U.S. markets has held up relatively well. We serve many clients that have been negatively impacted by COVID, but do a huge amount of business with technology, life science and other clients that have thrived over the past year. 
Reflecting how large companies increasingly rely on CBRE, nearly 90% of our 100 largest clients purchased 4 or more services in 2020, up from less than 1/4 a decade ago. Our broad diversification across these 4 key dimensions has served us well compared with prior downturns. Adjusted EPS fell 12% in 2020. We expect earnings to rise to near peak profitability this year, the second year of the downturn, and continue up from there. By comparison, during the great financial crisis, we suffered a more than 80% peak-to-trough decline, and adjusted earnings per share did not return to the prior peak for 8 years. 
We're exiting the worst of the COVID crisis in great shape. Our strengths include a leaner operating structure, significant financial capacity and a strategy squarely aimed at the many opportunities unfolding in our industry, including those with secular tailwinds. 
We've built our long-term plan on the assumption that office demand remains under pressure due to a lasting increase in remote working and occupiers' needs for greater flexibility in space obligations. This is reflected in our base case forecast, which nevertheless, expects us to achieve a minimum of low double-digit average annual adjusted EPS growth through at least 2025, absent a recession. This forecast is driven by organic growth and deploying capital, notably in M&A and real estate investments with meaningful upside potential from additional capital deployment. We expect to achieve this strong growth while continuing to evolve our business as we reduce contributions from lower secular growth business lines and increase our focus on areas that have higher secular growth profiles. 
One growth area we are particularly high on is flexible office space. We identified this sector as an opportunity 3 years ago and have been building our Hana business expressly to meet rapidly rising demand from occupiers and investors. Our investment in Industrious now aligns this with an exceptional operator and outstanding leadership team that is executing a great strategy. With more than 100 units in 50 markets, Industrious enables us to participate in the flex space opportunity at scale and contribute meaningfully to Industrious' expansion. 
Now Leah will discuss the quarter and our outlook for 2021."

Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA declined about 13% and nearly 8%, respectively.

Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA declined about 13% and nearly 8%, respectively. These declines are mostly attributable to continued weakness in high-margin sales and leasing businesses. This was partially offset by disciplined cost management and strong performance by the rest of our advisory businesses, which, in combination, grew revenue nearly 11%. Overall, our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 120 basis points compared to a year ago. This margin benefited from cost optimization efforts and 210 basis points from substantially higher OMSR gains than in last year's fourth quarter. 
Global leasing revenue declined about 28% as occupiers around the world continue to defer leasing decisions due to the pandemic. For the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which together comprise about 78% of global leasing, revenue decreased 36%, 18% and 6%, respectively. The U.K. again benefited from particularly strong industrial activity in the quarter, which helped offset subdued demand for office space. The continued growth of e-commerce drove industrial leasing revenue increases of 20% globally and 24% in the Americas. We're also seeing greater resilience among U.S. leasing transactions generating less than $1 million of revenue, which were down just 25% [ with ] a decline of over 60% for those over $1 million. Advisory sales improved notably from Q3, but remained 15% below Q4 2019 levels. 
The Americas and APAC regions saw sequential improvement, paced by the U.S., where advisory sales revenue fell just 5% in Q4 compared with nearly 39% in Q3. Strength in the Americas reflected both U.S. market share gains of 90 basis points to nearly 19% and relatively strong industrial and multifamily transactional activity. 
Looking more closely at our activity with office assets underscores the benefits of our geographic diversification. In the Americas, office sales and leasing revenue fell over 50% compared to declines of around 30% for each in EMEA and 17% for sales and 20% for leasing in APAC. Commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 49% in the quarter, reflecting a surge in GSE lending, particularly targeted at affordable housing. This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and loan sales activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan originations, our loan servicing portfolio grew 17% to $269 billion, while servicing revenue grew nearly 25%. Valuation revenue grew about 4%, reflecting increased assignments for investor clients, particularly in Continental Europe, North Asia and Pacific. 
Finally, Advisory Property and Project Management together declined about 4%. Property Management fee revenue grew just over 1%, while advisory project management declined 12%, as demand from U.S. public sector and industrial clients partially offset a steep decline in office. Notably, we completed 18% fewer projects than in the last year's fourth quarter, while the margin on these projects improved. We expect Project Management to benefit from pent-up demand as economies reopen and business activity normalizes. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our global Workplace Solutions segment posted 3% fee revenue growth as a 7% increase in both Facilities and Project Management offset a steep decline in GWS transactional revenue. Despite limited transaction revenue in the fourth quarter, our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded over 350 basis points to nearly 18%, marking our third consecutive quarter of record profitability. GWS margins continued to benefit from lower discretionary spending and structural changes to the cost base. 
While our new business pipeline remains solid, COVID restrictions continue to hamper new GWS client onboarding. We expect GWS growth to gain momentum in the middle part of this year as the economy continues to reopen. Despite these recent operational challenges, we expect our GWS business to continue benefiting from greater diversification across client sectors and property types. For example, our focus on specialized services for life sciences and health care assets resulted in a 240 basis point increase in revenue contribution from these clients in these sectors in 2020. In addition, our data center services business delivered notably strong revenue growth in 2020. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate investments segment achieved $110 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $68 million increase from the prior year Q4. Investment Management adjusted EBITDA rose over 228% to nearly $53 million. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at nearly $123 billion, driving 15% growth in asset management fees. Importantly, just 20% of total AUM is invested in office, while industrial and logistics comprise our largest investment. Additionally, carried interest surged to $31.5 million versus just $9.7 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of the disposition of a retail property portfolio in South Korea. 
Development adjusted EBITDA rose to over $67 million, reflecting an elevated level of industrial asset sales in the quarter. Our in-process development portfolio continued to grow, driven by strong demand from industrial clients, reaching a new record at $14.9 billion. Importantly, fee development and build-to-suit projects comprise more than half of this in-process portfolio, offering greater visibility and predictability into our future development earnings. 
Lastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of over $10 million was slightly more than that in Q3. Hana's results were impacted by the pandemic and the cost of building out new units. As Bob detailed earlier, we expect demand for flexible solutions to ramp up as the pandemic recedes and occupiers act on their desire for optionality in their real estate portfolios. Our investment and partnership with Industrious positions us to capitalize on this opportunity. 
Turning to Slide 11. We've ended 2020 with record free cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet and considerable financial capacity. During 2020, free cash flow increased 68% to nearly $1.6 billion. This was partially driven by lower working capital required by our GWS business as new client onboarding slowed from a particularly strong pace in 2019. We expect this to modestly reverse as client onboarding accelerate. Nevertheless, we will benefit from improved cash management processes and our cost optimization efforts, which generated savings of around $120 million in 2020. Structural cost changes are expected to deliver over $100 million of incremental savings in 2021, even after accounting for the reversal of certain actions that were temporary in nature. These changes will enable us to pursue OpEx investments to enhance growth while preserving strong profitability. 
We managed our balance sheet prudently heading into the downturn. This, coupled with the strong cash flow generation, enabled us to end 2020 with a net cash position and $4.6 billion of liquidity. 
Turning to Slide 12. While considerable uncertainty remains, we expect our business' resiliency and the world's continued progress in mitigating the pandemic to benefit our 2021 results. While transaction revenue has been weak, we have fared much better than in prior downturn due to the broad diversification of both deal sizes and property types. During 2021, we expect continued growth in industrial and multifamily transactions as well as a modest rebound in retail leasing to offset continued pressure in the office market. Within office, we anticipate quicker leasing improvement outside of the Americas. Overall, we expect transactional revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits for the full year 2021. From a sequential standpoint, we expect the sales and leasing revenue decline on a combined basis in Q1 relative to prior year to be similar to the pullback we saw in Q4 of 2020. The transactional revenue should begin to rebound in Q2, particularly since by then, we will be comparing against the depressed levels of the pandemic's first month. 
Across the rest of advisory, we expect high single-digit revenue growth, with Property Management and mortgage origination leading the gains. We expect modest margin improvement in advisory this year, reflecting this revenue growth and the full year effects of cost optimization, partially offset by the reversal of some temporary cost savings measures we imposed during the depth of the crisis as well as select investments. 
Moving to GWS. We expect revenue to rise in the high single-digit range this year, with slightly better growth in adjusted EBITDA. The relaxation of COVID restrictions should enable faster client onboarding and catalyze GWS growth across Project Management and Facilities Management. Because of this, we expect sequential improvement in our GWS growth as we move through 2021, with the rate expected to accelerate to low double digits by year-end. We believe this growth rate can be sustainable on a multiyear basis. 
Looking at REI. We expect this segment to build on its record-breaking adjusted EBITDA contribution in 2020, with both investment management and development poised for compelling performance. In Investment Management, we expect revenue to approximate 2020's $475 million level, with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. We expect adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid- to high single-digit range compared with the $125 million contributed in 2020. This reflects some operating leverage as well as some incremental operating expense investments to enhance future growth. 
We project U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid single-digit range from the $142 million generated this year. Our in-process portfolio continues to grow, reflecting increased appetite for warehouse and distribution space. We also envision targeted investments this year to expand our geographic reach, deepen our position in growth sectors and accelerate future growth, including a new initiative to launch an industrial and logistics development capability in Continental Europe. We are seeing tremendous demand from U.S.-based capital partners and occupiers for logistics facilities across Europe and are assembling an experienced team under the highly regarded Trammel Crow Company brand to meet this exploding demand. 
For our U.K. multifamily development business, we expect the pace of construction to pick up as COVID restrictions lift. As a result, we are forecasting this business to produce around [ $15 ] million more in adjusted EBITDA than the $3 million contribution it generated in 2020. All in, we expect our 2021 adjusted EPS to approach our pre-pandemic peak achieved in 2019, with some potential upside from our capital allocation activity. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our track record over the last decade, and notably over the last 12 months, has proven the resiliency of CBRE's business and provides the foundation for enduring average annual earnings growth about a minimum low double digits through at least 2025, with meaningful upside potential from additional capital allocation. We expect to further enhance our organic earnings growth through a combination of investments and capital returns to shareholders. Given our diversified business mix, we expect strong organic growth in key parts of our business to more than offset lower demand for office space as hybrid work models result in smaller corporate footprint. We see growth opportunities through increasing broker recruiting, digital and technology investment and principal and co-investment activity in our REI segment. A good example of this is our co-investment through CBRE global investors into private infrastructure programs, which is an area we expect will benefit from secular growth tailwinds. Initiatives like the SPAC sponsorship and Industrious investment, which partners us with an industry leader in flexible workspaces, can further jump-start our growth while offering younger, developing companies the benefit of aligning with CBRE's extensive platform capabilities. 
Finally, we intend to dynamically allocate our capital while preserving our investment-grade credit rating to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. To this end, we view our shares as an attractive investment if we are unable to identify enough strategic acquisition opportunities at attractive valuations. We intend to resume our programmatic repurchase program, and we'll seek to repurchase shares as our financial capacity and valuation allows. We will provide progress updates annually as we pursue this multiyear growth framework. 
With that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some closing remarks."

Before we take your questions, I want to briefly touch on CBRE's approach to environmental, social and governance issues. We know from our interactions with you that ESG is extremely important to our shareholders as well as our clients and our people. CBRE is determined to set the pace for our sector on ESG issues, particularly sustainability and diversity. Making measurable progress is one of my personal performance objectives for the year. 
When it comes to diversity, CBRE's commitment begins at the top. Our 12-person Board of Directors includes 3 women and 4 diverse men. Of the 13 executives who report to me, 5 are diverse. These direct reports include Tim Disman, who is named Chief Diversity Officer last year. We have just expanded Tim's role to Chief Responsibility Officer and are bringing together all aspects of ESG, environmental sustainability, workplace safety and well-being, philanthropy and public affairs as well as diversity and inclusion under his leadership. 
One notable commitment is the use of our massive supply chain to advance diversity by spending $3 billion annually with minority- and women-owned businesses by 2025. Accelerating our progress with recruiting and developing diverse team members remains a core focus. We're making steady progress as reflected in our earning a place on both the Bloomberg Gender-Equality index and the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality index in late January. 
We've also been recognized for our leadership in sustainability. For example, CBRE is the only commercial real estate services provider to land on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We are determined to make further gains. Late last year, we committed the science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets with the goal of cutting our emissions by more than 2/3 by 2035. We also pledged to make similarly ambitious reductions in the properties and facilities we manage for clients. As the world's largest manager of commercial properties, CBRE can play an outsized role in helping to limit the rise in global temperatures, improve the efficiency and sustainability of building operations while benefiting our shareholders given the heightened demand for sustainability services. This is not only good for the planet, it is simply good business practice. 
With that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

So to repeat those 4 dimensions, it's product type, for instance, industrial versus office, et cetera. It's line of business, for instance, leasing versus project management versus facilities management. It's geographic spread. And of course, it's client type. 
We have done a ton of strategic work over the last year in response to COVID. And the crisis has caused us to really get focused on what parts of our business are going to be accelerated given the current circumstance and the likely circumstance over the next few years and what parts are going to be under pressure. We've got a management team that's very well equipped to adjust focus, and we got a balance sheet with lots of capacity to help us drive that adjustment to our focus.

But as it relates to their business model, it is so overlapping with what we've been trying to do with Hana. It was the perfect flex space operator for us to invest in. They have an asset-light model. That means that they provide flex space as a service as a service to landlord, as a service to tenants. They are not taking long-term leases and then turning around and doing short-term leases with occupiers. They are very, very riveted on client service. We were super proud of Hana's client service that they beat us. They topped us. They were the 1 operator in the marketplace that had better client service. They have a footprint of 100 units. It will be well over 100 with Hana and growing nicely from there so that there'll be some scale to offer our occupier clients. And if you were to talk to Jamie Hadari, their CEO, he would tell you that one of the things he was excited about our ability to bring to the table is deep and broad relations across the occupiers around the world. So we think that strategically, Industrious is the right company for us to invest in and partner with in a sector that we believe is going to have really nice dynamics over the next several years because these occupiers, as they rethink their space utilization, are going to want flexibility all over the place. They're going to want to be able to get in and out of space relatively quickly. They're going to want to be able to take smaller spaces away from their headquarters, so their people can not have to come into CBDs in some cases or come into other areas of the CBD where the headquarter isn't. So we think they were the perfect partner for us, and we love where we've ended up there. And I think if you talk to Jamie and their team, they would comment similarly on the situation."

We start with -- and by the way, M&A and investments that we make, for instance, the Industrious investment, which clearly wasn't M&A. We, first and foremost, think about improving our ability to serve our clients, bringing something to the table that we didn't have before because at the core of our strategy is delivering outcomes to our clients they couldn't get elsewhere. We look across our business, all 3 segments. So advisory, GWS or outsourcing and REI, and we look for places where we can buy businesses to fill out our capability set. Of course, we're not going to do deals that don't make sense that don't achieve the hurdle rates we establish, so on and so forth. Right now, we think there are some very good opportunities out there. We're being very thoughtful about where we go. 
You know, Tony, we've talked about it so much over the year. There are certain parts of our business, we think, have better growth profiles than others. So we're a little more oriented there when we do M&A. But we think we can find M&A opportunities across all 3 sectors. And I'm going to highlight 1 that surprised everybody 1.5 years ago when we did the Telford Homes acquisition in the U.K. That was an area where we came in. We realized that there was a real need for institutional quality, multifamily housing in London that wasn't being fulfilled. We had the opportunity to buy that business. We love the long-term profile of that business, and now we're using our presence there to -- and Leah commented on this, to expand into industrial development in the U.K. and Europe and very consistent with the model. That will be more of an organic expansion. But we think there's going to be opportunities across all 3 of our segments, some infill and some larger."

Well, we've had a huge amount of -- one of the things that we've just worn out during COVID is interfacing with these occupier clients about what their expectations are about going back to the office. So first of all, I want to start with what we think in general. 
In general, we believe that on kind of a weighted average basis, clients will go back to the office at about 85% of where they were before. In other words, their weighted average headcount will be down maybe 15%. Of course, we're all going to learn a whole lot more about that once COVID's over and there's not that kind of psychological overhang of making those decisions while we're in the midst of COVID. We also know that most of the occupiers are going to want to have some remote capability for their people to come into the office. A lot of them are doing that now, but they're going to want to make that a formal part of their portfolio. So historically, when we work with these big clients, they had 2 types of components to their portfolio. They had space they own and space they lease in a traditional long-term way. They started to get into the flex space as a third option toward the end of the last cycle. And now they're saying that's going to be a more pronounced part of their portfolio of space going forward. So we think that means for companies like Industrious, in particular, Industrious, who has a offering that's very high-quality, data security oriented towards corporate users that there's going to be big demand for what they do. 
They're not going to be the only ones. There's other providers that can do good work in that regard, too. But we think that this will be a permanent piece in a bigger way of the portfolio of these occupier clients, and that will serve right into the heart of the Industrious strategy."

What it's really created is a pause in their decision-making because for them to make significant outsourcing decisions that are long-term in nature, they need to have a clear understanding of how the footprint of their real estate needs will evolve over time. And so it's not about a diminution or reduction of our existing revenue. It's more about a delay in our pipeline. And what's important to appreciate is that we have significant diversification across the clients that we serve within GWS. So we're not just serving their office footprint. We're also serving their data center needs. We're serving their -- for life sciences clients, we're serving their research facility needs. And so there's a lot of other opportunity out there across other property types and through our client diversification where we see significant opportunities for growth as well.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with the presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.  
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our fourth quarter results and expectations for the future. After their comments, we'll open up the call for questions.  
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2021 outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment, financial performance, including profitability and margins and the effects of both cost savings initiatives in COVID-19 and the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only, and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS; adjusted EBITDA; fee revenue; certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.  
Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our fourth quarter 2020 and full year financial results. 
During the fourth quarter, total revenue and fee revenue fell about 3% and 7%, respectively, driven by constrained transaction activity in Advisory Services. Lower revenue was more than offset by prudent cost management and the continued benefit of transformation initiatives that improved both our cost structure and operational agility. 
Overall, adjusted EPS grew nearly 10% to $1.45. GAAP EPS of $0.93 includes around $0.28 of transformation initiative costs. Importantly, GAAP EPS in the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.67 tax benefit, primarily from legal entity restructuring. Excluding these unusual items in both periods, GAAP EPS would have been up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Now for insights on results and our longer-term strategy, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to Bob."

As you've seen, we ended 2020 on a high note, with adjusted EPS for the quarter reaching an all-time high and adjusted EBITDA growing 9%. This capped a year of significant challenges stemming from COVID, but also one that brought to the forefront CBRE's competitive advantages, our ability to capture often overlooked industry opportunities and the resiliency we've built into the business over the past decade. This resilience has allowed us to offset the steep decline in sales and lease transactions and the pandemic's unique effects on the office market.  
Today, CBRE is more diversified than ever before across 4 key dimensions: property types, lines of business, geographic markets and clients. A few examples will bring definition to this. While office remains an important property type for us, its negative effects have been tempered by our large and growing presence in industrial, data centers and multifamily. Leasing is a key line of business for us that has been under pressure. However, other lines of business, such as GSE financing, investment management and facilities management have all continued to grow. Geographically, New York, London and San Francisco are key markets for us. But our presence in Asia is robust and growing, and our significant activity in Europe and second-tier U.S. markets has held up relatively well. We serve many clients that have been negatively impacted by COVID, but do a huge amount of business with technology, life science and other clients that have thrived over the past year.  
Reflecting how large companies increasingly rely on CBRE, nearly 90% of our 100 largest clients purchased 4 or more services in 2020, up from less than 1/4 a decade ago. Our broad diversification across these 4 key dimensions has served us well compared with prior downturns. Adjusted EPS fell 12% in 2020. We expect earnings to rise to near peak profitability this year, the second year of the downturn, and continue up from there. By comparison, during the great financial crisis, we suffered a more than 80% peak-to-trough decline, and adjusted earnings per share did not return to the prior peak for 8 years.  
We're exiting the worst of the COVID crisis in great shape. Our strengths include a leaner operating structure, significant financial capacity and a strategy squarely aimed at the many opportunities unfolding in our industry, including those with secular tailwinds.  
We've built our long-term plan on the assumption that office demand remains under pressure due to a lasting increase in remote working and occupiers' needs for greater flexibility in space obligations. This is reflected in our base case forecast, which, nevertheless, expects us to achieve a minimum of low double-digit average annual adjusted EPS growth through at least 2025, absent a recession. This forecast is driven by organic growth and deploying capital, notably in M&A and real estate investments, with meaningful upside potential from additional capital deployment. We expect to achieve this strong growth while continuing to evolve our business as we reduce contributions from lower secular growth business lines and increase our focus on areas that have higher secular growth profiles.  
One growth area we are particularly high on is flexible office space. We identified this sector as an opportunity 3 years ago and have been building our Hana business expressly to meet rapidly rising demand from occupiers and investors. Our investment in Industrious now aligns this with an exceptional operator and outstanding leadership team that is executing a great strategy. With more than 100 units in 50 markets, Industrious enables us to participate in the flex space opportunity at scale and contribute meaningfully to Industrious' expansion.  
Now Leah will discuss the quarter and our outlook for 2021."

Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA declined about 13% and nearly 8%, respectively.

Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA declined about 13% and nearly 8%, respectively. These declines are mostly attributable to continued weakness in high-margin sales and leasing businesses. This was partially offset by disciplined cost management and strong performance by the rest of our advisory businesses, which, in combination, grew revenue nearly 11%. Overall, our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 120 basis points compared to a year ago. This margin benefited from cost optimization efforts and 210 basis points from substantially higher OMSR gains than in last year's fourth quarter.  
Global leasing revenue declined about 28% as occupiers around the world continued to defer leasing decisions due to the pandemic. For the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which together comprise about 78% of global leasing, revenue decreased 36%, 18% and 6%, respectively. The U.K. again benefited from particularly strong industrial activity in the quarter, which helped offset subdued demand for office space. The continued growth of e-commerce drove industrial leasing revenue increases of 20% globally and 24% in the Americas. We're also seeing greater resilience among U.S. leasing transactions generating less than $1 million of revenue, which were down just 25% versus a decline of over 60% for those over $1 million. Advisory sales improved notably from Q3, but remained 15% below Q4 2019 levels.  
The Americas and APAC regions saw sequential improvement, paced by the U.S., where advisory sales revenue fell just 5% in Q4 compared with nearly 39% in Q3. Strength in the Americas reflected both U.S. market share gains of 90 basis points to nearly 19% and relatively strong industrial and multifamily transactional activity.  
Looking more closely at our activity with office assets underscores the benefits of our geographic diversification. In the Americas, office sales and leasing revenue fell over 50% compared to declines of around 30% for each in EMEA and 17% for sales and 20% for leasing in APAC. Commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 49% in the quarter, reflecting a surge in GSE lending, particularly targeted at affordable housing. This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and loan sales activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan originations, our loan servicing portfolio grew 17% to $269 billion, while servicing revenue grew nearly 25%. Valuation revenue grew about 4%, reflecting increased assignments for investor clients, particularly in Continental Europe, North Asia and Pacific.  
Finally, Advisory Property and Project Management together declined about 4%. Property Management fee revenue grew just over 1%, while advisory project management declined 12%, as demand from U.S. public sector and industrial clients partially offset a steep decline in office. Notably, we completed 18% fewer projects than in the last year's fourth quarter, while the margin on these projects improved. We expect Project Management to benefit from pent-up demand as economies reopen and business activity normalizes.  
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment posted 3% fee revenue growth as a 7% increase in both Facilities and Project Management offset a steep decline in GWS transactional revenue. Despite limited transaction revenue in the fourth quarter, our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded over 350 basis points to nearly 18%, marking our third consecutive quarter of record profitability. GWS margins continued to benefit from lower discretionary spending and structural changes to the cost base.  
While our new business pipeline remains solid, COVID restrictions continue to hamper new GWS client onboarding. We expect GWS growth to gain momentum in the middle part of this year as the economy continues to reopen. Despite these recent operational challenges, we expect our GWS business to continue benefiting from greater diversification across client sectors and property types. For example, our focus on specialized services for life sciences and health care assets resulted in a 240 basis point increase in revenue contribution from these clients in these sectors in 2020. In addition, our data center services business delivered notably strong revenue growth in 2020.  
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment achieved $110 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $68 million increase from the prior year Q4. Investment Management adjusted EBITDA rose over 228% to nearly $53 million. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at nearly $123 billion, driving 15% growth in asset management fees. Importantly, just 20% of total AUM is invested in office, while industrial and logistics comprise our largest investment. Additionally, carried interest surged to $31.5 million versus just $9.7 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of the disposition of a retail property portfolio in South Korea.  
Development adjusted EBITDA rose to over $67 million, reflecting an elevated level of industrial asset sales in the quarter. Our in-process development portfolio continued to grow, driven by strong demand from industrial clients, reaching a new record at $14.9 billion. Importantly, fee development and build-to-suit projects comprise more than half of this in-process portfolio, offering greater visibility and predictability into our future development earnings.  
Lastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of over $10 million was slightly more than that in Q3. Hana's results were impacted by the pandemic and the cost of building out new units. As Bob detailed earlier, we expect demand for flexible solutions to ramp up as the pandemic recedes and occupiers act on their desire for optionality in their real estate portfolios. Our investment and partnership with Industrious positions us to capitalize on this opportunity.  
Turning to Slide 11. We've ended 2020 with record free cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet and considerable financial capacity. During 2020, free cash flow increased 68% to nearly $1.6 billion. This was partially driven by lower working capital required by our GWS business as new client onboarding slowed from a particularly strong pace in 2019. We expect this to modestly reverse as client onboarding accelerates. Nevertheless, we will benefit from improved cash management processes and our cost optimization efforts, which generated savings of around $120 million in 2020. Structural cost changes are expected to deliver over $100 million of incremental savings in 2021, even after accounting for the reversal of certain actions that were temporary in nature. These changes will enable us to pursue OpEx investments to enhance growth while preserving strong profitability.  
We managed our balance sheet prudently heading into the downturn. This, coupled with the strong cash flow generation, enabled us to end 2020 with a net cash position and $4.6 billion of liquidity.  
Turning to Slide 12. While considerable uncertainty remains, we expect our business' resiliency and the world's continued progress in mitigating the pandemic to benefit our 2021 results. While transaction revenue has been weak, we have fared much better than in prior downturns due to the broad diversification of both deal sizes and property types. During 2021, we expect continued growth in industrial and multifamily transactions as well as a modest rebound in retail leasing to offset continued pressure in the office market. Within office, we anticipate quicker leasing improvement outside of the Americas. Overall, we expect transactional revenue growth in the mid to high single digits for the full year 2021. From a sequential standpoint, we expect the sales and leasing revenue decline on a combined basis in Q1 relative to prior year to be similar to the pullback we saw in Q4 of 2020. The transactional revenue should begin to rebound in Q2, particularly since, by then, we will be comparing against the depressed levels of the pandemic's first month.  
Across the rest of Advisory, we expect high single-digit revenue growth, with Property Management and mortgage origination leading the gains. We expect modest margin improvement in advisory this year, reflecting this revenue growth and the full year effects of cost optimization, partially offset by the reversal of some temporary cost savings measures we imposed during the depth of the crisis as well as select investments.  
Moving to GWS. We expect revenue to rise in the high single-digit range this year, with slightly better growth in adjusted EBITDA. The relaxation of COVID restrictions should enable faster client onboarding and catalyze GWS growth across Project Management and Facilities Management. Because of this, we expect sequential improvement in our GWS growth as we move through 2021, with the rate expected to accelerate to low double digits by year-end. We believe this growth rate can be sustainable on a multiyear basis.  
Looking at REI. We expect this segment to build on its record-breaking adjusted EBITDA contribution in 2020, with both investment management and development poised for compelling performance. In Investment Management, we expect revenue to approximate 2020's $475 million level, with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. We expect adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid- to high single-digit range compared with the $125 million contributed in 2020. This reflects some operating leverage as well as some incremental operating expense investments to enhance future growth.  
We project U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid single-digit range from the $142 million generated this year. Our in-process portfolio continues to grow, reflecting increased appetite for warehouse and distribution space. We also envision targeted investments this year to expand our geographic reach, deepen our position in growth sectors and accelerate future growth, including a new initiative to launch an industrial and logistics development capability in Continental Europe. We are seeing tremendous demand from U.S.-based capital partners and occupiers for logistics facilities across Europe and are assembling an experienced team under the highly regarded Trammell Crow Company brand to meet this exploding demand.  
For our U.K. multifamily development business, we expect the pace of construction to pick up as COVID restrictions lift. As a result, we are forecasting this business to produce around $15 million more in adjusted EBITDA than the $3 million contribution it generated in 2020. All in, we expect our 2021 adjusted EPS to approach our pre-pandemic peak achieved in 2019, with some potential upside from our capital allocation activity.  
Turning to Slide 13. Our track record over the last decade, and notably over the last 12 months, has proven the resiliency of CBRE's business and provides the foundation for enduring average annual earnings growth, about a minimum low double digits through at least 2025, with meaningful upside potential from additional capital allocation. We expect to further enhance our organic earnings growth through a combination of investments and capital returns to shareholders. 
Given our diversified business mix, we expect strong organic growth in key parts of our business to more than offset lower demand for office space as hybrid work models result in smaller corporate footprint. We see growth opportunities through increasing broker recruiting, digital and technology investment and principal and co-investment activity in our REI segment. A good example of this is our co-investment through CBRE Global Investors into private infrastructure programs, which is an area we expect will benefit from secular growth tailwinds. Initiatives like the SPAC sponsorship and Industrious investment, which partners us with an industry leader in flexible workspaces, can further jump-start our growth while offering younger, developing companies the benefit of aligning with CBRE's extensive platform capabilities.  
Finally, we intend to dynamically allocate our capital while preserving our investment-grade credit rating to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. To this end, we view our shares as an attractive investment if we are unable to identify enough strategic acquisition opportunities at attractive valuations. We intend to resume our programmatic repurchase program, and we'll seek to repurchase shares as our financial capacity and valuation allows. We will provide progress updates annually as we pursue this multiyear growth framework.  
With that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some closing remarks."

Before we take your questions, I want to briefly touch on CBRE's approach to environmental, social and governance issues. We know from our interactions with you that ESG is extremely important to our shareholders as well as our clients and our people. CBRE is determined to set the pace for our sector on ESG issues, particularly sustainability and diversity. Making measurable progress is one of my personal performance objectives for the year.  
When it comes to diversity, CBRE's commitment begins at the top. Our 12-person Board of Directors includes 3 women and 4 diverse men. Of the 13 executives who report to me, 5 are diverse. These direct reports include Tim Dismond, who is named Chief Diversity Officer last year. We have just expanded Tim's role to Chief Responsibility Officer and are bringing together all aspects of ESG, environmental sustainability, workplace safety and well-being, philanthropy and public affairs as well as diversity and inclusion under his leadership.  
One notable commitment is the use of our massive supply chain to advance diversity by spending $3 billion annually with minority- and women-owned businesses by 2025. Accelerating our progress with recruiting and developing diverse team members remains a core focus. We're making steady progress as reflected in our earning a place on both the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index in late January.  
We've also been recognized for our leadership in sustainability. For example, CBRE is the only commercial real estate services provider to land on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We are determined to make further gains. Late last year, we committed the science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets with the goal of cutting our emissions by more than 2/3 by 2035. We also pledged to make similarly ambitious reductions in the properties and facilities we manage for clients. As the world's largest manager of commercial properties, CBRE can play an outsized role in helping to limit the rise in global temperatures, improve the efficiency and sustainability of building operations while benefiting our shareholders given the heightened demand for sustainability services. This is not only good for the planet, it is simply good business practice.  
With that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

So to repeat those 4 dimensions, it's product type, for instance, industrial versus office, et cetera. It's line of business, for instance, leasing versus Project Management versus Facilities Management. It's geographic spread. And of course, it's client type. 
We have done a ton of strategic work over the last year in response to COVID. And the crisis has caused us to really get focused on what parts of our business are going to be accelerated given the current circumstance and the likely circumstance over the next few years and what parts are going to be under pressure. We've got a management team that's very well equipped to adjust focus, and we got a balance sheet with lots of capacity to help us drive that adjustment to our focus. And yes, we believe that we'll be moving in the direction of elements of our business across those 4 dimensions that have secular advantage or at least neutral as it relates to being resilient.

But as it relates to their business model, it is so overlapping with what we've been trying to do with Hana. It was the perfect flex space operator for us to invest in. They have an asset-light model. That means that they provide flex space as a service -- as a service to landlord, as a service to tenants. They are not taking long-term leases and then turning around and doing short-term leases with occupiers. 
They are very, very riveted on client service. We were super proud of Hana's client service, and they beat us. They topped us. They were the one operator in the marketplace that had better client service. They have a footprint of 100 units. It will be well over 100 with Hana and growing nicely from there so that there'll be some scale to offer our occupier clients. And if you were to talk to Jamie Hodari, their CEO, he would tell you that one of the things he was excited about our ability to bring to the table is deep and broad relations across the occupiers around the world. 
So we think that strategically, Industrious is the right company for us to invest in and partner with in a sector that we believe is going to have really nice dynamics over the next several years because these occupiers, as they rethink their space utilization, are going to want flexibility all over the place. They're going to want to be able to get in and out of space relatively quickly. They're going to want to be able to take smaller spaces away from their headquarters so their people can not have to come into CBDs in some cases or come into other areas of the CBD where the headquarter isn't. So we think they were the perfect partner for us, and we love where we've ended up there. And I think if you talk to Jamie and their team, they would comment similarly on the situation."

Right now, we think there are some very good opportunities out there. We're being very thoughtful about where we go. 
You know, Tony, we've talked about it so much over the year. There are certain parts of our business, we think, have better growth profiles than others. So we're a little more oriented there when we do M&A. But we think we can find M&A opportunities across all 3 sectors. And I'm going to highlight one that surprised everybody 1.5 years ago when we did the Telford Homes acquisition in the U.K. That was an area where we came in. We realized that there was a real need for institutional quality, multifamily housing in London that wasn't being fulfilled. We had the opportunity to buy that business. We love the long-term profile of that business, and now we're using our presence there to -- and Leah commented on this, to expand into industrial development in the U.K. and Europe and very consistent with the model.

First was workforce optimization. That was early in the year. It was really meant to address the immediate needs to respond to the changing demand environment as that was presented by COVID. We spent about $38 million on workforce optimization. 
We then turned our sights on transformation initiatives that were specifically targeted at changing the shape and the structure of parts of our business that are effectively positioning us to be more agile going forward. We invested about $176 million into those transformation initiatives. We expect that the total run rate benefit from the $214 million of investment will be around $369 million of cost. That's being offset in '21 by the resumption -- or we had some temporary costs that were cut in 2020 that will come back. But net-net, we think there will be about $100 million of incremental savings in 2021 from the full work that we did in 2020 related to cost management.

Well, we've had a huge amount of -- one of the things that we've just worn out during COVID is interfacing with these occupier clients about what their expectations are about going back to the office. So first of all, I want to start with what we think in general. 
In general, we believe that on kind of a weighted average basis, clients will go back to the office at about 85% of where they were before. In other words, their weighted average headcount will be down maybe 15%. Of course, we're all going to learn a whole lot more about that once COVID's over and there's not that kind of psychological overhang of making those decisions while we're in the midst of COVID. We also know that most of the occupiers are going to want to have some remote capability for their people to come into the office. A lot of them are doing that now, but they're going to want to make that a formal part of their portfolio. 
So historically, when we work with these big clients, they had 2 types of components to their portfolio. They had space they own and space they lease in a traditional long-term way. They started to get into the flex space as a third option toward the end of the last cycle. And now they're saying that's going to be a more pronounced part of their portfolio of space going forward. So we think that means for companies like Industrious, in particular, Industrious, who has a offering that's very high-quality, data security oriented towards corporate users that there's going to be big demand for what they do. 
They're not going to be the only ones. There's other providers that can do good work in that regard, too. But we think that this will be a permanent piece in a bigger way of the portfolio of these occupier clients, and that will serve right into the heart of the Industrious strategy."

When we contemplated doing the SPAC, that's what we had in mind. We would make an investment in those kind of companies. We would establish some kind of operating alliance with those type of companies. But we wouldn't buy them outright because of the reasons I just articulated.

What it's really created is a pause in their decision-making because for them to make significant outsourcing decisions that are long-term in nature, they need to have a clear understanding of how the footprint of their real estate needs will evolve over time. And so it's not about a diminution or reduction of our existing revenue. It's more about a delay in our pipeline.

We're also serving their data center needs. We're serving their -- for life sciences clients, we're serving their research facility needs.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leo sterns, our CFO, will discuss our quarterly results and updated 2021 qualitative outlook. After their comments, we'll open up the call for questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases, M&A and investment activity, financial performance, including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and the effects of both cost savings initiatives and the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. 
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. 
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. 
Before we discuss the quarter, I'll briefly outline a few changes to our financial reporting, which are summarized in our earnings release as well. First, we now report all project management revenue in our GWS segment. 
Previously, a portion of our project management revenue was reported in the advisory segment. Next, all sales and leasing revenue is now reported in the advisory segment. We will no longer report sales and leasing revenue from GWS clients in the GWS segment. Including all sales and leasing revenue in the advisory segment had a more complete picture of transactional trends in our business. 
We have also established a fourth business segment where we will report corporate overhead expense and other financial impacts that are not specific to 1 of our 3 existing operational segments. This will provide greater transparency into our cost structure. 
Due to this change, we will be utilizing segment operating profit to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments which excludes the impact of corporate overhead. 
Additionally, we will replace our fee revenue metric with net revenue to account for the impact of pass-through reimbursement revenue. Net revenue will only exclude reimbursement revenue that does not generate a margin for CBRE. We believe this will provide a clear view of our profitability profile, particularly in our GWS business. 
For this quarter, we have provided a bridge for our legacy and revised financial metrics and our quarterly supplemental posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. Going forward, we will only be reporting these updated financial metrics. 
Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our first quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew about 1% to a new first quarter record of over $5.9 billion while net revenue fell 2%, reflecting continued constrained transaction activity in advisory services. The quarter saw a tangible benefit from both last year's transformation initiatives which has improved our cost structure and operational agility and higher OMSR gains. In total, our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 200 basis points rising to 14.6% and in line with our first quarter 2019 margin. 
Adjusted EPS grew 15% to $0.86, while GAAP EPS rose 55% to $0.78. And importantly, GAAP EPS in the prior year first quarter included a $0.17 headwind from an asset impairment, which was in part related to the offset of the pandemic. The impairment was not included in adjusted EPS last year. 
Additionally, this quarter includes an $0.11 benefit from venture fund investment gains and an accounting methodology change within our investment management business. Excluding unusual items in both periods, EPS is roughly flat with first quarter 2020 on an adjusted and GAAP basis. 
Now for deeper insights, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to Bob."

CBRE is off to a strong start in 2021. Our performance is being propelled by our long-standing efforts to diversify our business across 4 key dimensions: property types, lines of business, geographic markets and client types. Last quarter, we described in detail how this diversification has enhanced the resiliency of our business. This played out in several ways during the first quarter. 
Geographically, while activity in some markets, notably the Americas remained muted, we saw solid growth in the United Kingdom, parts of Continental Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia and Greater China. Among business lines, mortgage origination and loan servicing, valuations investment management and facilities management logged solid growth, offsetting a continued tepid sales and leasing environment. 
Industrial and data centers remain preferred property types. Our work in both property types grew robustly in the quarter, fueled by booming demand for e-commerce and cloud based services. 
Growth in these resilient property types helped to compensate for continued pressure on other property types, particularly office. Our client base is well diversified across the economy. 
In a quarter when activity with clients in some industries was down from a year ago, we saw particular strength in our work for life sciences and industrial and logistics companies, among others. 
The broad diversification of our business, coupled with decisive actions in 2020 to reset our cost structure, underpinned our earnings growth for the quarter, and we expect to see continued benefits in the quarters and years ahead. 
For full year 2021, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to meaningfully surpass 2019's peak level with potential upside from discretionary capital deployment. 
Notably, our outlook for 2021 and beyond envisions strong growth even with continued pressure on the office market. Clearly, that pressure remains very acute right now, particularly in densely populated gateway cities and will remain challenging for some time to come. 
However, we strongly believe the pressures on office were received from today's extreme levels as vaccine rollouts continue and companies settle into new normal work regimes. We expect our growth to be enhanced by capital deployment that is focused on sectors and business lines that are positioned to benefit significantly from secular growth trends. 
You saw evidence of this with our investment in industrious in the first quarter, which positions us to participate in the rising demand for flexible space solutions. And you can expect to see more evidence of that in future partnerships sponsorships and M&A activity. 
Now Leah will tell you more about the quarter, our outlook and our capital deployment strategy. Leah?"

Segment operating profit for advisory services was nearly flat despite a 5% net revenue decline. The revenue shortfall reflects continued pressure in high-margin sales and leasing businesses, which we offset with disciplined cost management, strong GSD servicing activity and elevated OMSR gains as well as growth in the other advisory lines of business. 
Overall, our advisory segment operating profit margin expanded about 100 basis points compared with a year ago. Excluding the OMSR gains in both years, the margin improved 20 basis points to about 17.2%. The as expected, global leasing revenue remained under pressure, declining 17% due primarily to weak office leasing in the Americas. 
We did see modest sequential improvement in Americas office leasing, as revenue fell 47% versus the 58% decline we experienced in the fourth quarter. Activity was stronger in other geographies and property types. For example, APAC leasing rose a healthy 11% as retail and industrial jumped 25% and 38%, respectively, while office was flat with a year ago. 
EMEA leasing grew 4%, reflecting surging industrial demand, which outweighed moderate office and retail declines. Notably, China and Australia, where the pandemic remains well in check have seen office occupancy return to pre-COVID levels, which has coincided with improving leasing trends in these markets. 
Advisory sales continued to improve sequentially. Declining just 9% versus the 16% decline in the fourth quarter. This improvement was paced by APAC, where sales dipped just 2%, reflecting particularly robust retail and industrial activity. 
Americas and EMEA sales fell around 10% and 13%, respectively, due primarily to sharply lower office sales. Excluding the sales and leasing business lines, net revenue rose 7% and comprised nearly half of the advisory segment's total net revenue. Commercial mortgage origination revenue rose nearly 14% in the quarter, reflecting strong GSE lending, including for affordable housing. 
This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and a pickup in construction activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan originations, our loan servicing portfolio increased 19% to nearly $285 billion, while servicing revenue rose over 21%. Valuation revenue was up 8%. 
Activity was particularly strong in the Pacific region, where valuation revenue increased over 35%. And finally, property management net revenue grew over 2%. And primarily driven by expanded and new client relationships in APAC. 
This offset a modest decline in the U.S. as we exited a low-margin contract and transferred a few accounts to our local facilities management business in GWS. 
Moving to Slide 9. Global Workplace Solutions revenue and net revenue edged up 4% and 1%, respectively. 
On a net revenue basis, facilities management rose 4%. And while project management decreased 7%. The decline in project management was driven by the legacy advisory project management business. Project work for these clients tends to be tied to space fit out, resulting from new leases. And thus should improve as leasing markets recover. 
Revenue associated with GWS contractual clients was up moderately in the quarter. Modest top line growth, coupled with continued discipline in cost management and the benefit of transformation initiatives undertaken in 2020 led to segment operating profit growth of 42%. 
As we mentioned last year, Q1 did include an $11 million drag from the reduced scope of a client account. Adjusting for this unique item, segment operating profit was still up 29%. Importantly, we have seen a meaningful ramp in our facilities management new business pipeline, and it now exceeds the year-end 2019 level. 
The acceleration since year-end has been broad-based and diversified across geographies industry sectors, notably life sciences, manufacturing and logistics, professional services and technology clients and among property types, including data centers, retail, office and manufacturing facilities. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment generated $61 million of segment operating profit, an $18 million increase from Q1 2020. Investment management revenue grew 9% to $132 million. This revenue growth was fueled by a 16% increase in asset management fees generated by our strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record level of over $124 billion as well as stronger incentives and development fees as well as co-investment gains. 
In addition, we recorded a $24 million benefit from an accounting change related to the valuation of unlisted assets which should help reduce earnings volatility going forward. 
This partially offset lower carried interest, which declined $14 million to about $5 million in the quarter. Operating profit for this business line rose to $69 million, an increase of over 200%. Development operating profit fell to $9 million. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of certain asset sales, which were particularly strong in the prior year first quarter. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, development operating profit has grown about 36%. Our in process development portfolio reached a new record at $15 billion, importantly, 3 asset types that remain in strong demand, multifamily, industrial and health care, plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased, comprise more than 80% of this portfolio. 
Our development pipeline also grew 11% from year-end to $6.8 billion. Lastly, Hana's higher operating loss primarily reflects certain deal costs and software write-downs associated with the industrious transaction. 
We remain on course to close on the increase in our industrial stake from 35% to 40% during the second quarter. Turning to Slide 11. Let's now take a look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. 
Transaction activity is improving more quickly than we initially anticipated. This is especially true for global property sales and leasing outside the Americas. 
As a result, we have raised our outlook for 2021 transaction revenue growth. To the low double-digit range. Earlier, we had expected growth in the mid- to high single digits. We expect the rebound in transaction revenue to be most pronounced in the second quarter, since we will be comparing against the most depressed levels of the pandemic. 
Across the rest of our advisory businesses, we continue to expect high single-digit growth. We expect improved profitability as well given the revival of transaction revenue. 
For 2021, we anticipate our advisory segment operating profit margin on net revenue will slightly surpass the 19.7% and pre pandemic peak achieved in 2019. 
Moving to GWS. We are raising our expectations for segment operating profit, while maintaining our revenue forecast in the high single-digit range. We are benefiting from exceptional cost discipline, which we believe will allow us to reverse certain temporary expense cuts more slowly than originally anticipated. 
As a result, we now expect GWS segment operating profit to grow in the mid- to high teens range this year. Looking at REI, we expect this segment to build on its record profitability contribution in 2020 and with both investment management and development poised for sharply improved performance. In Investment management, we expect revenue to slightly surpass 2020's $475 million with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. 
We expect this business line's profitability, which totaled $140 million in 2020 to rise from that level at a mid- to high teens pace. We project U.S. development profit to rise by more than 30% compared with last year's $150 million level. Our improved outlook reflects a strong pace of monetization and higher property valuations than we originally projected. 
Our in process portfolio continues to grow with an emphasis on warehouse and distribution space. For our U.K. multifamily development business, we expect the pace of construction to pick up as Covid restrictions lift and reiterate our earlier expectation for this business. 
Profitability is expected to be about $15 million higher than the $3 million generated in 2020. Due to our improved revenue outlook and the benefit of transformation initiatives completed last year we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue to modestly exceed the 14% level achieved in 2019. This includes an expected uptick in corporate expenses, primarily related to higher performance-based stock compensation and certain OpEx investments for growth initiatives. 
All in, as Bob indicated, we now expect our 2021 adjusted EPS to meaningfully surpass our pre pandemic peak of $3.71 achieved in 2019, with potential upside from capital allocation activities. The anticipated growth for this year is likely to be significantly above the trend line. 
We provided in our long-term aspirational outlook last quarter. Flipping to Slide 12. We retain significant financial capacity to accelerate long-term growth while also returning cash to our shareholders. 
We believe that we have significantly reduced the volatility of our financial results and enhanced free cash flow potential. The record free cash flow we generated in 2020, combined with the prudent way we managed our balance sheet ahead of the crisis, positions us to deploy capital as economic conditions improve. Our efforts have already begun. So far this year, we've invested about $200 million on capital expenditures, M&A and partnership investments while buying back approximately $88 million of shares, including $64 million in the first quarter. 
We have a strong M&A pipeline and expect to continue programmatic share repurchases. However, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, it is highly unlikely we will approach the high end of our target leverage range within our current long-term planning period, absent a transformational investment. 
In closing, we are optimistic about our outlook for 2021 and beyond. We have a strong industry leadership position and management team. Well diversified business, loyal client base and the capital structure to fund future growth and optimize shareholder returns. 
And with that, operator, we'll take questions."

Next, to that is GWS, where we've got about 30%, and then the rest is between RDI and our corporate segment. In terms of the first quarter, though, on a net basis, so I'll talk a little bit about -- we have run rate cost savings, and we do have some temporary costs coming back, like compensation, it's performance-based and accrued based on that. 
We had about $24 million of benefit in advisory on a net basis and about $14 million of benefit in GWS with the rest, basically about $1 million or so across REI and corporate.

Those are certainly helping to mitigate the acute declines that we're seeing across office. So I do think that, that is a key part of the overall story for CBRE. The fact that we have positioned ourselves to be aligned with those very important areas of demand in the market today. And then also, given the fact that APAC was early on in terms of the impact related to COVID, we are seeing the regions of the world that have kind of come through this and manage through COVID quite well or effectively or we're early on in the onset of COVID.

So if you look at our margin performance for the year, yes, OMSR certainly helps. But even if you back out MSRs just before I get into the volumes on the GSES, I think it's important to note that we actually saw margin expansion ex-MSRS. So that's really important. As it relates to the GSES, their caps are coming down this year. 
So we may see some attenuation in terms of overall liquidity in that market. But again, their mandate is liquidity. 
So we'll see how they respond to the overall market conditions. The benefit to our business, though, is about the mix of where we're seeing that activity come from. And in the quarter, we did have more of a volume coming from Fannie as opposed to Freddie, and that certainly helps from a margin perspective, given the fact that we do have a risk share there on the Fannie side. 
So overall, it will really depend unfortunately, Jade, with respect to how that activity comes in, and we don't actually influence that. It's really a market-driven outcome."

So that's the portion of our business that might be impacted. Our view is that if it were to happen and not be retroactive, for the foreseeable future, it would be a plus for transaction volumes because people would be in the market trying to get deals done.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leo sterns, our CFO, will discuss our quarterly results and updated 2021 qualitative outlook. After their comments, we'll open up the call for questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases, M&A and investment activity, financial performance, including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and the effects of both cost savings initiatives and the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. 
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. 
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. 
Before we discuss the quarter, I'll briefly outline a few changes to our financial reporting, which are summarized in our earnings release as well. First, we now report all project management revenue in our GWS segment. 
Previously, a portion of our project management revenue was reported in the advisory segment. Next, all sales and leasing revenue is now reported in the advisory segment. We will no longer report sales and leasing revenue from GWS clients in the GWS segment. Including all sales and leasing revenue in the advisory segment had a more complete picture of transactional trends in our business. 
We have also established a fourth business segment where we will report corporate overhead expense and other financial impacts that are not specific to 1 of our 3 existing operational segments. This will provide greater transparency into our cost structure. 
Due to this change, we will be utilizing segment operating profit to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments which excludes the impact of corporate overhead. 
Additionally, we will replace our fee revenue metric with net revenue to account for the impact of pass-through reimbursement revenue. Net revenue will only exclude reimbursement revenue that does not generate a margin for CBRE. We believe this will provide a clear view of our profitability profile, particularly in our GWS business. 
For this quarter, we have provided a bridge for our legacy and revised financial metrics and our quarterly supplemental posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. Going forward, we will only be reporting these updated financial metrics. 
Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our first quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew about 1% to a new first quarter record of over $5.9 billion while net revenue fell 2%, reflecting continued constrained transaction activity in advisory services. The quarter saw a tangible benefit from both last year's transformation initiatives which has improved our cost structure and operational agility and higher OMSR gains. In total, our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 200 basis points rising to 14.6% and in line with our first quarter 2019 margin. 
Adjusted EPS grew 15% to $0.86, while GAAP EPS rose 55% to $0.78. And importantly, GAAP EPS in the prior year first quarter included a $0.17 headwind from an asset impairment, which was in part related to the offset of the pandemic. The impairment was not included in adjusted EPS last year. 
Additionally, this quarter includes an $0.11 benefit from venture fund investment gains and an accounting methodology change within our investment management business. Excluding unusual items in both periods, EPS is roughly flat with first quarter 2020 on an adjusted and GAAP basis. 
Now for deeper insights, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to Bob."

CBRE is off to a strong start in 2021. Our performance is being propelled by our long-standing efforts to diversify our business across 4 key dimensions: property types, lines of business, geographic markets and client types. Last quarter, we described in detail how this diversification has enhanced the resiliency of our business. This played out in several ways during the first quarter. 
Geographically, while activity in some markets, notably the Americas remained muted, we saw solid growth in the United Kingdom, parts of Continental Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia and Greater China. Among business lines, mortgage origination and loan servicing, valuations investment management and facilities management logged solid growth, offsetting a continued tepid sales and leasing environment. 
Industrial and data centers remain preferred property types. Our work in both property types grew robustly in the quarter, fueled by booming demand for e-commerce and cloud based services. 
Growth in these resilient property types helped to compensate for continued pressure on other property types, particularly office. Our client base is well diversified across the economy. 
In a quarter when activity with clients in some industries was down from a year ago, we saw particular strength in our work for life sciences and industrial and logistics companies, among others. 
The broad diversification of our business, coupled with decisive actions in 2020 to reset our cost structure, underpinned our earnings growth for the quarter, and we expect to see continued benefits in the quarters and years ahead. 
For full year 2021, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to meaningfully surpass 2019's peak level with potential upside from discretionary capital deployment. 
Notably, our outlook for 2021 and beyond envisions strong growth even with continued pressure on the office market. Clearly, that pressure remains very acute right now, particularly in densely populated gateway cities and will remain challenging for some time to come. 
However, we strongly believe the pressures on office were received from today's extreme levels as vaccine rollouts continue and companies settle into new normal work regimes. We expect our growth to be enhanced by capital deployment that is focused on sectors and business lines that are positioned to benefit significantly from secular growth trends. 
You saw evidence of this with our investment in industrious in the first quarter, which positions us to participate in the rising demand for flexible space solutions. And you can expect to see more evidence of that in future partnerships sponsorships and M&A activity. 
Now Leah will tell you more about the quarter, our outlook and our capital deployment strategy. Leah?"

Segment operating profit for advisory services was nearly flat despite a 5% net revenue decline. The revenue shortfall reflects continued pressure in high-margin sales and leasing businesses, which we offset with disciplined cost management, strong GSD servicing activity and elevated OMSR gains as well as growth in the other advisory lines of business. 
Overall, our advisory segment operating profit margin expanded about 100 basis points compared with a year ago. Excluding the OMSR gains in both years, the margin improved 20 basis points to about 17.2%. The as expected, global leasing revenue remained under pressure, declining 17% due primarily to weak office leasing in the Americas. 
We did see modest sequential improvement in Americas office leasing, as revenue fell 47% versus the 58% decline we experienced in the fourth quarter. Activity was stronger in other geographies and property types. For example, APAC leasing rose a healthy 11% as retail and industrial jumped 25% and 38%, respectively, while office was flat with a year ago. 
EMEA leasing grew 4%, reflecting surging industrial demand, which outweighed moderate office and retail declines. Notably, China and Australia, where the pandemic remains well in check have seen office occupancy return to pre-COVID levels, which has coincided with improving leasing trends in these markets. 
Advisory sales continued to improve sequentially. Declining just 9% versus the 16% decline in the fourth quarter. This improvement was paced by APAC, where sales dipped just 2%, reflecting particularly robust retail and industrial activity. 
Americas and EMEA sales fell around 10% and 13%, respectively, due primarily to sharply lower office sales. Excluding the sales and leasing business lines, net revenue rose 7% and comprised nearly half of the advisory segment's total net revenue. Commercial mortgage origination revenue rose nearly 14% in the quarter, reflecting strong GSE lending, including for affordable housing. 
This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and a pickup in construction activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan originations, our loan servicing portfolio increased 19% to nearly $285 billion, while servicing revenue rose over 21%. Valuation revenue was up 8%. 
Activity was particularly strong in the Pacific region, where valuation revenue increased over 35%. And finally, property management net revenue grew over 2%. And primarily driven by expanded and new client relationships in APAC. 
This offset a modest decline in the U.S. as we exited a low-margin contract and transferred a few accounts to our local facilities management business in GWS. 
Moving to Slide 9. Global Workplace Solutions revenue and net revenue edged up 4% and 1%, respectively. 
On a net revenue basis, facilities management rose 4%. And while project management decreased 7%. The decline in project management was driven by the legacy advisory project management business. Project work for these clients tends to be tied to space fit out, resulting from new leases. And thus should improve as leasing markets recover. 
Revenue associated with GWS contractual clients was up moderately in the quarter. Modest top line growth, coupled with continued discipline in cost management and the benefit of transformation initiatives undertaken in 2020 led to segment operating profit growth of 42%. 
As we mentioned last year, Q1 did include an $11 million drag from the reduced scope of a client account. Adjusting for this unique item, segment operating profit was still up 29%. Importantly, we have seen a meaningful ramp in our facilities management new business pipeline, and it now exceeds the year-end 2019 level. 
The acceleration since year-end has been broad-based and diversified across geographies industry sectors, notably life sciences, manufacturing and logistics, professional services and technology clients and among property types, including data centers, retail, office and manufacturing facilities. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment generated $61 million of segment operating profit, an $18 million increase from Q1 2020. Investment management revenue grew 9% to $132 million. This revenue growth was fueled by a 16% increase in asset management fees generated by our strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record level of over $124 billion as well as stronger incentives and development fees as well as co-investment gains. 
In addition, we recorded a $24 million benefit from an accounting change related to the valuation of unlisted assets which should help reduce earnings volatility going forward. 
This partially offset lower carried interest, which declined $14 million to about $5 million in the quarter. Operating profit for this business line rose to $69 million, an increase of over 200%. Development operating profit fell to $9 million. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of certain asset sales, which were particularly strong in the prior year first quarter. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, development operating profit has grown about 36%. Our in process development portfolio reached a new record at $15 billion, importantly, 3 asset types that remain in strong demand, multifamily, industrial and health care, plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased, comprise more than 80% of this portfolio. 
Our development pipeline also grew 11% from year-end to $6.8 billion. Lastly, Hana's higher operating loss primarily reflects certain deal costs and software write-downs associated with the industrious transaction. 
We remain on course to close on the increase in our industrial stake from 35% to 40% during the second quarter. Turning to Slide 11. Let's now take a look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. 
Transaction activity is improving more quickly than we initially anticipated. This is especially true for global property sales and leasing outside the Americas. 
As a result, we have raised our outlook for 2021 transaction revenue growth. To the low double-digit range. Earlier, we had expected growth in the mid- to high single digits. We expect the rebound in transaction revenue to be most pronounced in the second quarter, since we will be comparing against the most depressed levels of the pandemic. 
Across the rest of our advisory businesses, we continue to expect high single-digit growth. We expect improved profitability as well given the revival of transaction revenue. 
For 2021, we anticipate our advisory segment operating profit margin on net revenue will slightly surpass the 19.7% and pre pandemic peak achieved in 2019. 
Moving to GWS. We are raising our expectations for segment operating profit, while maintaining our revenue forecast in the high single-digit range. We are benefiting from exceptional cost discipline, which we believe will allow us to reverse certain temporary expense cuts more slowly than originally anticipated. 
As a result, we now expect GWS segment operating profit to grow in the mid- to high teens range this year. Looking at REI, we expect this segment to build on its record profitability contribution in 2020 and with both investment management and development poised for sharply improved performance. In Investment management, we expect revenue to slightly surpass 2020's $475 million with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. 
We expect this business line's profitability, which totaled $140 million in 2020 to rise from that level at a mid- to high teens pace. We project U.S. development profit to rise by more than 30% compared with last year's $150 million level. Our improved outlook reflects a strong pace of monetization and higher property valuations than we originally projected. 
Our in process portfolio continues to grow with an emphasis on warehouse and distribution space. For our U.K. multifamily development business, we expect the pace of construction to pick up as Covid restrictions lift and reiterate our earlier expectation for this business. 
Profitability is expected to be about $15 million higher than the $3 million generated in 2020. Due to our improved revenue outlook and the benefit of transformation initiatives completed last year we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue to modestly exceed the 14% level achieved in 2019. This includes an expected uptick in corporate expenses, primarily related to higher performance-based stock compensation and certain OpEx investments for growth initiatives. 
All in, as Bob indicated, we now expect our 2021 adjusted EPS to meaningfully surpass our pre pandemic peak of $3.71 achieved in 2019, with potential upside from capital allocation activities. The anticipated growth for this year is likely to be significantly above the trend line. 
We provided in our long-term aspirational outlook last quarter. Flipping to Slide 12. We retain significant financial capacity to accelerate long-term growth while also returning cash to our shareholders. 
We believe that we have significantly reduced the volatility of our financial results and enhanced free cash flow potential. The record free cash flow we generated in 2020, combined with the prudent way we managed our balance sheet ahead of the crisis, positions us to deploy capital as economic conditions improve. Our efforts have already begun. So far this year, we've invested about $200 million on capital expenditures, M&A and partnership investments while buying back approximately $88 million of shares, including $64 million in the first quarter. 
We have a strong M&A pipeline and expect to continue programmatic share repurchases. However, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, it is highly unlikely we will approach the high end of our target leverage range within our current long-term planning period, absent a transformational investment. 
In closing, we are optimistic about our outlook for 2021 and beyond. We have a strong industry leadership position and management team. Well diversified business, loyal client base and the capital structure to fund future growth and optimize shareholder returns. 
And with that, operator, we'll take questions."

We I would say, in terms of how we're presenting the information, there's not a real material shift in terms of where the benefits of the cost management actions are flowing through the business. 
The advisory segment continues to be the area where we've made the lion's share of the overall cost reductions, about 60% of our cost actions are benefiting advisory. Next, to that is GWS, where we've got about 30%, and then the rest is between RDI and our corporate segment. In terms of the first quarter, though, on a net basis, so I'll talk a little bit about -- we have run rate cost savings, and we do have some temporary costs coming back, like compensation, it's performance-based and accrued based on that. 
We had about $24 million of benefit in advisory on a net basis and about $14 million of benefit in GWS with the rest, basically about $1 million or so across REI and corporate. 
So again, the vast majority of the overall benefit in Q1 was in advisory and our reporting segment modifications haven't really altered the mix of where that's going to impact the business going forward."

And then just maybe moving more towards the business side of things. As you look at sort of the strength in life sciences, data centers, industrial, that stuff, can the growth in those areas longer-term offset any diminution in office? We do expect that the diversification, not just across asset types, but across our geographies will also be important so as we think about the just surging demand for warehouse, industrial distribution, life sciences as well as digital infrastructure.
Those are certainly helping to mitigate the acute declines that we're seeing across office. So I do think that, that is a key part of the overall story for CBRE. The fact that we have positioned ourselves to be aligned with those very important areas of demand in the market today. And then also, given the fact that APAC was early on in terms of the impact related to COVID, we are seeing the regions of the world that have kind of come through this and manage through COVID quite well or effectively or we're early on in the onset of COVID. Those are really back in terms of strong performance, and we're starting to see the recovery take shape in places the U.K. commentary Europe in the U.S.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leo sterns, our CFO, will discuss our quarterly results and updated 2021 qualitative outlook. After their comments, we'll open up the call for questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases, M&A and investment activity, financial performance, including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and the effects of both cost savings initiatives and the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. 
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. 
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. 
Before we discuss the quarter, I'll briefly outline a few changes to our financial reporting, which are summarized in our earnings release as well. First, we now report all project management revenue in our GWS segment. 
Previously, a portion of our project management revenue was reported in the advisory segment. Next, all sales and leasing revenue is now reported in the advisory segment. We will no longer report sales and leasing revenue from GWS clients in the GWS segment. Including all sales and leasing revenue in the advisory segment [indiscernible] a more complete picture of transactional trends in our business. 
We have also established a fourth business segment where we will report corporate overhead expense and other financial impacts that are not specific to 1 of our 3 existing operational segments. This will provide greater transparency into our cost structure. Due to this change, we will be utilizing segment operating profit to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments, which excludes the impact of corporate overhead. 
Additionally, we will replace our fee revenue metric with net revenue to account for the impact of pass-through reimbursement revenue. Net revenue will only exclude reimbursement revenue that does not generate a margin for CBRE. We believe this will provide a clear view of our profitability profile, particularly in our GWS business. 
For this quarter, we have provided a bridge for our legacy and revised financial metrics and our quarterly supplemental posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. Going forward, we will only be reporting these updated financial metrics. 
Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our first quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew about 1% to a new first quarter record of over $5.9 billion while net revenue fell 2%, reflecting continued constrained transaction activity in advisory services. The quarter saw a tangible benefit from both last year's transformation initiatives, which has improved our cost structure and operational agility and higher OMSR gains. In total, our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 200 basis points rising to 14.6%, in line with our first quarter 2019 margin. 
Overall, adjusted EPS grew 15% to $0.86, while GAAP EPS grew 55% to $0.78. And importantly, GAAP EPS in the prior year first quarter included a $0.17 headwind from an asset impairment, which was in part related to the onset of the pandemic. The impairment was not included in adjusted EPS last year. 
Additionally, this quarter includes an $0.11 benefit from venture fund investment gains and an accounting methodology change within our investment management business. Excluding unusual items in both periods, EPS is roughly flat with first quarter 2020 on an adjusted and GAAP basis. 
Now for deeper insights, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to Bob."

CBRE is off to a strong start in 2021. Our performance is being propelled by our long-standing efforts to diversify our business across 4 key dimensions: property types, lines of business, geographic markets and client types. Last quarter, we described in detail how this diversification has enhanced the resiliency of our business. This played out in several ways during the first quarter. 
Geographically, while activity in some markets, notably the Americas remained muted, we saw solid growth in the United Kingdom, parts of Continental Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia and Greater China. Among business lines, mortgage origination and loan servicing, valuations, investment management and facilities management logged solid growth, offsetting a continued tepid sales and leasing environment. 
Industrial and data centers remain preferred property types. Our work in both property types grew robustly in the quarter, fueled by booming demand for e-commerce and cloud based services. 
Growth in these resilient property types helped to compensate for continued pressure on other property types, particularly office. Our client base is well diversified across the economy. 
In a quarter when activity with clients in some industries was down from a year ago, we saw particular strength in our work for life sciences and industrial and logistics companies, among others. 
The broad diversification of our business, coupled with decisive actions in 2020 to reset our cost structure, underpinned our earnings growth for the quarter, and we expect to see continued benefits in the quarters and years ahead. 
For full year 2021, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to meaningfully surpass 2019's peak level with potential upside from discretionary capital deployment. 
Notably, our outlook for 2021 and beyond envisions strong growth even with continued pressure on the office market. Clearly, that pressure remains very acute right now, particularly in densely populated gateway cities and will remain challenging for some time to come. 
However, we strongly believe the pressures on office were received from today's extreme levels as vaccine rollouts continue and companies settle into new normal work regimes. We expect our growth to be enhanced by capital deployment that is focused on sectors and business lines that are positioned to benefit significantly from secular growth trends. 
You saw evidence of this with our investment in Industrious in the first quarter, which positions us to participate in the rising demand for flexible space solutions. And you can expect to see more evidence of that in future partnerships, sponsorships and M&A activity. 
Now Leah will tell you more about the quarter, our outlook and our capital deployment strategy. Leah?"

Segment operating profit for Advisory Services was nearly flat despite a 5% net revenue decline. The revenue shortfall reflects continued pressure in high-margin sales and leasing businesses, which we offset with disciplined cost management, strong GSE servicing activity and elevated OMSR gains as well as growth in the other advisory lines of business. 
Overall, our advisory segment operating profit margin expanded about 100 basis points compared with a year ago. Excluding the OMSR gains in both years, the margin improved 20 basis points to about 17.2%. The as expected, global leasing revenue remained under pressure declining 17%, due primarily to weak office leasing in the Americas. 
We did see modest sequential improvement in Americas office leasing, as revenue fell 47% versus the 58% decline we experienced in the fourth quarter. Activity was stronger in other geographies and property types. For example, APAC leasing rose a healthy 11% as retail and industrial jumped 25% and 38%, respectively, while office was flat with a year ago. 
EMEA leasing grew 4%, reflecting surging industrial demand, which outweighed moderate office and retail declines. Notably, China and Australia, where the pandemic remains well in check have seen office occupancy return to pre-COVID levels, which has coincided with improving leasing trends in these markets. 
Advisory sales continued to improve sequentially declining just 9% versus the 16% decline in the fourth quarter. This improvement was paced by APAC, where sales dipped just 2%, reflecting particularly robust retail and industrial activity. 
Americas and EMEA sales fell around 10% and 13%, respectively, due primarily to sharply lower office sales. Excluding the sales and leasing business lines, net revenue rose 7% and comprised nearly half of the advisory segment's total net revenue. Commercial mortgage origination revenue rose nearly 14% in the quarter, reflecting strong GSE lending, including for affordable housing. 
This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and a pickup in construction activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan originations, our loan servicing portfolio increased 19% to nearly $285 billion, while servicing revenue rose over 21%. 
Valuation revenue was up 8%. Activity was particularly strong in the Pacific region, where valuation revenue increased over 35%. And finally, property management net revenue grew over 2%, primarily driven by expanded and new client relationships in APAC. This offset a modest decline in the U.S. as we exited a low-margin contract and transferred a few accounts to our local facilities management business in GWS. 
Moving to Slide 9. Global Workplace Solutions revenue and net revenue edged up 4% and 1%, respectively. On a net revenue basis, facilities management rose 4%, while project management decreased 7%. The decline in project management was driven by the legacy advisory project management business. Project work for these clients tends to be tied to space fit out, resulting from new leases. And thus should improve as leasing markets recover. 
Revenue associated with GWS contractual clients was up moderately in the quarter. Modest top line growth, coupled with continued discipline in cost management and the benefit of transformation initiatives undertaken in 2020 led to segment operating profit growth of 42%. 
As we mentioned last year, Q1 did include an $11 million drag from the reduced scope of a client accounts. Adjusting for this unique item, segment operating profit was still up 29%. Importantly, we have seen a meaningful ramp in our facilities management new business pipeline, and it now exceeds the year-end 2019 level. 
The acceleration since year-end has been broad-based and diversified across geographies, industry sectors, notably life sciences, manufacturing and logistics, professional services and technology clients and among property types, including data centers, retail, office and manufacturing facilities. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment generated $61 million of segment operating profit, an $18 million increase from Q1 2020. Investment Management revenue grew 9% to $132 million. This revenue growth was fueled by a 16% increase in asset management fees generated by our strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record level of over $124 billion as well as stronger incentives and development fees as well as co-investment gains. 
In addition, we recorded a $24 million benefit from an accounting change related to the valuation of unlisted assets, which should help reduce earnings volatility going forward. 
This partially offset lower carried interest, which declined $14 million to about $5 million in the quarter. Operating profit for this business line rose to $69 million, an increase of over 200%. Development operating profit fell to $9 million. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of certain asset sales, which were particularly strong in the prior year first quarter. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, development operating profit has grown about 36%. Our in-process development portfolio reached a new record at $15 billion, importantly, 3 asset types that remain in strong demand, multifamily, industrial and health care, plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased, comprise more than 80% of this portfolio. 
Our development pipeline also grew 11% from year-end to $6.8 billion. Lastly, Hana's higher operating loss primarily reflects certain deal costs and software write-downs associated with the Industrious transaction. We remain on course to close on the increase in our Industrial stake from 35% to 40% during the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11. Let's now take a look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. Transaction activity is improving more quickly than we initially anticipated. This is especially true for global property sales and leasing outside the Americas. 
As a result, we have raised our outlook for 2021 transaction revenue growth to the low double-digit range. Earlier, we had expected growth in the mid- to high single digits. We expect the rebound in transaction revenue to be most pronounced in the second quarter, since we will be comparing against the most depressed levels of the pandemic. 
Across the rest of our advisory businesses, we continue to expect high single-digit growth. We expect improved profitability as well given the revival of transaction revenue. 
For 2021, we anticipate our advisory segment operating profit margin on net revenue will slightly surpass the 19.7%, pre pandemic peak achieved in 2019. 
Moving to GWS. We are raising our expectations for segment operating profit, while maintaining our revenue forecast in the high single-digit range. We are benefiting from exceptional cost discipline, which we believe will allow us to reverse certain temporary expense cuts more slowly than originally anticipated. 
As a result, we now expect GWS segment operating profit to grow in the mid- to high teens range this year. Looking at REI, we expect this segment to build on its record profitability contribution in 2020 with both investment management and development poised for sharply improved performance. In Investment management, we expect revenue to slightly surpass 2020's $475 million with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. 
We expect this business line's profitability, which totaled $140 million in 2020, to rise from that level at a mid- to high teens pace. We project U.S. development profit to rise by more than 30% compared with last year's $150 million level. Our improved outlook reflects a strong pace of monetization and higher property valuations than we originally projected. 
Our in process portfolio continues to grow with an emphasis on warehouse and distribution space. For our U.K. multifamily development business, we expect the pace of construction to pick up as COVID restrictions lift and reiterate our earlier expectation for this business. 
Profitability is expected to be about $15 million higher than the $3 million generated in 2020. Due to our improved revenue outlook and the benefit of transformation initiatives completed last year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue to modestly exceed the 14% level achieved in 2019. This includes an expected uptick in corporate expenses, primarily related to higher performance-based stock compensation and certain OpEx investments for growth initiatives. 
All in, as Bob indicated, we now expect our 2021 adjusted EPS to meaningfully surpass our pre pandemic peak of $3.71 achieved in 2019, with potential upside from capital allocation activities. The anticipated growth for this year is likely to be significantly above the trend line we provided in our long-term aspirational outlook last quarter. 
Flipping to Slide 12. We retain significant financial capacity to accelerate long-term growth while also returning cash to our shareholders. 
We believe that we have significantly reduced the volatility of our financial results and enhanced free cash flow potential. The record free cash flow we generated in 2020, combined with the prudent way we managed our balance sheet ahead of the crisis, positions us to deploy capital as economic conditions improve. Our efforts have already begun. So far this year, we've invested about $200 million on capital expenditures, M&A and partnership investments while buying back approximately $88 million of shares, including $64 million in the first quarter. 
We have a strong M&A pipeline and expect to continue programmatic share repurchases. However, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, it is highly unlikely we will approach the high end of our target leverage range within our current long-term planning period, absent a transformational investment. 
In closing, we are optimistic about our outlook for 2021 and beyond. We have a strong industry leadership position and management team, well diversified business, loyal client base and the capital structure to fund future growth and optimize shareholder returns. 
And with that, operator, we'll take questions."

Next, to that is GWS, where we've got about 30%, and then the rest is between REI and our corporate segment. In terms of the first quarter, though, on a net basis, so I'll talk a little bit about -- we have run rate cost savings, and we do have some temporary costs coming back, like compensation, it's performance-based and accrued based on that.

By the way, if you're paying close attention to the press in what individual companies are saying, most of the outlier comments coming in now have the flavor of, well, we -- our people are really getting wary and our people really need to get back together, we really need to focus on culture, and we really need to focus bringing new people on. 
So while our view hasn't changed, our conviction around the notion that it will -- that people will get back to the office in a dramatically different way than they are today has probably grown. There will certainly be a hybrid scenario where there'll be some work from home, some work from flex space and then, of course, some work from offices. We think the configuration of offices will change, and that will create some real opportunity for us to do work for our clients. But largely, our view is what it was 60 days ago when we reported our year end earnings, Rick."

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with the presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.  
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our fourth quarter results and expectations for the future. After their comments, we'll open up the call for questions.  
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2021 outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment, financial performance, including profitability and margins and the effects of both cost savings initiatives in COVID-19 and the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only, and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS; adjusted EBITDA; fee revenue; certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.  
Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our fourth quarter 2020 and full year financial results. 
During the fourth quarter, total revenue and fee revenue fell about 3% and 7%, respectively, driven by constrained transaction activity in Advisory Services. Lower revenue was more than offset by prudent cost management and the continued benefit of transformation initiatives that improved both our cost structure and operational agility. 
Overall, adjusted EPS grew nearly 10% to $1.45. GAAP EPS of $0.93 includes around $0.28 of transformation initiative costs. Importantly, GAAP EPS in the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.67 tax benefit, primarily from legal entity restructuring. Excluding these unusual items in both periods, GAAP EPS would have been up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Now for insights on results and our longer-term strategy, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to Bob."

As you've seen, we ended 2020 on a high note, with adjusted EPS for the quarter reaching an all-time high and adjusted EBITDA growing 9%. This capped a year of significant challenges stemming from COVID, but also one that brought to the forefront CBRE's competitive advantages, our ability to capture often overlooked industry opportunities and the resiliency we've built into the business over the past decade. This resilience has allowed us to offset the steep decline in sales and lease transactions and the pandemic's unique effects on the office market.  
Today, CBRE is more diversified than ever before across 4 key dimensions: property types, lines of business, geographic markets and clients. A few examples will bring definition to this. While office remains an important property type for us, its negative effects have been tempered by our large and growing presence in industrial, data centers and multifamily. Leasing is a key line of business for us that has been under pressure. However, other lines of business, such as GSE financing, investment management and facilities management have all continued to grow. Geographically, New York, London and San Francisco are key markets for us. But our presence in Asia is robust and growing, and our significant activity in Europe and second-tier U.S. markets has held up relatively well. We serve many clients that have been negatively impacted by COVID, but do a huge amount of business with technology, life science and other clients that have thrived over the past year.  
Reflecting how large companies increasingly rely on CBRE, nearly 90% of our 100 largest clients purchased 4 or more services in 2020, up from less than 1/4 a decade ago. Our broad diversification across these 4 key dimensions has served us well compared with prior downturns. Adjusted EPS fell 12% in 2020. We expect earnings to rise to near peak profitability this year, the second year of the downturn, and continue up from there. By comparison, during the great financial crisis, we suffered a more than 80% peak-to-trough decline, and adjusted earnings per share did not return to the prior peak for 8 years.  
We're exiting the worst of the COVID crisis in great shape. Our strengths include a leaner operating structure, significant financial capacity and a strategy squarely aimed at the many opportunities unfolding in our industry, including those with secular tailwinds.  
We've built our long-term plan on the assumption that office demand remains under pressure due to a lasting increase in remote working and occupiers' needs for greater flexibility in space obligations. This is reflected in our base case forecast, which, nevertheless, expects us to achieve a minimum of low double-digit average annual adjusted EPS growth through at least 2025, absent a recession. This forecast is driven by organic growth and deploying capital, notably in M&A and real estate investments, with meaningful upside potential from additional capital deployment. We expect to achieve this strong growth while continuing to evolve our business as we reduce contributions from lower secular growth business lines and increase our focus on areas that have higher secular growth profiles.  
One growth area we are particularly high on is flexible office space. We identified this sector as an opportunity 3 years ago and have been building our Hana business expressly to meet rapidly rising demand from occupiers and investors. Our investment in Industrious now aligns this with an exceptional operator and outstanding leadership team that is executing a great strategy. With more than 100 units in 50 markets, Industrious enables us to participate in the flex space opportunity at scale and contribute meaningfully to Industrious' expansion.  
Now Leah will discuss the quarter and our outlook for 2021."

Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA declined about 13% and nearly 8%, respectively.

Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA declined about 13% and nearly 8%, respectively. These declines are mostly attributable to continued weakness in high-margin sales and leasing businesses. This is partially offset by disciplined cost management and strong performance by the rest of our advisory businesses, which, in combination, grew revenue nearly 11%. Overall, our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 120 basis points compared to a year ago. This margin benefited from cost optimization efforts and 210 basis points from substantially higher OMSR gains than in last year's fourth quarter.  
Global leasing revenue declined about 28% as occupiers around the world continued to defer leasing decisions due to the pandemic. For the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which together comprise about 78% of global leasing, revenue decreased 36%, 18% and 6%, respectively. The U.K. again benefited from particularly strong industrial activity in the quarter, which helped offset subdued demand for office space. The continued growth of e-commerce drove industrial leasing revenue increases of 20% globally and 24% in the Americas. We're also seeing greater resilience among U.S. leasing transactions generating less than $1 million of revenue, which were down just 25% versus a decline of over 60% for those over $1 million. Advisory sales improved notably from Q3, but remained 15% below Q4 2019 levels.  
The Americas and APAC regions saw sequential improvement, paced by the U.S., where advisory sales revenue fell just 5% in Q4 compared with nearly 39% in Q3. Strength in the Americas reflected both U.S. market share gains of 90 basis points to nearly 19% and relatively strong industrial and multifamily transactional activity.  
Looking more closely at our activity with office assets underscores the benefits of our geographic diversification. In the Americas, office sales and leasing revenue fell over 50% compared to declines of around 30% for each in EMEA and 17% for sales and 20% for leasing in APAC. Commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 49% in the quarter, reflecting a surge in GSE lending, particularly targeted at affordable housing. This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and loan sales activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan originations, our loan servicing portfolio grew 17% to $269 billion, while servicing revenue grew nearly 25%. Valuation revenue grew about 4%, reflecting increased assignments for investor clients, particularly in Continental Europe, North Asia and Pacific.  
Finally, Advisory Property and Project Management together declined about 4%. Property Management fee revenue grew just over 1%, while advisory project management declined 12%, as demand from U.S. public sector and industrial clients partially offset a steep decline in office. Notably, we completed 18% fewer projects than in the last year's fourth quarter, while the margin on these projects improved. We expect Project Management to benefit from pent-up demand as economies reopen and business activity normalizes.  
Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment posted 3% fee revenue growth as a 7% increase in both Facilities and Project Management offset a steep decline in GWS transactional revenue. Despite limited transaction revenue in the fourth quarter, our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded over 350 basis points to nearly 18%, marking our third consecutive quarter of record profitability. GWS margins continued to benefit from lower discretionary spending and structural changes to the cost base.  
While our new business pipeline remains solid, COVID restrictions continue to hamper new GWS client onboarding. We expect GWS growth to gain momentum in the middle part of this year as the economy continues to reopen. Despite these recent operational challenges, we expect our GWS business to continue benefiting from greater diversification across client sectors and property types. For example, our focus on specialized services for life sciences and health care assets resulted in a 240 basis point increase in revenue contribution from these clients in these sectors in 2020. In addition, our data center services business delivered notably strong revenue growth in 2020.  
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment achieved $110 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $68 million increase from the prior year Q4. Investment Management adjusted EBITDA rose over 228% to nearly $53 million. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at nearly $123 billion, driving 15% growth in asset management fees. Importantly, just 20% of total AUM is invested in office, while industrial and logistics comprise our largest investment. Additionally, carried interest surged to $31.5 million versus just $9.7 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of the disposition of a retail property portfolio in South Korea.  
Development adjusted EBITDA rose to over $67 million, reflecting an elevated level of industrial asset sales in the quarter. Our in-process development portfolio continued to grow, driven by strong demand from industrial clients, reaching a new record at $14.9 billion. Importantly, fee development and build-to-suit projects comprise more than half of this in-process portfolio, offering greater visibility and predictability into our future development earnings.  
Lastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of over $10 million was slightly more than that in Q3. Hana's results were impacted by the pandemic and the cost of building out new units. As Bob detailed earlier, we expect demand for flexible solutions to ramp up as the pandemic recedes and occupiers act on their desire for optionality in their real estate portfolios. Our investment and partnership with Industrious positions us to capitalize on this opportunity.  
Turning to Slide 11. We've ended 2020 with record free cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet and considerable financial capacity. During 2020, free cash flow increased 68% to nearly $1.6 billion. This was partially driven by lower working capital required by our GWS business as new client onboarding slowed from a particularly strong pace in 2019. We expect this to modestly reverse as client onboarding accelerates. Nevertheless, we will benefit from improved cash management processes and our cost optimization efforts, which generated savings of around $120 million in 2020. Structural cost changes are expected to deliver over $100 million of incremental savings in 2021, even after accounting for the reversal of certain actions that were temporary in nature. These changes will enable us to pursue OpEx investments to enhance growth while preserving strong profitability.  
We managed our balance sheet prudently heading into the downturn. This, coupled with the strong cash flow generation, enabled us to end 2020 with a net cash position and $4.6 billion of liquidity.  
Turning to Slide 12. While considerable uncertainty remains, we expect our business' resiliency and the world's continued progress in mitigating the pandemic to benefit our 2021 results. While transaction revenue has been weak, we have fared much better than in prior downturns due to the broad diversification of both deal sizes and property types. During 2021, we expect continued growth in industrial and multifamily transactions as well as a modest rebound in retail leasing to offset continued pressure in the office market. Within office, we anticipate quicker leasing improvement outside of the Americas. Overall, we expect transactional revenue growth in the mid to high single digits for the full year 2021. From a sequential standpoint, we expect the sales and leasing revenue decline on a combined basis in Q1 relative to prior year to be similar to the pullback we saw in Q4 of 2020. The transactional revenue should begin to rebound in Q2, particularly since, by then, we will be comparing against the depressed levels of the pandemic's first month.  
Across the rest of Advisory, we expect high single-digit revenue growth, with Property Management and mortgage origination leading the gains. We expect modest margin improvement in advisory this year, reflecting this revenue growth and the full year effects of cost optimization, partially offset by the reversal of some temporary cost savings measures we imposed during the depth of the crisis as well as select investments.  
Moving to GWS. We expect revenue to rise in the high single-digit range this year, with slightly better growth in adjusted EBITDA. The relaxation of COVID restrictions should enable faster client onboarding and catalyze GWS growth across Project Management and Facilities Management. Because of this, we expect sequential improvement in our GWS growth as we move through 2021, with the rate expected to accelerate to low double digits by year-end. We believe this growth rate can be sustainable on a multiyear basis.  
Looking at REI. We expect this segment to build on its record-breaking adjusted EBITDA contribution in 2020, with both investment management and development poised for compelling performance. In Investment Management, we expect revenue to approximate 2020's $475 million level, with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. We expect adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid- to high single-digit range compared with the $125 million contributed in 2020. This reflects some operating leverage as well as some incremental operating expense investments to enhance future growth.  
We project U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid single-digit range from the $142 million generated this year. Our in-process portfolio continues to grow, reflecting increased appetite for warehouse and distribution space. We also envision targeted investments this year to expand our geographic reach, deepen our position in growth sectors and accelerate future growth, including a new initiative to launch an industrial and logistics development capability in Continental Europe. We are seeing tremendous demand from U.S.-based capital partners and occupiers for logistics facilities across Europe and are assembling an experienced team under the highly regarded Trammell Crow Company brand to meet this exploding demand.  
For our U.K. multifamily development business, we expect the pace of construction to pick up as COVID restrictions lift. As a result, we are forecasting this business to produce around $15 million more in adjusted EBITDA than the $3 million contribution it generated in 2020. All in, we expect our 2021 adjusted EPS to approach our pre-pandemic peak achieved in 2019, with some potential upside from our capital allocation activity.  
Turning to Slide 13. Our track record over the last decade, and notably over the last 12 months, has proven the resiliency of CBRE's business and provides the foundation for enduring average annual earnings growth, about a minimum low double digits through at least 2025, with meaningful upside potential from additional capital allocation. We expect to further enhance our organic earnings growth through a combination of investments and capital returns to shareholders. 
Given our diversified business mix, we expect strong organic growth in key parts of our business to more than offset lower demand for office space as hybrid work models result in smaller corporate footprint. We see growth opportunities through increasing broker recruiting, digital and technology investment and principal and co-investment activity in our REI segment. A good example of this is our co-investment through CBRE Global Investors into private infrastructure programs, which is an area we expect will benefit from secular growth tailwinds. Initiatives like the SPAC sponsorship and Industrious investment, which partners us with an industry leader in flexible workspaces, can further jump-start our growth while offering younger, developing companies the benefit of aligning with CBRE's extensive platform capabilities.  
Finally, we intend to dynamically allocate our capital while preserving our investment-grade credit rating to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. To this end, we view our shares as an attractive investment if we are unable to identify enough strategic acquisition opportunities at attractive valuations. We intend to resume our programmatic repurchase program, and we'll seek to repurchase shares as our financial capacity and valuation allows. We will provide progress updates annually as we pursue this multiyear growth framework.  
With that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some closing remarks."

Before we take your questions, I want to briefly touch on CBRE's approach to environmental, social and governance issues. We know from our interactions with you that ESG is extremely important to our shareholders as well as our clients and our people. CBRE is determined to set the pace for our sector on ESG issues, particularly sustainability and diversity. Making measurable progress is one of my personal performance objectives for the year.  
When it comes to diversity, CBRE's commitment begins at the top. Our 12-person Board of Directors includes 3 women and 4 diverse men. Of the 13 executives who report to me, 5 are diverse. These direct reports include Tim Dismond, who is named Chief Diversity Officer last year. We have just expanded Tim's role to Chief Responsibility Officer and are bringing together all aspects of ESG, environmental sustainability, workplace safety and well-being, philanthropy and public affairs as well as diversity and inclusion under his leadership.  
One notable commitment is the use of our massive supply chain to advance diversity by spending $3 billion annually with minority- and women-owned businesses by 2025. Accelerating our progress with recruiting and developing diverse team members remains a core focus. We're making steady progress as reflected in our earning a place on both the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index in late January.  
We've also been recognized for our leadership in sustainability. For example, CBRE is the only commercial real estate services provider to land on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We are determined to make further gains. Late last year, we committed to science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets with the goal of cutting our emissions by more than 2/3 by 2035. We also pledged to make similarly ambitious reductions in the properties and facilities we manage for clients. As the world's largest manager of commercial properties, CBRE can play an outsized role in helping to limit the rise in global temperatures, improve the efficiency and sustainability of building operations while benefiting our shareholders given the heightened demand for sustainability services. This is not only good for the planet, it is simply good business practice.  
With that, operator, please open the lines for questions."

So to repeat those 4 dimensions, it's product type, for instance, industrial versus office, et cetera; it's line of business, for instance, leasing versus Project Management versus Facilities Management; it's geographic spread; and of course, it's client type. 
We have done a ton of strategic work over the last year in response to COVID. And the crisis has caused us to really get focused on what parts of our business are going to be accelerated given the current circumstance and the likely circumstance over the next few years and what parts are going to be under pressure. We've got a management team that's very well equipped to adjust focus, and we got a balance sheet with lots of capacity to help us drive that adjustment to our focus. And yes, we believe that we'll be moving in the direction of elements of our business across those 4 dimensions that have secular advantage or at least neutral as it relates to being resilient. And Leah can talk to you more about that. But we've really doubled down in thinking that way as it relates to our balance sheet and using the $4 billion of capacity we have.

But as it relates to their business model, it is so overlapping with what we've been trying to do with Hana. It was the perfect flex space operator for us to invest in. They have an asset-light model. That means that they provide flex space as a service -- as a service to landlord, as a service to tenants. They are not taking long-term leases and then turning around and doing short-term leases with occupiers. 
They are very, very riveted on client service. We were super proud of Hana's client service, and they beat us. They topped us. They were the one operator in the marketplace that had better client service. They have a footprint of 100 units. It will be well over 100 with Hana and growing nicely from there so that there'll be some scale to offer our occupier clients. And if you were to talk to Jamie Hodari, their CEO, he would tell you that one of the things he was excited about our ability to bring to the table is deep and broad relations across the occupiers around the world. 
So we think that strategically, Industrious is the right company for us to invest in and partner with in a sector that we believe is going to have really nice dynamics over the next several years because these occupiers, as they rethink their space utilization, are going to want flexibility all over the place. They're going to want to be able to get in and out of space relatively quickly. They're going to want to be able to take smaller spaces away from their headquarters so their people can not have to come into CBDs in some cases or come into other areas of the CBD where the headquarter isn't. So we think they were the perfect partner for us, and we love where we've ended up there. And I think if you talk to Jamie and their team, they would comment similarly on the situation."

Right now, we think there are some very good opportunities out there. We're being very thoughtful about where we go. 
You know, Tony, we've talked about it so much over the year. There are certain parts of our business, we think, have better growth profiles than others. So we're a little more oriented there when we do M&A. But we think we can find M&A opportunities across all 3 sectors. And I'm going to highlight one that surprised everybody 1.5 years ago when we did the Telford Homes acquisition in the U.K. That was an area where we came in. We realized that there was a real need for institutional quality, multifamily housing in London that wasn't being fulfilled. We had the opportunity to buy that business. We love the long-term profile of that business, and now we're using our presence there to -- and Leah commented on this, to expand into industrial development in the U.K. and Europe and very consistent with the model.

We will look to put a little more money into co-investments in our REI business where we've generated strong returns. But for the most part, when we buy services businesses, they will be asset light. As Leah said in her prepared remarks, when you buy GWS or outsourcing businesses, you need some working capital to fund the growth of those individual client relationships, but we're mostly pretty asset-light.

First was workforce optimization. That was early in the year. It was really meant to address the immediate needs to respond to the changing demand environment as that was presented by COVID. We spent about $38 million on workforce optimization. 
We then turned our sights on transformation initiatives that were specifically targeted at changing the shape and the structure of parts of our business that are effectively positioning us to be more agile going forward. We invested about $176 million into those transformation initiatives. We expect that the total run rate benefit from the $214 million of investment will be around $369 million of cost. That's being offset in '21 by the resumption -- or we had some temporary costs that were cut in 2020 that will come back. But net-net, we think there will be about $100 million of incremental savings in 2021 from the full work that we did in 2020 related to cost management.

Well, we've had a huge amount of -- one of the things that we've just worn out during COVID is interfacing with these occupier clients about what their expectations are about going back to the office. So first of all, I want to start with what we think in general. 
In general, we believe that on kind of a weighted average basis, clients will go back to the office at about 85% of where they were before. In other words, their weighted average headcount will be down maybe 15%. Of course, we're all going to learn a whole lot more about that once COVID's over and there's not that kind of psychological overhang of making those decisions while we're in the midst of COVID. We also know that most of the occupiers are going to want to have some remote capability for their people to come into the office. A lot of them are doing that now, but they're going to want to make that a formal part of their portfolio. 
So historically, when we work with these big clients, they had 2 types of components to their portfolio. They had space they own and space they lease in a traditional long-term way. They started to get into the flex space as a third option toward the end of the last cycle. And now they're saying that's going to be a more pronounced part of their portfolio of space going forward. So we think that means for companies like Industrious, in particular, Industrious, who has a offering that's very high-quality, data security oriented towards corporate users that there's going to be big demand for what they do. 
They're not going to be the only ones. There's other providers that can do good work in that regard, too. But we think that this will be a permanent piece in a bigger way of the portfolio of these occupier clients, and that will serve right into the heart of the Industrious strategy."

We're also serving their data center needs. We're serving their -- for life sciences clients, we're serving their research facility needs.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. 
Separately, we also announced some changes to our leadership team, appointing Emma Gmartino as Global Group President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Vikram Cole as Global Group President, Business Intelligence. 
Before we kick off today's call, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including operations market and share repurchases as the expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and the effects of both cost savings initiatives and the COVID pandemic, the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. 
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release respectively. 
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of this present view of our quarterly financial results. 
Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO, will provide insight on our Q2 performance, the recently announced Turner and [indiscernible] in detail, along with our revised qualitative outlook for 2021, our capital deployment activities and broader investment strategy. 
Then we'll open up the call for questions. 
Total revenue grew about 20% to a new second quarter record of nearly $6.5 billion, while net revenue grew 31% to $3.9 billion, partially driven by a strong rebound in property builds and to a lesser extent, leasing as well as favorable foreign currency effects. 
The quarter also saw tangible benefit from last year's transformation initiatives, which have improved our cost structure and operational agility. Adjusted EBITDA grew 169% to [ $718 million,  ] surpassing Q2 2019 total by 53%. 
Overall, adjusted EPS grew 291% to $1.36, while GAAP EPS [Audio Gap]

[Audio Gap] 
CBRE continues to benefit from the multiyear efforts to diversify our business across 4 dimensions: asset type, business line, client type and geography. 
We've moved decisively to capitalize on this opportunity and are making investments and driving organic growth initiatives that will continue this trend. 
Overall, Q2 2021 adjusted EBITDA grew at a better than 20% compounded rate from Q2 2019 with strong growth across all 3 business segments. 
Each segment experienced significant margin expansion over this 2-year period due to our disciplined expense management, along with the benefits of diversification. 
Thoughtful investments, shaped by a well-developed strategy, will play a central role as we continue to grow and diversify our business across asset type, business line, client type and geography. 
Our balance sheet was very strong going into COVID and has strengthened further as we emerge from the pandemic. We are putting some of this balance sheet capacity to work with a particular focus on investing in secularly favored companies that enhance our ability to provide clients with customized solutions and will benefit from a relationship with CBRE. 
You saw this earlier this year when we acquired a 40% ownership interest in industrious in the flex space arena. And again, this month with our SPAC sponsorship of Altus Power in the commercial and industrial solar energy sector. 
On Tuesday, we announced a [ $1.3 billion  ] purchase of a 60% stake in Turner & Townsend, a global leader in project program and cost management. This is a great brand and great management team operating in sectors with favorable long-term growth profiles. 
Turner & Townsend will advance diversification across the 4 dimensions of our business that we've been discussing. 
For example, across asset types, Turner & Townsend brings us capabilities in infrastructure and green energy where they can help support our efforts to meet our clients' carbon reduction goals. They are the global leader in cost consultancy, a line of business where we have a small practice now. 
Geographically, they move our project management business into new markets in Asia and the Middle East, while we can help them grow in the Americas and elsewhere, and they add an array of new clients around the world, most notably in the government sector. 
We look forward to hitting the ground running with Turner & Townsend when the transaction closes later this year. 
Before concluding, I'll briefly comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. 
Over the past several years, we've evolved our senior leadership team dramatically, identifying our most compelling executives and putting them in roles where they can have the greatest impact on our business. 
The elevation of [indiscernible] Martino and Vikram Kohli, the Global Group President roles represents another step in this direction. 
Consolidating our capital investment and finance functions under Emma reflects the growing importance of capital allocation to the long-term growth aspirations that we outlined at the end of last year. She has proven to be an accomplished investor of our capital, who has an exceptional ability to work effectively with our leaders around the world to execute our capital and strategy. 
Vikram has rapidly emerged as a leader with a unique ability to harness data and insight from across our business as well as from external sources. And like Emma he has excelled at working across our global platform. Adding our strategy and digital and technology functions to his mandate will create a business intelligence capability that will better enable us to make powerful fact-based decisions as we guide the company's growth. 
Vikram is the first Seabury executive from outside the U.S. to ascend to this level in the company. We expect to elevate other executives from outside the U.S. into senior global leadership roles as we continue to put our best talent into key positions. 
Leah Stearns will remain with us through year-end to ensure a smooth transition of financial leadership responsibilities. 
I want to thank Leah for her vision in initiating the transformation of our finance organization. managing finance through the worst of the COVID-19 crisis and together with Kristen taking our Investor Relations program to a new level, including articulating the financial framework for our long-term growth aspirations. We wish Leah continued success. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Emma."

It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today, and I look forward to regularly engaging with you in my new capacity as CFO. With that, please turn to Slide 8. Advisory Services net revenue and segment operating profit set new second quart",1271,"Thanks, Bob. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today, and I look forward to regularly engaging with you in my new capacity as CFO. With that, please turn to Slide 8. Advisory Services net revenue and segment operating profit set new second quarter records rising 47% and 130% versus Q2 2020. Notably, they surpassed our previous Q2 2019 peaks by 3% and 18%, respectively. While leasing revenue climbed 33% compared to the prior year, it was about 18% below Q2 2019 levels, mostly due to subdued Americas office leasing 
[indiscernible] Americas, 61% in while EMEA and APAC were about 21% and 14% above. We are encouraged to see recent improvements in Americas leasing with July thus far up significantly compared to both 2020 and 2019. As expected, property sales improved markedly with revenue growing 152% from the prior year period. Americas, EMEA and APAC property sales revenue serves 158%, 132% and 151%, respectively. All regions eclipsed our Q2 2019 level with total property sales revenue about 27% above Q2 2019. 
The macroeconomic backdrop is supported of real estate investment and global capital migration continues to steadily improve. Rising property sales also helped to catalyze strong growth in commercial mortgage originations, which climbed to 61%. We saw particularly strong demand for acquisition and construction financing and recapitalization. 
Our loan servicing portfolio grew 20% versus prior year and 3% sequentially to over $294 billion, partially driven by strong retention of loans brokered and originated. This led to loan servicing revenue growth of over 15% compared to Q2 2020. Valuation revenue accelerated over 37% as transaction-related work picked up. Activity is particularly strong in the U.S. so valuation revenue increased nearly 47%. 
Finally, Property Management net revenue increased over 6%. EMEA and APAC grew strongly, while Americas lagged due to previous decision to exit some low-margin contracts. Moving to Slide 9. Global Workplace Solutions continued its long record of resilient growth with net revenue rising 11%. This reflected strong growth in project management, up 15% and Facilities Management up 10%, driven by elevated local facilities management and data center assignments as well as the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation. 
Segment operating profit rose over 33%, reflecting solid top line growth, disciplined cost management, the benefit of a mix shift to higher-margin work and the impact of last year's transformation initiative, which more than offset increased medical expense. 
Even accounting for about $17 million of transitory COVID-related expenses in last year's Q2, segment operating profit growth was up 18%. 
Importantly, our new business pipeline continues to be strong and well diversified with a high concentration of life sciences, logistics and technology companies, along with new data center activity. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment generated over [ $153  ] million of segment operating profit, surpassing its previous quarterly high by $38 million. Impressive development operating profit of nearly $120 million was fueled by large office property sales that commanded strong valuations due to the high quality of the assets and work for blue chip Occupier clients. Investment Management revenue grew 35% to $139 million fueled by a 29% increase in asset management fees, higher acquisition and disposition fees, carried interest and favorable FX translation. 
Assets under management rose 18% versus the prior year to a new record of more than $129 billion. Stepping up the growth of this business has been a strategic focus, and we're pleased with our progress. The strong top line growth, coupled with careful expense management, drove operating profit growth of 38%. 
Lastly, Hana's operating loss narrowed sequentially to $9 million. We expect a further narrowing of this loss going forward as all Hana sites are now operated by Industrious, and all units except for 4 legacy units are now owned by Industrious. 
The future financial impact of our industrial estate, which will be mark-to-market as the value changes will be reflected in Advisory. 
On Slide 11, we'll look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. We now expect full year advisory sales and leasing revenue on a combined basis will likely approach 2019 levels with sales likely to moderately exceed prior peak and leasing likely to be roughly 15% or so shy of peak. We anticipate year-over-year sales and leasing revenue growth rates will likely moderate as we move further into the second half of the year when year-over-year comparisons will be tougher than in Q2 when activity last year was at a virtual standstill. 
As noted previously, [ Q3  ] leasing is off to a strong start, and we continue to monitor the potential delta variant impact on transaction volume. We've learned over the past 15 months that office leasing is highly correlated with companies returning to the office [indiscernible] single-digit growth we anticipated previously. We also expect our more robust advisory revenue projections will flow through into incremental margin expansion relative to our previous expectations. 
Moving to GWS. We are modestly raising our expectations for segment operating profit while maintaining our revenue forecast in the high single-digit range. Net revenue is expected to slightly exceed this range. We're benefiting from a shift in service net to grow at around the high teens rate this year, a slight improvement from our previous expectations.  This segment nearly doubled 2020's record higher profitability. 
In Investment Management, we expect revenue to surpass $500 million and profit to rise at least at a high teens rate from the $140 million achieved in 2020. We project development operating profit to more double versus 2020 and to roughly triple its 2019 contribution of $122 million. We are developing products in strong markets and sectors with supportive fundamentals and have a solid pipeline for asset monetization. 
This is expected to translate into Q3 operating profits that are likely to be at least as high as Q2. Given the robust pipeline and in-process activity, we are optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business and expect it to have a meaningful contributors to our long-term growth. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue should significantly exceed the level achieved in 2019, even though we expect a modest uptick in corporate expenses as compared to that year. The return of high-margin sales revenue, the effects of last year's transformation initiatives and strong development gains are drivers of the improved outlook. 
Overall, we now project our 2021 adjusted EPS to surpass our 2019 pre-pandemic peak of $3.71 by a wider margin than we expected at the end of the first quarter. 
As usual, we will realize more than half of our earnings in the second half. But given our year-to-date performance, those earnings will be slightly more weighted to the first half than they have been in most years. 
Flipping Slide 12. Over the last year, we've allocated about $2 billion in total, including about $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, investments in sponsorships and partnerships and M&A inclusive of our pending Turner & Townsend transaction while returning cash to shareholders by buying back approximately $88 million of shares. 
Still, net leverage remains modest at just 0.2x pro forma for the expected closing payment of the Turner & Townsend transaction. We have significant capacity to invest in growth and diversification using our four-pronged investment approach consisting of sponsorships, partnerships, acquisitions and building our own resources and capabilities. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strategic moves we've made over the last year and market leading mission give us great confidence that we can deliver compelling and scalable growth for years to come. 
Looking ahead, we believe we are firmly on track to achieve the growth aspirations we outlined in February.

As Emma said, they've been a steady double-digit grower on the top and bottom line for the last decade. The nature of the projects they work on -- and 1 of the things, Steve, that was so attractive about them are really benefiting from secular tailwinds. So they're doing stuff in the green energy arena, in the infrastructure arena. They're doing very large complex projects for corporates that span several years. So the decision-making that underpins those contracts with corporates on about what's going on in the current cycle, there about what their long-term needs are. So we expect this to be an acquisition that they operate at a different margin level because they don't have the same level of pass-throughs we do. 
For instance, 1 thing they don't do this principal contracting, which we do, which, of course, has sample. They're doing the hydro project in New South Wales and Australia that will be the largest renewable project in the country of Australia ever. They're doing the -- they're working on the virgin hydro lists so well known in India that's going to connect the big cities in India. That will go on for years and years and years. 
My guess is their role in that will grow over time. They're involved in the program management and the ongoing cost management when they take on projects like this. So they're very resilient and they are a high-margin company and they're a real grower."

And so yes, there was a little pent-up demand coming through, but our view is that this is going to sustain for years."

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a p",621,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. 
Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. 
Separately, we also announced some changes to our leadership team, appointing Emma Giamartino as Global Group President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Vikram Kohli as Global Group President, Business Intelligence. 
Before we kick off today's call, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy, M&A and investment activity, financial performance, including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and the effects of both cost savings initiatives and the COVID pandemic, the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. 
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. 
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. 
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck. Our agenda for this morning call will be as follows. First, I'll provide an overview of our quarterly financial results. 
Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO, will provide insight on our Q2 performance, the recently announced Turner and Townsend transaction and today's senior leadership changes. Following Bob's remarks, Emma will discuss the quarter in detail, along with our revised qualitative outlook for 2021, our capital deployment activities and broader investment strategy. 
Then we'll open up the call for questions.  Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our second quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew about 20% to a new second quarter record of nearly $6.5 billion, while grew 31% to $3.9 billion, partially driven by a strong rebound in property builds and to a lesser extent, leasing as well as favorable foreign currency effects. 
The quarter also saw tangible benefit from last year's transformation initiatives, which have improved our cost structure and operational agility. Adjusted EBITDA grew 169% to $718 million, surpassing Q2 2019 total by 53%. 
 Overall, adjusted EPS grew 291% to $1.36, while GAAP EPS rose 437% to $1.30. Compared with Q2 2019, these metrics were up 68% and 98%, respectively. Both adjusted and GAAP EPS in the prior year second quarter included a $0.10 headwind from incremental COVID related costs and a terrible contribution to COVID relief efforts. Additionally, certain venture capital investments contributed $0.02 to GAAP and adjusted EPS this quarter. 
The fact, all key financial metrics significantly surpassed to Q2 2019 levels is a testament to the resiliency of our business and the actions we have taken to create a business primed to deliver scalable and enduring growth. 
Now for deeper insights, please turn to Slide 6 for Bob's remarks. Bob?"

As you've seen from the results, Kristen just summarized, CBRE continues to benefit from the multiyear efforts to diversify our business across 4 dimensions: asset type, business line, client type and geography. 
We've moved decisively to capitalize on this opportunity and are making investments and driving organic growth initiatives that will continue this trend. Overall, Q2 2021 adjusted EBITDA grew at a better than 20% compounded rate from Q2 2019 with strong growth across all 3 business segments. 
Each segment experienced significant margin expansion over this 2-year period due to our disciplined expense management, along with the benefits of diversification. 
Thoughtful investments, shaped by a well-developed strategy, will play a central role as we continue to grow and diversify our business across asset type, business line, client type and geography. 
Our balance sheet was very strong going into COVID and has strengthened further as we emerge from the pandemic. We are putting some of this balance sheet capacity to work with a particular focus on investing in secularly favored companies that enhance our ability to provide clients with customized solutions and will benefit from a relationship with CBRE. 
You saw this earlier this year when we acquired a 40% ownership interest in industrious in the flex space arena. And again, this month with our SPACs sponsorship of Altus Power in the commercial and industrial solar energy sector. On Tuesday, we announced a $1.3 billion purchase of a 60% stake in Turner & Townsend, a global leader in project program and cost management. This is a great brand and great management team operating in sectors with favorable long-term growth profiles. 
Turner & Townsend will advance diversification across the 4 dimensions of our business that we've been discussing. For example, across asset types, Turner & Townsend brings us capabilities in infrastructure and green energy where they can help support our efforts to meet our clients' carbon reduction goals. They are the global leader in cost consultancy, a line of business where we have a small practice now. 
Geographically, they move our project management business into new markets in Asia and the Middle East, while we can help them grow in the Americas and elsewhere, and they add an array of new clients around the world, most notably in the government sector. 
We look forward to hitting the ground running with Turner & Townsend when the transaction closes later this year. Before concluding, I'll briefly comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. 
Over the past several years, we've evolved our senior leadership team dramatically, identifying our most compelling executives and putting them in roles where they can have the greatest impact on our business. 
The elevation of Emma Giamartino and Vikram Kohli, the Global Group President roles represents another step in this direction. Consolidating our capital investment and finance functions under Emma reflects the growing importance of capital allocation to the long-term growth aspirations that we outlined at the end of last year. She has proven to be an accomplished investor of our capital, who has an exceptional ability to work effectively with our leaders around the world to execute our capital strategy. 
Vikram has rapidly emerged as a leader with a unique ability to harness data and insight from across our business as well as from external sources. And like Emma he has excelled at working across our global platform. Adding our strategy and digital and technology functions to his mandate will create a business intelligence capability that will better enable us to make powerful fact-based decisions as we guide the company's growth. 
Vikram is the first Seabury executive from outside the U.S. to ascend to this level in the company. We expect to elevate other executives from outside the U.S. into senior global leadership roles as we continue to put our best talent into key positions. Leah Stearns will remain with us through year-end to ensure a smooth transition of financial leadership responsibilities. 
I want to thank Leah for her vision in initiating the transformation of our finance organization. Managing finance through the worst of the COVID-19 crisis and together with Kristen taking our Investor Relations program to a new level, including articulating the financial framework for our long-term growth aspirations. We wish Leah continued success. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Emma."

Thanks, Bob. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today, and I look forward to regularly engaging with you in my new capacity as CFO. With that, please turn to Slide 8. Advisory Services net revenue and segment operating profit set new second quarter records rising 47% and 130% versus Q2 2020. Notably, they surpassed our previous Q2 2019 peaks by 3% and 18%, respectively. While leasing revenue climbed 33% compared to the prior year, it was about 18% below Q2 2019 levels, mostly due to subdued America's office leasing.
 Overall leasing revenue rose year-over-year by 26% in the Americas, 61% in EMEA and 40% in APAC. Americas performance was about 28% below Q2 2019, while EMEA and APAC were about 21% and 14% above. We are encouraged to see recent improvements in America's leasing with July thus far up significantly compared to both 2020 and 2019. 
As expected, property sales improved markedly with revenue growing 152% from the prior year period. Americas, EMEA and APAC property sales revenue serves 158%, 132% and 151%, respectively. All regions eclipsed our Q2 2019 level with total property sales revenue about 27% above Q2 2019. 
The macroeconomic backdrop is part of the real estate investment and global capital migration continues to steadily improve. Rising property sales also helped to catalyze strong growth in commercial mortgage originations, which climbed to 61%. We saw particularly strong demand for acquisition and construction financing and recapitalization. 
Our loan servicing portfolio grew 20% versus prior year and 3% sequentially to over $294 billion, partially driven by strong retention of loans brokered and originated. This led to loan servicing revenue growth of over 15% compared to Q2 2020. Valuation revenue accelerated over 37% as transaction-related work picked up. Activity is particularly strong in the U.S., the valuation revenue increased nearly 47%. 
Finally, Property Management net revenue increased over 6%. EMEA and APAC grew strongly, while Americas lagged due to previous decision to exit some low-margin contracts. Moving to Slide 9. Global Workplace Solutions continued its long record of resilient growth with net revenue rising 11%. This reflected strong growth in project management, up 15% and Facilities Management up 10%, driven by elevated local facilities management and data center assignments as well as the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation. 
Segment operating profit rose over 33%, reflecting solid top line growth, disciplined cost management, the benefit of a mix shift to higher-margin work and the impact of last year's transformation initiative, which more than offset increased medical expense. 
Even accounting for about $17 million of transitory COVID-related expenses in last year's Q2, segment operating profit growth was up 18%. Importantly, our new business pipeline continues to be strong and well diversified with a high concentration of life sciences, logistics and technology companies, along with new data center activity. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment generated over $153 million of segment operating profit, surpassing its previous quarterly high by $38 million. Impressive development operating profit of nearly $120 million was fueled by large office property sales that commanded strong valuations due to the high quality of the assets and tenancy. 
 Importantly, our pipeline and in-process portfolios both set new highs this quarter, rising to $9.6 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively. This growth was largely driven by fee-based office and industrial work for blue-chip occupier clients. Investment Management revenue grew 35% to $139 million fueled by a 29% increase in asset management fees, higher acquisition and disposition fees, carried interest and favorable FX translation. 
Assets under management rose 18% versus the prior year to a new record of more than $129 billion. Stepping up the growth of this business has been a strategic focus, and we're pleased with our progress. The strong top line growth, coupled with careful expense management, drove operating profit growth of 38%. 
Lastly, Hana's operating loss narrowed sequentially to $9 million. We expect a further narrowing of this loss going forward as all Hana sites are now operated by Industrious, and all Hana sites except for 4 legacy units are now owned by Industrious. 
The future financial impact of our Industrious estate, which will be mark-to-market as the value changes will be reflected in Advisory. On Slide 11, we'll look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. We now expect full year Advisory sales and leasing revenue on a combined basis will likely approach 2019 levels with sales likely to moderately exceed prior peak and leasing likely to be roughly 15% or so shy of peak. 
We anticipate year-over-year sales and leasing revenue growth rates will likely moderate as we move further into the second half of the year when year-over-year comparisons will be tougher than in Q2 when activity last year was at a virtual standstill. 
As noted previously, Q3 leasing is off to a strong start, and we continue to monitor the potential Delta variant impact on transaction volume. We've learned over the past 15 months that office leasing is highly correlated with companies return into the office. Given this, as we started to see some U.S.-based companies modestly delayed return to office states, we believe there is a potential for this to impact the strong recovery we've seen quarter to date. 
Across the rest of our Advisory business, we expect revenue to rise in the low double-digit range versus the high single-digit growth we anticipated previously. We also expect our more robust Advisory revenue projections will flow through into incremental margin expansion relative to our previous expectations. 
Moving to GWS. We are modestly raising our expectations for segment operating profit while maintaining our revenue forecast in the high single-digit range. Net revenue is expected to slightly exceed this range. We're benefiting from a shift in service mix and exemplary cost discipline. As a result, we now expect GWS segment operating profit to grow at around the high teens rate this year, a slight improvement from our previous expectations.  
Our updated GWS expectations include some incremental operating expense investments in the second half and do not include any benefit from our announced Turner and Townsend transaction. Looking at REI, we expect this this segment nearly doubled 2020's record higher profitability. 
In Investment Management, we expect revenue to surpass $500 million and profit to rise at least at a high teens rate from the $140 million achieved in 2020. We project development operating profit to more double versus 2020 and to roughly triple its 2019 contribution of $122 million. We are developing products in strong markets and sectors with supportive fundamentals, we have a solid pipeline for asset monetization. 
This is expected to translate into Q3 operating profits that are likely to be at least as high as Q2. Given the robust pipeline and in-process activity, we are optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business and expect it to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth. 
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue should significantly exceed the level achieved in 2019, even though we expect a modest uptick in corporate expenses as compared to that year. The return of high-margin sales revenue, the effects of last year's transformation initiatives and strong development gains are drivers of the improved outlook. 
Overall, we now project our 2021 adjusted EPS to surpass our 2019 pre-pandemic peak of $3.71 by a wider margin than we expected at the end of the first quarter. As usual, we will realize more than half of our earnings in the second half. But given our year-to-date performance, those earnings will be slightly more weighted to the first half than they have been in most years. 
Flipping to Slide 12. Over the last year, we've allocated about $2 billion in total, including about $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, investments in sponsorships and partnerships and M&A inclusive of our pending Turner & Townsend transaction while returning cash to shareholders by buying back approximately $88 million of shares. 
Still, net leverage remains modest at just 0.2x pro forma for the expected closing payment of the Turner & Townsend transaction. We have significant capacity to invest in growth and diversification using our four-pronged investment approach consisting of sponsorships, partnerships, acquisitions and building our own resources and capabilities. 
Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strategic moves we've made over the last year and market leading mission give us great confidence that we can deliver compelling and scalable growth for years to come. Looking ahead, we believe we are firmly on track to achieve the growth aspirations we outlined in February, at least low double-digit average annual earnings growth through at least 2025 absent and downturn with a meaningful upside from incremental capital allocation. With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Tony, I would say it's both. Capital markets is doing is doing quite well. There is a huge amount of capital interested in commercial real estate, obviously, aimed at certain asset classes, for instance, anything related to industrial distribution, multifamily, data centers, there is a lot of capital aimed at those assets, a lot of trading going on. And obviously, we're a big in those arenas. 
So it's coming through in our numbers. As it relates to leasing, it's what it has been. There's real uncertainty about how and when companies will go back to the office post COVID. And as long as that overhang is out there, decisions will be made more slowly than they have been historically. Now as you've seen over the past few months with the vaccination, more people were back in the office, more decisions were being made, commitments were being made. 
But we're -- I would say we can be certain about 2 things. We probably won't go back to where we were pre-COVID. But we'll definitively go back to a level that's far beyond what it has been in the past 15 months, right? The decision-making process around office space has just been extremely muted, and that's not going to sustain once we get to the other side of COVID."

As Emma said, they've been a steady double-digit grower on the top and bottom line for the last decade. The nature of the projects they work on -- and 1 of the things, Steve, that was so attractive about them are really benefiting from secular tailwinds. 
So they're doing stuff in the green energy arena, in the infrastructure arena. They're doing very large complex projects for corporates that span several years. So the decision-making that underpins those contracts with corporates on about what's going on in the current cycle, there about what their long-term needs are. 
So we expect this to be an acquisition that contributes to the resiliency of our business. They operate at a different margin level because they don't have the same level of pass-throughs we do. 
For instance, 1 thing they don't do this principal contracting, which we do, which, of course, has big pass-throughs. But they're doing some massive projects around the world. Give you an example. They're doing the hydro project in New South Wales in Australia that will be the largest renewable project in the country of Australia ever. They're doing the -- they're working on the Virgin Hyperloop so well known in India that's going to connect the big cities in India. That will go on for years and years and years. 
My guess is their role in that will grow over time. They're involved in the program management and the ongoing cost management when they take on projects like this. So they're very resilient and they are a high-margin company and they're a real grower."

Anything, by the way, in the office arena that are new high-quality buildings with great tenants, especially tech tenants. There's a lot of capital for those buildings still. And so what you're seeing is a lot of capital out there in general. A considerable portion of it, this concluded the commercial real estate is a good place to be and then some asset classes within commercial real estate that appear to be performing extremely well with lots of headway to continue to perform well.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.
Separately, we also announced some changes to our leadership team, appointing Emma Giamartino as Global Group President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Vikram Kohli as Global Group President, Business Intelligence. 
Before we kick off today's call, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases, M&A and investment activity; financial performance, including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and the effects of both cost savings initiatives and the COVID pandemic; the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I'll provide an overview of our quarterly financial results. 
Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO, will provide insight on our Q2 performance, the recently announced Turner & Townsend transaction and today's senior leadership changes. Following Bob's remarks, Emma will discuss the quarter in detail, along with our revised qualitative outlook for 2021, our capital deployment activities and broader investment strategy. Then we'll open up the call for questions.
Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our second quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew about 20% to a new second quarter record of nearly $6.5 billion, while net revenue grew 31% to $3.9 billion, partially driven by a strong rebound in property builds and to a lesser extent, leasing as well as favorable foreign currency effects.
The quarter also saw tangible benefit from last year's transformation initiatives, which have improved our cost structure and operational agility. Adjusted EBITDA grew 169% to $718 million, surpassing Q2 2019's total by 53%.
Overall, adjusted EPS grew 291% to $1.36, while GAAP EPS rose 437% to $1.30. Compared with Q2 2019, these metrics were up 68% and 98%, respectively. Both adjusted and GAAP EPS in the prior year second quarter included a $0.10 headwind from incremental COVID related costs and a terrible contribution to COVID relief efforts. Additionally, certain venture capital investments contributed $0.02 to GAAP and adjusted EPS this quarter. 
The fact, all key financial metrics significantly surpassed Q2 2019 levels is a testament to the resiliency of our business and the actions we have taken to create a business primed to deliver scalable and enduring growth.

As you've seen from the results Kristyn just summarized, CBRE continues to benefit from the multiyear efforts to diversify our business across 4 dimensions: asset type, business line, client type and geography.",722,"Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from the results Kristyn just summarized, CBRE continues to benefit from the multiyear efforts to diversify our business across 4 dimensions: asset type, business line, client type and geography. We've moved decisively to capitalize on this opportunity and are making investments and driving organic growth initiatives that will continue this trend.
Overall, Q2 2021 adjusted EBITDA grew at a better than 20% compounded rate from Q2 2019 with strong growth across all 3 business segments. Each segment experienced significant margin expansion over this 2-year period due to our disciplined expense management, along with the benefits of diversification. Thoughtful investments, shaped by a well-developed strategy, will play a central role as we continue to grow and diversify our business across asset type, business line, client type and geography.
Our balance sheet was very strong going into COVID and has strengthened further as we emerge from the pandemic. We are putting some of this balance sheet capacity to work with a particular focus on investing in secularly favored companies that enhance our ability to provide clients with customized solutions and will benefit from a relationship with CBRE.
You saw this earlier this year when we acquired a 40% ownership interest in Industrious in the flex space arena. And again, this month with our SPAC's sponsorship of Altus Power in the commercial and industrial solar energy sector. On Tuesday, we announced a $1.3 billion purchase of a 60% stake in Turner & Townsend, a global leader in project, program and cost management. This is a great brand and great management team operating in sectors with favorable long-term growth profiles.
Turner & Townsend will advance diversification across the 4 dimensions of our business that we've been discussing. For example, across asset types, Turner & Townsend brings us capabilities in infrastructure and green energy where they can help support our efforts to meet our clients' carbon reduction goals. They are the global leader in cost consultancy, a line of business where we have a small practice now.
Geographically, they move our project management business into new markets in Asia and the Middle East, while we can help them grow in the Americas and elsewhere, and they add an array of new clients around the world, most notably in the government sector. We look forward to hitting the ground running with Turner & Townsend when the transaction closes later this year.
Before concluding, I'll briefly comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. Over the past several years, we've evolved our senior leadership team dramatically, identifying our most compelling executives and putting them in roles where they can have the greatest impact on our business.
The elevation of Emma Giamartino and Vikram Kohli to Global Group President roles represents another step in this direction. Consolidating our capital investment and finance functions under Emma reflects the growing importance of capital allocation to the long-term growth aspirations that we outlined at the end of last year. She has proven to be an accomplished investor of our capital, who has an exceptional ability to work effectively with our leaders around the world to execute our capital strategy.
Vikram has rapidly emerged as a leader with a unique ability to harness data and insight from across our business as well as from external sources. And like Emma, he has excelled at working across our global platform. Adding our strategy and digital and technology functions to his mandate will create a business intelligence capability that will better enable us to make powerful fact-based decisions as we guide the company's growth.
Vikram is the first CBRE executive from outside the U.S. to ascend to this level in the company. We expect to elevate other executives from outside the U.S. into senior global leadership roles as we continue to put our best talent into key positions. Leah Stearns will remain with us through year-end to ensure a smooth transition of financial leadership responsibilities.
I want to thank Leah for her vision in initiating the transformation of our finance organization, managing finance through the worst of the COVID-19 crisis and together with Kristyn taking our Investor Relations program to a new level, including articulating the financial framework for our long-term growth aspirations. We wish Leah continued success.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Emma."

It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today, and I look forward to regularly engaging with you in my new capacity as CFO.With that, please turn to Slide 8. Advisory Services net revenue and segment operating profit set new second quar",1450,"Thanks, Bob. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today, and I look forward to regularly engaging with you in my new capacity as CFO.
With that, please turn to Slide 8. Advisory Services net revenue and segment operating profit set new second quarter records rising 47% and 130% versus Q2 2020. Notably, they surpassed our previous Q2 2019 peaks by 3% and 18%, respectively. While leasing revenue climbed 33% compared to the prior year, it was about 18% below Q2 2019 levels, mostly due to subdued Americas office leasing.
Overall leasing revenue rose year-over-year by 26% in the Americas, 61% in EMEA and 40% in APAC. Americas performance was about 28% below Q2 2019, while EMEA and APAC were about 21% and 14% above. We are encouraged to see recent improvements in Americas leasing with July thus far up significantly compared to both 2020 and 2019.
As expected, property sales improved markedly with revenue growing 152% from the prior year period. Americas, EMEA and APAC property sales revenue surged 158%, 132% and 151%, respectively. All regions eclipsed our Q2 2019 levels with total property sales revenue about 27% above Q2 2019.
The macroeconomic backdrop is supportive of real estate investment and global capital migration continues to steadily improve. Rising property sales also helped to catalyze strong growth in commercial mortgage originations, which climbed to 61%. We saw particularly strong demand for acquisition and construction financing and recapitalization.
Our loan servicing portfolio grew 20% versus prior year and 3% sequentially to over $294 billion, partially driven by strong retention of loans brokered and originated. This led to loan servicing revenue growth of over 15% compared to Q2 2020. Valuation revenue accelerated over 37% as transaction-related work picked up. Activity is particularly strong in the U.S., where valuation revenue increased nearly 47%. Finally, Property Management net revenue increased over 6%. EMEA and APAC grew strongly, while Americas lagged due to previous decision to exit some low-margin contracts.
Moving to Slide 9. Global Workplace Solutions continued its long record of resilient growth with net revenue rising 11%. This reflected strong growth in project management up 15% and Facilities Management up 10%, driven by elevated local facilities management and data center assignments as well as the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation.
Segment operating profit rose over 33%, reflecting solid top line growth, disciplined cost management, the benefit of a mix shift to higher-margin work and the impact of last year's transformation initiative, which more than offset increased medical expenses.
Even accounting for about $17 million of transitory COVID-related expenses in last year's Q2, segment operating profit growth was up 18%. Importantly, our new business pipeline continues to be strong and well diversified with a high concentration of life sciences, logistics and technology companies, along with new data center activity.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment generated over $153 million of segment operating profit, surpassing its previous quarterly high by $38 million. Impressive development operating profit of nearly $120 million was fueled by large office property sales that commanded strong valuations due to the high quality of the assets and tenancy.
Importantly, our pipeline and in-process portfolios both set new highs this quarter, rising to $9.6 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively. This growth was largely driven by fee-based office and industrial work for blue-chip occupier clients. Investment Management revenue grew 35% to $139 million fueled by a 29% increase in asset management fees, higher acquisition and disposition fees, carried interest and favorable FX translation. 
Assets under management rose 18% versus the prior year to a new record of more than $129 billion. Stepping up the growth of this business has been a strategic focus, and we're pleased with our progress. The strong top line growth, coupled with careful expense management, drove operating profit growth of 38%.
Lastly, Hana's operating loss narrowed sequentially to $9 million. We expect a further narrowing of this loss going forward as all Hana sites are now operated by Industrious, and all Hana sites except for 4 legacy units are now owned by Industrious. The future financial impact of our Industrious estate, which will be mark-to-market as the value changes, will be reflected in Advisory.
On Slide 11, we'll look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. We now expect full year Advisory sales and leasing revenue on a combined basis will likely approach 2019 levels with sales likely to moderately exceed prior peak and leasing likely to be roughly 15% or so shy of peak.
We anticipate year-over-year sales and leasing revenue growth rates will likely moderate as we move further into the second half of the year when year-over-year comparisons will be tougher than in Q2 when activity last year was at a virtual standstill.
As noted previously, Q3 leasing is off to a strong start, and we continue to monitor the potential Delta variant impact on transaction volume. We've learned over the past 15 months that office leasing is highly correlated with companies returning to the office. Given this, as we started to see some U.S.-based companies modestly delayed return to office states, we believe there is a potential for this to impact the strong recovery we've seen quarter to date.
Across the rest of our Advisory business, we expect revenue to rise in the low double-digit range versus the high single-digit growth we anticipated previously. We also expect our more robust Advisory revenue projections will flow through into incremental margin expansion relative to our previous expectations.
Moving to GWS. We are modestly raising our expectations for segment operating profit while maintaining our revenue forecast in the high single-digit range. Net revenue is expected to slightly exceed this range. We're benefiting from a shift in service mix and exemplary cost discipline. As a result, we now expect GWS segment operating profit to grow at around the high teens rate this year, a slight improvement from our previous expectations.
Our updated GWS expectations include some incremental operating expense investments in the second half and do not include any benefit from our announced Turner & Townsend transaction. Looking at REI, we expect this segment nearly double 2020's record high profitability.
In Investment Management, we expect revenue to surpass $500 million and profit to rise at least at a high teens rate from the $140 million achieved in 2020. We project development operating profit to more than double versus 2020 and to roughly triple its 2019 contribution of $122 million. We are developing products in strong markets and sectors with supportive fundamentals, and have a solid pipeline for asset monetization.
This is expected to translate into Q3 operating profits that are likely to be at least as high as Q2. Given the robust pipeline and in-process activity, we are optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business and expect it to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue should significantly exceed the level achieved in 2019, even though we expect a modest uptick in corporate expenses as compared to that year. The return of high-margin sales revenue, the effects of last year's transformation initiatives and strong development gains are drivers of the improved outlook.
Overall, we now project our 2021 adjusted EPS to surpass our 2019 pre-pandemic peak of $3.71 by a wider margin than we expected at the end of the first quarter. As usual, we will realize more than half of our earnings in the second half. But given our year-to-date performance, those earnings will be slightly more weighted to the first half than they have been in most years.
Flipping to Slide 12. Over the last year, we've allocated about $2 billion in total, including about $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, investments in sponsorships and partnerships and M&A inclusive of our pending Turner & Townsend transaction while returning cash to shareholders by buying back approximately $88 million of shares.
Still, net leverage remains modest at just 0.2x pro forma for the expected closing payment of the Turner & Townsend transaction. We have significant capacity to invest in growth and diversification using our four-pronged investment approach consisting of sponsorships, partnerships, acquisitions and building our own resources and capabilities.
Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strategic moves we've made over the last year and market leading position give us great confidence that we can deliver compelling and scalable growth for years to come. Looking ahead, we believe we are firmly on track to achieve the growth aspirations we outlined in February, at least low double-digit average annual earnings growth through at least 2025 absent a downturn with a meaningful upside from incremental capital allocation.

And obviously, we're big in those arenas.
So it's coming through in our numbers. As it relates to leasing, it's what it has been. There's real uncertainty about how and when companies will go back to the office post COVID. And as long as that overhang is out there, decisions will be made more slowly than they have been historically. Now as you've seen over the past few months with the vaccination, more people were back in the office, more decisions were being made, commitments were being made.
But we're -- I would say we can be certain about 2 things. We probably won't go back to where we were pre-COVID. But we'll definitively go back to a level that's far beyond what it has been in the past 15 months, right? The decision-making process around office space has just been extremely muted, and that's not going to sustain once we get to the other side of COVID."

As Emma said, they've been a steady double-digit grower on the top and bottom line for the last decade. The nature of the projects they work on -- and one of the things, Steve, that was so attractive about them are really benefiting from secular tailwinds.
So they're doing stuff in the green energy arena, in the infrastructure arena. They're doing very large complex projects for corporates that span several years. So the decision-making that underpins those contracts with corporates on about what's going on in the current cycle, there about what their long-term needs are.
So we expect this to be an acquisition that contributes to the resiliency of our business. They operate at a different margin level because they don't have the same level of pass-throughs we do. For instance, one thing they don't do is principal contracting, which we do, which, of course, has big pass-throughs.
But they're doing some massive projects around the world. Give you an example. They're doing the hydro project in New South Wales in Australia that will be the largest renewable project in the country of Australia ever. They're doing the -- they're working on the Virgin Hyperloop that's so well known in India that's going to connect the big cities in India. That will go on for years and years and years.
My guess is their role in that will grow over time. They're involved in the program management and the ongoing cost management when they take on projects like this. So they're very resilient and they are a high-margin company and they're a real grower."

But when you ask about capital markets in the commercial real estate sector, you have to look at the alternative places capital can go. And as you know, there is a lot of capital around the world and prices are high in most asset classes, stocks, et cetera.
And so real estate has proven to be a much better asset class over the last decade, and there are certain portion -- certain assets within real estate that appear to be particularly strong. And we've talked about them over and over, multifamily, data centers, anything industrial.
Anything, by the way, in the office arena that are new high-quality buildings with great tenants, especially tech tenants. There's a lot of capital for those buildings still. And so what you're seeing is a lot of capital out there in general. A considerable portion of it, this concluded the commercial real estate is a good place to be and then some asset classes within commercial real estate that appear to be performing extremely well with lots of headway to continue to perform well. And so yes, there was a little pent-up demand coming through, but our view is that this is going to sustain for years."

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.
Separately, we also announced some changes to our leadership team, appointing Emma Giamartino as Global Group President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Vikram Kohli as Global Group President, Business Intelligence. 
Before we kick off today's call, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases, M&A and investment activity; financial performance, including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and the effects of both cost savings initiatives and the COVID pandemic; the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.
We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I'll provide an overview of our quarterly financial results. 
Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO, will provide insight on our Q2 performance, the recently announced Turner & Townsend transaction and today's senior leadership changes. Following Bob's remarks, Emma will discuss the quarter in detail, along with our revised qualitative outlook for 2021, our capital deployment activities and broader investment strategy. Then we'll open up the call for questions.
Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our second quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew about 20% to a new second quarter record of nearly $6.5 billion, while net revenue grew 31% to $3.9 billion, partially driven by a strong rebound in property builds and to a lesser extent, leasing as well as favorable foreign currency effects.
The quarter also saw tangible benefit from last year's transformation initiatives, which have improved our cost structure and operational agility. Adjusted EBITDA grew 169% to $718 million, surpassing Q2 2019's total by 53%.
Overall, adjusted EPS grew 291% to $1.36, while GAAP EPS rose 437% to $1.30. Compared with Q2 2019, these metrics were up 68% and 98%, respectively. Both adjusted and GAAP EPS in the prior year second quarter included a $0.10 headwind from incremental COVID related costs and a terrible contribution to COVID relief efforts. Additionally, certain venture capital investments contributed $0.02 to GAAP and adjusted EPS this quarter. 
The fact, all key financial metrics significantly surpassed Q2 2019 levels is a testament to the resiliency of our business and the actions we have taken to create a business primed to deliver scalable and enduring growth.
Now for deeper insights, please turn to Slide 6 for Bob's remarks. Bob?"

As you've seen from the results Kristyn just summarized, CBRE continues to benefit from the multiyear efforts to diversify our business across 4 dimensions: asset type, business line, client type and geography.",722,"Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from the results Kristyn just summarized, CBRE continues to benefit from the multiyear efforts to diversify our business across 4 dimensions: asset type, business line, client type and geography. We've moved decisively to capitalize on this opportunity and are making investments and driving organic growth initiatives that will continue this trend.
Overall, Q2 2021 adjusted EBITDA grew at a better than 20% compounded rate from Q2 2019 with strong growth across all 3 business segments. Each segment experienced significant margin expansion over this 2-year period due to our disciplined expense management, along with the benefits of diversification. Thoughtful investments, shaped by a well-developed strategy, will play a central role as we continue to grow and diversify our business across asset type, business line, client type and geography.
Our balance sheet was very strong going into COVID and has strengthened further as we emerge from the pandemic. We are putting some of this balance sheet capacity to work with a particular focus on investing in secularly favored companies that enhance our ability to provide clients with customized solutions and will benefit from a relationship with CBRE.
You saw this earlier this year when we acquired a 40% ownership interest in Industrious in the flex space arena. And again, this month with our SPAC's sponsorship of Altus Power in the commercial and industrial solar energy sector. On Tuesday, we announced a $1.3 billion purchase of a 60% stake in Turner & Townsend, a global leader in project, program and cost management. This is a great brand and great management team operating in sectors with favorable long-term growth profiles.
Turner & Townsend will advance diversification across the 4 dimensions of our business that we've been discussing. For example, across asset types, Turner & Townsend brings us capabilities in infrastructure and green energy where they can help support our efforts to meet our clients' carbon reduction goals. They are the global leader in cost consultancy, a line of business where we have a small practice now.
Geographically, they move our project management business into new markets in Asia and the Middle East, while we can help them grow in the Americas and elsewhere, and they add an array of new clients around the world, most notably in the government sector. We look forward to hitting the ground running with Turner & Townsend when the transaction closes later this year.
Before concluding, I'll briefly comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. Over the past several years, we've evolved our senior leadership team dramatically, identifying our most compelling executives and putting them in roles where they can have the greatest impact on our business.
The elevation of Emma Giamartino and Vikram Kohli to Global Group President roles represents another step in this direction. Consolidating our capital investment and finance functions under Emma reflects the growing importance of capital allocation to the long-term growth aspirations that we outlined at the end of last year. She has proven to be an accomplished investor of our capital, who has an exceptional ability to work effectively with our leaders around the world to execute our capital strategy.
Vikram has rapidly emerged as a leader with a unique ability to harness data and insight from across our business as well as from external sources. And like Emma, he has excelled at working across our global platform. Adding our strategy and digital and technology functions to his mandate will create a business intelligence capability that will better enable us to make powerful fact-based decisions as we guide the company's growth.
Vikram is the first CBRE executive from outside the U.S. to ascend to this level in the company. We expect to elevate other executives from outside the U.S. into senior global leadership roles as we continue to put our best talent into key positions. Leah Stearns will remain with us through year-end to ensure a smooth transition of financial leadership responsibilities.
I want to thank Leah for her vision in initiating the transformation of our finance organization, managing finance through the worst of the COVID-19 crisis and together with Kristyn taking our Investor Relations program to a new level, including articulating the financial framework for our long-term growth aspirations. We wish Leah continued success.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Emma."

It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today, and I look forward to regularly engaging with you in my new capacity as CFO.
With that, please turn to Slide 8. Advisory Services net revenue and segment operating profit set new second quarter records rising 47% and 130% versus Q2 2020. Notably, they surpassed our previous Q2 2019 peaks by 3% and 18%, respectively. While leasing revenue climbed 33% compared to the prior year, it was about 18% below Q2 2019 levels, mostly due to subdued Americas office leasing.
Overall leasing revenue rose year-over-year by 26% in the Americas, 61% in EMEA and 40% in APAC. Americas performance was about 28% below Q2 2019, while EMEA and APAC were about 21% and 14% above. We are encouraged to see recent improvements in Americas leasing with July thus far up significantly compared to both 2020 and 2019.
As expected, property sales improved markedly with revenue growing 152% from the prior year period. Americas, EMEA and APAC property sales revenue surged 158%, 132% and 151%, respectively. All regions eclipsed our Q2 2019 levels with total property sales revenue about 27% above Q2 2019.
The macroeconomic backdrop is supportive of real estate investment and global capital migration continues to steadily improve. Rising property sales also helped to catalyze strong growth in commercial mortgage originations, which climbed to 61%. We saw particularly strong demand for acquisition and construction financing and recapitalization.
Our loan servicing portfolio grew 20% versus prior year and 3% sequentially to over $294 billion, partially driven by strong retention of loans brokered and originated. This led to loan servicing revenue growth of over 15% compared to Q2 2020. Valuation revenue accelerated over 37% as transaction-related work picked up. Activity is particularly strong in the U.S., where valuation revenue increased nearly 47%. Finally, Property Management net revenue increased over 6%. EMEA and APAC grew strongly, while Americas lagged due to previous decision to exit some low-margin contracts.
Moving to Slide 9. Global Workplace Solutions continued its long record of resilient growth with net revenue rising 11%. This reflected strong growth in project management up 15% and Facilities Management up 10%, driven by elevated local facilities management and data center assignments as well as the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation.
Segment operating profit rose over 33%, reflecting solid top line growth, disciplined cost management, the benefit of a mix shift to higher-margin work and the impact of last year's transformation initiative, which more than offset increased medical expenses.
Even accounting for about $17 million of transitory COVID-related expenses in last year's Q2, segment operating profit growth was up 18%. Importantly, our new business pipeline continues to be strong and well diversified with a high concentration of life sciences, logistics and technology companies, along with new data center activity.
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment generated over $153 million of segment operating profit, surpassing its previous quarterly high by $38 million. Impressive development operating profit of nearly $120 million was fueled by large office property sales that commanded strong valuations due to the high quality of the assets and tenancy.
Importantly, our pipeline and in-process portfolios both set new highs this quarter, rising to $9.6 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively. This growth was largely driven by fee-based office and industrial work for blue-chip occupier clients. Investment Management revenue grew 35% to $139 million fueled by a 29% increase in asset management fees, higher acquisition and disposition fees, carried interest and favorable FX translation. 
Assets under management rose 18% versus the prior year to a new record of more than $129 billion. Stepping up the growth of this business has been a strategic focus, and we're pleased with our progress. The strong top line growth, coupled with careful expense management, drove operating profit growth of 38%.
Lastly, Hana's operating loss narrowed sequentially to $9 million. We expect a further narrowing of this loss going forward as all Hana sites are now operated by Industrious, and all Hana sites except for 4 legacy units are now owned by Industrious. The future financial impact of our Industrious estate, which will be mark-to-market as the value changes, will be reflected in Advisory.
On Slide 11, we'll look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. We now expect full year Advisory sales and leasing revenue on a combined basis will likely approach 2019 levels with sales likely to moderately exceed prior peak and leasing likely to be roughly 15% or so shy of peak.
We anticipate year-over-year sales and leasing revenue growth rates will likely moderate as we move further into the second half of the year when year-over-year comparisons will be tougher than in Q2 when activity last year was at a virtual standstill.
As noted previously, Q3 leasing is off to a strong start, and we continue to monitor the potential Delta variant impact on transaction volume. We've learned over the past 15 months that office leasing is highly correlated with companies returning to the office. Given this, as we started to see some U.S.-based companies modestly delayed return to office states, we believe there is a potential for this to impact the strong recovery we've seen quarter to date.
Across the rest of our Advisory business, we expect revenue to rise in the low double-digit range versus the high single-digit growth we anticipated previously. We also expect our more robust Advisory revenue projections will flow through into incremental margin expansion relative to our previous expectations.
Moving to GWS. We are modestly raising our expectations for segment operating profit while maintaining our revenue forecast in the high single-digit range. Net revenue is expected to slightly exceed this range. We're benefiting from a shift in service mix and exemplary cost discipline. As a result, we now expect GWS segment operating profit to grow at around the high teens rate this year, a slight improvement from our previous expectations.
Our updated GWS expectations include some incremental operating expense investments in the second half and do not include any benefit from our announced Turner & Townsend transaction. Looking at REI, we expect this segment nearly double 2020's record high profitability.
In Investment Management, we expect revenue to surpass $500 million and profit to rise at least at a high teens rate from the $140 million achieved in 2020. We project development operating profit to more than double versus 2020 and to roughly triple its 2019 contribution of $122 million. We are developing products in strong markets and sectors with supportive fundamentals, and have a solid pipeline for asset monetization.
This is expected to translate into Q3 operating profits that are likely to be at least as high as Q2. Given the robust pipeline and in-process activity, we are optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business and expect it to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue should significantly exceed the level achieved in 2019, even though we expect a modest uptick in corporate expenses as compared to that year. The return of high-margin sales revenue, the effects of last year's transformation initiatives and strong development gains are drivers of the improved outlook.
Overall, we now project our 2021 adjusted EPS to surpass our 2019 pre-pandemic peak of $3.71 by a wider margin than we expected at the end of the first quarter. As usual, we will realize more than half of our earnings in the second half. But given our year-to-date performance, those earnings will be slightly more weighted to the first half than they have been in most years.
Flipping to Slide 12. Over the last year, we've allocated about $2 billion in total, including about $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, investments in sponsorships and partnerships and M&A inclusive of our pending Turner & Townsend transaction while returning cash to shareholders by buying back approximately $88 million of shares.
Still, net leverage remains modest at just 0.2x pro forma for the expected closing payment of the Turner & Townsend transaction. We have significant capacity to invest in growth and diversification using our four-pronged investment approach consisting of sponsorships, partnerships, acquisitions and building our own resources and capabilities.
Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strategic moves we've made over the last year and market leading position give us great confidence that we can deliver compelling and scalable growth for years to come. Looking ahead, we believe we are firmly on track to achieve the growth aspirations we outlined in February, at least low double-digit average annual earnings growth through at least 2025 absent a downturn with a meaningful upside from incremental capital allocation.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

And obviously, we're big in those arenas.
So it's coming through in our numbers. As it relates to leasing, it's what it has been. There's real uncertainty about how and when companies will go back to the office post COVID. And as long as that overhang is out there, decisions will be made more slowly than they have been historically. Now as you've seen over the past few months with the vaccination, more people were back in the office, more decisions were being made, commitments were being made.
But we're -- I would say we can be certain about 2 things. We probably won't go back to where we were pre-COVID. But we'll definitively go back to a level that's far beyond what it has been in the past 15 months, right? The decision-making process around office space has just been extremely muted, and that's not going to sustain once we get to the other side of COVID."

As Emma said, they've been a steady double-digit grower on the top and bottom line for the last decade. The nature of the projects they work on -- and one of the things, Steve, that was so attractive about them are really benefiting from secular tailwinds.
So they're doing stuff in the green energy arena, in the infrastructure arena. They're doing very large complex projects for corporates that span several years. So the decision-making that underpins those contracts with corporates on about what's going on in the current cycle, there about what their long-term needs are.
So we expect this to be an acquisition that contributes to the resiliency of our business. They operate at a different margin level because they don't have the same level of pass-throughs we do. For instance, one thing they don't do is principal contracting, which we do, which, of course, has big pass-throughs.
But they're doing some massive projects around the world. Give you an example. They're doing the hydro project in New South Wales in Australia that will be the largest renewable project in the country of Australia ever. They're doing the -- they're working on the Virgin Hyperloop that's so well known in India that's going to connect the big cities in India. That will go on for years and years and years.
My guess is their role in that will grow over time. They're involved in the program management and the ongoing cost management when they take on projects like this. So they're very resilient and they are a high-margin company and they're a real grower."

And so real estate has proven to be a much better asset class over the last decade, and there are certain portion -- certain assets within real estate that appear to be particularly strong. And we've talked about them over and over, multifamily, data centers, anything industrial.
Anything, by the way, in the office arena that are new high-quality buildings with great tenants, especially tech tenants. There's a lot of capital for those buildings still. And so what you're seeing is a lot of capital out there in general. A considerable portion of it, this concluded the commercial real estate is a good place to be and then some asset classes within commercial real estate that appear to be performing extremely well with lots of headway to continue to perform well.

Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases and M&A and investment activity, financial performance, including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and the effect of both cost savings initiatives in the COVID pandemic, the integration and performance of acquisitions and other transactions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. 
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our quarterly financial results. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO, will discuss our recent strategic investments and how they support our 4 dimension diversification strategy. Then Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial and Investment Officer, will discuss the quarter in detail, along with our revised qualitative outlook for 2021, our capital deployment activities and balance sheet strength. Then we'll open up the call for questions. 
Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our third quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew approximately 20% to a new third quarter record of about $6.8 billion while net revenue grew over 28% to nearly $4.2 billion. Notably, all our advisory service business lines, including leasing generated more revenue than they did in Q3 2019. The quarter also benefited from the work we completed last year on our cost structure as well as our continued financial discipline. Overall, GAAP EPS rose nearly 135% to $1.28, while adjusted EPS grew about 92% to $1.39. Compared with Q3 2019, these metrics were up approximately 71% and 76%, respectively. 
Now for deeper insights, please turn to Slide 6 for Bob's remarks. Bob?"

The diversification of our business across 4 dimensions: asset types, business lines, clients and geographic markets, has been a key focus of our past few earnings calls. The benefits of this diversification were clearly evident in our third quarter performance with adjusted EBITDA more than 60% above the Q3 2019 peak, record Q3 margins and strong top line growth across all global regions. Our leaders around the world have been adept at identifying and securing compelling opportunities to grow our business across the 4 dimensions of diversification. 
We have committed approximately $2 billion of capital already this year to secularly favored areas, including green energy and infrastructure project management with our Turner & Townsend investment; flex office solutions with our industrious investment; and logistics and multifamily assets in our Real Estate Investments segment. These investments position us well to make additional capital and organic investments that will drive earnings growth for years to come. 
We're also making substantial investments to grow our business organically. These include deeper asset-type specialization in both our brokerage and real estate investment management businesses and client sector specialization in our GWS business. And we're expanding our real estate development business into new international markets. 
With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation as well as the work we've done to streamline costs and capture the benefits of scale, we are positioned to continue growth initiatives like these well into the future. At the same time, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders and are evaluating all potential avenues for such returns. I will close by noting that we will update our multiyear growth framework when we report Q4 results in February. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Emma."
4204816,1684345641,2415477,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. Let's start with our Advisory segment. This segment rebounded strongly from the pandemic-suppressed levels of Q3 2020 and performed very well compared with pre-pandemic activity in 2019. In my c",1581,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. Let's start with our Advisory segment. This segment rebounded strongly from the pandemic-suppressed levels of Q3 2020 and performed very well compared with pre-pandemic activity in 2019. In my comments today, I'll include compared with Q3 2019 for the transactional business lines. We believe this is the best barometer of how these business lines are faring. 
Advisory Services net revenue and operating profit set new third quarter records, surpassing the Q3 2019 peak by 13% and 29%, respectively. This strong performance reflects not only our ability to capture reviving demand for real estate services but also our diligent focus on managing costs during the recovery. The strong operating profit growth also reflects a $7.5 million gain from our industrious investment. 
Leasing continued to bounce back strongly, particularly outside the U.S. with global revenue up 58% from Q3 2020 and 7% from the Q3 2019 peak. All 3 regions generated leasing revenue above Q3 2019 peak levels: Up 4% in the Americas; 20% in EMEA; and 11% in APAC. Office demand in the U.S. continues to trail pre-pandemic levels. However, the shortfalls from the 2019 peak levels narrowed to just 16% in Q3 versus 54% in Q2. 
We also continued to see strong small deal performance with revenue from U.S. leasing transactions below $1 million, up about 8% versus Q3 2019, while the contribution from large deals over $1 million remained about 5% below its prepandemic level. 
Property sales activity remained robust. All regions exceeded their prepandemic peaks, with global property sales up 93% from Q3 2020 and 27% from the Q3 2019 peak. Like in leasing, U.S. office sales activity saw a significant improvement, coming in just 16% below Q3 2019 levels versus 31% in Q2. 
An improved investment market also helped generate strong growth in commercial mortgage origination. Revenue rose 41% from Q3 2020 and 11% from the Q3 2019 peak. Both the government agencies and private lenders were noticeably more active in Q3. We expect the agency's higher lending caps through 2022, coupled with a healthy appetite from private lenders and the attractive yields available from real estate debt to provide a supportive backdrop heading into next year. 
Strong origination activity helped to drive a 19% increase versus the prior year quarter in our loan servicing portfolio, which reached $300 billion at quarter's end. The portfolio growth propelled a 35% revenue increase from the prior year Q3. 
Valuation revenue accelerated more than 27% from last year's quarter, partially reflecting particularly strong growth in the U.K. and Ireland.  Property management revenue increased 6% year-over-year. 
Moving to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment again posted solid revenue and segment operating profit growth across its global business base. Revenue rose over 8% from Q3 2020, comprised of 21% growth in project management and 6% in Facilities Management. Total GWS segment operating profit rose over 16% compared with Q3 2020. Our local client business was a standout performer, accounting for 1/4 of total segment operating profit. This growth has been driven in part by selective infill M&A. 
Importantly, despite evidence of increased inflation throughout the economy, we believe our GWS business is well protected by contract provisions that enable us to factor inflation into our pricing annually or even more frequently in certain cases. We are optimistic about the future growth trajectory of GWS. Our new business pipeline is growing and remains well diversified, with representation from financial services, industrial, life sciences and technology clients. The pipeline increased markedly from Q2 and is up from both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019. We expect continued pipeline strength as the business environment increasingly settles into a new normal. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment continued to deliver strong growth with segment operating profit nearly matching last quarter's record level. This performance reflects how well positioned our development and investment management businesses are to capitalize on the strong investment climate and the flow of capital into industrial, multifamily and other favorite asset classes. 
Global Development generated nearly $100 million of operating profit in the third quarter, primarily driven by selling industrial properties at high valuations, reflecting asset and tenant quality as well as strong market fundamentals. Industrial comprises the largest portion of our in-process portfolio and pipeline at 35% and 39%, respectively, and we continue adding new projects to the pipeline at a strong pace. This will drive revenue and profit opportunities for years to come. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, we have converted the average value of the in-process portfolio to operating profit at a rate of 1.9%, which is towards the high end of the historical range. Importantly, our in-process portfolio set another new high this quarter, rising to $16.8 billion, largely driven by multifamily activity. 
Investment Management benefited from a record level of asset management fees as well as higher incentive, acquisition and disposition fees. Compared with Q3 2020, revenue rose 35% to $135 million, while operating profit increased 68% to $49 million. Assets under management continued to grow steadily, rising to over $133 billion despite negative currency effects. 
Industrial and logistics properties remain the largest asset class in the portfolio, comprising more than $35 billion of AUM or over 26% of the total. Fundraising also remained strong as the performance of our funds and separate accounts attracts new capital. Dry powder rose 6% from Q2 to $13.2 billion. 
Looking at the business as a whole, we're on track to surpass 2019's record performance across all key financial metrics by a substantial margin. On Slide 11, we'll briefly walk through our revised qualitative 2021 outlook. We now expect full year global advisory sales revenue to be about 15% above the 2019 peak and global leasing to fall 5% or so short of peak. Q4 will likely see more moderate sales and leasing growth rates than we've experienced the last few quarters as prior year comparisons become tougher. However, both U.S. sales and leasing have been running well ahead of 2019 peak levels thus far in October. 
Across the rest of our advisory business, we reiterate expectations for low double-digit revenue growth on a combined basis. We also anticipate stronger incremental margin expansion than we previously forecast due to the more robust revenue growth. The Q4 net margin should be around the 22.7% achieved in the prior year fourth quarter. We expect the benefit of more revenue from high-margin business lines will likely be offset by increased discretionary spending to drive growth and by lower OMSR gains compared with Q4 2020. 
In GWS, we expect mid- to high single-digit net revenue growth, accompanied by operating profit growth of 20% or more year-over-year before contributions from the Turner & Townsend transaction. Our policy is to reflect transactions once closed. Currently, we expect this transaction to close early next week. Given this timing, we anticipate the transaction will contribute about $160 million to $170 million in revenue and about $20 million to $25 million in operating profit to our 2021 consolidated results. 
November and December are usually seasonally light months for the company. For calendar year 2021, Turner & Townsend is expected to generate roughly $1 billion in net revenue at the current spot rate at a similar operating profit margin to their prior fiscal year. 
Importantly, as I noted previously, our broader GWS new business pipeline is building, and we expect to see the benefit from this in 2022 and beyond. For REI, we have raised our expectations modestly, driven by investment management. We now expect this business line revenue to rise in the low to mid-teens range and its operating profit to increase slightly 30% versus 2020. This includes some incremental OpEx investments slated for the fourth quarter. 
We continue to expect global development operating profit to roughly triple the $122 million generated in 2019. This reflects the movement of some transactions previously expected to close in Q3 to Q4. They are developing properties in markets and sectors with strong underlying fundamentals and expect to continue monetizing these assets in Q4 and for the next several years. 
As we've noted in past quarters, Corporate segment expenses will be up from both 2019 and 2020 and are expected to end the year at just over 2% of total net revenue. Year-to-date, discretionary operating expenses have been trending well below pre-COVID levels. However, we expect some of these expenses to gradually return as business activity recover. 
Flipping to Slide 12. We've strengthened our balance sheet while committing approximately $2 billion thus far in 2021 to long-term growth initiatives while also returning $188 million to shareholders through repurchases. Trailing 12-month free cash flow generation reached a company record at over $1.9 billion. As a result, we ended the quarter with a net cash position of 0.3 turns and nearly $6 billion of liquidity. We expect to maintain our net cash position in Q4 even with our initial payment for our stake in Turner & Townsend, which will be about $700 million. 
We will continue to prioritize investments that enhance our diversification resiliency and long-run growth trajectory. Going forward, we are poised to continue investing in our growth while returning capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our market-leading position, the underlying momentum in our business and our substantial balance sheet capacity make us very excited about our future growth prospects. We look forward to closing out 2021 with another strong quarter. With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

We feel very comfortable that we're well positioned to weather inflationary pressures across our business. I did mention in my remarks that we see a natural hedge within our GWS contracts overall. And then we also see a natural hedge in other parts of our business with property management, for example. So within property management, as rents rise as inflation rises, our revenue in property management also rises. And then on the transactional side of the business, it tends to benefit from inflation given that inflation tends to only happen when the economy is expanding. So across all those businesses, we feel very comfortable that we can weather the inflationary environment.

The Industrious investment, we believe, is a bit of a hedge against -- not even a bit, a significant hedge against what we have said now for some time is that we expect there to be some downward pressure on the office product type relative to where it has been historically. But we've studied this flex dynamic over and over and over and spent a huge amount of time with our occupier clients. And the general view is that they expect flex space to be a bigger portion of their office space use going forward than it has been historically. And landlords expect it to be a fixture in their buildings in general going forward. So we think the future for Industrious is quite bright. We voted with our pocketbook as they stay when we invested in that business, and we are prepared to make incremental investments to support their growth. We're quite, quite bullish about what might happen with Industrious. 
As it relates to the office product type in general, I think our company and our own plans about what to do with our people is a bit of a proxy for what's going on in the marketplace. There's uncertainty. We had thought we would have a significant return to the office kind of inflection point after Labor Day because people were more and more aimed at getting their teams back into the office for all the reasons we know, collaboration, culture, et cetera. Well, when the Delta variant came, it pushed that back. We now think that inflection point is probably going to be the first of the year. And we think people will come back to the office in the same way they would have come back to the office had the delta variant not occurred. And our view that we've articulated for the past several quarters is that's going to be something like 80%, 85% of where it was before. But again, we're all trying to figure out what the future of office space is going to be. But we believe what we've really seen is a delay from Labor Day to the first of the year. 
And I can tell you, I interface with a lot of clients, interface with a lot of CEOs and talk to them about their plans. In general, they believe that getting back to the office in a significant way -- not all the way back to where they were before, there will be hybrid work going on long into the future. But getting back significantly is in people's plans. And we think that's going to impact our business positively. One thing that, I believe, close to not arguable, what we're seeing today is not as good as what we're going to see in the future as it relates to office buildings. We're still significantly impacted by COVID. But as you saw, the gap between peak leasing performance in the office sector in the third quarter was meaningfully smaller than it was in the second quarter."

They are causing some challenges in terms of staffing. We and our clients are like everybody else. There's a real war for talent, and it's impacting the things we do. What you're seeing on the rebuild of the pipeline and the relative -- slightly relative downward pressure we've seen on the growth trajectory of the enterprise portion of our outsourcing business is that people have found it difficult to make decisions, not knowing what's going to go on with office space. And they found it difficult to make decisions because they aren't in the office together, coordinating all the things you need to coordinate to make massive commitments the way outsourcing contracts require you to make to move forward at the pace we're moving forward before. These commitments that these occupiers are making on these outsourcing contracts can be multibillion-dollar commitments over years. And so when the teams that are dealing with the strategy and the procurement teams, and the C-suite aren't in the office, interfacing with each other, aren't certain about where they're going to go, things slow down. Now we're seeing a market increase -- a significant increase in our pipeline from where we were a year ago, which is indicative of the fact that people are getting back to being able to make these decisions with a little more clarity.

Please note, we have added some new detail to our Real Estate Investments segment tab.  
Before we kick off today's call, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases, M&A and investment activity, financial performance, including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and the effect of both cost savings initiatives in the COVID pandemic the integration and performance of acquisitions and other transactions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.  
You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.  
Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our quarterly financial results. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO, will discuss our recent strategic investments and how they support our 4 dimension diversification strategy. Then Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial and Investment Officer, will discuss the quarter in detail, along with our revised qualitative outlook for 2021, our capital deployment activities and balance sheet strength. Then we'll open up the call for questions.  
Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our third quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew approximately 20% to a new third quarter record of about $6.8 billion while net revenue grew over 28% to nearly $4.2 billion. Notably, all our advisory service business lines, including leasing generated more revenue than they did in Q3 2019. The quarter also benefited from the work we completed last year on our cost structure as well as our continued financial discipline. Overall, GAAP EPS rose nearly 135% to $1.28, while adjusted EPS grew about 92% to $1.39. Compared with Q3 2019, these metrics were up approximately 71% and 76%, respectively.  
Now for deeper insights, please turn to Slide 6 for Bob's remarks. Bob?"

The diversification of our business across 4 dimensions: asset types, business lines, clients and geographic markets, has been a key focus of our past few earnings calls. The benefits of this diversification were clearly evident in our third quarter performance with adjusted EBITDA more than 60% above the Q3 2019 peak record Q3 margins and strong top line growth across all global regions. Our leaders around the world have been adept at identifying and securing compelling opportunities to grow our business across the 4 dimensions of diversification.  
We have committed approximately $2 billion of capital already this year to secularly favored areas, including green energy and infrastructure project management with our Turner & Townsend investment; flex office solutions with our industrious investment; and logistics and multifamily assets in our Real Estate Investments segment. These investments position us well to make additional capital and organic investments that will drive earnings growth for years to come.  
We're also making substantial investments to grow our business organically. These include deeper asset-type specialization in both our brokerage and real estate investment management businesses and client sector specialization in our GWS business. And we're expanding our real estate development business into new international markets. 
With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation as well as the work we've done to streamline costs and capture the benefits of scale, we are positioned to continue growth initiatives like these well into the future. At the same time, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders and are evaluating all potential avenues for such returns. I will close by noting that we will update our multiyear growth framework when we report Q4 results in February. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Emma."

Turning to Slide 8. Let's start with our Advisory segment. This segment rebounded strongly from the pandemic-suppressed levels of Q3 2020 and performed very well compared with pre-pandemic activity in 2019. In my c",1580,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. Let's start with our Advisory segment. This segment rebounded strongly from the pandemic-suppressed levels of Q3 2020 and performed very well compared with pre-pandemic activity in 2019. In my comments today, I'll include compared with Q3 2019 for the transactional business lines. We believe this is the best barometer of how these business lines are faring.  
Advisory Services net revenue and operating profit set new third quarter records, surpassing the Q3 2019 peak by 13% and 29%, respectively. This strong performance reflects not only our ability to capture reviving demand for real estate services, but also our diligent focus on managing costs during the recovery. The strong operating profit growth also reflects a $7.5 million gain from our industrious investment.  
Leasing continued to bounce back strongly, particularly outside the U.S. with global revenue up 58% from Q3 2020 and 7% from the Q3 2019 peak. All 3 regions generated leasing revenue above Q3 2019 peak levels: Up 4% in the Americas; 20% in EMEA; and 11% in APAC. Office demand in the U.S. continues to trail pre-pandemic levels. However, the shortfalls from the 2019 peak levels narrowed to just 16% in Q3 versus 54% in Q2.  
We also continued to see strong small deal performance with revenue from U.S. leasing transactions below $1 million, up about 8% versus Q3 2019, while the contribution from large deals over $1 million remained about 5% below its pre-pandemic level.  
Property sales activity remained robust. All regions exceeded their pre-pandemic peaks, with global property sales, up 93% from Q3 2020 and 27% from the Q3 2019 peak. Like in leasing, U.S. office sales activity saw a significant improvement, coming in just 16% below Q3 2019 levels versus 31% in Q2. An improved investment market also helped generate strong growth in commercial mortgage origination. Revenue rose 41% from Q3 2020 and 11% from the Q3 2019 peak. Both the government agencies and private lenders were noticeably more active in Q3. We expect the agency's higher lending caps through 2022, coupled with a healthy appetite from private lenders and the attractive yields available from real estate debt to provide a supportive backdrop heading into next year.  
Strong origination activity helped to drive a 19% increase versus the prior year quarter in our loan servicing portfolio, which reached $300 billion at quarter's end. The portfolio growth propelled a 35% revenue increase from the prior year Q3.  
Valuation revenue accelerated more than 27% from last year's quarter, partially reflecting particularly strong growth in the U.K. and Ireland. Property management revenue increased 6% year-over-year.  
Moving to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment again posted solid revenue and segment operating profit growth across its global business base. Revenue rose over 8% from Q3 2020, comprised of 21% growth in project management and 6% in Facilities Management. Total GWS segment operating profit rose over 16% compared with Q3 2020. Our local client business was a standout performer, accounting for 1/4 of total segment operating profit. This growth has been driven in part by selective infill M&A.  
Importantly, despite evidence of increased inflation throughout the economy, we believe our GWS business is well protected by contract provisions that enable us to factor inflation into our pricing annually or even more frequently in certain cases. We are optimistic about the future growth trajectory of GWS. Our new business pipeline is growing and remains well diversified, with representation from financial services, industrial, life sciences and technology clients. The pipeline increased markedly from Q2 and is up from both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019. We expect continued pipeline strength as the business environment increasingly settles into a new normal.  
Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment continued to deliver strong growth with segment operating profit nearly matching last quarter's record level. This performance reflects how well positioned our development and investment management businesses are to capitalize on the strong investment climate and the flow of capital into industrial, multifamily and other favorite asset classes.  
Global Development generated nearly $100 million of operating profit in the third quarter, primarily driven by selling industrial properties at high valuations, reflecting asset and tenant quality as well as strong market fundamentals. Industrial comprises the largest portion of our in-process portfolio and pipeline at 35% and 39%, respectively, and we continue adding new projects to the pipeline at a strong pace. This will drive revenue and profit opportunities for years to come.  
On a trailing 12-month basis, we have converted the average value of the in-process portfolio to operating profit at a rate of 1.9%, which is towards the high end of the historical range. Importantly, our in-process portfolio set another new high this quarter, rising to $16.8 billion, largely driven by multifamily activity.  
Investment Management benefited from a record level of asset management fees as well as higher incentive, acquisition and disposition fees. Compared with Q3 2020, revenue rose 35% to $135 million while operating profit increased 68% to $49 million. Assets under management continued to grow steadily, rising to over $133 billion despite negative currency effects.  
Industrial and logistics properties remain the largest asset class in the portfolio, comprising more than $35 billion of AUM or over 26% of the total. Fundraising also remained strong as the performance of our funds and separate accounts attracts new capital. Dry powder rose 6% from Q2 to $13.2 billion.  
Looking at the business as a whole, we're on track to surpass 2019's record performance across all key financial metrics by a substantial margin. On Slide 11, we'll briefly walk through our revised qualitative 2021 outlook. We now expect full year global advisory sales revenue to be about 15% above the 2019 peak and global leasing to fall 5% or so short of peak. Q4 will likely see more moderate sales and leasing growth rates than we've experienced the last few quarters as prior year comparisons become tougher. However, both U.S. sales and leasing have been running well ahead of 2019 peak levels thus far in October.  
Across the rest of our advisory business, we reiterate expectations for low double-digit revenue growth on a combined basis. We also anticipate stronger incremental margin expansion than we previously forecast due to the more robust revenue growth. The Q4 net margin should be around the 22.7% achieved in the prior year fourth quarter. We expect the benefit of more revenue from high-margin business lines will likely be offset by increased discretionary spending to drive growth and by lower OMSR gains compared with Q4 2020. 
In GWS, we expect mid- to high-single-digit net revenue growth, accompanied by operating profit growth of 20% or more year-over-year before contributions from the Turner & Townsend transaction. Our policy is to reflect transactions once closed. Currently, we expect this transaction to close early next week. Given this timing, we anticipate the transaction will contribute about $160 million to $170 million in revenue and about $20 million to $25 million in operating profit to our 2021 consolidated results. 
November and December are usually seasonally light months for the company. For calendar year 2021, Turner & Townsend is expected to generate roughly $1 billion in net revenue at the current spot rate at a similar operating profit margin to their prior fiscal year. 
Importantly, as I noted previously, our broader GWS new business pipeline is building, and we expect to see the benefit from this in 2022 and beyond. For REI, we have raised our expectations modestly, driven by investment management. We now expect this business lines revenue to rise in the low to mid-teens range and its operating profit to increase slightly 30% versus 2020. This includes some incremental OpEx investments slated for the fourth quarter. 
We continue to expect global development operating profit to roughly triple the $122 million generated in 2019. This reflects the movement of some transactions previously expected to close in Q3 to Q4. They are developing properties in markets and sectors with strong underlying fundamentals and expect to continue monetizing these assets in Q4 and for the next several years. 
As we've noted in past quarters, corporate segment expenses will be up from both 2019 and 2020 and are expected to end the year at just over 2% of total net revenue. Year-to-date, discretionary operating expenses have been trending well below pre-COVID levels. However, we expect some of these expenses to gradually return as business activity recover. 
Flipping to Slide 12. We've strengthened our balance sheet while committing approximately $2 billion thus far in 2021 to long-term growth initiatives while also, returning $188 million to shareholders through repurchases. Trailing 12-month free cash flow generation reached a company record at over $1.9 billion. As a result, we ended the quarter with a net cash position of 0.3 turns and nearly $6 billion of liquidity. We expect to maintain our net cash position in Q4 even with our initial payment for our stake in Turner & Townsend, which will be about $700 million. 
We will continue to prioritize investments that enhance our diversification, resiliency and long-run growth trajectory. Going forward, we are poised to continue investing in our growth while returning capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our market-leading position, the underlying momentum in our business and our substantial balance sheet capacity make us very excited about our future growth prospects. We look forward to closing out 2021 with another strong quarter. With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

The Industrious investment, we believe, is a bit of a hedge against -- not even a bit, a significant hedge against what we have said now for some time is that we expect there to be some downward pressure on the office product type relative to where it has been historically. But we've studied this flex dynamic over and over and over and spent a huge amount of time with our occupier clients. And the general view is that they expect flex space to be a bigger portion of their office space use going forward than it has been historically. And landlords expect it to be a fixture in their buildings in general going forward. So we think the future for Industrious is quite bright. We voted with our pocketbook as they stay when we invested in that business, and we are prepared to make incremental investments to support their growth. We're quite, quite bullish about what might happen with Industrious. 
As it relates to the office product type in general, I think our company and our own plans about what to do with our people is a bit of a proxy for what's going on in the marketplace. There's uncertainty. We had thought we would have a significant return to the office kind of inflection point after Labor Day because people were more and more aimed at getting their teams back into the office for all the reasons we know, collaboration, culture, et cetera. Well, when the Delta Variant came, it pushed that back. We now think that inflection point is probably going to be the first of the year. And we think people will come back to the office in the same way they would have come back to the office had the Delta Variant not occurred. And our view that we've articulated for the past several quarters is that's going to be something like 80%, 85% of where it was before. But again, we're all trying to figure out what the future of office space is going to be. But we believe what we've really seen is a delay from Labor Day to the first of the year. 
And I can tell you, I interface with a lot of clients, interface with a lot of CEOs and talk to them about their plans. In general, they believe that getting back to the office in a significant way -- not all the way back to where they were before, there will be hybrid work going on long into the future. But getting back significantly is in people's plans. And we think that's going to impact our business positively. One thing that, I believe, close to not arguable, what we're seeing today is not as good as what we're going to see in the future as it relates to office buildings. We're still significantly impacted by COVID. But as you saw, the gap between peak leasing performance in the office sector in the third quarter was meaningfully smaller than it was in the second quarter."

They are causing some challenges in terms of staffing. We and our clients are like everybody else. There's a real war for talent, and it's impacting the things we do. What you're seeing on the rebuild of the pipeline and the relative -- slightly relative downward pressure we've seen on the growth trajectory of the enterprise portion of our outsourcing business is that people have found it difficult to make decisions, not knowing what's going to go on with office space. And they found it difficult to make decisions because they aren't in the office together, coordinating all the things you need to coordinate to make massive commitments the way outsourcing contracts require you to make to move forward at the pace we're moving forward before. These commitments that these occupiers are making on these outsourcing contracts can be multibillion-dollar commitments over years. And so when the teams that are dealing with the strategy and the procurement teams, and the C-suite aren't in the office, interfacing with each other, aren't certain about where they're going to go, things slow down. Now we're seeing a market increase, a significant increase in our pipeline from where we were a year ago, which is indicative of the fact that people are getting back to being able to make these decisions with a little more clarity. But that's really what you're seeing in terms of the pipeline, where it was a year ago, where it was 2 years ago and where it is now."
