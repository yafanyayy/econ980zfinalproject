Before we start, I'd be remiss not to point out what a fantastic past weekend this was for sport and for Under Armour. From Stephen Curry",2097,"Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end 2020 conference call. 
Before we start, I'd be remiss not to point out what a fantastic past weekend this was for sport and for Under Armour. From Stephen Curry scoring 57 points, the eighth time he scored more than 50 in a game, to Chase Yarn winning the NFL Defensive Rookie of the year and Joel putting up 33 to keep the 76ers in first place to Jordan posting a career-best 10 birdies in a round, there was no shortage of UA highlights this weekend. Oh, and of course, there's one more highlight or better yet, make that the seventh as a #7 for the gold quarterback, Tom Brady, as he led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the second-ever Super Bowl victory. With Tom, it's quite easy to run out of ways to describe yet again another incredible accomplishment he's added to his unparalleled career. In his 10 years as an Under Armour athlete, Tom has exemplified what perseverance, hard work and leadership can do in pursuit of excellence. On behalf of the entire Under Armour family, Tom, thank you for making us better. 
Now turning back to our results. As I reflect on my first year as CEO amid a global pandemic that has tested all of us, I'd start by underscoring just how incredibly proud I am of our team's resilience and their ability to execute at an incredibly high level against our long-term strategy. We've made significant progress on our way to becoming a stronger brand and a better run company during the past year from managing through a 3-month global retail shutdown and relaunching our North American e-commerce platform to executing a comprehensive restructuring effort and divesting the MyFitnessPal platform, our mantra, the only way is through, turned out to be even more foretelling than perhaps we had intended to be. Despite an incredible amount of uncertainty in 2020, we stayed the course by harnessing the strength of our rearchitected go-to-market engine to deliver performance-based products and experiences along with targeted data-driven storytelling, Under Armour showed up stronger and more holistically as a brand than in years past. 
From an operations perspective, increasingly more effective supply and demand planning, along with our best-in-class distribution network, enabled us to quickly adapt to the needs of our customers and consumers with greater precision and efficiency, getting the right product to the right place at the right time. As we closed out 2020, our efforts over the past couple of years to pursue a clearly defined target consumer, rebase our cost structure and fundamentally change the way we work is beginning to yield results. Empowered by a clear identity of who we are, a leading athletic performance brand, our foundation is solid, our discipline tested and proven and the opportunity before us is robust. 
As I look ahead, I'm energized by our transformation. I'm confident that our operating model is strengthening our ability to drive sustainable returns to our shareholders over the long term, yet we remain confronted with uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, some parts of our business have fundamentally changed, including new ways of working and interacting with our consumers, customers and teammates. 
How these changes ultimately play out over the next few years remains to be seen. Still, I'm confident that we are significantly better equipped to navigate through the changes, given our improved levels of agility and optionality. 
The last year has also brought about meaningful changes in consumer behavior and related marketplace demand impacts. In this respect, we remain focused on controlling what we can while staying prudent. This means being patient and measured in how we manage our business and conscious about where we are within our journey while maintaining the same level of discipline that got us here. 
To this effect, we will continue to constrain demand in 2021, a decision that, as discussed in previous calls, may impact our ability to drive top line volume in the near term. However, whether through proactive wholesale door-reduction efforts in North America or ordering slightly less product against future demand based on the brand and margin benefits that we realized in 2020, we are confident that this focus will help elevate our premium positioning with consumers and, therefore, driving better profitability. 
Carrying forward into 2021, there are 4 areas of focus that we laid out on our last call. First is continuing to strengthen the brand through increased engagement and consideration with the focused performer. Second is continuous improvement within our operating model to drive even greater efficiency across all end-to-end processes. Third is elevating a D2C-focused approach to deepen and amplify our most intimate connection with Under Armour's consumers. And finally, as we get back to profitable growth in 2021, making sure our discipline stays aligned with driving shareholder value over the long term. 
Starting with brand strength and engagement. About a year ago, we launched a powerful global Under Armour voice to drive increased consideration with our target consumer, the focused performer. Empowered by enhanced tools and real-time metrics as consumer behavior shifted towards e-commerce as well as working out from home, including a large shift towards running, we too altered course. From the only way through to through this together and other variations along the way, we refocused our efforts more surgically to drive greater returns and at an exceedingly dynamic environment. And while these efforts, of course, take time to manifest into sea change, exiting a year like 2020 with increased consideration, conversion and higher selling prices in many parts of our business gives us greater confidence in our strategy and execution for the year ahead. 
Successful storytelling, of course, needs to partner with great products. In 2020, we stuck to our playbook and leaned heavier into brand and product marketing to support successful introductions like our Project Rock collection, Meridian Pant, Infinity Bra, UA SPORTSMASK and in footwear, the HOVR Machina, Phantom 2 and the Breakthru. 
One highlight we're especially encouraged by is the continued momentum in our women's business, specifically bras and bottoms and broad-based interest across our run category, led by our innovation-driven HOVR franchise. Another highlight is the launch of the Curry brand in December. As a purpose-led collaboration powered by Under Armour, we're excited to partner with Stephen to deliver performance products that, along with focused partnerships, will help fund youth sports in under-resourced communities through equitable access and safe places to play. 
As a pinnacle expression of this effort, we launched the Curry 8 basketball shoe, the first product to feature UA Flow. As the second footwear cushioning technology released under our reengineered go to market, Flow's proprietary nonrubber outsole has manifested into our most obedient and highest traction footwear yet. 
Up next, UA Flow is set to launch in one of our largest long-term growth opportunities: running. Building on the success and momentum of HOVR, the UA Flow running platform will help us accomplish 2 things. As an innovation, we believe this product's performance attributes, including its unique traction, ride and energy return structure, will help drive even more significant consideration and authenticity with core runners. And second, as our most pinnacle running footwear offering, it will broaden our ability to segment and help differentiate our assortment, thereby creating opportunities for shelf space expansion within running specialty and key wholesale accounts. 
Switching gears to our second area of focus is our operating model evolution. Throughout 2020, we work to rebase our cost structure to ensure we are positioned from a strategic, operational and financial perspective with an appropriate foundation and agility to scale with future growth. And within our comprehensive restructuring plan, we believe our central purpose continues to put us in a position to return to double-digit operating margin over the long term. 
In this spirit, we've been asked many times if we've reached an optimal cost structure for Under Armour or where our general breakeven ratio lies. At $2.2 billion of SG&A in 2020, our cost structure is not meant to support the $4.5 billion in revenue that we realized last year, but instead, a larger top line business where we can begin to leverage some of the foundational investments necessary for our growth expectations. 
As laid out in this morning's press release and details that Dave will discuss later, we plan to return to profitability in 2021. Therefore, our breakeven is somewhere around the $4.7 billion mark. 
With our cost structure now appropriately rebased, it's important to understand a few elements of how we're thinking about SG&A expenses and investments moving forward. When considering our restructuring efforts and how they've impacted or will continue to affect our overall cost structure, it's essential to remember that most of these efforts have been related to future cost avoidance versus current cost reductions. 
That said, we had realized underlying SG&A benefits in certain areas. However, it's not as simple as cutting cost to gain leverage. As we mentioned early within our restructuring efforts, our main objective was to unburden ourselves of decisions and commitments made when we expected to be a much larger company than we are now. Within those scenarios, there was also an expected level of productivity that was never realized. 
As a business in pursuit of brand-right growth, we will continue to invest in driving that growth. And for us specifically, that means marketing, IT and elevating our international and D2C footprints. More simply put, while the absolute SG&A dollars may not change much in the near term, I'd underscore that productivity and return on the investments that we are making are appropriately greater than just a few years ago. And should market factors impact our growth track in the near term, we're now also capable of flexing and managing our costs with greater discipline and optionality to maintain a more consistent profitability trajectory. 
These factors, along with improved visibility and tighter alignment of our demand and supply planning functions, have afforded us greater flexibility with our customers and our ability to service higher-than-planned demand. This is especially evident in our year-end inventory position, which was at the same level that we ended 2019. In 2021, we plan to manage this even more tightly, helping us drive fuller price selling across all distribution points while keeping an eye on increasing our productivity and therefore, turns. 
Moving to our third priority, elevating a D2C-focused approach, and the pandemic has certainly magnified and accelerated digital adoption rates worldwide. With eCommerce up 40% in 2020 and representing nearly half of our total D2C business for the full year, we are hyper-focused on better understanding the consumer journey and building greater personalization capabilities to unlock even deeper connections with athletes. 
In our retail stores, we are working to evolve concepts to drive more profitable formats, particularly for our full-price brand house locations. Our factory house business is about driving greater productivity in store, reducing our promotional levels and leveraging the fleet to clear through excess product. While this foundational work continues to help us in our journey to be a best-in-class retailer, with the acceleration of eCommerce and tightening of wholesale, this truly becomes an omnichannel conversation. Whether it's drop ship, endless aisle or RFID, we believe executing a powerful omnichannel strategy will enable us to create a more seamless and connected shopping experience across all consumer touch points. 
And finally, being in a position, both strategically and operationally, to pursue this channel-agnostic approach is something that we believe will serve as a key unlock to strengthening our brand ecosystem wherever and whenever consumers choose to engage Under Armour. Bringing all these strategies together leads us to our last priority, maintaining our discipline around profitability to drive sustainable shareholder value over the long term. From operating model refinements, our innovation pipeline and brand-elevating strategies to our tighter inventory management and a rebased cost structure, it's well understood across the enterprise what we must do as we work to deliver greater leverage and sustainable profitable growth over the long term. 
So to wrap up, I am proud of what Under Armour has accomplished in the last year, particularly our ability to efficiently navigate an incredible amount of marketplace variability while continuing to advance our transformation. Building on this demonstrated proficiency, as we move into 2021 amid uncertainty that has carried over from last year, I am confident about our ability to meet near-term challenges, accomplish our goals, and balance them with our long-term objectives. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave."
8740684,702441825,2202263,"Under Armour, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrick. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we delivered stronger-than-expected results, a performance to be proud of, especially during a global business environment that faced significant macro and micro challenges. Over the past few",1956,"Thanks, Patrick. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we delivered stronger-than-expected results, a performance to be proud of, especially during a global business environment that faced significant macro and micro challenges. 
Over the past few years, the work we've accomplished created the space and optionality necessary to work through these challenging conditions. From industry-leading product innovations to connecting consumers through fantastic brand stories and improved shopping experiences to deliver decisions to ensure liquidity, along with executing the divestiture of MyFitnessPal, I'm pleased with the way we closed out 2020. 
With that said, let's dive into our fourth quarter results starting with revenue, which was down 3% to $1.4 billion compared to the prior year. This was better than we had expected due to higher-than-anticipated demand across our wholesale and DTC businesses. 
From a channel perspective, our wholesale revenue was down 12%. Keep in mind, about $130 million in orders shifted out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter of 2021 due to timing impacts from COVID-19 related to customer order flow and changes in supply chain timing that we discussed on our last call. Relative to our plan, we experienced stronger sell-through and higher demand from our customers. 
Our direct-to-consumer business increased 11% driven by 25% growth in our eCommerce business. Relative to our plan, we experienced better-than-expected traffic trends in our retail business. 
Our licensing business was down 12% driven primarily by lapping onetime settlements in the prior year with 2 of our North American partners and lower minimum royalty payments. This result was better than expected driven primarily by our Japanese partner. 
By product type, apparel revenue was down 4% driven by declines in our train and team sports categories. Footwear was down 7% mainly driven by declines in our team sports category. And finally, our accessories business was up 32%, with all of the growth being driven by SPORTSMASK. 
From a regional and segment perspective, fourth quarter revenue in North America was down 6%, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 timing impacts I previously mentioned as well as reduced off-price sales. These headwinds were partially offset by strength in eCommerce within our DTC business in the quarter. 
In EMEA, revenue was down 11%, also negatively impacted by COVID-19 timing impacts, partially offset by solid growth within our DTC business, primarily due to eCommerce. Revenue in Asia-Pacific was up 26% driven by growth across all channels, partially offset by timing impacts from COVID-19. In Latin America, revenue was up 2% driven by DTC growth, which included strength in our eCommerce business, partially offset by impacts from COVID-19. 
And finally, our Connected Fitness business was down 5% due to the sale of the MyFitnessPal platform in the quarter, which was completed in mid-December. It is important to note that following this sale, we will no longer be reporting the Connected Fitness segment. Starting with the first quarter of 2021, the remaining MapMy business will be consolidated within our Corporate Other segment. 
Fourth quarter gross margin increased 210 basis points to 49.4%, including a $12 million impact related to restructuring efforts. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted gross margin increased 300 basis points to 50.3% driven by approximately 150 basis points of positive channel mix benefiting from lower year-over-year distributor and off-price sales, which carry a lower gross margin and a heavier mix towards DTC, which included strong eCommerce growth. Additional year-over-year increases included 90 basis points of supply chain benefits primarily driven by product costing improvements and 30 basis points of positive regional mix driven by APAC growth in the quarter. 
Relative to our previous expectations for gross margin in the fourth quarter, our results were significantly better than expected as we experienced higher-than-anticipated demand, which allowed us to sell in and sell through with considerably less discounting and markdowns than we had initially anticipated. 
SG&A expense decreased 4% to $586 million due to our restructuring efforts and tighter spend management. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $52 million of restructuring charges and certain impairments related to long-lived assets. As a reminder, we expect to incur total estimated pretax restructuring and related charges under this plan in the range of $550 million to $600 million. 
For the full year, we realized $473 million in restructuring and related impairment charges and $141 million from impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill. We expect to complete our restructuring charges within the first half of 2021 with most of the remaining charges coming in the first quarter. 
Our fourth quarter operating income was $56 million. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted operating income was $120 million. After tax, we realized net income of $184 million or $0.40 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, as well as the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes and the gain in deal-related costs associated with the sale of MyFitnessPal, our adjusted net income was $55 million or $0.12 of adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter. 
From a balance sheet perspective, I am pleased to report we ended the fourth quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, inclusive of $199 million related to the sale of MyFitnessPal. We also had no borrowings outstanding under our $1.1 billion revolver. And finally, inventory for the fourth quarter was $896 million, relatively unchanged compared to the prior year. 
Concerning our 2021 outlook, while recent consumer trends have been more positive than we anticipated, we remain cautious in planning our business given the continued uncertainties with respect to demand and the overall marketplace due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the outlook we are providing today is predicated on our business continuing in the near term with the same general macros that we've seen most recently followed by moderate improvements within the greater retail landscape as the year progresses, meaning we're assuming no major retail or other business shutdowns or other new significant adverse economic impacts due to COVID-19. That said, I will provide some high-level color on how we are thinking about our business for 2021. 
Relative to revenue, we expect a high single-digit rate increase for the full year compared to 2020, reflecting a high single-digit increase in North America and a high-teens growth rate in our international business. 
Looking at 2021, some of the things included within our outlook that we anticipate will serve as revenue headwinds include the following. First would be the absence of MyFitnessPal. Second, to Patrick's earlier point about maintaining our current supply and demand planning and inventory management discipline, we plan to constrain orders against expected demand. Third, as previously discussed, we will begin to exit certain undifferentiated wholesale distribution, primarily in North America, starting in the back half of 2021 with a plan to close about 2,000 to 3,000 wholesale partner doors, thereby expecting to land closer to 10,000 doors by the end of 2022. And finally, we're making several changes to our operating model in Latin America, including shifting certain countries to strategic distributorship models, which will negatively impact revenue but should help improve operating margins. 
From a channel perspective, within wholesale, it's important to keep in mind that we are just now finalizing our third quarter bookings and have only recently started to take orders for the fourth quarter. Therefore, we have limited visibility into the back half of the year. And as Patrick mentioned, we will look to manage our inventory tightly, and in some instances, constrain demand to continue to return to more premium revenue growth. All of this means we are taking a prudent approach to forecasting and managing our business this year. 
From a DTC perspective, we expect retail to outpace eCommerce's growth as our digital business is up against strong comps from 2020. For gross margin on a GAAP basis, we expect the full year rate to be up slightly against our 2020 adjusted gross margin of 48.6%, with benefits from pricing and supply chain efficiency being largely offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal, which was a high gross margin business. 
From an SG&A perspective, as Patrick detailed, we believe we have appropriately rebased our cost structure. And we believe the improved discipline and processes we currently have in place have instilled a more return-based approach to our investments that should drive greater prioritization into the areas that deliver the highest return and support our long-term growth opportunities. 
However, critical areas like DTC, international and marketing will require us to continue investments to support our growth expectations. Therefore, we are planning on slight SG&A growth for the year. 
With all of that considered, we expect reported operating income to reach approximately $5 million to $25 million and adjusted operating income to be approximately $130 million to $150 million, which will take us to a reported diluted loss per share of about $0.18 to $0.20 or adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.12 to $0.14. 
Now to provide a little bit more color on the first quarter of 2021. We are currently planning for first quarter revenue to be up approximately 20%. This expectation includes about $130 million of orders that shifted out of the fourth quarter of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021 due to timing impacts from COVID-19 related to customer order flow and changes in supply chain timing that we discussed earlier. 
Next, we expect gross margin to be up about 180 to 200 basis points compared to the prior year driven primarily by pricing benefits related to lower promotions, primarily in DTC compared to the prior year, and continued supply chain benefits related to product costing improvements. We expect these benefits will be partially offset by the absence of MyFitnessPal. 
Bringing this to the bottom line, we expect a first quarter operating loss of approximately $55 million to $70 million. Excluding planned restructuring impacts, we expect adjusted operating income to be approximately $30 million to $35 million. Excluding restructuring, we expect about $0.03 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
And finally, before moving to Q&A, we also announced this morning our plan to change Under Armour's fiscal year-end from December 31 to March 31 of each year. This will become effective on April 1, 2022. Based on our revenue being more heavily weighted in the second half of the calendar year, we believe this change, namely putting those 2 quarters in the middle of our new fiscal year, will provide us with greater visibility and subsequent forecast accuracy as it relates to strategic business decisions and providing our initial annual outlook. 
Mechanically, nothing changes this year for fiscal 2021. Next year, in 2022, we will have a 3-month or 1 quarter transition period that runs January 1 through March 31, which we'd expect to report in May like our current first quarter cadence. Following that transition period, our fiscal 2023 will begin April 1, 2022, and run through March 31, 2023. Accordingly, there will be no full year fiscal 2022 reporting. 
In closing, we have made great progress against our transformational journey, which afforded us increased agility and flexibility to navigate through what was undoubtedly an unprecedented year. We've reengineered our go-to-market, optimized our product and innovation engines and focused on our well-defined target consumer. Additionally, the continued actions we took this year to protect and strengthen our balance sheet drove significant improvements in our ability to generate cash and protect liquidity. 
Moving forward, our approach remains appropriately cautious, given the high level of uncertainty related to COVID-19. That said, we will maintain our disciplined approach in executing our strategies and continue to put Under Armour in the best position possible to achieve sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. 
With that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

And our cost structure is built for a larger business, and it will take driving greater revenue to return to that kind of double-digit operating margins. But as we drive higher revenue in areas like marketing, IT and retail, we should be able to leverage the cost of these areas more efficiently and win -- kind of win going forward from a productivity perspective. 
As we mentioned, there are some key areas we've got to keep investing in like DTC, international and marketing. But the discipline and processes that we now have in place are going to help us kind of better manage our SG&A growth relative to revenue and making sure that we're continuing to leverage going forward. 
I would say that based on the timing of execution of our restructuring activities 2020 and into early '21, we talked about a benefit of about $40 million to $60 million on operating income in 2020. You can assume that, that benefit is going to at least double when you think about what's in the 2021 numbers. But again, we are reinvesting some of that, especially in the marketing front. 
And so this year, we're not giving an exact percentage of marketing, but we are going to stay at a pretty healthy investment area as a percentage of our revenue. I would say it might not be as high as in 2020, but it's probably going to be a higher percentage than it was potentially in '19 or prior as we continue to want to invest and really grow the brand and keep that momentum going. So that's what we're seeing, and we look forward to seeing that continued leverage as we drive into '22 as well."

I mean, a couple of things I would say is that from a people cost perspective, we are definitely rebased now, and that gives us a lot more flexibility going forward. In addition, from a marketing perspective, we've really gone deep there relative to trying to alleviate and get out of some of the longer-term contracts that we weren't receiving much of a benefit there. And that allows us to have kind of a bigger war chest to be nimble on the marketing front going forward and making sure we're deploying that marketing in the areas of highest return based on the roaming work that we've been doing. 
Some other areas that have really benefited, like even depreciation is now becoming more of a tailwind for us, whereas it used to be a headwind based on the high CapEx levels back in '16, '17, '18. But our investment committee has worked diligently to really prioritize our CapEx spending, and now we're seeing depreciation slowing down considerably, which has been nice as well. So there's a lot of other areas that we've been addressing around T&E and other areas of spend, but we are instilling the right discipline now, benchmarking metrics to make sure that we're investing in the right places going forward and keeping it under control and leveraging as we go into '22."

As it relates to the efforts that we're doing overall to what we call constrained demand and as part of that, the pullback that we're doing in some undifferentiated doors in North America, that really gets underway in 2021 and predominantly in the back half of the year as we've been wanting to be fair to the customers and allow them to adjust to our actions. So that will be a 2- to 3-year journey for us, where we get out of 2,000 to 3,000 doors, and that's starting in the back half of this year. And what we'll be left with when we're through that journey is really what we believe are more appropriate doors for us with doors that we feel are going to wins in other ways -- win with the winners kind of mentality there. And where we also feel that we can earn shelf space back. So that's really important for us. 
It's also an important for our segmentation and our merchandising strategy going forward. So those things will all help to make sure that we're building toward a more premium position. 
And in combination with that, I spoke about it in my script in terms of the effort that we're putting into our own direct to consumer as well and becoming a better eCommerce and full price brick-and-mortar as well as an enhanced positioning in our outlet going forward here in North America. All of that together is going to elevate the brand. And we're already seeing some of that happen to some respect in terms of what we talked about as it relates to more full-price selling. But it's a journey. And it happens over time, step by step. And we initiated this already last year, and we'll continue to do so as we go into the future."

I mean, in Q4, a big part of it was channel mix because we had lower mix of business within our distributor markets and also lower percentage of third-party off-price sales. But then also, we had a much higher DTC mix versus Q4 of 2019. So that area",398,"Yes. I mean, in Q4, a big part of it was channel mix because we had lower mix of business within our distributor markets and also lower percentage of third-party off-price sales. But then also, we had a much higher DTC mix versus Q4 of 2019. So that area was a big area for us with the channel mix in Q4. But then also, we continue to see some really solid supply chain benefits from a costing perspective. And we've talked about that a lot over the last year or so about all the work we've done with consolidating our vendor base, SKU rationalization, and we're seeing that really come through continually here. So excellent, excellent work from the supply chain side on that front. 
And then we also saw a little bit of benefit in Q4 relative to the region mix with the APAC growth being very strong and APAC being kind of our highest gross margin region. So all of those things were really helpful for us in Q4. It was obviously a lot better than we had given outlook for on our last call. And a lot of that was due to less promotions and discount than we expected due to the stronger sell-through, sell-in and sell-through. 
I think when you think about 2021, we would expect to be up slightly versus 2020, and that's really going to be the continued supply chain efficiencies, mainly around product costing, that we've seen a lot in 2020. And that's continuing into 2021. But then also, we would expect to see some improved margins from pricing as we continue to work on pulling back our promotions and discounting, primarily in the DTC front as we drive towards that continued premium brand-right growth. 
Those benefits in '21, though, will be largely offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal, which was a really high-margin business for us. So if you pull that out, that has a pretty dramatic offset on gross margin. And then the third-party off-price year-over-year really isn't much of a factor because we've kind of normalized that now in that 3% to 4% range mix of revenue. 
So again, it's really the -- for 2021, it's the supply chain efficiencies with product costing. It's continuing to pull back on promotions and discounting being largely offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal coming to our outlook of up slightly year-over-year."

One is that, as I mentioned, we still don't have many orders yet in hand from a timing perspective for Q4 on the wholesale side, and that's obviously a very big piece of our business. So we're being a little bit cautious from that perspective. Second, COVID is still very front and center and creating challenges around the world still at this point. 
And so I would say that as we go through the next couple of months and we get more visibility to Q4 orders and we get a better feel of whether the vaccination rollout and COVID is getting more and more in check, then we'll be in a better place to be able to reassess. But the third thing that I would say is I wouldn't necessarily say the word chase relative to Under Armour. We've talked about premium brand-right growth, and therefore, we are constraining demand a little bit. And so there may not be a lot of chasing to do if it's natural orders that are coming in, and we're putting the right discipline and constrain against those. That's one thing. 
But I don't think you're going to see Under Armour necessarily chasing within the year. And it might just be the term you used, John. So I'm not trying to pick on that, but I just want to be sensitive to our strategy and our approach this year."

In all those buckets, we will be tightening up our buys to make sure that we are managing our inventory appropriately but also to be helping us drive the brand into a more premium positioning. 
So there won't be a situation, even if it opens up, where we will go and chase apart from the inventories that we have. And that's a really important strategy for us going forward."

And I mean, that could actually give us a little bit of momentum when we think about Q1 and Q2. 
But when you think about Q3, Q4, to your point, I do want to remind us that a lot of the headwinds that we've talked about relative to driving premium brand-right growth, a lot of those have a heavier impact on the back half. Some of them are full year, like when you think about MyFitnessPal not being in the numbers for 2021, that's a full year impact. But when we think about the demand-constraint work, that's a little bit more back half as well. Especially when you think about exiting the undifferentiated retail in North America, that is clearly a back half impact, not really a front half impact. 
And then even the business model changes in Latin America, although they're not significant in size, moving out of some of those countries into distributor models, it's going to happen as we move through the year. And therefore, you'll get a more full impact of that on revenue in the back half of this year. And we're moving towards really getting to a point in Latin America where Mexico is the only remaining kind of full subsidiary business versus the other countries being more of a distributor model. So again, that will have some pressure in the back half but should help improve margins. 
And then to your point, again, we probably are being a little bit prudent and cautious here, especially with Q4 planning because we don't have visibility of the order bank yet. And then we're still keeping an eye on COVID implications. So I think we're being prudent in how we're planning and making sure that we're not getting ahead of ourselves in spending because we think revenue might be different. Right now, this is what we feel good with."

So it is about having that direct conversation with the consumer more frequently in a better way and truly understanding what they are expecting us to deliver. And if we do that well, we'll continue to make progress."

So for us, it's a holistic approach to driving those AURs up. And what we've seen, as we talked about on this call, the back half of 2020, that is the thing that we're starting to see that we're very excited about. 
What's exciting, too, is the fact that it's happening across categories. So it's not just in one place. We're seeing the rise of AURs across the business, and I think that is a sign of the brand starting to return to health. 
Now it's a journey. It's a step-by-step process. And we'll continue to make progress this year and into next year.

And I would say that on the supply chain front, you're probably in 2021, I won't give an exact number, but it's more than 50 basis points of improvement, probably less than 100 basis points of improvement. So it's in that range. But remember, that's going to be significantly offset by the MFP sale, which is a very large impact year-over-year in gross margin percentage points. 
When you think about '22 and beyond, we're not ready to get into a lot of detail there, but we do expect to see some continued product costing improvements. But you're going to start to normalize that cost base with the supply chain fairly soon. So that benefit will start to get smaller as we think about '22 and beyond. 
And then from a pricing perspective, definitely a decent benefit there as well. It's probably in a similar range to what we're anticipating on the supply chain benefit side. So hopefully, that triangulates a little bit for you."

So both are -- I would say across our bottoms and our tops for women's, it's really a very positive story for us. And we believe that's going to continue in 2021. 
And then, of course, in terms of our footwear, our new cushioning platform, UA Flow that was launched with the Curry 8 recently, which is doing really well, now comes into play in running.

Before we start, I'd be remiss not to point out what a fantastic past weekend this was for sport and for Under Armour. From Stephen Curry",2098,"Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end 2020 conference call.  
Before we start, I'd be remiss not to point out what a fantastic past weekend this was for sport and for Under Armour. From Stephen Curry scoring 57 points, the eighth time he scored more than 50 in a game, to Chase Yarn winning the NFL Defensive Rookie of the year and Joel Embiid putting up 33 to keep the 76ers in first place to Jordan Spieth posting a career-best 10 birdies in a round, there was no shortage of UA highlights this weekend. Oh, and of course, there's one more highlight or better yet, make that the seventh as a #7 for the gold quarterback, Tom Brady, as he had led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for their second-ever Super Bowl victory. 
With Tom, it's quite easy to run out of ways to describe yet again another incredible accomplishment he's added to his unparalleled career. In his 10 years as an Under Armour athlete, Tom has exemplified what perseverance, hard work and leadership can do in pursuit of excellence. On behalf of the entire Under Armour family, Tom, thank you for making us better.  
Now turning back to our results. As I reflect on my first year as CEO amid a global pandemic that has tested all of us, I'd start by underscoring just how incredibly proud I am of our team's resilience and their ability to execute at an incredibly high level against our long-term strategy. We've made significant progress on our way to becoming a stronger brand and a better run company during the past year from managing through a 3-month global retail shutdown and relaunching our North American e-commerce platform to executing a comprehensive restructuring effort and divesting the MyFitnessPal platform, our mantra, the only way is through, turned out to be even more foretelling than perhaps we had intended it to be.  
Despite an incredible amount of uncertainty in 2020, we stayed the course by harnessing the strength of our rearchitected go-to-market engine to deliver performance-based products and experiences along with targeted data-driven storytelling, Under Armour showed up stronger and more holistically as a brand than in years past.  
From an operations perspective, increasingly more effective supply and demand planning, along with our best-in-class distribution network, enabled us to quickly adapt to the needs of our customers and consumers with greater precision and efficiency, getting the right product to the right place at the right time. As we closed out 2020, our efforts over the past couple of years to pursue a clearly defined target consumer, rebase our cost structure and fundamentally change the way we work is beginning to yield results, empowered by a clear identity of who we are, a leading athletic performance brand, our foundation is solid, our discipline tested and proven and the opportunity before us is robust.  
As I look ahead, I'm energized by our transformation. I'm confident that our operating model is strengthening our ability to drive sustainable returns to our shareholders over the long term, yet we remain confronted with uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, some parts of our business have fundamentally changed, including new ways of working and interacting with our consumers, customers and teammates.  
How these changes ultimately play out over the next few years remains to be seen. Still, I'm confident that we are significantly better equipped to navigate through the changes, given our improved levels of agility and optionality.  
The last year has also brought about meaningful changes in consumer behavior and related marketplace demand impacts. In this respect, we remain focused on controlling what we can while staying prudent. This means being patient and measured in how we manage our business and conscious about where we are within our journey while maintaining the same level of discipline that got us here.  
To this effect, we will continue to constrain demand in 2021, a decision that, as discussed in previous calls, may impact our ability to drive top line volume in the near term. However, whether through proactive wholesale door-reduction efforts in North America or ordering slightly less product against future demand based on the brand and margin benefits that we realized in 2020, we are confident that this focus will help elevate our premium positioning with consumers and, therefore, driving better profitability.  
Carrying forward into 2021, there are 4 areas of focus that we laid out on our last call. First is continuing to strengthen the brand through increased engagement and consideration with the focused performer. Second is continuous improvement within our operating model to drive even greater efficiency across all end-to-end processes. Third is elevating a D2C-focused approach to deepen and amplify our most intimate connection with Under Armour's consumers. And finally, as we get back to profitable growth in 2021, making sure our discipline stays aligned with driving shareholder value over the long term.  
Starting with brand strength and engagement. About a year ago, we launched a powerful global Under Armour voice to drive increased consideration with our target consumer, the focused performer, empowered by enhanced tools and real-time metrics as consumer behavior shifted towards e-commerce as well as working out from home, including a large shift towards running, we too altered course. From the only way is through to through this together and other variations along the way, we refocused our efforts more surgically to drive greater returns at an exceedingly dynamic environment. And while these efforts, of course, take time to manifest into sea change, exiting a year like 2020 with increased consideration, conversion and higher selling prices in many parts of our business gives us greater confidence in our strategy and execution for the year ahead.  
Successful storytelling, of course, needs to partner with great products. In 2020, we stuck to our playbook and leaned heavier into brand and product marketing to support successful introductions like our Project Rock collection, Meridian Pant, Infinity Bra, UA SPORTSMASK and in footwear, the HOVR Machina, Phantom 2 and the Breakthru.  
One highlight we're especially encouraged by is the continued momentum in our women's business, specifically bras and bottoms and broad-based interest across our run category, led by our innovation-driven HOVR franchise. Another highlight is the launch of the Curry brand in December. As a purpose-led collaboration powered by Under Armour, we're excited to partner with Stephen to deliver performance products that, along with focused partnerships, will help fund youth sports in under-resourced communities through equitable access and safe places to play.  
As a pinnacle expression of this effort, we launched the Curry 8 basketball shoe, the first product to feature UA Flow. As the second footwear cushioning technology released under our reengineered go-to-market, Flow's proprietary nonrubber outsole has manifested into our most obedient and highest traction footwear yet.  
Up next, UA Flow is set to launch in one of our largest long-term growth opportunities: running. Building on the success and momentum of HOVR, the UA Flow running platform will help us accomplish 2 things. As an innovation, we believe this product's performance attributes, including its unique traction, ride and energy return structure, will help drive even more significant consideration and authenticity with core runners. And second, as our most pinnacle running footwear offering, it will broaden our ability to segment and help differentiate our assortment, thereby creating opportunities for shelf space expansion within running specialty and key wholesale accounts.  
Switching gears to our second area of focus is our operating model evolution. Throughout 2020, we work to rebase our cost structure to ensure we are positioned from a strategic, operational and financial perspective with an appropriate foundation and agility to scale with future growth. And within our comprehensive restructuring plan, we believe our central purpose continues to put us in a position to return to double-digit operating margin over the long term.  
In this spirit, we've been asked many times if we've reached an optimal cost structure for Under Armour or where our general breakeven ratio lies. At $2.2 billion of SG&A in 2020, our cost structure is not meant to support the $4.5 billion revenue that we realized last year, but instead, a larger top line business where we can begin to leverage some of the foundational investments necessary for our growth expectations.  
As laid out in this morning's press release and details that Dave will discuss later, we plan to return to profitability in 2021. Therefore, our breakeven is somewhere around the $4.7 billion mark.  
With our cost structure now appropriately rebased, it's important to understand a few elements of how we're thinking about SG&A expenses and investments moving forward. When considering our restructuring efforts and how they've impacted or will continue to affect our overall cost structure, it's essential to remember that most of these efforts have been related to future cost avoidance versus current cost reductions.  
That said, we had realized underlying SG&A benefits in certain areas. However, it's not as simple as cutting cost to gain leverage. As we mentioned early within our restructuring efforts, our main objective was to unburden ourselves of decisions and commitments made when we expected to be a much larger company than we are now. Within those scenarios, there was also an expected level of productivity that was never realized.  
As a business in pursuit of brand-right growth, we will continue to invest in driving that growth. And for us specifically, that means marketing, IT and elevating our international and D2C footprints. More simply put, while the absolute SG&A dollars may not change much in the near term, I'd underscore that productivity and return on the investments that we are making are appropriately greater than just a few years ago. And should market factors impact our growth track in the near term, we're now also capable of flexing and managing our costs with greater discipline and optionality to maintain a more consistent profitability trajectory.  
These factors, along with improved visibility and tighter alignment of our demand and supply planning functions, have afforded us greater flexibility with our customers and our ability to service higher-than-planned demand. This is especially evident in our year-end inventory position, which was at the same level that we ended 2019. In 2021, we plan to manage this even more tightly, helping us drive fuller price selling across all distribution points while keeping an eye on increasing our productivity and therefore, turns.  
Moving to our third priority, elevating a D2C-focused approach, and the pandemic has certainly magnified and accelerated digital adoption rates worldwide. With e-commerce up 40% in 2020 and representing nearly half of our total D2C business for the full year, we are hyper-focused on better understanding the consumer journey and building greater personalization capabilities to unlock even deeper connections with athletes.  
In our retail stores, we are working to evolve concepts to drive more profitable formats, particularly for our full-price brand house locations. Our factory house business is about driving greater productivity in store, reducing our promotional levels and leveraging the fleet to clear through excess product. While this foundational work continues to help us in our journey to be a best-in-class retailer, with the acceleration of e-commerce and tightening of wholesale, this truly becomes an omnichannel conversation. Whether it's drop ship, endless aisle or RFID, we believe executing a powerful omnichannel strategy will enable us to create a more seamless and connected shopping experience across all consumer touch points.  
And finally, being in a position, both strategically and operationally, to pursue this channel-agnostic approach is something that we believe will serve as a key unlock to strengthening our brand ecosystem wherever and whenever consumers choose to engage Under Armour. Bringing all these strategies together leads us to our last priority, maintaining our discipline around profitability to drive sustainable shareholder value over the long term. From operating model refinements, our innovation pipeline and brand-elevating strategies to our tighter inventory management and a rebased cost structure, it's well understood across the enterprise what we must do as we work to deliver greater leverage and sustainable profitable growth over the long term.  
So to wrap up, I am proud of what Under Armour has accomplished in the last year, particularly our ability to efficiently navigate an incredible amount of marketplace variability while continuing to advance our transformation. Building on this demonstrated proficiency, as we move into 2021 amid uncertainty that has carried over from last year, I am confident about our ability to meet near-term challenges, accomplish our goals, and balance them with our long-term objectives.  
And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave."
8740684,702441825,2202487,"Under Armour, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrik. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we delivered stronger-than-expected results, a performance to be proud of, especially during a global business environment that faced significant macro and micro challenges.  Over the past few",1957,"Thanks, Patrik. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we delivered stronger-than-expected results, a performance to be proud of, especially during a global business environment that faced significant macro and micro challenges.  
Over the past few years, the work we've accomplished created the space and optionality necessary to work through these challenging conditions. From industry-leading product innovations to connecting consumers through fantastic brand stories and improved shopping experiences to deliver decisions to ensure liquidity, along with executing the divestiture of MyFitnessPal, I'm pleased with the way we closed out 2020.  
With that said, let's dive into our fourth quarter results starting with revenue, which was down 3% to $1.4 billion compared to the prior year. This was better than we had expected due to higher-than-anticipated demand across our wholesale and DTC businesses. 
From a channel perspective, our wholesale revenue was down 12%. Keep in mind, about $130 million in orders shifted out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter of 2021 due to timing impacts from COVID-19 related to customer order flow and changes in supply chain timing that we discussed on our last call. Relative to our plan, we experienced stronger sell-through and higher demand from our customers.  
Our direct-to-consumer business increased 11% driven by 25% growth in our e-commerce business. Relative to our plan, we experienced better-than-expected traffic trends in our retail business.  
Our licensing business was down 12% driven primarily by lapping onetime settlements in the prior year with 2 of our North American partners and lower minimum royalty payments. This result was better than expected driven primarily by our Japanese partner.  
By product type, apparel revenue was down 4% driven by declines in our train and team sports categories. Footwear was down 7% mainly driven by declines in our team sports category. And finally, our accessories business was up 32%, with all of the growth being driven by SPORTSMASK.  
From a regional and segment perspective, fourth quarter revenue in North America was down 6%, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 timing impacts, I previously mentioned as well as reduced off-price sales. These headwinds were partially offset by strength in e-commerce within our DTC business in the quarter.  
In EMEA, revenue was down 11%, also negatively impacted by COVID-19 timing impacts, partially offset by solid growth within our DTC business, primarily due to e-commerce. Revenue in Asia Pacific was up 26% driven by growth across all channels, partially offset by timing impacts from COVID-19. In Latin America, revenue was up 2% driven by DTC growth, which included strength in our e-commerce business, partially offset by impacts from COVID-19.  
And finally, our Connected Fitness business was down 5% due to the sale of the MyFitnessPal platform in the quarter, which was completed in mid-December. It is important to note that following this sale, we will no longer be reporting the Connected Fitness segment. Starting with the first quarter of 2021, the remaining MapMy business will be consolidated within our Corporate Other segment. 
Fourth quarter gross margin increased 210 basis points to 49.4%, including a $12 million impact related to restructuring efforts. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted gross margin increased 300 basis points to 50.3% driven by approximately 150 basis points of positive channel mix benefiting from lower year-over-year distributor and off-price sales, which carry a lower gross margin and a heavier mix towards DTC, which included strong e-commerce growth. Additional year-over-year increases included 90 basis points of supply chain benefits primarily driven by product costing improvements and 30 basis points of positive regional mix driven by APAC growth in the quarter.  
Relative to our previous expectations for gross margin in the fourth quarter, our results were significantly better than expected as we experienced higher-than-anticipated demand, which allowed us to sell in and sell through with considerably less discounting and markdowns than we had initially anticipated.  
SG&A expense decreased 4% to $586 million due to our restructuring efforts and tighter spend management. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $52 million of restructuring charges and certain impairments related to long-lived assets. As a reminder, we expect to incur total estimated pretax restructuring and related charges under this plan in the range of $550 million to $600 million.  
For the full year, we realized $473 million in restructuring and related impairment charges and $141 million from impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill. We expect to complete our restructuring charges within the first half of 2021 with most of the remaining charges coming in the first quarter.  
Our fourth quarter operating income was $56 million. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted operating income was $120 million. After tax, we realized net income of $184 million or $0.40 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, as well as the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes and the gain in deal-related costs associated with the sale of MyFitnessPal, our adjusted net income was $55 million or $0.12 of adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter.  
From a balance sheet perspective, I am pleased to report we ended the fourth quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, inclusive of $199 million related to the sale of MyFitnessPal. We also had no borrowings outstanding under our $1.1 billion revolver. And finally, inventory for the fourth quarter was $896 million, relatively unchanged compared to the prior year.  
Concerning our 2021 outlook, while recent consumer trends have been more positive than we anticipated, we remain cautious in planning our business given the continued uncertainties with respect to demand and the overall marketplace due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the outlook we are providing today is predicated on our business continuing in the near term with the same general macros that we've seen most recently followed by moderate improvements within the greater retail landscape as the year progresses, meaning we're assuming no major retail or other business shutdowns or other new significant adverse economic impacts due to COVID-19. That said, I will provide some high-level color on how we are thinking about our business for 2021.  
Relative to revenue, we expect a high single-digit rate increase for the full year compared to 2020, reflecting a high single-digit increase in North America and a high-teens growth rate in our international business.  
Looking at 2021, some of the things included within our outlook that we anticipate will serve as revenue headwinds include the following. First would be the absence of MyFitnessPal. Second, to Patrick's earlier point about maintaining our current supply and demand planning and inventory management discipline, we plan to constrain orders against expected demand. Third, as previously discussed, we will begin to exit certain undifferentiated wholesale distribution, primarily in North America, starting in the back half of 2021 with a plan to close about 2,000 to 3,000 wholesale partner doors, thereby expecting to win closer to 10,000 doors by the end of 2022. And finally, we're making several changes to our operating model in Latin America, including shifting certain countries to strategic distributorship models, which will negatively impact revenue but should help improve operating margins.  
From a channel perspective, within wholesale, it's important to keep in mind that we are just now finalizing our third quarter bookings and have only recently started to take orders for the fourth quarter. Therefore, we have limited visibility into the back half of the year. And as Patrik mentioned, we will look to manage our inventory tightly, and in some instances, constrain demand continue to return to more premium revenue growth. All of this means we are taking a prudent approach to forecasting and managing our business this year.  
From a DTC perspective, we expect retail to outpace e-commerce's growth as our digital business is up against strong comps from 2020. For gross margin on a GAAP basis, we expect the full year rate to be up slightly against our 2020 adjusted gross margin of 48.6%, with benefits from pricing and supply chain efficiency being largely offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal, which was a high gross margin business.  
From an SG&A perspective, as Patrik detailed, we believe we have appropriately rebased our cost structure. And we believe the improved discipline and processes we currently have in place have instilled a more return-based approach to our investments that should drive greater prioritization into the areas that deliver the highest return and support our long-term growth opportunities.  
However, critical areas like DTC, international and marketing will require us to continue investments to support our growth expectations. Therefore, we are planning on slight SG&A growth for the year.  
With all of that considered, we expect reported operating income to reach approximately $5 million to $25 million and adjusted operating income to be approximately $130 million to $150 million, which will take us to a reported diluted loss per share of about $0.18 to $0.20 or adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.12 to $0.14.  
Now to provide a little bit more color on the first quarter of 2021. We are currently planning for first quarter revenue to be up approximately 20%. This expectation includes about $130 million of orders that shifted out of the fourth quarter of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021 due to timing impacts from COVID-19 related to customer order flow and changes in supply chain timing that we discussed earlier.  
Next, we expect gross margin to be up about 180 to 200 basis points compared to the prior year driven primarily by pricing benefits related to lower promotions, primarily in DTC compared to the prior year, and continued supply chain benefits related to product costing improvements. We expect these benefits will be partially offset by the absence of MyFitnessPal.  
Bringing this to the bottom line, we expect a first quarter operating loss of approximately $55 million to $70 million. Excluding planned restructuring impacts, we expect adjusted operating income to be approximately $30 million to $35 million. Excluding restructuring, we expect about $0.03 of adjusted diluted earnings per share.  
And finally, before moving to Q&A, we also announced this morning our plan to change Under Armour's fiscal year end from December 31 to March 31 of each year. This will become effective on April 1, 2022. Based on our revenue being more heavily weighted in the second half of the calendar year, we believe this change, namely putting those 2 quarters in the middle of our new fiscal year, will provide us with greater visibility and subsequent forecast accuracy as it relates to strategic business decisions and providing our initial annual outlook.  
Mechanically, nothing changes this year for fiscal 2021. Next year, in 2022, we will have a 3-month or 1 quarter transition period that runs January 1 through March 31, which we'd expect to report in May like our current first quarter cadence. Following that transition period, our fiscal 2023 will begin April 1, 2022, and run through March 31, 2023. Accordingly, there will be no full year fiscal 2022 reporting. 
In closing, we have made great progress against our transformational journey, which afforded us increased agility and flexibility to navigate through what was undoubtedly an unprecedented year. We've reengineered our go-to-market, optimized our product and innovation engines and focused on our well-defined target consumer. Additionally, the continued actions we took this year to protect and strengthen our balance sheet, drove significant improvements in our ability to generate cash and protect liquidity.  
Moving forward, our approach remains appropriately cautious, given the high level of uncertainty related to COVID-19. That said, we will maintain our disciplined approach in executing our strategies and continue to put Under Armour in the best position possible to achieve sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.  
With that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

And our cost structure is built for a larger business, and it will take driving greater revenue to return to that kind of double-digit operating margins. But as we drive higher revenue in areas like marketing, IT and retail, we should be able to leverage the cost of these areas more efficiently and win -- kind of win going forward from a productivity perspective.  
As we mentioned, there are some key areas we've got to keep investing in like DTC, international and marketing. But the discipline and processes that we now have in place are going to help us kind of better manage our SG&A growth relative to revenue and making sure that we're continuing to leverage going forward. 
I would say that based on the timing of execution of our restructuring activities 2020 and into early '21, we talked about a benefit of about $40 million to $60 million on operating income in 2020. You can assume that, that benefit is going to at least double when you think about what's in the 2021 numbers. But again, we are reinvesting some of that, especially in the marketing front. 
And so this year, we're not giving an exact percentage of marketing, but we are going to stay at a pretty healthy investment area as a percentage of our revenue. I would say it might not be as high as in 2020, but it's probably going to be a higher percentage than it was potentially in '19 or prior as we continue to want to invest and really grow the brand and keep that momentum going. So that's what we're seeing, and we look forward to seeing that continued leverage as we drive into '22 as well."

I mean, a couple of things I would say is that from a people cost perspective, we are definitely rebased now, and that gives us a lot more flexibility going forward. In addition, from a marketing perspective, we've really gone deep there relative to trying to alleviate and get out of some of the longer-term contracts that we weren't receiving much of the benefit there. And that allows us to have kind of a bigger war chest to be nimble on a marketing front going forward and making sure we're deploying that marketing in the areas of highest return based on the roaming work that we've been doing. 
Some other areas that have really benefited, like even depreciation is now becoming more of a tailwind for us, whereas it used to be a headwind based on the high CapEx levels back in '16, '17, '18. But our investment committee has worked diligently to really prioritize our CapEx spending, and now we're seeing depreciation slowing down considerably, which has been nice as well. 
So there's a lot of other areas that we've been addressing around T&E and other areas of spend, but we are instilling the right discipline now, benchmarking metrics to make sure that we're investing in the right places going forward and keeping it under control and leveraging as we go into '22."

As it relates to the efforts that we're doing overall to what we call constrained demand and as part of that, the pullback that we're doing in some undifferentiated doors in North America, that really gets underway in 2021 and predominantly in the back half of the year as we've been wanting to be fair to the customers and allow them to adjust to our actions. So that will be a 2- to 3-year journey for us, where we get out of 2,000 to 3,000 doors, and that's starting in the back half of this year. And what we'll be left with when we're through that journey is really what we believe are more appropriate doors for us with doors that we feel are going to wins in other ways -- win with the winners kind of mentality there. And where we also feel that we can earn shelf space back. So that's really important for us. 
It's also an important for our segmentation and our merchandising strategy going forward. So those things will all help to make sure that we're building toward a more premium position. 
And in combination with that, I spoke about it in my script in terms of the effort that we're putting into our own direct-to-consumer as well and becoming a better e-commerce and full price brick-and-mortar as well as an enhanced positioning in our outlet going forward here in North America. All of that together is going to elevate the brand. And we're already seeing some of that happen to some respect in terms of what we talked about as it relates to more full-price selling. But it's a journey. And it happens over time, step by step. And we initiated this already last year, and we'll continue to do so as we go into the future."

I mean, in Q4, a big part of it was channel mix because we had lower mix of business within our distributor markets and also lower percentage of third-party off-price sales. But then also, we had a much higher DTC mix versus Q4 of 2019. So that area",398,"Yes. I mean, in Q4, a big part of it was channel mix because we had lower mix of business within our distributor markets and also lower percentage of third-party off-price sales. But then also, we had a much higher DTC mix versus Q4 of 2019. So that area was a big area for us with the channel mix in Q4. But then also, we continue to see some really solid supply chain benefits from a costing perspective. And we've talked about that a lot over the last year or so about all the work we've done with consolidating our vendor base, SKU rationalization, and we're seeing that really come through continually here. So excellent, excellent work from the supply chain side on that front. 
And then we also saw a little bit of benefit in Q4 relative to the region mix with the APAC growth being very strong and APAC being kind of our highest gross margin region. So all those things were really helpful for us in Q4. It was obviously a lot better than we had given outlook for on our last call. And a lot of that was due to less promotions and discount than we expected due to the stronger sell-through -- sell-in and sell-through. 
I think when you think about 2021, we would expect to be up slightly versus 2020, and that's really going to be the continued supply chain efficiencies, mainly around product costing, that we've seen a lot in 2020. And that's continuing into 2021. But then also, we would expect to see some improved margins from pricing as we continue to work on pulling back our promotions and discounting, primarily in the DTC front as we drive towards that continued premium brand-right growth. 
Those benefits in '21, though, will be largely offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal, which was a really high-margin business for us. So if you pull that out, that has a pretty dramatic offset on gross margin. And then the third-party off-price year-over-year really isn't much of a factor because we've kind of normalized that now in that 3% to 4% range mix of revenue. 
So again, it's really the -- for 2021, it's the supply chain efficiencies with product costing. It's continuing to pull back on promotions and discounting being largely offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal coming to our outlook of up slightly year-over-year."

And so I would say that as we go through the next couple of months and we get more visibility to Q4 orders and we get a better feel of whether the vaccination rollout and COVID is getting more and more in check, then we'll be in a better place to be able to reassess. But the third thing that I would say is I wouldn't necessarily say the word chase relative to Under Armour. We've talked about premium brand-right growth, and therefore, we are constraining demand a little bit. And so there may not be a lot of chasing to do if it's natural orders that are coming in, and we're putting the right discipline and constrain against those. That's one thing. 
But I don't think you're going to see Under Armour necessarily chasing within the year. And it might just be the term you used, John. So I'm not trying to pick on that, but I just want to be sensitive to our strategy and our approach this year."

So there won't be a situation, even if it opens up, where we will go and chase apart from the inventories that we have. And that's a really important strategy for us going forward."

When we look at this year, that's actually one area where we are enthusiastic in terms of 2 things. One is our innovation pipeline. We're going to be coming out with some awesome cleated product for both baseball, football and soccer here in this year that we're really, really excited about. So that's a big deal for us.

And I think it sounds like you're saying you're trying to be conservative or be cautious given the order patterns haven't started effectively yet for the back half. But can you kind of give some sense of where the inventory levels are with your various wholesale accounts? 
Because it appears to me that they seem to be very, very lean. So if there's an event where the consumer feels a little bit stronger and your product is starting to resonate a little bit better, the inventory kind of compare with these accounts for the back half is pretty, I guess, easy or compelling such that you could probably see some growth there. So just curious on how you think about that."

And I mean, that could actually give us a little bit of momentum when we think about Q1 and Q2. 
But when you think about Q3, Q4, to your point, I do want to remind us that a lot of the headwinds that we've talked about relative to driving premium brand-right growth, a lot of those have a heavier impact on the back half. Some of them are full year, like when you think about MyFitnessPal not being in the numbers for 2021, that's a full year impact. But when we think about the demand-constraint work, that's a little bit more back half as well. Especially when you think about exiting the undifferentiated retail in North America, that is clearly a back half impact, not really a front half impact. 
And then even the business model changes in Latin America, although they're not significant in size, moving out of some of those countries into distributor models, it's going to happen as we move through the year. And therefore, you'll get a more full impact of that on revenue in the back half of this year. And we're moving towards really getting to a point in Latin America where Mexico is the only remaining kind of full subsidiary business versus the other countries being more of a distributor model. So again, that will have some pressure in the back half but should help improve margins. 
And then to your point, again, we probably are being a little bit prudent and cautious here, especially with Q4 planning because we don't have visibility of the order bank yet. And then we're still keeping an eye on COVID implications. So I think we're being prudent in how we're planning and making sure that we're not getting ahead of ourselves in spending because we think revenue might be different. Right now, this is what we feel good with."

Having said that, there are certain areas that we are investing a little bit more heavily into, things like run, in our run category, our footwear category, our women's category. Those are areas where we are being a little bit more liberal with increasing SKUs. But we're not doing it without the expectation of productivity. 
And I feel that our -- the way that we think about our SKUs now building through the year is the right mix between initiatives that drive brand and initiatives as it relates to product that drive volume and ultimately also margins.

And I would say that on the supply chain front, you're probably in 2021, I won't give an exact number, but it's more than 50 basis points of improvement, probably less than 100 basis points of improvement. So it's in that range. But remember, that's going to be significantly offset by the MFP sale, which is a very large impact year-over-year in gross margin percentage points. 
When you think about '22 and beyond, we're not ready to get into a lot of detail there, but we do expect to see some continued product costing improvements. But you're going to start to normalize that cost base with the supply chain fairly soon. So that benefit will start to get smaller as we think about '22 and beyond. 
And then from a pricing perspective, definitely a decent benefit there as well. It's probably in a similar range to what we're anticipating on the supply chain benefit side. So hopefully, that triangulates a little bit for you."

With the continued disciplined execution of our strategic playbook, we're happy with our results, which marks a better-than-expected start to our year.A",1691,"Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 conference call. With the continued disciplined execution of our strategic playbook, we're happy with our results, which marks a better-than-expected start to our year.
As with many companies, our year-over-year comparisons are affected by the significant COVID impacts we experienced in 2020. Putting these dynamics aside for a moment and perhaps what we're most encouraged to see at this early point in our year, is that on a 2-year stack, that is skipping over 2020, we're running a better, higher quality and more profitable business. This is even more evident because of the strategies we've employed over the past couple of years, including significantly reduced sales to the off-price channel, proactive supply constraints against demand signals, the early days of exiting undifferentiated distribution, and certainly, on an annual basis, the absence of My Fitness Pal, which we sold at the end of last year.
By staying focused on athletic performance, operational excellence and connecting even more deeply with our consumers, these efforts are beginning to drive more consistent results, particularly in North America, our largest and most challenged business over the past couple of years. At the highest level, we are executing well strategically, operationally and financially.
Given these and other factors, including market dynamics and continued strong momentum in fitness and wellness, we have meaningfully updated our outlook for the year, with revenue now expected to grow at a high teen percentage rate, bringing our business essentially back in line with our results from 2019.
As our transformation continues to translate into improved momentum for Under Armour, there are no changes to the strategies we outlined earlier this year: strengthening the brand, continuous operating model improvement, elevating a direct-to-consumer-focused approach and staying disciplined about turning greater profitability and value to shareholders.
Using this construct, I'll take a few minutes to highlight some of the progress we're making in these areas, starting with brand strength. From a marketing and consumer engagement perspective, our global campaign, The Only Way is Through, is delivering a singular Under Armor voice with focused performers. In 2021, we are evolving these efforts to bring the ecosystem of how we engage and inspire athletes across both physical and digital experiences into even better alignment. These factors, driven by more robust data-driven decisions, a constant consumer insights feedback loop and our meaningfully improved outlook gives us confidence that this is an opportune time to amplify the momentum even more greatly in the second half of this year. As such, we plan to make additional investments to support our marketing efforts to help drive awareness and increase conversion. These accelerated investments will primarily focus on North America and critical countries, like China and Germany, where we are still significantly underpenetrated from a brand awareness perspective.
Next is product. As a premium athletic performance brand, the products that Under Armour delivers to the marketplace must meet and exceed the consumers' high expectation of performance fit and style unfailingly to make them better. So whether it's bringing newness and excitement to women with our crossback and [indiscernible] bras and no slip waste band leggings, to the next generation of rush and Iso-Chill apparel for all athletes, our go-to-market process, storytelling and operational excellence are helping to drive more robust consumer demand.
Taking a moment to talk about our run category. We continue to be quite pleased with the success of our Under Armour HOVR franchise as it's broadened our appeal and preference among runners by offering multiple price points and seasonal newness to inspire loyalty. During the first quarter, we saw strength in HOVR Sonic, Machina and Infinite. We also successfully launched our most pinnacle running footwear ever with the UA Flow Velocity Wind. Priced at $160, this product is delivering well against our expectations.
It's also pushing performance with data from our Map My Run digital app, telling us that runners wearing these shoes are on average going further and faster than any other UA running shoe. So while still early, very exciting to see.
Switching gears to our second area of focus, which is continuous operating model improvement. With the critical mass of our transformation now behind us, and appropriately rebased cost structure and optionality that scaled smartly with future growth, we believe we are firmly on a path to returning to double-digit operating margin over the long term. This, of course, is not a one-and-done strategy, there is no finish line. Yet instead an ever-present focus on getting better, better process, more optimal structure, more efficient systems and vigilance around our decision-making. By region, channel or product, we are constantly challenging ourselves to leverage our foundational horsepower by being more precised and return-based on the investment choices we make as a global company to advance our strategic and financial goals.
Looking at our business by region. Let's review how some of this is playing out. I'll start with North America, which by many accounts, I believe to be in the healthiest position it's been in, in quite a few years from both a brand and financial perspective. High-quality revenue driven by a sharp focus around tight inventory management, proactive demand constraints, improving segmentation and servicing our customers well, puts us in the sweet spot of our strategy to return to brand drive premium growth.
To support this confidence and recall in my earlier 2-year stack example, we see our full-price wholesale business in North America in 2021 being meaningfully higher than the same business in 2019. Keep in mind, this is despite several headwinds in the comp set, including proactive demand constraints, exiting undifferentiated retail, a significant reduction in sales to the off-price channel and overall promotional activities. So we've taken, in total, an encouraging sign as to the future of our business.
The other side of this equation is our direct-to-consumer business in North America, where we remain committed to reducing our promotional activity and driving improved store and digital productivity. And while traffic challenges persist in our physical stores, the business is performing above plan, and we expect it to deliver solid growth in 2021.
Shifting next to Asia Pacific. While short-term pandemic-driven impacts continue to present traffic challenges and higher promotional activities across the region, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these dynamics to emerge a stronger brand. Opportunistically, given an accelerated shift to online purchase behaviors, investments into CRM and digital activations remain center stage in our playbook to driving better brand affinity in the long term. From a direct-to-consumer perspective, we remain appropriately cautious concerning the right balance of return on those investments relative to the environment and staying premium.
Next up is EMEA. And even though ongoing impacts from COVID-19 and related restrictions are tempering our near-term growth expectations a bit, there's no change to our expectations for this crucial market. With stronger-than-expected bookings coming in for the fourth quarter, we remain encouraged by our strategies to tightly manage inventory while investing in brand awareness and consideration. The reception to new products, combined with the strength of our go-to-market, is enabling us to build strong demand among key wholesale and distributor partners. And within our direct-to-consumer business, while stores are a bit more challenged due to pandemic restrictions, like last year, our e-commerce business continues to serve as a healthy offset to drive growth.
And finally, our Latin America region. As discussed on our last call, we have begun transitioning our business in certain countries to a strategic distributor model. While we expect this change to negatively impact our revenue in 2021, over the long term, we believe it will help drive greater profitability and provide a better opportunity to increase brand awareness and affinity across this region.
Now moving to our third priority, elevating a direct consumer-focused approach. Consumer shopping preferences continues to blur the lines between physical and digital demanding that brands create unique personalized experiences to integrate seamlessly into their lives. For Under Armour, we believe building out the capabilities to execute a powerful omnichannel strategy will enable us to create more connected shopping experiences across all consumer touch points.
From an own store perspective, our first quarter results, led by improved traffic trends and higher average order values, along with higher gross margins due to reduced promotional activity, are encouraging signs for how we're thinking about our long-term opportunity in retail. In the near term, however, even amid optimism from recent trends, we'll continue to keep an appropriate level of conservatism in the mix.
Globally, our e-commerce business was up 69% in the first quarter, representing approximately 45% of our total direct-to-consumer business and included solid growth across all regions with better-than-expected conversion. Given the outside strength of e-commerce in 2020 and the continued shift to online due to the pandemic, we are hyper-focused on better understanding the consumer journey and building greater digital capabilities to unlock even deeper connections with athletes. And ultimately, while it's left to be seen about how sticky last year's e-commerce results are against this year's performance, we're confident that making additional investments in our sites, teams and processes to support our long-term growth expectations is money well spent. 
Bringing all these strategies together leads us to our last focus, maintaining our discipline around profitability to drive sustainable shareholder value over the long term. With our expectation of revenue being up at a high teen rate for the full year, I am pleased with our progress and our expectation to deliver an adjusted operating margin in line with 2019. This is a nice step up towards a double-digit rate over the long term.
So to wrap up, I'm pleased with the progress we are making. Our transformational strategy to architect a global operating model, capable of driving sustainable and profitable growth, is on track. With a solid start to the year, it's about continuing to execute the play with patience and allowing the processes, tools and structure we've built to drive improved capabilities across Under Armour and further enable our ability to compete for premium brand right growth.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave."

Today's results are strong evidence that our transformed operating model can efficiently serve strong demand for the Under Armour brand against the continued backdrop of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic.With an outstanding start",1775,"Thanks, Patrick. Today's results are strong evidence that our transformed operating model can efficiently serve strong demand for the Under Armour brand against the continued backdrop of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
With an outstanding start to the year, let's dive right in with our first quarter results. Revenue was up 35% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior year, this was better than expected due to higher demand across our wholesale and DTC businesses. From a channel perspective, our wholesale revenue was up 35%. Keep in mind, approximately 2/3 of this growth was due to a Q4 '20 to Q1 '21 shift related to COVID-19 impacts connected to customer order flow and changes in supply chain timing, as noted on our last call.
In addition, most of our Q1 wholesale over-delivery was due to stronger sell-through and higher demand from our North American customers. Our direct-to-consumer business increased 54%, led by a 69% growth in e-commerce and 44% growth in our owned and operated retail stores. Our DTC results were better-than-expected, primarily due to higher average order values in retail and higher e-commerce conversion rates. Our licensing business was up 9%, driven primarily by North America.
By product type, apparel revenue was up 35%, driven by our train and run categories. Footwear was up 47%, driven by our run and team sports categories. And our accessories business was up 73%, with most of the growth being driven by sports masks.
From a regional and segment perspective, first quarter revenue in North America was up 32%, driven by growth in our wholesale business, which was driven in part by Q4 to Q1 COVID-19-impacted order shift. Additionally, we saw strength in our North American DTC business, with Factory House and e-commerce leading the way for growth.
In EMEA, revenue was up 41%, driven by growth in wholesale, led by our distributor business, including the Q4 to Q1 COVID-19-impacted order shift as well as strength in e-commerce. It's important to note that EMEA continues to face significant impacts due to COVID, with about 1/3 of our owned and partner mono-branded doors closed at the end of the quarter.
Revenue in Asia Pacific was up 120%, with balanced growth across all channels, including our wholesale business, which partly benefited from Q4 to Q1 COVID-19-impacted order shifts. As a reminder, stores in APAC were closed through most of Q1 2020, so we are comping a more significant COVID-19 impact here than in our other regions.
In Latin America, revenue was down 9%, driven primarily by lower wholesale results, partially offset by growth in e-commerce. First quarter gross margin was significantly better-than-expected, with a 370 basis point improvement to 50%, driven by approximately 270 basis points of pricing improvements due to lower promotional activity within our DTC channel, along with lower promotions and markdowns within our wholesale business. In addition, we experienced 130 basis points of supply chain benefits, including improved inventory levels resulting in lower reserves and product cost improvements.
And finally, we realized 50 basis points of favorable channel mix due to a lower mix of off-price sales and a higher mix of DTC. Offsetting these improvements was about 140 basis points of negative gross margin impact related to the absence of MyFitnessPal, a factor we expect to impact us throughout this year.
Overall, versus our previous outlook for first quarter gross margin, we saw tighter inventories driven by stronger-than-expected demand and lower promotions, which resulted in a reduced requirement for inventory reserves, along with more favorable pricing. SG&A expenses were down 7% to $515 million, primarily due to lower legal and marketing costs versus the prior year. Relative to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded $7 million of charges in the first quarter, an amount less than we had anticipated due to slower-than-expected execution.
Including Q1, we've now realized $480 million of pretax restructuring and related charges. As detailed last September, this plan contemplates total charges ranging from $550 million to $600 million. It's important to note that all remaining charges are related to initiatives that we determined in 2020, meaning we are not adding anything new in 2021. We expect to incur approximately $35 million to $40 million of charges in the second quarter as we work towards completing this program in the second half of 2021.
Moving on. Our first quarter operating income was $107 million. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted operating income was $114 million. After tax, we realized net income of $78 million or $0.17 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes, our adjusted net income was $75 million or $0.16 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. And finally, inventory at the end of the first quarter was down 9% to $852 million, a clear indicator of the improvements we have made to drive a more efficient operating model.
Now moving on to our updated 2021 outlook. While recent consumer trends continue to be more positive than we anticipated, we remain cautious with respect to demand and the overall marketplace due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, today's outlook is predicated on our business continuing under the same general macros we've seen most recently, with no significant shutdowns as well as moderate improvements within the greater retail landscape as the year progresses.
That said, let's start at the top with revenue, which we expect to be up at a high-teen percentage rate for the full year. This reflects a high teen percentage increase in North America and a low 30s percentage rate increase in our international business. And while we see improvements across our regions, more robust demand in North America is driving most of the gain relative to our last outlook.
From a channel perspective, our Q4 bookings have come in better within our wholesale business than our initial expectations. As discussed, we are focused on managing our inventory tightly, including constraining supply to meet demand and exiting undifferentiated retail, particularly in North America.
In our DTC business, we also expect to see stronger results drive through the remainder of the year, with retail store growth far outpacing that of e-commerce, given that business is up against some difficult comps in 2020.
For gross margin, on a GAAP basis, we expect the full year rate to be up approximately 50 basis points against our 2020 adjusted gross margin of 48.6%, with benefits from pricing and supply chain efficiency partially offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal, which carried a high gross margin rate. The gross margin improvement relative to our previous outlook is due to improving benefits within pricing, partially offset by changes in channel mix and increased freight expense related to port congestion and logistical costs, which remains a rapidly evolving situation.
From an SG&A perspective, as we stated on our last call, We believe we have appropriately re-based our cost structure to scale for future growth. The improved discipline and processes we employ help ensure we stay return-based with the optionality to invest in critical areas like marketing in our DTC and international businesses.
As Patrik laid out, we intend to take advantage of some of our improved outlook in the second half of this year with incremental investments, particularly in marketing, to continue driving the underlying momentum we're seeing. In this respect, we expect SG&A to be up at a rate that is approximately 1/2 that of our revenue growth.
In addition to these incremental marketing investments, the other significant part of the overall increase in SG&A relative to our prior outlook is higher incentive compensation when compared to a year that saw significant reductions against target levels. When combined, these marketing investments and planned higher incentive compensation represent about 3/4 of the increase in our year-over-year SG&A dollars, meaning without them, the underlying SG&A is planned up slightly at about 2% to 3% in absolute dollars, which is consistent with the initial outlook we provided earlier this year. That said, remaining discipline about controlling costs and ensuring the right balance between growth, productivity and profitability is our top priority. After these factors, we now expect operating income to reach approximately $105 million to $115 million this year or about $230 million to $240 million on an adjusted basis. Translated to rate, we expect to deliver an operating margin of approximately 2% or an adjusted operating margin of approximately 4.5% in 2021. All of this takes us to a diluted loss per share of approximately $0.02 to $0.04, or excluding restructuring impacts, about $0.28 to $0.30 of adjusted diluted earnings per share.
To sum it up, we believe we have appropriately updated our outlook to reflect the improvements we see across the business. And to reiterate, some of the comments we made on our last call, headwinds should be taken into consideration for our full year outlook, particularly in the second half, including the absence of MyFitnessPal, continued supply and demand constraints, the exit of undifferentiated retail, which starts in the back half of this year, changes to our Latin American operating model and lower expected sales of our sports masks. For a little more color on the quarterly flow, we expect our second quarter revenue to be up approximately 70% as we lap last year's significantly shuttered retail world, with the highest regional growth seen in North America and Latin America.
Next, we expect Q2 gross margin to be down about 120 to 140 basis points primarily due to the following negative impacts: channel mix, with e-commerce being a considerably lower portion of the overall business when compared to last year; and within the wholesale channel, we expect a higher percentage of off-price sales versus last year's second quarter when off-price was predominantly closed. Additionally, The absence of MyFitnessPal will negatively impact the quarter. And finally, we anticipate increased freight expense from a supply chain perspective relative to the prior year as we work through ongoing logistics and transportation challenges. These negative factors are expected to be partially offset by an improvement in pricing due to lower planned promotional and discounting activities, along with some tailwinds from changes in foreign currency.
Bringing this to the bottom line, we expect second quarter adjusted operating income to be approximately $40 million to $45 million or about $0.04 to $0.06 of adjusted diluted earnings per share.
To close out, with an incredibly focused strategy led by a talented, passionate team and improved operations from our multiyear transformation, we believe Under Armour is well positioned to deliver on our expectations for 2021 and beyond.
With that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Well, let's start with North America. For us, thinking about North America today and the journey that we've been on, I mentioned in my script that we feel that the North American business is in a healthier position this year than it's been in a very long time. And that has to do with the quality of what's in the market for us right now as a brand, and the fact that we understand the consumer better and what's working for them. We're leveraging that into our go-to-market. We're also leveraging our marketing spend more efficiently, and we're doing that through the [indiscernible] work, return on investment and marketing model that we now have here at Under Armour. 
And this whole go-to-market that we started to deploy in early 2020, it makes us better each season. And part of that is the execution that you're now seeing across innovation, across gender, across our various categories and across the world. And in North America, being our biggest business, it just has a disproportionate impact, we believe.
But we're also seeing strength in the fitness and wellness industry that we're benefiting from, for sure. And we believe that's going to continue as we go into the rest of '21 and beyond at this point. So a lot to be proud of from the team. There's definitely a spring in our step at this point in terms of how we think about North America. Execution is, of course, everything, and we are executing. We're getting the right stuff to the right place at the right time, better innovation, better product, better marketing, all coordinated and the consumer is responding.

And then we are still operating in highly uncertain times with COVID-19. So we're trying to be prudent with our planning as well."

And a lot of that I would attribute to better product, better communication, better marketing. And across both tops, bottoms as well as footwear, we're resonating with the consumer right now in many different styles. 
If I had to make a call out, I think what's really encouraging for me in our run category, for example, in the footwear space, the launches that we've had around the Flow Velocity Wind, continuing with the HOVR, Machina and Sonic and Infinite is resonating for both genders.
And then when it comes to apparel for women, our Infinity cross bra as well as our Meridian leggings and many other products that we're now innovating into for women as it relates to leggings like our no-slip waste band, for example, which is really been a great innovation for us this year, are all resonating.
So it's more comprehensive. It's across more styles. It's across categories. at tops, it's bottoms, it's footwear. And it's that holistic approach that we're taking to the business, head to toe, through the go-to-market. But it's also about the communication.

Well, we came into this year, and we've talked about this now for the last 6 months and the last 2 calls around this notion of demand constraint. What it means is that we're tightening how we think about inventory across both in terms of exiting undifferentiated retail, which is exiting somewhere between 2,000 to 3,000 doors that will take full effect in the back half of this year.
We're also tightening the buckets that's in an inventory, things like order replenishment and at once dialing it in better, making sure that we have, of course, the right product at the right place but not necessarily spreading ourselves so thin across, but being very, very selective with our investments.
The reality is, Jim, that we won't have a tremendous amount of opportunity to capitalize on accelerating demand beyond what we're actually seeing and what we're thinking about right now simply because we are constraining ourselves. That's part of the model that we're running right now, and we believe very strongly and because we do want to continue to tighten up the availability of bad inventory, making sure that we're staying as clean as we can in every channel and every point of distribution.
And as it relates to Chase, that's going to be something that we're not going to do so much off in '21. And we're doing that also to be careful with what we're seeing right now in terms of everything that's happening in supply chain. We think that would be a very risky proposition at this point. So we're being very careful with any sort of Chase for the back half of 2021.
I don't know if you want to add some color on that, Dave?"

A lot of this, of course, is driven by a combination of factors, one is the actual availability of inventory. One is the better product that you're launching and the better ability to launch product well, right, which is resonating with the consumer. In other words, you're getting a bang for your buck in both ends in terms of us being able to be more premium as it relates to less promotional activity in our own channel in terms of markdowns, driving our average selling prices up. 
It's also resulting in less markdown in the wholesale channel because our innovation is matching our inventory levels. So the weeks on hand are lower. And as a consequence, they're selling our product better, which means that we're not diluting our gross to net so much.
And what we're seeing right now with this approach that we've taken is that all of those things are happening simultaneously. And it's about balance, right? It's about balance in terms of how much inventory you have in those different channels and buckets and how you're able to communicate your innovation and your product stories to the marketplace, which we're doing much better.
And I would just highlight also the fact that if you think about the digital revenue aspect of this, the work that we've done on our e-commerce over the last 18 months specifically as it relates to what we did midway through last year, for example, with the new North American site and our ability to merchandise better, be faster, we're now also upgrading the European sites to the same standard as the North American side. They're on the same platform, which will enable us to capitalize a little more on being better also in digital in the back half of the year.

That's helping from an inventory management perspective and taking back less returns. and also making it maybe a little bit easier also to manage that off-price third-party mix in that kind of 3% to 4% range that we think is kind of the sweet spot as we go forward.

And we are definitely on that journey towards double-digit operating margin. It is going to come in a couple of different ways.
You're right, we are going to continue to lean forward on DTC and really the best expression of our brand and driving those touch points with the consumers. That will continue to mix up a little bit of our revenue as we go forward. Keep in mind, though, that a lot of the doors we open in APAC are partner doors, and those go through wholesale. So that might temper the increasing mix of DTC a little bit. But you will continue to see the DTC mix go up, and with that comes generally higher gross margin.
When you couple that with a lot of the costing improvements that our supply chain has been driving over the last few years. So part of that journey is continued positive developments on the gross margin front. But then also there's kind of a 2-part story within SG&A. As you know, when you start to mix up in DTC on the revenue side, that does bring with it a little bit more in SG&A and operating costs with rent and everything else. So that does pressure kind of the SG&A to revenue a little bit. But with all the extensive work we've done with re-basing the cost structure and the operating model and restructuring, we feel like we're in a really good spot. It's kind of re-basing that cost structure to be able to leverage a lot better as we grow. And that's what we're going to be doing as we go into '22 and beyond.
So you'll continue to see a little bit of improvement in SG&A to revenue, a little bit of improvement in gross margin, and that's really kind of the simplest way to lay out the journey to double-digit operating margin. So we're excited about running forward on that."

I mean, obviously, globally, there is a lot of pressure just on logistics, on container availability, port delays, things like that. And I believe our supply chain has done a remarkable job navigating that to date, but it is challenging.
And so we do have some of that pressure built into this updated forecast. I wouldn't say that it is a massive factor, but it is big enough that we wanted to call it out and that we actually did adjust our forecast to make sure that we're covering for it.
The good thing is that the improvements that we've been seeing versus our expectations in our pricing ability, including the lower promotions, markdowns, off-price, and then also inventory reserve assumptions relative to the health of our inventory, those improvements are actually outweighing the new, tougher news relative to freight and logistical challenges.
So net-net, that's why you're seeing a little bit of the higher outlook that we're giving for the full year on gross margin than our prior call. So we're monitoring it. Our supply chain is on it, and we're navigating it fairly well at this point."

So a lot of favorable developments, but we've got to just continue to think about the fact that there are a fair amount of those back half headwinds as well, which are not as related to health of the business. So the sale of MyFitnessPal, that was 85% to 90% of our Connected Fitness segment. So that's a pretty big impact for back half of the year.
The demand constraint work we've been talking about exiting undifferentiated retail, which doesn't really come into play until back half of this year. The LatAm business model changes have more of a back half impact and then the sport mass business as well. So those are definitely some pretty decent sized headwinds. Relative to 2019, I think, again, the biggest call out is just overall health of the business mix of accounts. And we're excited about continuing to kind of drive that forward."

But the advantage of that was we learned a lot. 
And with our new tools and our modeling capability that we have, we were able to actually use the time, especially in the digital space, to really learn what works for Under Armour in terms of how to think about resonating with the consumer to make them better.
So as Dave and I saw the numbers improved here this year, now it's much easier for us to make the decision to invest back into the brand because we understand what buttons to push, and we understand what kind of returns we should be expecting. And It is really around building brand top of funnel now for us in the back half of the year, more so than we thought we would be able to do coming into the year.
So it's just that understanding of what works for us as a brand and having the right asset base to be able to activate against in the right space to really connect with the consumer and raise the engagement level, both from an awareness and consideration perspective. So very excited that we're able to do this, and it should really set the stage for us also for '22."

It's a great question. And just to clarify, the marketing spend that we're now driving in the back half that predominantly is going top of funnel versus down funnel in performance marketing where you would see most of the quick return, so to speak. So we're really balancing and making sure that we're driving towards a more balanced funnel, something that we've been wanting to do for quite some time. And we've been somewhat hindered by because we've had also a lot of commitments in the past to -- tied to long-term contracts and other things that hasn't really permitted us to go up funnel and drive brand marketing. And that's what we're able to do now. 
So hence my commentary a little bit around how we're now investing for the future, and really, a lot of that top of funnel marketing is really to set the stage for '22 and beyond. It doesn't mean we're not going to span down in the funnel, we have already planned that to support the revenue that we now have guided to. So this is really about additional brand marketing that we're talking about.

We set ourselves up well in the back half of last year for tighter supply chain management.
But then coming into this year, with the incremental drive-through in Q1, and then also with the updated forecast, we are running even healthier inventory than we originally thought. And the mix of that inventory is healthy as well, not just the level of the inventory. And so when you add those things together and our ability to sell through more at full price, it does have an impact and your required reserves are lower than anticipated.

With the continued disciplined execution of our strategic playbook, we're happy with our results, which marks a better-than-expected start to our year.",1683,"Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 conference call. With the continued disciplined execution of our strategic playbook, we're happy with our results, which marks a better-than-expected start to our year. 
As with many companies, our year-over-year comparisons are affected by the significant COVID impacts we experienced in 2020. Putting these dynamics aside for a moment and perhaps what we're most encouraged to see at this early point in our year, is that on a 2-year stack, that is skipping over 2020, we're running a better, higher quality and more profitable business. This is even more evident because of the strategies we've employed over the past couple of years, including significantly reduced sales to the off-price channel, proactive supply constraints against demand signals, the early days of exiting undifferentiated distribution, and certainly, on an annual basis, the absence of MyFitnessPal, which we sold at the end of last year. 
By staying focused on athletic performance, operational excellence and connecting even more deeply with our consumers, these efforts are beginning to drive more consistent results, particularly in North America, our largest and most challenged business over the past couple of years. At the highest level, we are executing well strategically, operationally and financially. 
Given these and other factors, including market dynamics and continued strong momentum in fitness and wellness, we have meaningfully updated our outlook for the year, with revenue now expected to grow at a high-teen percentage rate, bringing our business essentially back in line with our results from 2019. 
As our transformation continues to translate into improved momentum for Under Armour, there are no changes to the strategies we outlined earlier this year: strengthening the brand, continuous operating model improvement, elevating a direct-to-consumer-focused approach and staying disciplined about turning greater profitability and value to shareholders. 
Using this construct, I'll take a few minutes to highlight some of the progress we're making in these areas, starting with brand strength. From a marketing and consumer engagement perspective, our global campaign, The Only Way is Through, is delivering a singular Under Armour voice with focused performers. In 2021, we are evolving these efforts to bring the ecosystem of how we engage and inspire athletes across both physical and digital experiences into even better alignment. 
These factors, driven by more robust data-driven decisions, a constant consumer insights feedback loop and our meaningfully improved outlook gives us confidence that this is an opportune time to amplify the momentum even more greatly in the second half of this year. As such, we plan to make additional investments to support our marketing efforts to help drive awareness and increase conversion. These accelerated investments will primarily focus on North America and critical countries like China and Germany, where we are still significantly underpenetrated from a brand awareness perspective. 
Next is product. As a premium athletic performance brand, the products that Under Armour delivers to the marketplace must meet and exceed the consumers' high expectation of performance, fit and style unfailingly to make them better. So whether it's bringing newness and excitement to women with our crossback and Infinity bras and no slip waste band leggings, to the next generation of RUSH and Iso-Chill apparel for all athletes, our go-to-market process, storytelling and operational excellence are helping to drive more robust consumer demand. 
Taking a moment to talk about our run category. We continue to be quite pleased with the success of our Under Armour HOVR franchise as it's broadened our appeal and preference among runners by offering multiple price points and seasonal newness to inspire loyalty. During the first quarter, we saw strength in HOVR Sonic, Machina and Infinite. 
We also successfully launched our most pinnacle running footwear ever with the UA Flow Velociti Wind. Priced at $160, this product is delivering well against our expectations. It's also pushing performance with data from our MapMyRun digital app, telling us that runners wearing these shoes are on average going further and faster than any other UA running shoe. So while still early, very exciting to see. 
Switching gears to our second area of focus, which is continuous operating model improvement. With the critical mass of our transformation now behind us, and appropriately rebased cost structure and optionality that scaled smartly with future growth, we believe we are firmly on a path to returning to double-digit operating margin over the long term. This, of course, is not a one-and-done strategy, there is no finish line. Yet instead an ever-present focus on getting better, better process, more optimal structure, more efficient systems and vigilance around our decision-making. By region, channel or product, we are constantly challenging ourselves to leverage our foundational horsepower by being more precise and return-based on the investment choices we make as a global company to advance our strategic and financial goals. 
Looking at our business by region. Let's review how some of this is playing out. I'll start with North America, which by many accounts, I believe to be in the healthiest position it's been in, in quite a few years from both a brand and financial perspective. High-quality revenue driven by a sharp focus around tight inventory management, proactive demand constraints, improving segmentation and servicing our customers well puts us in the sweet spot of our strategy to return to brand-right premium growth. 
To support this confidence and recall in my earlier 2-year stack example, we see our full-price wholesale business in North America in 2021 being meaningfully here than the same business in 2019. Keep in mind, this is despite several headwinds in the comp set, including proactive demand constraints, exiting undifferentiated retail, a significant reduction in sales to the off-price channel and overall promotional activities. So we've taken, in total, an encouraging sign as to the future of our business. 
The other side of this equation is our direct-to-consumer business in North America, where we remain committed to reducing our promotional activity and driving improved store and digital productivity. And while traffic challenges persist in our physical stores, the business is performing above plan, and we expect it to deliver solid growth in 2021. 
Shifting next to Asia Pacific. While short-term pandemic-driven impacts continue to present traffic challenges and higher promotional activities across the region, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these dynamics to emerge a stronger brand. Opportunistically, given an accelerated shift to online purchase behaviors, investments into CRM and digital activations remain center stage in our playbook to driving better brand affinity in the long term. From a direct-to-consumer perspective, we remain appropriately cautious concerning the right balance of return on those investments relative to the environment and staying premium. 
Next up is EMEA. And even though ongoing impacts from COVID-19 and related restrictions are tempering our near-term growth expectations a bit, there's no change to our expectations for this crucial market. With stronger-than-expected bookings coming in for the fourth quarter, we remain encouraged by our strategies to tightly manage inventory while investing in brand awareness and consideration. The reception to new products, combined with the strength of our go-to-market, is enabling us to build strong demand among key wholesale and distributor partners. And within our direct-to-consumer business, while stores are a bit more challenged due to pandemic restrictions, like last year, our e-commerce business continues to serve as a healthy offset to drive growth. 
And finally, our Latin America region. As discussed on our last call, we have begun transitioning our business in certain countries to a strategic distributor model. While we expect this change to negatively impact our revenue in 2021, over the long term, we believe it will help drive greater profitability and provide a better opportunity to increase brand awareness and affinity across this region. 
Now moving to our third priority, elevating a direct consumer-focused approach. Consumer shopping preferences continues to blur the lines between physical and digital demanding that brands create unique personalized experiences to integrate seamlessly into their lives. For Under Armour, we believe building out the capabilities to execute a powerful omnichannel strategy will enable us to create more connected shopping experiences across all consumer touch points. 
From an owned store perspective, our first quarter results, led by improved traffic trends and higher average order values, along with higher gross margins due to reduced promotional activity, are encouraging signs for how we're thinking about our long-term opportunity in retail. In the near term, however, even amid optimism from recent trends, we'll continue to keep an appropriate level of conservatism in the mix. 
Globally, our e-commerce business was up 69% in the first quarter, representing approximately 45% of our total direct-to-consumer business and included solid growth across all regions with better-than-expected conversion. Given the outside strength of e-commerce in 2020 and the continued shift to online due to the pandemic, we are hyper-focused on better understanding the consumer journey and building greater digital capabilities to unlock even deeper connections with athletes. And ultimately, while it's left to be seen about how sticky last year's e-commerce results are against this year's performance, we're confident that making additional investments in our sites, teams and processes to support our long-term growth expectations is money well spent.  
Bringing all these strategies together leads us to our last focus, maintaining our discipline around profitability to drive sustainable shareholder value over the long term. With our expectation of revenue being up at a high-teen rate for the full year, I am pleased with our progress and our expectation to deliver an adjusted operating margin in line with 2019. This is a nice step up towards a double-digit rate over the long term. 
So to wrap up, I'm pleased with the progress we are making. Our transformational strategy to architect a global operating model capable of driving sustainable and profitable growth is on track. With a solid start to the year, it's about continuing to execute the play with patience and allowing the processes, tools and structure we've built to drive improved capabilities across Under Armour and further enable our ability to compete for premium brand-right growth. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave."

Today's results are strong evidence that our transformed operating model can efficiently serve strong demand for the Under Armour brand against the continued backdrop of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With an outstanding start",1774,"Thanks, Patrik. Today's results are strong evidence that our transformed operating model can efficiently serve strong demand for the Under Armour brand against the continued backdrop of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
With an outstanding start to the year, let's dive right in with our first quarter results. Revenue was up 35% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior year. This was better than expected due to higher demand across our wholesale and DTC businesses. From a channel perspective, our wholesale revenue was up 35%. Keep in mind, approximately 2/3 of this growth was due to a Q4 '20 to Q1 '21 shift related to COVID-19 impacts connected to customer order flow and changes in supply chain timing, as noted on our last call. In addition, most of our Q1 wholesale over-delivery was due to stronger sell-through and higher demand from our North American customers. 
Our direct-to-consumer business increased 54%, led by a 69% growth in e-commerce and 44% growth in our owned and operated retail stores. Our DTC results were better-than-expected, primarily due to higher average order values in retail and higher e-commerce conversion rates. Our licensing business was up 9%, driven primarily by North America. 
By product type, apparel revenue was up 35%, driven by our train and run categories. Footwear was up 47%, driven by our run and team sports categories. And our accessories business was up 73%, with most of the growth being driven by sports masks. 
From a regional and segment perspective, first quarter revenue in North America was up 32%, driven by growth in our wholesale business, which was driven in part by Q4 to Q1 COVID-19-impacted order shift. Additionally, we saw strength in our North American DTC business, with Factory House and e-commerce leading the way for growth. 
In EMEA, revenue was up 41%, driven by growth in wholesale, led by our distributor business, including the Q4 to Q1 COVID-19-impacted order shift as well as strength in e-commerce. It's important to note that EMEA continues to face significant impacts due to COVID, with about 1/3 of our owned and partner mono-branded doors closed at the end of the quarter. 
Revenue in Asia Pacific was up 120%, with balanced growth across all channels, including our wholesale business, which partly benefited from Q4 to Q1 COVID-19-impacted order shifts. As a reminder, stores in APAC were closed through most of Q1 2020, so we are comping a more significant COVID-19 impact here than in our other regions. 
In Latin America, revenue was down 9%, driven primarily by lower wholesale results, partially offset by growth in e-commerce. 
First quarter gross margin was significantly better-than-expected, with a 370 basis point improvement to 50%, driven by approximately 270 basis points of pricing improvements due to lower promotional activity within our DTC channel, along with lower promotions and markdowns within our wholesale business. In addition, we experienced 130 basis points of supply chain benefits, including improved inventory levels resulting in lower reserves and product costing improvements. 
And finally, we realized 50 basis points of favorable channel mix due to a lower mix of off-price sales and a higher mix of DTC. Offsetting these improvements was about 140 basis points of negative gross margin impact related to the absence of MyFitnessPal, a factor we expect to impact us throughout this year. 
Overall, versus our previous outlook for first quarter gross margin, we saw tighter inventories driven by stronger-than-expected demand and lower promotions, which resulted in a reduced requirement for inventory reserves, along with more favorable pricing. 
SG&A expenses were down 7% to $515 million, primarily due to lower legal and marketing costs versus the prior year. Relative to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded $7 million of charges in the first quarter, an amount less than we had anticipated due to slower-than-expected execution. 
Including Q1, we've now realized $480 million of pretax restructuring and related charges. As detailed last September, this plan contemplates total charges ranging from $550 million to $600 million. It's important to note that all remaining charges are related to initiatives that we determined in 2020, meaning we are not adding anything new in 2021. We expect to incur approximately $35 million to $40 million of charges in the second quarter as we work towards completing this program in the second half of 2021. 
Moving on. Our first quarter operating income was $107 million. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted operating income was $114 million. After tax, we realized net income of $78 million or $0.17 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes, our adjusted net income was $75 million or $0.16 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. And finally, inventory at the end of the first quarter was down 9% to $852 million, a clear indicator of the improvements we have made to drive a more efficient operating model. 
Now moving on to our updated 2021 outlook. While recent consumer trends continue to be more positive than we anticipated, we remain cautious with respect to demand and the overall marketplace due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, today's outlook is predicated on our business continuing under the same general macros we've seen most recently, with no significant shutdowns as well as moderate improvements within the greater retail landscape as the year progresses. 
That said, let's start at the top with revenue, which we expect to be up at a high-teen percentage rate for the full year. This reflects a high-teen percentage increase in North America and a low 30s percentage rate increase in our international business. And while we see improvements across our regions, more robust demand in North America is driving most of the gain relative to our last outlook. 
From a channel perspective, our Q4 bookings have come in better within our wholesale business than our initial expectations. As discussed, we are focused on managing our inventory tightly, including constraining supply to meet demand and exiting undifferentiated retail, particularly in North America. 
In our DTC business, we also expect to see stronger results drive through the remainder of the year, with retail store growth far outpacing that of e-commerce, given that business is up against some difficult comps in 2020. 
For gross margin, on a GAAP basis, we expect the full year rate to be up approximately 50 basis points against our 2020 adjusted gross margin of 48.6%, with benefits from pricing and supply chain efficiency partially offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal, which carried a high gross margin rate. The gross margin improvement relative to our previous outlook is due to improving benefits within pricing, partially offset by changes in channel mix and increased freight expense related to port congestion and logistical costs, which remains a rapidly evolving situation. 
From an SG&A perspective, as we stated on our last call, We believe we have appropriately re-based our cost structure to scale for future growth. The improved discipline and processes we employ help ensure we stay return-based with the optionality to invest in critical areas like marketing in our DTC and international businesses. 
As Patrik laid out, we intend to take advantage of some of our improved outlook in the second half of this year with incremental investments, particularly in marketing, to continue driving the underlying momentum we're seeing. In this respect, we expect SG&A to be up at a rate that is approximately 1/2 that of our revenue growth. 
In addition to these incremental marketing investments, the other significant part of the overall increase in SG&A relative to our prior outlook is higher incentive compensation when compared to a year that saw significant reductions against target levels. When combined, these marketing investments and planned higher incentive compensation represent about 3/4 of the increase in our year-over-year SG&A dollars, meaning without them, the underlying SG&A is planned up slightly at about 2% to 3% in absolute dollars, which is consistent with the initial outlook we provided earlier this year. That said, remaining discipline about controlling costs and ensuring the right balance between growth, productivity and profitability is our top priority. 
After these factors, we now expect operating income to reach approximately $105 million to $115 million this year or about $230 million to $240 million on an adjusted basis. Translated to rate, we expect to deliver an operating margin of approximately 2% or an adjusted operating margin of approximately 4.5% in 2021. All of this takes us to a diluted loss per share of approximately $0.02 to $0.04, or excluding restructuring impacts, about $0.28 to $0.30 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
To sum it up, we believe we have appropriately updated our outlook to reflect the improvements we see across the business. And to reiterate some of the comments we made on our last call, headwinds should be taken into consideration for our full year outlook, particularly in the second half, including the absence of MyFitnessPal; continued supply and demand constraints; the exit of undifferentiated retail, which starts in the back half of this year; changes to our Latin American operating model; and lower expected sales of our sports masks. 
For a little more color on the quarterly flow, we expect our second quarter revenue to be up approximately 70% as we lap last year's significantly shuttered retail world, with the highest regional growth seen in North America and Latin America. 
Next, we expect Q2 gross margin to be down about 120 to 140 basis points primarily due to the following negative impacts: channel mix, with e-commerce being a considerably lower portion of the overall business when compared to last year; and within the wholesale channel, we expect a higher percentage of off-price sales versus last year's second quarter when off-price was predominantly closed. Additionally, the absence of MyFitnessPal will negatively impact the quarter. And finally, we anticipate increased freight expense from a supply chain perspective relative to the prior year as we work through ongoing logistics and transportation challenges. 
These negative factors are expected to be partially offset by an improvement in pricing due to lower planned promotional and discounting activities, along with some tailwinds from changes in foreign currency. 
Bringing this to the bottom line, we expect second quarter adjusted operating income to be approximately $40 million to $45 million or about $0.04 to $0.06 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
To close out, with an incredibly focused strategy led by a talented, passionate team and improved operations from our multiyear transformation, we believe Under Armour is well positioned to deliver on our expectations for 2021 and beyond. 
With that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Can you just share more about what you're seeing? And then really on the wholesale order books, I'm very curious what's implied in the back half.

Well, let's start with North America. For us, thinking about North America today and the journey that we've been on, I mentioned in my script that we feel that the North American business is in a healthier position this year than it's been in a very long time. And that has to do with the quality of what's in the market for us right now as a brand, and the fact that we understand the consumer better and what's working for them. We're leveraging that into our go-to-market. We're also leveraging our marketing spend more efficiently, and we're doing that through the ROMI work, return on investment and marketing model that we now have here at Under Armour. 
And this whole go-to-market that we started to deploy in early 2020 makes us better each season. And part of that is the execution that you're now seeing across innovation, across gender, across our various categories and across the world. And in North America, being our biggest business, it just has a disproportionate impact, we believe.
But we're also seeing strength in the fitness and wellness industry that we're benefiting from, for sure. And we believe that's going to continue as we go into the rest of '21 and beyond at this point. So a lot to be proud of from the team. There's definitely a spring in our step at this point in terms of how we think about North America. Execution is, of course, everything, and we are executing. We're getting the right stuff at the right place at the right time, better innovation, better product, better marketing, all coordinated and the consumer is responding.

But then also, the plans to exit on differentiated retail and really focus on premium side is more of a back half impact for North America as well. And then also, we mentioned the sport masks business is a factor as well as far as being down back half versus back half of last year. So a couple of different factors that are going on there. And then we are still operating in highly uncertain times with COVID-19. So we're trying to be prudent with our planning as well."

And across both tops, bottoms as well as footwear, we're resonating with the consumer right now in many different styles. 
If I had to make a call out, I think what's really encouraging for me in our run category, for example, in the footwear space, the launches that we've had around the Flow Velociti Wind, continuing with the HOVR and Machina and Sonic and Infinite is resonating for both genders.
And then when it comes to apparel for women, our Infinity cross bra as well as our Meridian leggings and many other products that we're now innovating into for women as it relates to leggings like our no-slip waste band, for example, which is really been a great innovation for us this year, are all resonating.

Well, we came into this year, and we've talked about this now for the last 6 months and the last 2 calls around this notion of demand constraint. What it means is that we're tightening how we think about inventory across both in terms of exiting undifferentiated retail, which is exiting somewhere between 2,000 to 3,000 doors that will take full effect in the back half of this year.
We're also tightening the buckets that's in an inventory. Things like order replenishment and at once. Dialing it in better, making sure that we have, of course, the right product at the right place but not necessarily spreading ourselves so thin across, but being very, very selective with our investments.
The reality is, Jim, that we won't have a tremendous amount of opportunity to capitalize on accelerating demand beyond what we're actually seeing and what we're thinking about right now simply because we are constraining ourselves. That's part of the model that we're running right now, and we believe very strongly and because we do want to continue to tighten up the availability of bad inventory, making sure that we're staying as clean as we can in every channel and every point of distribution.
And as it relates to chase, that's going to be something that we're not going to do so much of in '21. And we're doing that also to be careful with what we're seeing right now in terms of everything that's happening in supply chain. We think that would be a very risky proposition at this point. So we're being very careful with any sort of chase for the back half of 2021.

A lot of this, of course, is driven by a combination of factors. One is the actual availability of inventory. One is the better product that you're launching and the better ability to launch product well, right, which is resonating with the consumer. In other words, you're getting a bang for your buck in both ends in terms of us being able to be more premium as it relates to less promotional activity in our own channel in terms of markdowns, driving our average selling prices up. 
It's also resulting in less markdown in the wholesale channel because our innovation is matching our inventory levels. So the weeks on hand are lower. And as a consequence, they're selling our product better, which means that we're not diluting our gross-to-net so much.
And what we're seeing right now with this approach that we've taken is that all of those things are happening simultaneously. And it's about balance, right? It's about balance in terms of how much inventory you have in those different channels and buckets and how you're able to communicate your innovation and your product stories to the marketplace, which we're doing much better.
And I would just highlight also the fact that if you think about the digital revenue aspect of this, the work that we've done on our e-commerce over the last 18 months, specifically as it relates to what we did midway through last year, for example, with the new North American site and our ability to merchandise better, be faster. We're now also upgrading the European sites to the same standard as the North American site.

Just give us some perspective there. And maybe a little more color on the differences and changes you've seen on that sell-through in apparel versus footwear in the business?"

But what I would say is that the bigger improvements that we started really seeing in sell-through were really back half of last year and continuing forward through Q1. And we're excited about the fact that that's also leading towards less need for promotions, less need for markdowns, less need for returns. So again, kind of the revenue dilution aspects of that have been fairly favorable as well as we continue forward. And that's helping from a gross margin perspective. That's helping from an inventory management perspective and taking back less returns. And also making it maybe a little bit easier also to manage that off-price third-party mix in that kind of 3% to 4% range that we think is kind of the sweet spot as we go forward.
So we continually monitor the weeks of stock that are at our wholesale partners, which has been at very, very healthy levels for, really, 2 to 3 quarters now. And we continue to see that. We continue to have great partnerships and discussions with our key accounts. And we're excited to -- working together with them to maximize sell-through as we continue to move forward."

And we are definitely on that journey towards double-digit operating margin. It is going to come in a couple of different ways.
You're right, we are going to continue to lean forward on DTC and really the best expression of our brand and driving those touch points with the consumers. That will continue to mix up a little bit of our revenue as we go forward. Keep in mind, though, that a lot of the doors we open in APAC are partner doors, and those go through wholesale. So that might temper the increasing mix of DTC a little bit. But you will continue to see the DTC mix go up, and with that comes generally higher gross margin.
When you couple that with a lot of the costing improvements that our supply chain has been driving over the last few years. So part of that journey is continued positive developments on the gross margin front. But then also there's kind of a 2-part story within SG&A. As you know, when you start to mix up in DTC on the revenue side, that does bring with it a little bit more in SG&A and operating costs with rent and everything else. So that does pressure kind of the SG&A to revenue a little bit. But with all the extensive work we've done with re-basing the cost structure and the operating model and restructuring, we feel like we're in a really good spot. It's kind of re-basing that cost structure to be able to leverage a lot better as we grow. And that's what we're going to be doing as we go into '22 and beyond.
So you'll continue to see a little bit of improvement SG&A to revenue, a little bit of improvement in gross margin, and that's really kind of the simplest way to lay out the journey to double-digit operating margin. So we're excited about running forward on that."

And this is similar to what we expected coming into the year, driven by continued investments into retail and international, offset by savings initiatives related to our restructuring and our capital preservation strategies from 2020, along with lower legal expenses as well.
So you are seeing an increase from our last forecast, especially in marketing as we want to invest more in the brand and continue that momentum in the back half of the year. And then you are seeing a higher expectation of incentive compensation with the improving results. But again, we feel good about the cost structure as we drive into '22 and going forward.

We're doing that in a careful manner, making sure that we're prioritizing profitability, of course. But we've seen the traffic rebound, especially in the outlet business.
But I would say that China is a more promotional market now than it was before COVID hit. So we're watching that and just trying to understand when the new normal, so to speak, will be there.

But also, at the same time, I would say traffic is still down, right, in retail. So yes, there is certainly some stimulus going on. But we've also been very good at converting a lot better, both in our e-commerce business as well as our retail business.

The good thing is that the improvements that we've been seeing versus our expectations in our pricing ability, including the lower promotions, markdowns, off-price, and then also, inventory reserve assumptions relative to the health of our inventory, those improvements are actually outweighing the new, tougher news relative to freight and logistical challenges.

That's a great question. And just to clarify, the marketing spend that we're now driving in the back half that predominantly is going top of funnel versus down funnel in performance marketing where you would see most of the quick return, so to speak. So we're really balancing and making sure that we're driving towards a more balanced funnel, something that we've been wanting to do for quite some time. And we've been somewhat hindered by because we've had also a lot of commitments in the past to -- tied to long-term contracts and other things that hasn't really permitted us to go up funnel and drive brand marketing. And that's what we're able to do now. 
So hence my commentary a little bit around how we're now investing for the future, and really, a lot of that top of funnel marketing is really to set the stage for '22 and beyond. It doesn't mean we're not going to spend down in the funnel. We have already planned that to support the revenue that we now have guided to. So this is really about additional brand marketing that we're talking about.
And Dave, I don't know if you want to add something to that?"

And to Patrik's point, the revenue that we are seeing is incremental versus our last call. There's not much of that is directly tied to the increased marketing.

We set ourselves up well in the back half of last year for tighter supply chain management.
But then coming into this year, with the incremental drive-through in Q1, and then also with the updated forecast, we are running even healthier inventory than we originally thought. And the mix of that inventory is healthy as well, not just the level of the inventory. And so when you add those things together and our ability to sell through more at full price, it does have an impact and your required reserves are lower than anticipated. We haven't broken out the exact basis point of that difference versus our prior outlook, but it is meaningful enough that we wanted to call it out."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. 
At the halfway point of 2021, our better-than-expected results continue to validate that our multiyear transformation is working with a stronger top and bottom line performance relative to our previous outlook, perhaps more importantly, we're also driving higher quality growth, margin expansion and greater profitability against our pre-pandemic 2019 results. In fact, diluted earnings per share through the first 6 months of 2021 are greater than the full year 2019. So all in, a great first half. 
Reflecting on the past 18 months amid a historically challenging environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I am incredibly proud of Under Armour's global team and the way we've worked to hold ourselves accountable to our strategic playbook. By continuing to sharpen our focus, the operating model and financial discipline we have ingrained within our culture serve as a constant check in balance to deliver premium products and experiences to our consumers and customers. And by driving higher quality revenue through a constant lens of operational excellence and applying what we've learned, consistently refining and orienting towards brand-right profitable growth means we are better positioned today to drive greater returns to our shareholders than we were before the pandemic started. 
And yet, with sustained uncertainty related to COVID, which as of late is trending unfavorably in key sourcing countries in Southeast Asia, the resiliency we have earned over the last 1.5 years will continue to serve as an asset while we navigate the second half of 2021. In this respect, we're focused on the things we can control, staying grounded in our 4 strategic pillars: strengthening the Under Armour brand, improving our operating model, amplifying a D2C focused approach, and increasing our capacity to return greater profitability across the company. 
Starting with strengthening our brand and the proactive decision we've made to reinvest some of this year's upside into additional marketing efforts. This flexibility is empowering us to amplify our middle to top-of-funnel activations geared at increasing awareness, attraction and consideration for the Under Armour brand. As we work to connect with new athletes and inspire existing ones, we are centered on our brand attributes, resilience, hard work, heart and edge. 
In the second half, this will come to light more holistically as we illustrate the journey to compete through the process of training, setting goals, struggling and ultimately realizing the results. Through a team sports lens supported by consistent messaging via The Only Way Is Through, our third quarter activations highlight the importance of mental strength, an often overlooked aspect of training and its relationship to unlocking an athlete's full potential. Certainly, coming out of a long stretch of COVID restrictions and as team sports hopefully open up more broadly this fall, we believe this is a timely effort to draw consumers into the psyche that is uniquely Under Armour as we work to make them better. 
So starting this month, via social media, TV and streaming, be on the lookout for Chase Young, [indiscernible], Tai Harris and Nick Merck, among others, helping to highlight metal training and the role it plays in achieving one's personal performance goals. As we say at Under Armour, if you train your mind, you train your game. So while there's still more work to be done to unlock our full marketing potential, I am pleased with the progress we're making in aligning our go-to-market with focused performers and the evolving needs of our key retail partners around the world, not to mention the incremental marketing investments we're making in 2021 are really geared that setting us up for more strongly in 2022 as awareness and consideration should lead to increased conversion as we strengthen our connectivity. 
In product, our strategy remains firmly rooted in an athletes' journey to sport, leading with insights and data to provide solutions they didn't know they needed and now can't imagine living without. With quite a few product highlights during the quarter, I'd start by recognizing the incredible milestone that our partners at Virgin Galactic achieved a few weeks ago with their commercial flight into space. To play a part in pushing the boundaries of what is possible, we are excited to see what the future holds as new barriers get broken, inspiring all of us to strive for more. 
In apparel, second quarter highlights included strong sell-through of our Iso-Chill running products, featuring a UA innovation that keeps you cooler in hot conditions. We also saw strong sell-through in men's unstoppable bottoms and women's leggings, including Meridian and our no-Slip waste band technology. We'll also continue to build on its momentum as well with meaningful increases in our Infinite and Crossback products. And we also saw solid results in tops, featuring our RUSH technology. And finally, Project Rock apparel continued to build on its strong momentum as well with an excellent response to new drops. 
In footwear, Flow Velociti performed well in all regions, as did Hovr Phantom and Machina 2, including significant growth against last year's already strong performance. Our Charge Pursuit 2 and [ Assert 9 ] footwear offerings also posted substantial numbers demonstrating continued success in our segmentation strategy to bring premium innovations across all price points. 
In Curry, we saw success on and off court with our Curry Flow 8 signature shoe as well as retro styles that we pre-released in APAC, all good signs of momentum as we work towards the launch of the Curry 9 late this year. And finally, the Project Rock 3 shoe, which combines UA HOVR and TriBase technologies for a highly comfortable and stable training platform, was also a standout. 
Switching gears to our next area of focus, which is continuous operating model improvement. Our second quarter results demonstrate once again that our ability to service increased demand with efficient, effective execution is getting better. Creating product at the right price and getting it to the right place at the right time is at the core of how we'll win. To empower this, the adage holds, ""Success is doing the common things uncommonly well."" Simple perhaps, but precisely at the core of our strategic playbook and what we're obsessing on a day-to-day basis. 
Turning to our regions. We believe it's most helpful to compare our results to 2019 since last year's second quarter was an incredibly unique period. And we believe this 2-year stack better represents some of the progress we're making in the overall performance of our business. Starting with North America. I'd underscore how happy we are with improving our ability to drive higher-quality revenue through sharper segmentation, tighter inventory management and delivering consistent service to our customers. Versus 2019, North American revenue was up 11% in the second quarter and about 3% for the first half of the year. 
Now in context, it's important to keep in mind that these comparable periods have some key differences including a significant increase in our direct-to-consumer business, offset by considerably lower sales to the off-price channel, lower overall promotional and markdown activities and supply constraints engineered to put us in a more advantaged position in the marketplace. All of this, of course, is geared to continuing to lift the Under Armour brand to a more premium level in our largest market. 
And to that point, as evidenced by our gross margin results, this strategy is working. From a channel perspective, we feel good about the pace. We're earning back space with our key North American wholesale partners, driving forward price revenue and showing up both digitally and physically in a more comprehensive way than ever before. Revenue from our owned and operated stores is up meaningfully in the quarter versus the same period in 2019 and includes improved quality and composition of sales. 
For the full year, we expect our North American business to be up at a low 20s percentage rate compared to 2020. Versus 2019, North America will be close to the same revenue, which taking into consideration the factors I mentioned, less off-price, lower discounts and promotions and tighter supply constraints, along with our exit of undifferentiated retail, which starts in Q3 leaves me confident that we're setting ourselves up for improving brand right, profitable growth in 2022 and beyond. 
Turning to our international business. We expect revenue to be up at a mid-30s percent rate versus 2020 or up at a high 20s percentage rates on a 2-year stack. In our Asia Pacific region, we remain laser-focused on ensuring our brand remains firmly positioned in athletic performance while staying agile in a quickly evolving marketplace. With second quarter revenue up 25% versus 2019 or up 35% for the first half on a 2-year stack, our results gives us confidence that the additional investments we're making into marketing, CRM, digital activations and store expansions are working to drive greater brand affinity amid a highly competitive backdrop. 
Next up is EMEA, a region that is also seeing pockets of COVID resurgence, but also delivered strong growth for Under Armour. Second quarter revenue was up 43% over 2019 and up 44% for the first 6 months on a 2-year stack. Within DTC, we recently upgraded our e-commerce site platform to improve our capabilities and functionality as we focus on driving more seamless shopping experiences for our consumers. EMEA wholesale growth was balanced across our full price and distributor businesses. Looking at the rest of the year, we remain confident that our strategies to drive greater reach and connection to our consumers are working well. 
And finally, our Latin America region, where second quarter revenue was up 17% over 2019 or up 7% for the first 6 months on a 2-year stack. As discussed on our last call, we have begun transitioning our business in certain countries to a strategic distributor model, which we expect to impact revenue more negatively in the back half of this year. So still working through this transition as we rearchitect this business for improved consistency and we believe better profitability. 
Switching to our third pillar, which is our focus on elevating our D2C business. With a 33% increase in revenue for the second quarter and a 32% increase for the first half versus 2019, we're pleased to see the results of our multifaceted strategies to come to fruition. In conjunction with consumer behavioral shifts throughout the pandemic and an even greater appetite for product and brand experiences that are personalized, unique and premium, we are advancing how we show up in stores and online to meet their needs. All of this, of course, starts with our retail and distribution teammates who are the backbone of our business, playing an essential role in how we serve focus performers. 
Ensuring that they feel valued and appreciated, we increased our minimum pay rate to $15 per hour in our U.S. business as part of a larger effort that includes professional learning and development opportunities and additional incentive plans. In combination, these actions will allow us to drive better connectivity across the consumer journey. From an owned store perspective, we experienced improved traffic trends and higher average selling prices in the quarter, driving better productivity and more normalized promotions. Longer term, we remain focused on building the capabilities necessary to become a best-in-class retailer by creating incredible experiences in our full-price Brand House stores and better leveraging our factory house locations to drive greater overall profit. 
In our e-commerce business, revenue was down 18% in the quarter, a result that we anticipated being the most challenging of the year considering the shift to online in 2020 following the retail lockdown. That said, given the work we did to exit the highly promotional elements that this business experienced in 2019, along with the investments we've made in our platforms and teams over the last 18 months, and we're very encouraged by a 53% second quarter increase versus 2019 or a 55% increase for the first 6 months on a 2-year stack. Throw in that we expect our e-commerce business to be up at a high single-digit rate in 2021, and that puts our growth up nearly 50% on a 2-year stack. 
So to wrap it up, I'll end with our last area of focus, driving profitability to increase shareholder value over the long term. Based on our updated full year outlook, which includes revenue being up at a low to mid-single-digit rate versus 2019, and our adjusted EPS being up meaningfully, our strategy to return to profitable brand right growth is working. With a high quality and composition of revenue including significantly reduced off-price sales and less promotions and discounting, we're driving more productive dollars through our P&L, dollars that are contributing nicely to margin improvements and greater EPS demonstrating the results of our transformation and the stronger foundation we have built over the past couple of years. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave."

At the halfway point of 2021, our second quarter results demonstrate that the strategies we've been executing against and the foundation we've worked hard to reset to increase Under Armour's capacity to return sustainable profitable growth to shareholders are working. Our operational execution has never wavered against an incredibly challenging and dynamic global market punctuated by COVID over the last 1.5 years. Our attention to Under Armour's focused performers and delivering best-in-class innovations and premium experiences have never been sharper. And all of this has come together to target full year top line, bottom line and working capital performance at better than pre-pandemic levels. 
In the second quarter, revenue was up 91% to $1.4 billion compared to the prior year. Versus our previous outlook, this overdrive was primarily due to higher demand across our wholesale and Factory House businesses. And of course, in general, our second quarter results were up against last year's significantly restricted retail environment due to the peak of COVID impacted store closures. From a channel perspective, our wholesale revenue was up 157%, driven by broad-based growth as we lap the most significant impact from the retail door closures in the prior year. Additionally, most of our Q2 wholesale overdrive was due to stronger sell-through and higher demand in North America. 
Our direct-to-consumer business increased 52%, led by 234% growth in our owned and operated retail stores, partially offset by an 18% decline in e-commerce, which faced a difficult comp as it was the primary business driver of last year's second quarter. Our licensing revenues were up 276% driven by increases in our North American partner business. 
By product type, apparel revenue was up 105% driven by strength in our train, golf and run categories. Footwear was up 85%, driven by our run and team sports categories. And our accessories business was up 99% driven by hats, bags and sports masks. 
From a regional and segment perspective, second quarter revenue in North America was up 101%. In wholesale, we continue to drive lower markdowns with tighter inventory, enabling fuller priced sell-through. Within DTC, we saw strength in our owned and operated stores given the easier comparison to the prior year when most of our locations were closed for the quarter. This was partially offset by a decline in our e-commerce business, which conversely was up against a particularly tough comparison to last year. 
In EMEA, revenue was up 133%, driven by growth in wholesale and DTC with significant strength across our wholesale and distributor partners. Revenue in Asia Pacific was up 56% with balanced growth across all channels. And in Latin America, revenue was up 317%, driven primarily by lapping the store closures in the prior year. As we move into the back half of the year, we expect the transition of certain countries to distributor models to negatively impact top line performance, particularly in the fourth quarter. 
Second quarter gross margin came in better than expected, improving 20 basis points to 49.5%, driven by 570 basis points of pricing improvements due to lower promotional activity within our DTC channel along with lower promotions and markdowns within our wholesale business, which was significantly impacted by the pandemic in the prior year and 100 basis points of benefit due to changes in foreign currency. Offsetting these improvements was a 460 basis point negative impact from channel mix, primarily driven by a lower mix of e-commerce and a larger mix of wholesale, including a higher percentage of off-price sales than last year when this channel was essentially closed for most of the quarter. 
Additionally, we realized 170 basis points of negative gross margin impact related to the absence of MyFitnessPal, which will remain a headwind throughout 2021. And finally, a 10 basis point negative impact within supply chain as our continued benefits and product costs were more than offset by higher freight and logistics costs due to developing COVID-related supply chain pressures. Overall, versus our previous outlook for second quarter gross margin, we experienced lower-than-planned promotions enabled through higher demand along with driving more favorable pricing. 
SG&A expenses were up 14% to $545 million, primarily due to higher marketing costs and expenses tied to store operations, given most retail locations were closed throughout the second quarter of 2020. Relative to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded $3 million of charges in the second quarter, an amount less than we had anticipated due to the timing of specific executions such as the realization of lease and contract terminations. Throughout the plan thus far, we've realized $483 million of pretax restructuring and related charges. As detailed last September, this plan contemplates total charges ranging from $550 million to $600 million. It's important to note that all remaining charges are related to initiatives outlined in 2020, meaning nothing new has been added in 2021. For the quarter -- for the third quarter, we expect to realize approximately $40 million to $50 million in charges related to this plan. 
Moving on. Our second quarter operating income was $121 million. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted operating income was $124 million. After tax, we realized a net income of $59 million or $0.13 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, loss on extinguishment of $250 million in principal amount of senior convertible notes and the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes, our adjusted net income was $110 million or $0.24 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
In this respect, we are proud to report that in the first half of 2021, we have already surpassed our full year 2019 diluted earnings per share. So in a great position to finish out 2021 with strength against prepandemic levels. Inventory at the end of the second quarter was down 26% to $881 million as we continue to drive improvements throughout our operating model, along with experiencing some inbound shipping delays due to COVID-related supply chain pressures. 
Our cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we had no borrowings under our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. With respect to debt, during the second quarter, we entered into exchange agreements with certain convertible bondholders for $250 million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes and terminated certain related cap call transactions. We utilized net $247 million in cash, issued 11 million shares of our Class C stock and recorded a related loss of approximately $35 million, which is captured in other income and expenses. Post this transaction, $250 million of our convertible bonds remain outstanding. 
Next, let's move on to our updated 2021 outlook where, based on better-than-expected performance in our second quarter, we flowed through the upside for a meaningful increase for our full year. That said, although recent consumer trends continue to track positively, we remain cautious with demand and the overall marketplace due to both the COVID-19 pandemic and developing manufacturing and logistics challenges in key sourcing countries in Southeast Asia. 
Accordingly, today's outlook is subject to our business continuing under the same general macros we've seen most recently with no significant shutdowns of manufacturing partners or retail or logistics disruptions, along with continuing improvements within the global retail landscape as we progress through the second half of 2021. 
That said, let's start at the top with revenue. which we now expect to be up at a low 20s percentage rate for the full year. This reflects a low 20s percentage increase in North America and a mid-30s percentage increase in our international business. For gross margin, on a GAAP basis, we expect the full year rate to be up 50 to 70 basis points against our 2020 adjusted gross margin of 48.6% with benefits from pricing and benefits from changes in foreign currency being partially offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal, which carried a high gross margin rate, along with higher expected freight expenses. 
The gross margin improvement relative to our previous outlook is due to improving benefits within pricing, partially offset by increased freight expense related to port congestion and logistics costs, which remains a rapidly evolving situation. Versus 2020, we expect a high single-digit rate increase in SG&A, a rate that is less than half that of our revenue growth. As laid out previously, it's important to remember that specific to 2021, we are taking advantage of our improved outlook and proactively making incremental investments, particularly in marketing to build even deeper connections with our consumers. 
Additionally, the other significant part of the overall increase in SG&A is higher incentive compensation, which is up against 2020 when we realized significant reductions against target levels. All in, of this expected high single-digit rate increase in SG&A in 2021, on an absolute dollar basis, about 1/2 of this is related to incremental marketing, 1/3 related to higher incentive compensation and the balance related to our other underlying SG&A. On a 2-year stack, the most significant drivers of SG&A dollar growth are the incremental marketing investments and higher incentive compensation we expect in 2021. 
Beyond these items, our underlying SG&A is planned to be up only slightly against 2019's base. As we look ahead, remaining disciplined around SG&A and striking the right balance between growth, productivity and profitability is our top priority. With that, we now expect operating income to reach $215 million to $225 million this year or $340 million to $350 million on an adjusted basis. Translated to rate, we expect to deliver an operating margin of approximately 4% or an adjusted operating margin just north of 6% in 2021. All of this takes us to an expected diluted earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.16, or excluding restructuring charges, the loss on early extinguishment of convertible senior notes and noncash amortization of debt discount on these convertible senior notes, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52 in 2021. 
In summary, our full year outlook reflects the combination of the overdrive we've realized in the first half of 2021, along with improvements across our business, positioning us to deliver growth and stronger profitability relative to 2019. Next, before giving more color on how we're thinking about the balance of the year, I'll highlight some headwinds that impact us more directly in the second half of 2021, including lower expected sales of our sports masks, supply and demand constraints, the absence of MyFitnessPal, lower expected sales to the off-price channel, changes to our Latin American operating model and the exit of undifferentiated retail, which began in the third quarter. 
Looking at quarterly flow, we expect third quarter revenue to be up at a low single-digit rate and the fourth quarter to be relatively flat to finish out the year. Next, we expect third quarter gross margin to be up 130 to 150 basis points due to pricing benefits and channel mix as we anticipate lower promotional activity and lower sales to the off-price channel. These benefits will be partially offset by the absence of MyFitnessPal, higher expected freight costs and changes in product mix driven by lower sales of sports masks. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin to be down due to negative impacts from the absence of MyFitnessPal, channel mix driven by lower licensing revenue and product mix driven by a higher percentage of footwear and lower sales of sports masks. Bringing this to the bottom line, we expect third quarter adjusted operating income to be $95 million to $105 million or $0.13 to $0.15 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
So to close out, operational excellence, flexibility, a strong balance sheet and consistent financial management, when combined, form a model that's allowed us to transcend pandemic challenges proficiently. Looking at the next 6 months and to set up all these accomplishments provide for us going into 2022, we believe Under Armour is well positioned to deliver on our next chapter of profitable growth.

We think, in general, the ability that we've had to execute -- if you remember a year ago, we talked on this call about how we were going to continue to drive our innovation and go-to-market pipeline and continue to become more consumer-centric and focus on being able to deliver across all channels better. I see now the results of that really playing into it. And that, in combination with the demand constraints that we've put in to make sure we're putting the right product in the right place at the right time, is playing out with the consistent messaging that we've been able to deliver against. 
And I think the consumer patterns, of course, were very hard to predict in 2021 versus 2020. And I think we have been pleased with how the consumer has returned to some degree, right, into a full price retail and our outlets and also continued to shop online. Our ability to fulfill demand in terms of doing a better job, of delivering a better experience, better product, better messaging more consistently is really what you're starting to see the effect of. So really, at the essence of that is, our strategy is working. And we're able to execute against it. When we look a little bit forward into next year, I think the way to think about the current environment is there's a lot of uncertainty, right? And they've highlighted this in terms of what we're seeing with the development of COVID-19 here in the back half. But we've built resiliency and an ability to adapt to be agile and we're ready for twists and turns in the road, but we're not going to sway off our strategy of direct-to-consumer focus, the focused performer and being the best we can be in athletic performance."

We're really happy with how we have planned our sourcing strategy, and we talked about that actually at the Investor Day, and we've continued down the path that we talked about where we're not reliant necessarily in all categories so much on APAC. We have a very balanced sourcing strategy across the world. And today, Vietnam, for example, that you mentioned, is about 1/3 what we do, but it's split, right, a little bit between apparel and footwear. 
And it's important to note that we also have a good presence in Europe, Middle East and as well as South America, Latin America in terms of our sourcing strategy. So we're well balanced. Does that mean we're not going to have potential issues developing? Well, we've -- in our outlook here, given the -- our current view, of course, things will continue to develop. But again, agility here and a well-balanced sourcing platform probably puts us in a -- maybe a little bit better position than most, but it's going to be a developing situation."

And we have seen an opportunity on -- not just the first half this year, but also the back half of last year and the investments we've made that there's an opportunity for us to drive media efficiency more in the upper funnel. 
So that means perhaps not so much driving more revenue this year, but really preparing ourselves for the future. So putting money into the top of the funnel, so to speak, to drive the brand which will give us a payoff down the line. And we're not just doing that in North America. We're doing it also in Europe, in specific countries, as well as in China. And we believe that that's really important for us right now, to continue to enhance the brand.

I mean if you think about playing out the back half of this year, we mentioned a lot of the back half headwinds around whether it be MyFitnessPal, demand constraints, exiting undifferentiated retail, et cetera, that are going on in the back half from a revenue perspective. We also mentioned some of the pressure on gross margin in the back half relative to some of the additional freight and logistics costs, et cetera. So some of those things are coming into play in the back half of this year. And then also, as Patrik just highlighted, we're heavying up marketing a fair amount in the back half of the year as well from a spend perspective. 
And then last, I would just point out that as DTC is a higher percentage as we get towards Q4, that brings with it more operating and SG&A costs as well. So there's a lot of things coming into play relative to kind of the tempering operating margin in the back half of the year versus the front half of the year. As we think about playing that forward, we are absolutely driving down that profitable growth journey now, and we're excited about that. And we do believe that we will be able to get to a double-digit operating margin in the future. We're not ready to speak to what year that will be, but I mean, there are a lot of different opportunities to be able to get there, whether it's continued improvement on kind of gross to net revenue with the health of the business that we're driving, whether it be continued gross margin opportunities relative to DTC mix increasing and continued scale and costing benefits from that. 
And then also, obviously, we've done so much work on the SG&A and cost base front that we really look forward to being able to leverage that heavily as we step into '22 and beyond. So a lot of different opportunities there that we'll be excited to be able to speak more to in the future."

And I'd just like to point out here, specifically in the run category, I think in the last few years, we've done a great job instilling a franchise mindset on our HOVR platform, where we now have 6 or 7 franchises, and we're now into things like the Sonic 4 and the Machina 2 and the Infinite 3 and so forth. 
And this year, layering on top of that in a pandemic year, kind of halfway post pandemic year, whatever you want to call it, actually an elevated expression in terms of a franchise with the flow that came out in early spring that did incredibly well. What was interesting for us was the fact that the HOVR platform continued to perform incredibly well, especially the Machina at $150. So you have now running shoes at $160. And we just introduced a Flow Velociti FC a few weeks ago, and that is also cranking. So I think it isn't as easy as saying that we're just following the trend. I think that we're doing all of the things I just talked about with constrained demand, with making sure that we are being -- running a better play in terms of profitability and execution. 
So it's really truly, I think, a holistic approach from Under Armour. And what I think we're proving out is that this focus that we put in place around athletic performance, the focus performer, sticking to that strategy, being consistent, executing well is now playing out."

We have very strong leadership that are able to execute at every level.

It's one of my favorite questions because one of the things that's so exciting about Under Armour right now is our innovation pipeline. And we talked to you guys, as I said here, to Aaron earlier today, we decided last year, as we went into the pandemic, that we were going to execute on our innovations and our go-to-market, which is what we've done. I think this increased laser focus that we have on consumer centricity is also helping us understand how to cadence things, how to tune things and how to really drive not just our innovation, but our go-to-market holistically. 
So we have now learned, as a brand, how to drive franchises in footwear. We have also learned how to drive specific initiatives like Curry, like the Rock. But we've also learned how to do all of that, executing excellently all the way upstream. So for us, it's really about continuing to play now, stick to the strategy, execute the play, stay consistent, spend a little bit more in marketing to drive the brand. And when we come out of this pandemic, we're going to be ready for growth."

At this point, we've highlighted how outside of marketing and outside of incentive compensation this year, we expect underlying SG&A to only grow 2% to 3%.

I'm not saying that that's what the growth will be next year, but I'm saying that we are into a much, much better place. And I think Patrick and I, combined with our leadership, really have the right financial discipline and understanding, combined with enterprise mindset to make sure that we're prioritizing our investments and not letting that cost structure get to any much larger standpoint longer term. 
So we're continuing to look at each spend. We're continuing to prioritize. We're continuing to also invest in the key areas that we believe are critical for our growth. But at the same time, we've got to make sure that we continue to leverage. So I think we're well positioned as we go into '22 and beyond. There's a really solid understanding around the leadership of how to drive that growth more profitably going forward, and that's what we're going to be looking to do."

And we believe that there is -- we talked a little bit about pricing power here before. We believe there's opportunity for us as we go forward. And what's exciting is some of the examples I've given already in terms of footwear, for example. The ability for us to push upward, right, in terms of the $160 Flow, for example, that just came out this year. And we tend to forget that if you back up to 2018, when we launched the HOVR platform, which was really our first foray into a concerted effort at driving into the run category, footwear category, if you like. We started at that point at $100 and $120. We then took ourselves up into $130, $150. And then we now went up into $160. That kind of thinking and progression, as we drive franchises also in apparel, whether it is in our RUSH technology or in our Iso-Chill technology is the same sort of thinking, right? 
We're building franchises. We're building ability to drive the AURs up over time as the brand gets stronger. And the teams are now doing an excellent job of orchestrating that play. Because it is an orchestration at the end of the day. You've got to do it in a very determined and appropriate way and everything's got to come together. And I think that is what you see, is an ability to execute on that from the brand. So that should give everybody optimism for the future."

So there certainly is a demand constraint impact going on that we're expecting to be bigger in the back half of the year, and we're doing that for the right reasons. 
But in addition, yes, our forecast does contemplate some of those supply chain pressures. We are seeing a little bit of delays in some of our product and that could lead to some cancellations here and there and other pressure points. So we have included that in what we expect in our outlook for the back half of the year to a reasonable degree. So it's a little bit of both."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call.  
At the halfway point of 2021, our better-than-expected results continue to validate that our multiyear transformation is working, with a stronger top and bottom line performance relative to our previous outlook. Perhaps more importantly, we're also driving higher quality growth, margin expansion and greater profitability against our pre-pandemic 2019 results. In fact, diluted earnings per share through the first 6 months of 2021 are greater than the full year 2019. So all in, a great first half.  
Reflecting on the past 18 months amid a historically challenging environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I am incredibly proud of Under Armour's global team and the way we've worked to hold ourselves accountable to our strategic playbook. By continuing to sharpen our focus, the operating model and financial discipline we have ingrained within our culture serve as a constant check and balance to deliver premium products and experiences to our consumers and customers. 
And by driving higher quality revenue through a constant lens of operational excellence and applying what we've learned, consistently refining and orienting towards brand-right profitable growth, means we are better positioned today to drive greater returns to our shareholders than we were before the pandemic started. And yet, with sustained uncertainty related to COVID, which, as of late, is trending unfavorably in key sourcing countries in Southeast Asia, the resiliency we have earned over the last 1.5 years will continue to serve as an asset while we navigate the second half of 2021. 
In this respect, we're focused on the things we can control, staying grounded in our 4 strategic pillars: strengthening the Under Armour brand, improving our operating model, amplifying a DTC-focused approach and increasing our capacity to return greater profitability across the company.  
Starting with strengthening our brand and the proactive decision we've made to reinvest some of this year's upside into additional marketing efforts. This flexibility is empowering us to amplify our middle to top-of-funnel activations geared at increasing awareness, attraction and consideration for the Under Armour brand. As we work to connect with new athletes and inspire existing ones, we are centered on our brand attributes, resilience, hard work, heart and edge.  
In the second half, this will come to light more holistically as we illustrate the journey to compete through the process of training, setting goals, struggling and ultimately realizing the results. Through a team sports lens supported by consistent messaging via The Only Way Is Through, our third quarter activations highlight the importance of mental strength, an often-overlooked aspect of training, and its relationship to unlocking an athlete's full potential. 
Certainly, coming out of a long stretch of COVID restrictions and as team sports hopefully open up more broadly this fall, we believe this is a timely effort to draw consumers into the psyche that is uniquely Under Armour as we work to make them better. So starting this month, via social media, TV and streaming, be on the lookout for Chase Young, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ty Harris and NICKMERCS, among others, helping to highlight mental training and the role it plays in achieving one's personal performance goals. As we say at Under Armour, if you train your mind, you train your game. 
So while there's still more work to be done to unlock our full marketing potential, I am pleased with the progress we're making in aligning our go-to-market with focused performers and the evolving needs of our key retail partners around the world. Not to mention the incremental marketing investments we're making in 2021 are really geared at setting us up for more strong lead in 2022, as awareness and consideration should lead to increased conversion as we strengthen our connectivity.  
In product, our strategy remains firmly rooted in an athletes' journey to sport, leading with insights and data to provide solutions they didn't know they needed and now can't imagine living without. With quite a few product highlights during the quarter, I'd start by recognizing the incredible milestone that our partners at Virgin Galactic achieved a few weeks ago with their commercial flight into space. To play a part in pushing the boundaries of what is possible, we are excited to see what the future holds as new barriers get broken, inspiring all of us to strive for more.  
In Apparel, second quarter highlights included strong sell-through of our Iso-Chill running products, featuring a UA innovation that keeps you cooler in hot conditions. We also saw strong sell-through in Men's Unstoppable bottoms and women's leggings, including Meridian and our No-Slip Waistband technology. We'll also continue to build on this momentum as well with meaningful increases in our Infinity and Crossback products. And we also saw solid results in tops, featuring our RUSH technology. And finally, Project Rock apparel continued to build on its strong momentum as well, with an excellent response to new drops.  
In Footwear, Flow Velociti performed well in all regions, as did HOVR Phantom and Machina 2, including significant growth against last year's already strong performance. Our Charged Pursuit 2 and Assert 9 footwear offerings also posted substantial numbers, demonstrating continued success in our segmentation strategy to bring premium innovations across all price points.  
In Curry, we saw success on and off court with our Curry Flow 8 signature shoe as well as retro styles that we pre-released in APAC, all good signs of momentum as we work towards the launch of the Curry 9 late this year. And finally, the Project Rock 3 shoe, which combines UA HOVR and TriBase technologies for a highly comfortable and stable training platform, was also a standout.  
Switching gears to our next area of focus, which is continuous operating model improvement. Our second quarter results demonstrate once again that our ability to service increased demand with efficient, effective execution is getting better. Creating product at the right price and getting it to the right place at the right time is at the core of how we'll win. To empower this, the adage holds, ""Success is doing the common things uncommonly well."" Simple perhaps, but precisely at the core of our strategic playbook and what we're obsessing on a day-to-day basis.  
Turning to our regions. We believe it's most helpful to compare our results to 2019 since last year's second quarter was an incredibly unique period, and we believe this 2-year stack better represents some of the progress we're making in the overall performance of our business. Starting with North America. I'd underscore how happy we are with improving our ability to drive higher-quality revenue through sharper segmentation, tighter inventory management and delivering consistent service to our customers. Versus 2019, North American revenue was up 11% in the second quarter and about 3% for the first half of the year.  
Now in context, it's important to keep in mind that these comparable periods have some key differences, including a significant increase in our direct-to-consumer business, offset by considerably lower sales to the off-price channel, lower overall promotional and markdown activities and supply constraints engineered to put us in a more advantaged position in the marketplace. All of this, of course, is geared to continuing to lift the Under Armour brand to a more premium level in our largest market. And to that point, as evidenced by our gross margin results, this strategy is working. 
From a channel perspective, we feel good about the pace we're earning back space with our key North American wholesale partners, driving full-price revenue and showing up both digitally and physically in a more comprehensive way than ever before. Revenue from our owned and operated stores is up meaningfully in the quarter versus the same period in 2019 and includes improved quality and composition of sales.  
For the full year, we expect our North American business to be up at a low 20s percentage rate compared to 2020. Versus 2019, North America will be close to the same revenue, which, taking into consideration the factors I mentioned, less off-price, lower discounts and promotions and tighter supply constraints, along with our exit of undifferentiated retail, which starts in Q3, leaves me confident that we're setting ourselves up for improving brand-right profitable growth in 2022 and beyond.  
Turning to our international business. We expect revenue to be up at a mid-30s percentage rate versus 2020 or up at a high 20s percentage rates on a 2-year stack. In our Asia Pacific region, we remain laser-focused on ensuring our brand remains firmly positioned in athletic performance while staying agile in a quickly evolving marketplace. With second quarter revenue up 25% versus 2019 or up 35% for the first half on a 2-year stack, our results gives us confidence that the additional investments we're making into marketing, CRM, digital activations and store expansions are working to drive greater brand affinity amid a highly competitive backdrop.  
Next up is EMEA, a region that is also seeing pockets of COVID resurgence, but also delivered strong growth for Under Armour. Second quarter revenue was up 43% over 2019 and up 44% for the first 6 months on a 2-year stack. Within DTC, we recently upgraded our eCommerce site platform to improve our capabilities and functionality as we focus on driving more seamless shopping experiences for our consumers. EMEA wholesale growth was balanced across our full price and distributor businesses. Looking at the rest of the year, we remain confident that our strategies to drive greater reach and connection to our consumers are working well. 
And finally, our Latin America region, where second quarter revenue was up 17% over 2019 or is up 7% for the first 6 months on a 2-year stack. As discussed on our last call, we have begun transitioning our business in certain countries to a strategic distributor model, which we expect to impact revenue more negatively in the back half of this year. So still working through this transition as we re-architect this business for improved consistency and, we believe, better profitability.  
Switching to our third pillar, which is our focus on elevating our DTC business. With a 33% increase in revenue for the second quarter and a 32% increase for the first half versus 2019, we're pleased to see the results of our multifaceted strategies come to fruition. In conjunction with consumer behavioral shifts throughout the pandemic and an even greater appetite for product and brand experiences that are personalized, unique and premium, we are advancing how we show up in stores and online to meet their needs. 
All of this, of course, starts with our retail and distribution teammates who are at the backbone of our business, playing an essential role in how we serve focused performers. Ensuring that they feel valued and appreciated, we increased our minimum pay rate to $15 per hour in our U.S. business as part of a larger effort that includes professional learning and development opportunities and additional incentive plans. In combination, these actions will allow us to drive better connectivity across the consumer journey. 
From an owned store perspective, we experienced improved traffic trends and higher average selling prices in the quarter, driving better productivity and more normalized promotions. Longer term, we remain focused on building the capabilities necessary to become a best-in-class retailer by creating incredible experiences in our full-priced Brand House stores and better leveraging our Factory House locations to drive greater overall profit.  
In our eCommerce business, revenue was down 18% in the quarter, a result that we anticipated being the most challenging of the year considering the shift to online in 2020 following the retail lockdown. That said, given the work we did to exit the highly promotional elements that this business experienced in 2019, along with the investments we've made in our platforms and teams over the last 18 months, and we're very encouraged by a 53% second quarter increase versus 2019 or a 55% increase for the first 6 months on a 2-year stack. Throw in that we expect our eCommerce business to be up at a high single-digit rate in 2021, and that puts our growth up nearly 50% on a 2-year stack.  
So to wrap it up, I'll end with our last area of focus, driving profitability to increase shareholder value over the long term. Based on our updated full year outlook, which includes revenue being up at a low to mid-single-digit rate versus 2019, and our adjusted EPS being up meaningfully, our strategy to return to profitable brand-right growth is working. With a high quality and composition of revenue, including significantly reduced off-price sales and less promotions and discounting, we're driving more productive dollars through our P&L, dollars that are contributing nicely to margin improvements and greater EPS, demonstrating the results of our transformation and the stronger foundation we have built over the past couple of years.  
And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave."

At the halfway point of 2021, our second quarter results demonstrate that the strategies we've been executing against, and the foundation we've worked hard to reset to increase Under Armour's capacity to return sustainable profitable growth to shareholders, are working. 
Our operational execution has never wavered against an incredibly challenging and dynamic global market, punctuated by COVID over the last 1.5 years. Our attention to Under Armour's focused performers and delivering best-in-class innovations and premium experiences have never been sharper. And all of this has come together to target full year top line, bottom line and working capital performance at better than pre-pandemic levels.  
In the second quarter, revenue was up 91% to $1.4 billion compared to the prior year. Versus our previous outlook, this overdrive was primarily due to higher demand across our Wholesale and Factory House businesses. And of course, in general, our second quarter results were up against last year's significantly restricted retail environment due to the peak of COVID-impacted store closures. 
From a channel perspective, our Wholesale revenue was up 157%, driven by broad-based growth, as we lap the most significant impact from the retail door closures in the prior year. Additionally, most of our Q2 Wholesale overdrive was due to stronger sell-through and higher demand in North America.  
Our direct-to-consumer business increased 52%, led by 234% growth in our owned and operated retail stores, partially offset by an 18% decline in eCommerce, which faced a difficult comp as it was the primary business driver of last year's second quarter. Our licensing revenues were up 276%, driven by increases in our North American partner business.  
By product type, Apparel revenue was up 105%, driven by strength in our train, golf and run categories. Footwear was up 85%, driven by our run and team sports categories. And our Accessories business was up 99%, driven by hats, bags and sports masks.  
From a regional and segment perspective, second quarter revenue in North America was up 101%. In Wholesale, we continue to drive lower markdowns with tighter inventory, enabling fuller-priced sell-through. Within DTC, we saw strength in our owned and operated stores given the easier comparison to the prior year when most of our locations were closed for the quarter. This was partially offset by a decline in our eCommerce business, which, conversely, was up against a particularly tough comparison to last year.  
In EMEA, revenue was up 133%, driven by growth in Wholesale and DTC, with significant strength across our wholesale and distributor partners. Revenue in Asia Pacific was up 56%, with balanced growth across all channels. And in Latin America, revenue was up 317%, driven primarily by lapping the store closures in the prior year. As we move into the back half of the year, we expect the transition of certain countries to distributor models to negatively impact top line performance, particularly in the fourth quarter.  
Second quarter gross margin came in better than expected, improving 20 basis points to 49.5%, driven by 570 basis points of pricing improvements due to lower promotional activity within our DTC channel, along with lower promotions and markdowns within our Wholesale business, which was significantly impacted by the pandemic in the prior year, and 100 basis points of benefit due to changes in foreign currency. 
Offsetting these improvements was a 460 basis point negative impact from channel mix, primarily driven by a lower mix of eCommerce and a larger mix of Wholesale, including a higher percentage of off-price sales than last year when this channel was essentially closed for most of the quarter. Additionally, we realized 170 basis points of negative gross margin impact related to the absence of MyFitnessPal, which will remain a headwind throughout 2021. 
And finally, a 10 basis point negative impact within supply chain as our continued benefits and product costs were more than offset by higher freight and logistics costs due to developing COVID-related supply chain pressures. Overall, versus our previous outlook for second quarter gross margin, we experienced lower-than-planned promotions enabled through higher demand, along with driving more favorable pricing.  
SG&A expenses were up 14% to $545 million, primarily due to higher marketing costs and expenses tied to store operations, given most retail locations were closed throughout the second quarter of 2020. Relative to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded $3 million of charges in the second quarter, an amount less than we had anticipated due to the timing of specific executions such as the realization of lease and contract terminations. Throughout the plan thus far, we've realized $483 million of pretax restructuring and related charges. 
As detailed last September, this plan contemplates total charges ranging from $550 million to $600 million. It's important to note that all remaining charges are related to initiatives outlined in 2020, meaning nothing new has been added in 2021. For the quarter -- for the third quarter, we expect to realize approximately $40 million to $50 million in charges related to this plan. 
Moving on. Our second quarter operating income was $121 million. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted operating income was $124 million. After tax, we realized a net income of $59 million or $0.13 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, loss on extinguishment of $250 million in principal amount of senior convertible notes and the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes, our adjusted net income was $110 million or $0.24 of adjusted diluted earnings per share.  
In this respect, we are proud to report that in the first half of 2021, we have already surpassed our full year 2019 diluted earnings per share. So in a great position to finish out 2021 with strength against pre-pandemic levels. Inventory at the end of the second quarter was down 26% to $881 million as we continue to drive improvements throughout our operating model, along with experiencing some inbound shipping delays due to COVID-related supply chain pressures.  
Our cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we had no borrowings under our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. With respect to debt,  during the second quarter, we entered into exchange agreements with certain convertible bondholders for $250 million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes and terminated certain related capped call transactions. We utilized net $247 million in cash, issued 11 million shares of our Class C stock and recorded a related loss of approximately $35 million, which is captured in other income and expenses. Post this transaction, $250 million of our convertible bonds remain outstanding.  
Next, let's move on to our updated 2021 outlook, where, based on better-than-expected performance in our second quarter, we flowed through the upside for a meaningful increase for our full year. That said, although recent consumer trends continued to track positively, we remain cautious with demand and the overall marketplace due to both the COVID-19 pandemic and developing manufacturing and logistics challenges in key sourcing countries in Southeast Asia. 
Accordingly, today's outlook is subject to our business continuing under the same general macros we've seen most recently, with no significant shutdowns of manufacturing partners or retail or logistics disruptions, along with continuing improvements within the global retail landscape as we progress through the second half of 2021. That said, let's start at the top with revenue, which we now expect to be up at a low 20s percentage rate for the full year. This reflects a low 20s percentage increase in North America and a mid-30s percentage increase in our international business. 
For gross margin, on a GAAP basis, we expect the full year rate to be up 50 to 70 basis points against our 2020 adjusted gross margin of 48.6%, with benefits from pricing and benefits from changes in foreign currency being partially offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal, which carried a high gross margin rate, along with higher expected freight expenses. The gross margin improvement relative to our previous outlook is due to improving benefits within pricing, partially offset by increased freight expense related to port congestion and logistics costs, which remains a rapidly evolving situation. 
Versus 2020, we expect a high single-digit rate increase in SG&A, a rate that is less than half that of our revenue growth. As laid out previously, it's important to remember that specific to 2021, we are taking advantage of our improved outlook and proactively making incremental investments, particularly in marketing, to build even deeper connections with our consumers. Additionally, the other significant part of the overall increase in SG&A is higher incentive compensation, which is up against 2020 when we realized significant reductions against target levels. 
All in, of this expected high single-digit rate increase in SG&A in 2021, on an absolute dollar basis, about 1/2 of this is related to incremental marketing, 1/3 related to higher incentive compensation and the balance related to our other underlying SG&A. On a 2-year stack, the most significant drivers of SG&A dollar growth are the incremental marketing investments and higher incentive compensation we expect in 2021. Beyond these items, our underlying SG&A is planned to be up only slightly against 2019's base. As we look ahead, remaining disciplined around SG&A and striking the right balance between growth, productivity and profitability is our top priority.  
With that, we now expect operating income to reach $215 million to $225 million this year or $340 million to $350 million on an adjusted basis. Translated to rate, we expect to deliver an operating margin of approximately 4% or an adjusted operating margin just north of 6% in 2021. All of this takes us to an expected diluted earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.16 or, excluding restructuring charges, the loss on early extinguishment of convertible senior notes and noncash amortization of debt discount on these convertible senior notes, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52 in 2021.  
In summary, our full year outlook reflects the combination of the overdrive we've realized in the first half of 2021, along with improvements across our business, positioning us to deliver growth and stronger profitability relative to 2019. Next, before giving more color on how we're thinking about the balance of the year, I'll highlight some headwinds that impact us more directly in the second half of 2021, including lower expected sales of our sports masks, supply and demand constraints, the absence of MyFitnessPal, lower expected sales to the off-price channel, changes to our Latin American operating model and the exit of undifferentiated retail, which began in the third quarter.  
Looking at quarterly flow, we expect third quarter revenue to be up at a low single-digit rate and the fourth quarter to be relatively flat to finish out the year. Next, we expect third quarter gross margin to be up 130 to 150 basis points due to pricing benefits and channel mix as we anticipate lower promotional activity and lower sales to the off-price channel. These benefits will be partially offset by the absence of MyFitnessPal, higher expected freight costs and changes in product mix driven by lower sales of sports masks.  
For the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin to be down due to negative impacts from the absence of MyFitnessPal, channel mix driven by lower licensing revenue and product mix driven by a higher percentage of footwear and lower sales of sports masks. Bringing this to the bottom line, we expect third quarter adjusted operating income to be $95 million to $105 million or $0.13 to $0.15 of adjusted diluted earnings per share.  
So to close out, operational excellence, flexibility, a strong balance sheet and consistent financial management, when combined, form a model that's allowed us to transcend pandemic challenges proficiently. Looking at the next 6 months and the set up all these accomplishments provide for us going into 2022, we believe Under Armour is well positioned to deliver on our next chapter of profitable growth.

I see now the results of that really playing into it. And that, in combination with the demand constraints that we've put in to make sure we're putting the right product in the right place at the right time, is playing out with the consistent messaging that we've been able to deliver against.  
And I think the consumer patterns, of course, were very hard to predict in 2021 versus 2020. And I think we have been pleased with how the consumer has returned, to some degree, right, into the full-price retail and our outlets and also continued to shop online. Our ability to fulfill demand in terms of doing a better job, of delivering a better experience, better product, better messaging more consistently is really what you're starting to see the effect of. So really, at the essence of it is our strategy is working, and we're able to execute against it.

And today, Vietnam, for example, that you mentioned, is about 1/3 at what we do, but it's split, right, a little bit between apparel and footwear. And it's important to note that we also have a good presence in Europe, Middle East and as well as South America, Latin America, in terms of our sourcing strategy. So we're well balanced. 
Does that mean we're not going to have potential issues developing? Well, we've -- in our outlook here, given the -- our current view, of course, things will continue to develop. But again, agility here and a well-balanced sourcing platform probably puts us in a -- maybe a little bit better position than most, but it's going to be a developing situation."

I think Dave and I and the team now are starting to feel really comfortable with the capabilities that we've put in place in terms of our ability to read and react as it relates to the messaging and the media that we're seeing through our roaming models. And what that means now for the back half, and one of the reasons that we're choosing to invest, is that we're understanding so much better what happens to every dollar that we put into the marketplace. 
And we have seen an opportunity based on not just the first half this year, but also the back half of last year in the investments we've made, that there's an opportunity for us to drive media's efficiency more in the upper funnel. So that means perhaps not so much driving more revenue this year, but really preparing ourselves for the future. 
So putting money into the top of the funnel, so to speak, to drive the brand, which will give us a payoff down the line. And we're not just doing that in North America. We're doing it also in Europe, in specific countries, as well as in China. And we believe that that's really important for us right now, to continue to enhance the brand. And we believe that, with the capabilities that we've built, we're now able to do that in a very measured and strategic way and looking forward to ramping it up here in the back half."

I mean if you think about playing out the back half of this year, we mentioned a lot of the back half headwinds around whether it be MyFitnessPal, demand constraints, exiting undifferentiated retail, et cetera, that are going on in the back half from a revenue perspective. We also mentioned some of the pressure on gross margin in the back half relative to some of the additional freight and logistics costs, et cetera. So some of those things are coming into play in the back half of this year. 
And then also, as Patrik just highlighted, we're heavying up marketing a fair amount in the back half of the year as well from a spend perspective. And then last, I would just point out that as DTC is a higher percentage, as we get towards Q4, that brings with it more operating and SG&A costs as well. So there's a lot of things coming into play relative to kind of the tempering operating margin in the back half of the year versus the front half of the year. 
As we think about playing that forward, we are absolutely driving down that profitable growth journey now, and we're excited about that. And we do believe that we will be able to get to a double-digit operating margin in the future. We're not ready to speak to what year that will be, but I mean, there are a lot of different opportunities to be able to get there, whether it's continued improvement on kind of gross-to-net revenue with the health of the business that we're driving, whether it be continued gross margin opportunities relative to DTC mix increasing and continued scale and costing benefits from that. 
And then also, obviously, we've done so much work on the SG&A and cost base front that we really look forward to being able to leverage that heavily as we step into '22 and beyond. So a lot of different opportunities there that we'll be excited to be able to speak more to in the future."

And I'd just like to point out here, specifically in the run category, I think, in the last few years, we've done a great job instilling a franchise mindset on our HOVR platform, where we now have 6 or 7 franchises. And we're now into things like the Sonic 4 and the Machina 2 and the Infinite 3 and so forth. And this year, layering on top of that in a pandemic year, kind of halfway post pandemic year, whatever you want to call it, actually an elevated expression in terms of a franchise with the flow that came out in early spring that did incredibly well, what was interesting for us was the fact that the HOVR platform continued to perform incredibly well, especially the Machina at $150. So we have now a running shoe at $160. And we just introduced the Flow Velociti FC a few weeks ago, and that is also cranking. 
So I think it isn't as easy as saying that we're just following the trend. I think that we're doing all of the things I just talked about with constrained demand, with making sure that we are being -- running a better play in terms of profitability and execution. So it's really truly, I think, a holistic approach from Under Armour.

I don't know. I think your guess is as good as mine. 
I think the way we're approaching it, though, is the fact that what I've seen from our teams here at Under Armour is an incredible resiliency and an ability to adapt and be agile in this pandemic situation. And it's built that resiliency for us. So we're ready to be able to navigate the twists and turns here on the road going forward with that agility. And the new operating model we have. We have very strong leadership that are able to execute at every level. 
But we do believe, and that's what Dave called out in his remarks, that it's going to be twists and turns in the road here as we look in the back half of this year for sure. And it's going to be a little bit different depending on where you are. Europe is in and out a little bit. North America is still holding, but probably it's going to be a few twists and turns. And then we have the supply chain in Southeast Asia to deal with. So it's a very fluid moment right now, I think, in terms of what's going to happen next."

I think this increased laser focus that we have on consumer centricity is also helping us understand how to cadence things, how to tune things and how to really drive not just our innovation, but our go-to-market holistically.  
So we have now learned, as a brand, how to drive franchises in Footwear. We have also learned how to drive specific initiatives like Curry, like the Rock. But we've also learned how to do all of that, executing excellently, all the way upstream.

And what's exciting is some of the examples I've given already in terms of footwear, for example. 
The ability for us to push upward, right, in terms of the $160 Flow, for example, that just came out this year. And we tend to forget that, if you back up to 2018 when we launched the HOVR platform, which was really our first foray into a concerted effort at driving into the run category and Footwear category, if you like, we started at that point at $100 and $120. We then took ourselves up into $130, $150. And then we now went up into $160. 
That kind of thinking and progression, as we drive franchises also in Apparel, whether it is in our RUSH technology or in our Iso-Chill technology, is the same sort of thinking, right?  We're building franchises. We're building ability to drive the AURs up over time as the brand gets stronger. And the teams are now doing an excellent job of orchestrating that play. 
Because it is an orchestration at the end of the day. You've got to do it in a very determined and appropriate way and everything's got to come together. And I think that is what you see, is an ability to execute on that from the brand, so that should give everybody optimism for the future."

So there certainly is a demand constraint impact going on that we're expecting to be bigger in the back half of the year, and we're doing that for the right reasons.  
But in addition, yes, our forecast does contemplate some of those supply chain pressures. We are seeing a little bit of delays in some of our product, and that could lead to some cancellations here and there and other pressure points.

In the third quarter, higher-than-expected demand for the Under Armour brand and outstanding execution from our global team allowed us to drive strong top and bottom line results. Everything we do at Under Armour is based on driving sustainable long-term growth while at the same time, ensuring we're setting a solid foundation to deliver near-term value to our shareholders. This is the balance you should expect from us and is the commitment we work towards every day. 
We strike this balance by leveraging our strategic playbook across key elements of our business, including a consumer-centric strategy to drive deep, authentic and emotional connections with focused performers, innovative products and experiences that advantage and inspire an athlete's journey, a constant focus on operational excellence to ensure we manage the marketplace efficiently and steady financial discipline to create meaningful levers to drive greater profitability. 
These strengths were evident in our third quarter results with revenue up 8%, gross margin up 310 basis points to a record 51% and solid adjusted EPS performance at $0.31. In this spirit, as we work to close out 2021, I feel good about the progress we've made, the resiliency we've earned and the potential we have to do even better in the future. 
Demand for our product and consideration for our brand is growing. That gives me confidence that despite potential impact from near-term headwinds, the long-term opportunities before us and our ability to compete and win in an ever-changing global landscape are stronger than ever. Of course, it all starts with brand, so with that, let's get into some third quarter highlights, starting with the incremental investments we're making in marketing and how they're translating to improving brand affinity from our focus on consumer awareness, attraction and consideration. 
As part of our Holistic Journey to Compete strategy, which centers on goal setting, training and what it takes to earn results, we use the team sports lens to focus on the importance of metal strength as an unlock to realize one's full potential. Through Uniquely Under Armour execution by our social media, TV, retail and digital activations, the only way is through and train your mine train your game showed up as one global brand and voice across categories, channels and our marketing funnel. Coming off this effort, we've now shifted gears into fourth quarter activation, which is centered on cold weather training. Knowing athletes sometimes see cold as their cryptonite, our human performance research lab is helping equip them and reshape this type of training as an asset to take their performance to new levels. Validated by the experiences of our most elite athletes, we're inspiring and educating focused performers for the winter ahead with powerful storytelling, workout routines, product reviews and premium retail capsules, our ecosystem is well set to inspire and capitalize on growing demand. 
Turning to product. Given the third quarter bridge summer and fall, we realized success on both sides of the temperature spectrum, including solid sell-through of our Iso-Chill apparel products, which cool you; and fleece, which saw strength in men's and youth as athletes gear up for the cooler months ahead. There's also continued momentum in men's unstoppable bottoms and women's leggings, including Meridian and our no slip waste ban technology. And finally, the Project Rock collection and tops featuring Rush also built on their year-to-date momentum, so consistency in some of our best sellers. In footwear, our core running products, including Pursuit, Aurora and ASER saw strength in all regions globally. Additionally, Project Rock performed well, and we had success in our slides business. Regionally, a few of the highlights included the Curry Hover splash and mega clone and APAC, Hoverstreet and Banded Trail and EMEA and Flow Velocity SC and cleated footwear in the Americas, driven by better-than-expected back-to-school demand as team sports returned. 
Let's turn next to our regions, starting with North America, where revenue was up 8% to $1 billion, indicative of improving brand health in our largest market, we had stronger-than-expected back-to-school and direct-to-consumer demand. In fact, North America drove the majority of the third quarter overdelivery for the company, so encouraging to see continued progress here. Compared to 2019, North American revenue was up 2% in the third quarter. It is important, however, to revisit some key differences in these comparable periods, 2021 North America versus 2019, including a significant increase in our direct-to-consumer business, substantially lower off-price sales, reduced promotional and markdown activities, proactive supply constraints and undifferentiated wholesale exits. So all in, meaningfully higher quality and more productive dollars going through our P&L now than just 2 years ago. 
Turning to our international business. Revenue in our Asia Pacific region was up 19%, driven primarily by wholesale growth. Given some of the recent market trends, particularly in China, where traffic continues to struggle, our consumer insights data tells us that our brand health is holding steady in an otherwise dynamic environment. We attribute this to the investments we're making into marketing, CRM and store expansions, including opening our 1,000th store in the region. 
Versus 2019, third quarter APAC revenue was up 37%, so solid progress on a 2-year stack. Next up is EMEA, where revenue was up 15%, driven by wholesale, which saw continued momentum from our distributor partnerships and a solid direct-to-consumer performance. In our 2 most prominent countries in this region, the U.K. and Germany,  we remain focused on brand development, building long-term relationships with our key wholesale partners and strengthening our direct-to-consumer team and retail capabilities. EMEA wholesale growth was balanced across our full price and distributor businesses. Versus 2019, third quarter revenue in EMEA was up 50%. 
And finally, our Latin America region was up 27%, driven by strength in our full-price wholesale and distributor businesses. Versus 2019, third quarter revenue in Latin America was up 8%. As previously detailed, we are transitioning certain countries in this region to a strategic distributor model, of which most of this change takes place in the fourth quarter. Accordingly,  we expect top line pressure in Latin America as we finish out 2021. 
Another highlight is the performance of our direct-to-consumer business, which was up 12%. And although traffic trends were somewhat mixed in our own stores and narrowed various COVID restrictions around the world, we continue to see improvements in average selling prices and productivity. Due to higher-than-expected demand during the quarter, we further reduced promotions and realized higher price sell-through, which, of course, you see in our gross margin results. Versus 2019, direct-to-consumer was up 31% for the third quarter. Overall, we're pleased that our strategies towards improved presentation and experiences in our stores and online are driving better economics throughout this business. 
So in summary,  we're pleased with our third quarter performance and our ability to close up what would be Under Armour and split adjusted EPS here in our history. In the near term, however, we remain both confident and cautious with several fluid headwinds continuing to impact nearly every sector, it's important to remember that Under Armour is battle-tested and mission proven. I am incredibly proud of our global team and how we work to maintain balance and trajectory regardless of what has thrown our way. We continue to get sharper, smarter and more efficient. Across our business, by channel, product or region, there remains one constant: we obsess the intersection of -- Under Armour serving focused performers, industry-leading innovations, premium experiences, heart-led but data-driven, we empower the stage strive for more. And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave."

With 3 quarters of the year behind us,  our strong third quarter results demonstrate our ability to execute quickly to meet the needs of our consumers and customers, all while driving toward record revenue and earnings in 2021. So let's dive right into our results. Compared to the prior year, revenue was up 8% to $1.5 billion. Versus our previous outlook, this overdrive was primarily due to higher demand across our full-price wholesale and Factory House businesses in North America. 
Patrik covered our regional performance earlier, so now let's click down into our channel results on a global basis. Third quarter wholesale revenue was up 10%, driven by higher-than-expected demand in our full-price business, particularly in North American wholesale, which was tempered by a reduction in sales to the off-price channel as we continue to work to elevate our brand positioning. Our direct-to-consumer business increased 12%, led by 21% growth in our owned and operated retail stores, partially offset by a 4% decline in e-commerce, which faced a difficult comparison to last year's third quarter. But I would also note that when compared to the third quarter of 2019, our e-commerce business was up over 50%.  And licensing revenue was up 24%, driven by improving strength within our North American partner businesses. By product type, apparel revenue was up 14% with strength across all categories, particularly in train and golf. Footwear was up 10%, driven primarily by strength in running. And our accessories business was down 13% due to lower sales of our sports masks compared to last year's third quarter. 
Relative to gross margin,  our third quarter improved 310 basis points over last year, landing at 51%. This expansion was driven by 400 basis points of pricing improvements due primarily to lower promotional activity within our DTC channel, along with lower promotions and markdowns within our wholesale business and 120 basis points of benefit due to channel mix, primarily related to lower mix of off-price sales versus last year's third quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was about 100 basis points of negative impact related to the absence of My Fitness Pal and 90 basis points of negative impacts from higher freight and logistics costs due to COVID-related supply chain pressures. Versus our previous expectation, our higher-than-expected Q3 gross margin improvement was primarily due to lower-than-planned promotional activity within our DTC business and more favorable pricing related to sales to our off-price partners. 
SG&A expenses were up 8% to $599 million due to increased marketing investments, incentive compensation and nonsalaried workforce wages. Relative to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded $17 million of charges in the third quarter. In this morning's press release, we noted that we have reduced our plan expectations by $25 million. So we now expect to recognize total planned charges ranging from $525 million to $575 million. Thus far, we've realized $500 million of pretax restructuring and related charges. As a reminder, all remaining charges are related to initiatives outlined in 2020, meaning nothing new has been added in 2021. We expect to recognize any remaining charges related to this plan by the first calendar quarter of 2022. 
Moving on. Our third quarter operating income was $172 million. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted operating income was $189 million. After tax, we realized a net income of $113 million or $0.24 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, loss on extinguishment of $169 million in principal amount of senior convertible notes and the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes. Our adjusted net income was $145 million, or $0.31 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
In this respect, we are excited to report that the $0.71 of adjusted diluted earnings per share that we've realized year-to-date has surpassed our highest previous full year split adjusted earnings, thus solid traction and excellent progress. Inventory was down 21% to $838 million, driven by improvements in our operating model and inbound shipping delays due to COVID-related supply chain pressures. Our cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we had no borrowings under our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. 
With respect to debt, during the third quarter, we entered into exchange agreements with certain convertible bondholders for $169 million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes and terminated certain related cap call transactions. We utilized net $168 million in cash issued 7.7 million shares of our Class C stock and recorded a related loss of approximately $24 million, which is captured in other income and expenses. 
Following this transaction and our actions in the second quarter, $81 million of convertible notes remain outstanding. Now moving on to the balance of the year. As we noted earlier in this call, the current global retail environment remains varied with some markets realizing a steadier return to growth like in the Americas, albeit with continued weak traffic trends, somewhat mixed environments across different regions in EMEA and conservative assumptions about APAC as it navigates ongoing phases of closures, reopenings and restrictions. Factoring in the current supply chain challenges emanating from Southeast Asia and logistics challenges being experienced worldwide we're staying appropriately cautious in the near term. However, it is important to note that today's revised outlook assumes no additional shutdowns of manufacturing partners or further retail sector disruptions as we close out 2021. 
Now turning to our updated 2021 outlook. Let's start with revenue, which we now expect to be up approximately 25% for the full year. This reflects a high 20s percentage rate increase in North America and a mid-30s increase in our international business. From a channel perspective, wholesale is expected to be up at a mid-30s rate, and our DTC business up at a mid-20s rate with e-commerce up at a low single-digit rate for the full year against 2020. Concerning our top line expectation for the fourth quarter, the same significant headwinds from our last call remain in play. In addition to the developing COVID-related supply chain issues currently facing the sector. 
Turning to gross margin. On a GAAP basis, we expect the full year rate to be up approximately 130 basis points against our 2020 adjusted gross margin of 48.6%, with benefits from pricing and changes in foreign currency being partially offset by higher expected freight expenses and the sale of MyFitnessPal, which carried a high gross margin rate. The gross margin improvement relative to our previous outlook is primarily due to pricing benefits, partially offset by increased freight expenses related to supply chain challenges, which we continue to monitor. Versus 2020, we now expect that full year SG&A will be up 6% to 7%. 
As laid out previously, specific to 2021, we have taken advantage of our improved results and proactively made incremental investments, particularly in marketing, to build even deeper connections with our consumers. We also expect higher incentive compensation, which is up against 2020 when we had significant reductions against target levels as well as higher nonsalaried wages. With that, we now expect operating income to reach approximately $425 million this year or $475 million on an adjusted basis. Translated to rate, we expect to deliver an operating margin of just under 8% or an adjusted operating margin of approximately 8.5% in 2021. 
All of this takes us to an expected diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.55 or adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.74 in 2021, with an average weighted diluted share count of approximately 468 million shares. And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we expect to end the year with inventory relatively flat against 2020's year-end, and we expect to close the year with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
Looking forward, a reminder that we are changing our fiscal reporting year in 2022. Mechanically, the first calendar quarter will serve as a transition period until we begin our new fiscal year 2023 and on April 1. Accordingly, we are not providing color for next year on today's call. That said, there are supply chain pressures that are challenging the industry in the near term. And while we believe the impact to our P&L in 2021 are expected to be relatively minimal, we are taking precautions to navigate some of the volatility and anticipated business disruptions in the first half of 2022, including the work we began in the second quarter of 2021 to adjust orders and shipping with our factory partners and logistics suppliers, working with wholesale customers to narrow and edit our spring/summer 2022 order book and assessing various mitigation offsets for inflationary pressures, including elevated logistics costs and higher wages. Given this situation is still fluid, it is difficult to estimate the full extent of potential effects on our business at this point. However, on what we know -- based on what we know today, we are forecasting material impacts to the first half of 2022. And therefore, with respect to the first calendar quarter, we expect revenue to be up at a low single-digit rate. Concerning a longer-term view, as of this week, nearly all factories that Under Armour does business with, including those in Vietnam are open. So definitely encouraging news. Of course, full capacity will take some time to ramp back up, and this is only one part of the equation. 
Over the next several quarters, we expect longer-than-usual transit times as backlogs and congestion find balance. So this may create some variability in our results. That said, the proactive strategies we're employing, greater operational agility and overall demand for the Under Armour brand give us confidence in our ability to navigate effectively through the coming environment. With that, I'd like to close today's call by returning to Patrik's opening thought and the balance we are committed to striking between driving sustainable long-term growth while delivering near-term value to our shareholders. All global companies operate in a constantly changing environment. And over the past few years, through our transformation and the pandemic,  Under Armour has demonstrated its ability to effectively manage our business under a range of conditions. 
Lastly, as we look to close out the strongest top and bottom line performance in our history,  the work we've done to rearchitect our strategy, operations and financial discipline sets us up well to leverage this balance and thus create improved value for our shareholders over the long term. With that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?"

Relative to the supply chain impacts in Q4, as I had mentioned, almost all of our -- the vaccination rates across Asia continue to trend up. And it's really kind of now pushing down the line a little bit where the congestion and container availability at the origin ports have improved, but the local ports of entry is where the bigger challenges are developing that we're monitoring. 
To date, we've seen some timing changes in inbound product and how we can get that out to our partners, but we haven't seen any cancellations. And so the forecast and the outlook that we've given for the rest of the year in Q4, we feel good about. But it's definitely a very fluid situation. Relative to calendar Q1, this really relates to the factories getting up and running, but not at full capacity and that creating a challenge to be able to produce all the orders needed to meet our demand. So we've actually had to cancel some of our purchase orders relative to Spring/Summer '22 product to be able to alleviate some of that pressure on the factories. And based on that, and therefore, the change in inbound product to be able to go out, that's where we're saying the impact is driving us towards what we see as of today as a low single-digit growth rate for calendar Q1."

You see a balance between wholesale and DTC. You see also balance across the categories in terms of footwear and apparel. We also now saw, specifically here in the third quarter, the back-to-school happening again in a more normal fashion, I guess, you could say, in terms of team sports being played, and Under Armour really coming into its own with the performance we saw now in things like cleated product and team product as well. So across the board, whether it's team sports, train or run, men's or women's, we are able to really drive our brand in all of those different categories and areas.

And that all ties into our longer-term strategy of continuing to drive the brand to a more premium position. So we're definitely excited about the momentum to be able to do that and the sell-through that is allowing for that as well. We are also looking at ticket pricing also when you think about some of the inflationary pressures, wage pressures, et cetera. So we have a team that's been looking at that, and we're going to be very strategic and targeted in how we might do that, but we do think that there is some MSRP opportunities for us as well based on our premium positioning and the quality of certain groups of our products versus others.

I don't know that we would be able to affect too much of that for spring/summer. But when you think more about fall/winter of next year, there's probably a bigger opportunity there based on life cycle and time line. And we're excited about that. We think we're earning that in certain areas, and that's where we're going to go after it. But it will be very strategic, very targeted. And in general, we are looking to continue to improve our gross margin percentage as we go forward."

Relative to the whole third-party off-price channel, we have embarked for the last couple of years on continuing to kind of wean that down to really get into that 3% to 4% range of revenue. We're excited that this year, we've been able to basically drive it down to a planned level of about 3% this year. And that obviously creates a little bit of a tailwind on gross margin percentage with that mix of business coming down. 
And then outside of that, we've tightened up our supply chain process. We've employed some demand constraints. All of those things are helping to keep the brand more premium, but they're also helping to reduce the amount of excess that we create. So overall, just a tighter process based on our new operating model. And therefore, we feel better about being able to move a lot of that excess through our own factory health stores and more of a brand right way and also in a more profitable way. 
I would say that the other piece of it is that as we have reduced the amount that we're selling to the third-party off-price channel, the demand for the brand continues and is strong. And so those partners would like more product. And when they want more, and we don't have as much to give, generally, that means that they're going to pay a little bit more to us. And so we're seeing that benefit even on the smaller amount that we are selling to them, we're getting better prices, which has helped the gross margins as well. And we plan to continue as we go forward to manage it in that 3% to 4% mix of revenue globally. So going forward, it really shouldn't be much of a revenue headwind or tailwind or a gross margin headwind or tailwind in general going forward. It's just a small piece of our business that we maintain going forward."

So in other words, we readjusted ourselves to a level that we felt would be able to sustain the growth that we were planning. And we're still at that level. And  the way we think about it going forward is really in a balanced way. In other words, we will invest in SKUs where we see opportunity, but we're also very diligent about taking things out through our life management cycle for our products, ensuring that we're not getting on top of our SKUs in terms of the balance of this holistically across the company. 
The other interesting thing is also the fact that at that point in time in '17, '18 in our first round of transformation, we also took down our trims and our materials, both by about 80%. And we've been able to maintain those levels, too. So coming back a little bit to what Dave talked about previously here in terms of our operating model and our efficiencies because we now have a way to make sure that we are holding ourselves accountable to what different products should be doing in our line to help grow the brand and the business, the teams are doing an excellent job maintaining the discipline. And as a consequence, we'll grow our SKUs a little bit as we grow as a brand going forward, but it's always going to be in a controlled way where we're holding ourselves accountable."

We have a balanced portfolio in terms of how we think about sourcing, first of all,  in terms of what's happening right now, the factories have been closed, especially impacting the industry, I would say, out of Vietnam because there is a mix of apparel and footwear that's coming out of there, especially South Vietnam. All those factories are now -- at least our factories are open. However, it's going to take the remainder of this year to really get them ramped up to full capacity and full speed. 
So for us, in terms of how we think about what's really going to be affecting us going forward more so because we've taken actions already to let's say, prune our order books for the beginning of next year to make sure that we're able to deliver against the expectation of our partners and our own direct consumer. 
What we're seeing now is more of a logistics and transportation challenge. And the majority, we believe in the medium term here, in other words, from the end of this coming quarter going forward is going to be inbound more so than outbound. And that has to do with just congestion at every step of the chain, right, whether it's a container or a chassis or access to port or unloading a port and then the entire journey once it lands in inbound. So we see the logistics and shipment being the biggest concern for us, let's say, in the medium term here as we turn the corner into '22."

We see some minimal impacts for Q4 of this year, which is already assumed in the outlook we gave, definitely incurring a fair amount more in inbound freight costs to get things here and catch up a little bit. And that is an impact for Q4 on gross margin. And then calendar Q1 and calendar Q2 is probably where we see a little bit of the bigger revenue impact because of the canceled POs to be able to realistically get the factories back up and caught up and not be missing POs to customers. So we've worked with our customers on those PO cancellations. So that's a bigger impact on calendar Q1 and calendar Q2. 
And then after that, it should start to dissipate, and we're continuing to work through it. So I think we have really good partnerships with our suppliers.

And really, this year, to pivot a little bit into your second question around marketing, we've really activated against this concept of the journey to compete through the same campaign that we started last year, the only way is through change your game and being on the offensive. 
And I think for us, that marketing spend and the activation that we're able to do is being done much better now. And it's being done better because we understand through our return on marketing investment models that we're able to run, how to do it better. So we're more effective, we're more efficient, and it's having a better effect on the consumer as we're activating against it.

But I would say that although we're going to run a higher percentage of revenue this year, we do expect to be able to leverage marketing as a percentage of revenue as we go into next year and the following year because we need to leverage every area of our cost structure going forward, and we feel confident about being able to do that and still get more return and more bang for the buck based on what we've been doing this year. And based on all the ROI work we've been doing from a marketing perspective and changing the mix and how we spend through the restructuring activities as well. 
So you will probably see some leverage in marketing as a percentage of revenue as we go into next year and beyond. But I don't think you will see any decrease in the power of our marketing. If anything, you should see an increase in the power."

I think Dave, if you've got any additional comments once I've commented on this. I think, in general, in terms of the operating ability that we currently have, the agility that we have and the improvements we've made in our supply chain and our vendor base over the last years have now put us in a position where we can go both ways. We've talked a little bit here today about our ability to navigate through a pandemic where we had to scale our orders back by 30% and then ramping it up again for '21 and kind of going through what is now a logistic and transportation quagmire and navigating through that, adjusting again our order base a little bit for first half of '22. All of those different things are not possible unless you run an efficient and effective machine. And I think that's what you're really seeing from Under Armour at this point in time. 
It's an ability to navigate anything that's thrown at us and do so in the most efficient way possible. Just think about the last 2 quarters. I mean, our inventory position in the last quarter was down 26%. It's now down 21%. And we're guiding to a flattish end to the year. I think that is a testament to how we're able to navigate and understand demand much better and then throwing that over to supply chain to execute more efficiently and better. 
And I think also, going back to what Dave talked about earlier as it relates to our off-price or what we're selling into that channel, being also able to manage that in combination with how we think about our wholesale and our own direct-to-consumer. All of that coming together and being able to navigate the last 2 years, should give you an indication of the ability of this team's ability to execute. Dave, I don't know if you want to add a bit to that."

We are, I would say, employing every lever possible to try and mitigate as best we can and keep the experience to our customers and our consumers strong. So  we have used a fair -- a lot of air freight this year, which we're not excited about, but it's a necessary thing with the challenges that we're all being faced with. 
And I think as we approach next year, we would expect the use of airfreight to be something that we would still employ probably not as much as we did in this year in 2021, but still more than pre-COVID 2020. And I would say that, that is probably going to be more front half calendar 2022-focused, which will put a little bit of pressure on gross margin, but is helping us to mitigate some of those challenges from a timing perspective and try and keep that impact from being not as significant. So it is a work in process. 
There's a lot of pieces to that puzzle as we're driving through. But our supply chain has been excellent in working with our partners, not just the factories but also our logistics providers to mitigate this as best we can.

But I think China, we're still seeing COVID effects, if you like, in terms of how the consumer is navigating the landscape there are lots of ins and outs on a, I would say, weekly or monthly basis in terms of localized closures as it relates to brick-and-mortar. And the traffic in terms of -- full-price traffic really has not returned to pre-COVID levels yet. It's just the way it is. And I think we're also seeing somewhat of a tempered traffic pattern in e-commerce. And I think that is -- a lot of that has to do with the big platforms, right? Tmall and JD that are seeing also a diminished traffic pattern on their platform. So the digital landscape in China is shifting. You're seeing surgeons of smaller platforms and commercial ventures starting up around these bigger platforms. 
The good news for us, I guess, is that we've made a lot of investments into our digital teams over there over the last few years. And when we feel that we're able to navigate this new landscape, but it is a varied landscape and it isn't necessarily 100% clear how this holiday period is going to pan out in China. So there's a softness, I would say, in the traffic patterns in China right now."

I think that you're seeing more of a discounted environment in China right now in APAC and with softness in traffic patterns. In Europe, we see a pretty interesting phenomenon where actually the consumer has gone back to brick-and-mortar more strongly than we would have anticipated. Actually, creating a bit of softness in the e-commerce digital channels, not just for us but also for the pure players in Europe. So the consumer really is enjoying being back out and shopping in stores, and they're doing so at a, let's say, premium level. So not really a very discounted level. 
And in North America, I think the consumer has stayed in digital and have continued to go back at higher rates in terms of traffic to the stores. And at a more -- and less discounts at an elevated level for us. So I think it's a mixed bag across the world. The 3 regions are behaving a little bit differently right now, which makes it a little bit challenging perhaps to, let's say, understand exactly how they're going to navigate through this next couple of months. 
But  at the end of the day, we feel confident that the forecast that we currently have given today is going to be kind of where we're heading. But it is interesting. I don't think I've seen it like this before where  everybody is at different stages with COVID. Everybody is at different stages with retail and e-commerce. But in general, in the Western world, there is definitely less discounting and more so in China, at least in terms of how we think about our sector right now."

In the third quarter, higher-than-expected demand for the Under Armour brand and outstanding execution from our global team allowed us to drive strong top and bottom line results. Everything we do at Under Armour is based on driving sustainable long-term growth while at the same time, ensuring we're setting a solid foundation to deliver near-term value to our shareholders. This is the balance you should expect from us and is the commitment we work towards every day.  
We strike this balance by leveraging our strategic playbook across key elements of our business, including a consumer-centric strategy to drive deep, authentic and emotional connections with focused performers, innovative products and experiences that advantage and inspire an athlete's journey, a constant focus on operational excellence to ensure we manage the marketplace efficiently and steady financial discipline to create meaningful levers to drive greater profitability.  
These strengths were evident in our third quarter results with revenue up 8%, gross margin up 310 basis points to a record 51% and solid adjusted EPS performance at $0.31. In this spirit, as we work to close out 2021, I feel good about the progress we've made, the resiliency we've earned and the potential we have to do even better in the future.  
Demand for our product and consideration for our brand is growing. That gives me confidence that despite potential impact from near-term headwinds, the long-term opportunities before us and our ability to compete and win in an ever-changing global landscape are stronger than ever. Of course, it all starts with brand, so with that, let's get into some third quarter highlights, starting with the incremental investments we're making in marketing and how they're translating to improving brand affinity from our focus on consumer awareness, attraction and consideration.  
As part of our Holistic Journey to Compete strategy, which centers on goal setting, training and what it takes to earn results, we use the team sports lens to focus on the importance of mental strength as an unlock to realize one's full potential. Through uniquely Under Armour execution by our social media, TV, retail and digital activations, the only way is through and train your mine train your game showed up as one global brand and voice across categories, channels and our marketing funnel. Coming off this effort, we've now shifted gears into fourth quarter activation, which is centered on cold weather training. Knowing athletes sometimes see cold as their kryptonite, our human performance research lab is helping equip them and reshape this type of training as an asset to take their performance to new levels. Validated by the experiences of our most elite athletes, we're inspiring and educating focused performers for the winter ahead with powerful storytelling, workout routines, product reviews and premium retail capsules, our ecosystem is well set to inspire and capitalize on growing demand.  
Turning to product. Given the third quarter bridge summer and fall, we realized success on both sides of the temperature spectrum, including solid sell-through of our Iso-Chill apparel products, which cool you; and fleece, which saw strength in men's and youth as athletes gear up for the cooler months ahead. There's also continued momentum in men's unstoppable bottoms and women's leggings, including Meridian and our No-Slip Waistband technology. And finally, the Project Rock collection and tops featuring Rush also built on their year-to-date momentum, so consistency in some of our best sellers. In footwear, our core running products, including Pursuit, Aurora and Assert saw strength in all regions globally. Additionally, Project Rock footwear performed well, and we had success in our slides business. Regionally, a few of the highlights included the Curry HOVR Splash and Mega Clone in APAC, HOVR Strt and Bandit Trail in EMEA and Flow Velociti SE and cleated footwear in the Americas, driven by better-than-expected back-to-school demand as team sports returned.  
Let's turn next to our regions, starting with North America, where revenue was up 8% to $1 billion, indicative of improving brand health in our largest market, we had stronger-than-expected back-to-school and direct-to-consumer demand. In fact, North America drove the majority of the third quarter overdelivery for the company, so encouraging to see continued progress here. Compared to 2019, North American revenue was up 2% in the third quarter. It is important, however, to revisit some key differences in these comparable periods, 2021 North America versus 2019, including a significant increase in our direct-to-consumer business, substantially lower off-price sales, reduced promotional and markdown activities, proactive supply constraints and undifferentiated wholesale exits. So all in, meaningfully higher quality and more productive dollars going through our P&L now than just 2 years ago.  
Turning to our international business. Revenue in our Asia Pacific region was up 19%, driven primarily by wholesale growth. Given some of the recent market trends, particularly in China, where traffic continues to struggle, our consumer insights data tells us that our brand health is holding steady in an otherwise dynamic environment. We attribute this to the investments we're making into marketing, CRM and store expansions, including opening our 1,000th store in the region.  
Versus 2019, third quarter APAC revenue was up 37%, so solid progress on a 2-year stack. Next up is EMEA, where revenue was up 15%, driven by wholesale, which saw continued momentum from our distributor partnerships and a solid direct-to-consumer performance. In our 2 most prominent countries in this region, the U.K. and Germany,  we remain focused on brand development, building long-term relationships with our key wholesale partners and strengthening our direct-to-consumer team and retail capabilities. EMEA wholesale growth was balanced across our full price and distributor businesses. Versus 2019, third quarter revenue in EMEA was up 50%.  
And finally, our Latin America region was up 27%, driven by strength in our full-price wholesale and distributor businesses. Versus 2019, third quarter revenue in Latin America was up 8%. As previously detailed, we are transitioning certain countries in this region to a strategic distributor model, of which most of this change takes place in the fourth quarter. Accordingly,  we expect top line pressure in Latin America as we finish out 2021.  
Another highlight is the performance of our direct-to-consumer business, which was up 12%. And although traffic trends were somewhat mixed in our own stores and                 mirrored various COVID restrictions around the world, we continued to see improvements in average selling prices and productivity. Due to higher-than-expected demand during the quarter, we further reduced promotions and realized higher price sell-through, which, of course, you see in our gross margin results. Versus 2019, direct-to-consumer was up 31% for the third quarter. Overall, we're pleased that our strategies towards improved presentation and experiences in our stores and online are driving better economics throughout this business.  
So in summary, we're pleased with our third quarter performance and our ability to close up                 Under Armour's and split adjusted EPS here in our history. In the near term, however, we remain both confident and cautious with several fluid headwinds continuing to impact nearly every sector, it's important to remember that Under Armour is battle-tested and mission proven. I am incredibly proud of our global team and how we work to maintain balance and trajectory regardless of what has thrown our way. We continue to get sharper, smarter and more efficient. Across our business, by channel, product or region, there remains one constant: we obsess the intersection of -- Under Armour serving focused performers, industry-leading innovations, premium experiences, heart-led but data-driven, we empower those who strive for more. And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave."
8740684,1685660080,2421419,"Under Armour, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Under Armour, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Patrik. With 3 quarters of the year behind us, our strong third quarter results demonstrate our ability to execute quickly to meet the needs of our consumers and customers, all while driving toward record revenue and earnings in 2021. So let's div",1745,"Thanks, Patrik. With 3 quarters of the year behind us, our strong third quarter results demonstrate our ability to execute quickly to meet the needs of our consumers and customers, all while driving toward record revenue and earnings in 2021. So let's dive right into our results. Compared to the prior year, revenue was up 8% to $1.5 billion. Versus our previous outlook, this overdrive was primarily due to higher demand across our full-price wholesale and Factory House businesses in North America.  
Patrik covered our regional performance earlier, so now let's click down into our channel results on a global basis. Third quarter wholesale revenue was up 10%, driven by higher-than-expected demand in our full-price business, particularly in North American wholesale, which was tempered by a reduction in sales to the off-price channel as we continue to work to elevate our brand positioning. Our direct-to-consumer business increased 12%, led by 21% growth in our owned and operated retail stores, partially offset by a 4% decline in e-commerce, which faced a difficult comparison to last year's third quarter. But I would also note that when compared to the third quarter of 2019, our e-commerce business was up over 50%.  And licensing revenue was up 24%, driven by improving strength within our North American partner businesses. By product type, apparel revenue was up 14% with strength across all categories, particularly in train and golf. Footwear was up 10%, driven primarily by strength in running. And our accessories business was down 13% due to lower sales of our sports masks compared to last year's third quarter.  
Relative to gross margin,  our third quarter improved 310 basis points over last year, landing at 51%. This expansion was driven by 400 basis points of pricing improvements due primarily to lower promotional activity within our DTC channel, along with lower promotions and markdowns within our wholesale business and 120 basis points of benefit due to channel mix, primarily related to lower mix of off-price sales versus last year's third quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was about 100 basis points of negative impact related to the absence of MyFitnessPal and 90 basis points of negative impacts from higher freight and logistics costs due to COVID-related supply chain pressures. Versus our previous expectation, our higher-than-expected Q3 gross margin improvement was primarily due to lower than-planned promotional activity within our DTC business and more favorable pricing related to sales to our off-price partners.  
SG&A expenses were up 8% to $599 million due to increased marketing investments, incentive compensation and nonsalaried workforce wages.
Relative to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded $17 million of charges in the third quarter. In this morning's press release, we noted that we have reduced our plan expectations by $25 million. So we now expect to recognize total planned charges ranging from $525 million to $575 million. Thus far, we've realized $500 million of pretax restructuring and related charges. As a reminder, all remaining charges are related to initiatives outlined in 2020, meaning nothing new has been added in 2021. We expect to recognize any remaining charges related to this plan by the first calendar quarter of 2022. 
Moving on. Our third quarter operating income was $172 million. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted operating income was $189 million. After tax, we realized a net income of $113 million or $0.24 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, loss on extinguishment of $169 million in principal amount of senior convertible notes and the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes. Our adjusted net income was $145 million, or $0.31 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
In this respect, we are excited to report that the $0.71 of adjusted diluted earnings per share that we've realized year-to-date has surpassed our highest previous full year split adjusted earnings, thus solid traction and excellent progress. Inventory was down 21% to $838 million, driven by improvements in our operating model and inbound shipping delays due to COVID-related supply chain pressures. Our cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we had no borrowings under our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. 
With respect to debt, during the third quarter, we entered into exchange agreements with certain convertible bondholders for $169 million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes and terminated certain related cap call transactions. We utilized net $168 million in cash, issued 7.7 million shares of our Class C stock and recorded a related loss of approximately $24 million, which is captured in other income and expenses. 
Following this transaction and our actions in the second quarter, $81 million of convertible notes remain outstanding. Now moving on to the balance of the year. As we noted earlier in this call, the current global retail environment remains varied with some markets realizing a steadier return to growth like in the Americas, albeit with continued weak traffic trends, somewhat mixed environments across different regions in EMEA and conservative assumptions about APAC as it navigates ongoing phases of closures, reopenings and restrictions. Factoring in the current supply chain challenges emanating from Southeast Asia and logistics challenges being experienced worldwide, we're staying appropriately cautious in the near term. However, it is important to note that today's revised outlook assumes no additional shutdowns of manufacturing partners or further retail sector disruptions as we close out 2021. 
Now turning to our updated 2021 outlook. Let's start with revenue, which we now expect to be up approximately 25% for the full year. This reflects a high 20s percentage rate increase in North America and a mid-30s increase in our international business. From a channel perspective, wholesale is expected to be up at a mid-30s rate, and our DTC business up at a mid-20s rate with e-commerce up at a low single-digit rate for the full year against 2020. Concerning our top line expectation for the fourth quarter, the same significant headwinds from our last call remain in play. In addition to the developing COVID-related supply chain issues currently facing the sector. 
Turning to gross margin. On a GAAP basis, we expect the full year rate to be up approximately 130 basis points against our 2020 adjusted gross margin of 48.6%, with benefits from pricing and changes in foreign currency being partially offset by higher expected freight expenses and the sale of MyFitnessPal, which carried a high gross margin rate. The gross margin improvement relative to our previous outlook is primarily due to pricing benefits, partially offset by increased freight expenses related to supply chain challenges, which we continue to monitor. Versus 2020, we now expect that full year SG&A will be up 6% to 7%. 
As laid out previously, specific to 2021, we have taken advantage of our improved results and proactively made incremental investments, particularly in marketing, to build even deeper connections with our consumers. We also expect higher incentive compensation, which is up against 2020 when we had significant reductions against target levels as well as higher nonsalaried wages. With that, we now expect operating income to reach approximately $425 million this year or $475 million on an adjusted basis. Translated to rate, we expect to deliver an operating margin of just under 8% or an adjusted operating margin of approximately 8.5% in 2021. 
All of this takes us to an expected diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.55 or adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.74 in 2021, with an average weighted diluted share count of approximately 468 million shares. And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we expect to end the year with inventory relatively flat against 2020's year-end, and we expect to close the year with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
Looking forward, a reminder that we are changing our fiscal reporting year in 2022. Mechanically, the first calendar quarter will serve as a transition period until we begin our new fiscal year 2023 and on April 1. Accordingly, we are not providing color for next year on today's call. That said, there are supply chain pressures that are challenging the industry in the near term. And while we believe the impact to our P&L in 2021 are expected to be relatively minimal, we are taking precautions to navigate some of the volatility and anticipated business disruptions in the first half of 2022, including the work we began in the second quarter of 2021 to adjust orders and shipping with our factory partners and logistics suppliers, working with wholesale customers to narrow and edit our spring/summer 2022 order book and assessing various mitigation offsets for inflationary pressures, including elevated logistics costs and higher wages. Given that the situation is still fluid, it is difficult to estimate the full extent of potential effects on our business at this point. However, on what we know -- based on what we know today, we are forecasting material impacts to the first half of 2022. And therefore, with respect to the first calendar quarter, we expect revenue to be up at a low single-digit rate. Concerning a longer-term view, as of this week, nearly all factories that Under Armour does business with, including those in Vietnam are open. So definitely encouraging news. Of course, full capacity will take some time to ramp back up, and this is only one part of the equation. 
Over the next several quarters, we expect longer-than-usual transit times as backlogs and congestion find balance. So this may create some variability in our results. That said, the proactive strategies we're employing, greater operational agility and overall demand for the Under Armour brand give us confidence in our ability to navigate effectively through the coming environment. With that, I'd like to close today's call by returning to Patrik's opening thought and the balance we are committed to striking between driving sustainable long-term growth while delivering near-term value to our shareholders. All global companies operate in a constantly changing environment. And over the past few years, through our transformation and the pandemic,  Under Armour has demonstrated its ability to effectively manage our business under a range of conditions. 
Lastly, as we look to close out the strongest top and bottom line performance in our history,  the work we've done to rearchitect our strategy, operations and financial discipline sets us up well to leverage this balance and thus create improved value for our shareholders over the long term. With that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?"

To date, we've seen some timing changes in inbound product and how we can get that out to our partners, but we haven't seen any cancellations. And so the forecast and the outlook that we've given for the rest of the year in Q4, we feel good about. But it's definitely a very fluid situation. Relative to calendar Q1, this really relates to the factories getting up and running, but not at full capacity and that creating a challenge to be able to produce all the orders needed to meet our demand. So we've actually had to cancel some of our purchase orders relative to Spring/Summer '22 product to be able to alleviate some of that pressure on the factories. And based on that, and therefore, the change in inbound product to be able to go out, that's where we're saying the impact is driving us towards what we see as of today as a low single-digit growth rate for calendar Q1."

You see a balance between wholesale and DTC. You see also balance across the categories in terms of footwear and apparel. We also now saw, specifically here in the third quarter, the back-to-school happening again in a more normal fashion, I guess, you could say, in terms of team sports being played, and Under Armour really coming into its own with the performance we saw now in things like cleated product and team product as well. So across the board, whether it's team sports, train or run, men's or women's, we are able to really drive our brand in all of those different categories and areas.

We're excited that this year, we've been able to basically drive it down to a planned level of about 3% this year. And that obviously creates a little bit of a tailwind on gross margin percentage with that mix of business coming down. 
And then outside of that, we've tightened up our supply chain process. We've employed some demand constraints. All of those things are helping to keep the brand more premium, but they're also helping to reduce the amount of excess that we create. So overall, just a tighter process based on our new operating model. And therefore, we feel better about being able to move a lot of that excess through our own factory house stores and more of a brand right way and also in a more profitable way. 
I would say that the other piece of it is that as we have reduced the amount that we're selling to the third-party off-price channel, the demand for the brand continues and is strong. And so those partners would like more product. And when they want more, and we don't have as much to give, generally, that means that they're going to pay a little bit more to us. And so we're seeing that benefit even on the smaller amount that we are selling to them, we're getting better prices, which has helped the gross margins as well. And we plan to continue as we go forward to manage it in that 3% to 4% mix of revenue globally. So going forward, it really shouldn't be much of a revenue headwind or tailwind or a gross margin headwind or tailwind in general going forward. It's just a small piece of our business that we maintain going forward."

We did a lot of work around SKU management actually as far back as starting in 2017 and 2018, and we got it down to a reduction of about 50% or so. We never have expanded from that point. So in other words, we readjusted ourselves to a level that we felt would be able to sustain the growth that we were planning. And we're still at that level. And the way we think about it going forward is really in a balanced way. In other words, we will invest in SKUs where we see opportunity, but we're also very diligent about taking things out through our life management cycle for our products, ensuring that we're not getting on top of our SKUs in terms of the balance of this holistically across the company. 
The other interesting thing is also the fact that at that point in time in '17, '18 in our first round of transformation, we also took down our trims and our materials, both by about 80%. And we've been able to maintain those levels, too. So coming back a little bit to what Dave talked about previously here in terms of our operating model and our efficiencies, because we now have a way to make sure that we are holding ourselves accountable to what different products should be doing in our line to help grow the brand and the business, the teams are doing an excellent job maintaining the discipline. And as a consequence, we'll grow our SKUs a little bit as we grow as a brand going forward, but it's always going to be in a controlled way where we're holding ourselves accountable."

First of all, I think in terms of how we -- our position from a sourcing perspective, we feel that we are balanced across the globe. In other words, we have about 50% of everything that we make coming out of APAC and the rest of it is split between Middle East, Europe and Latin America.  We have a balanced portfolio in terms of how we think about sourcing, first of all. In terms of what's happening right now, the factories have been closed, especially impacting the industry, I would say, out of Vietnam because there is a mix of apparel and footwear that's coming out of there, especially South Vietnam. All those factories are now -- at least our factories are open. However, it's going to take the remainder of this year to really get them ramped up to full capacity and full speed. 
So for us, in terms of how we think about what's really going to be affecting us going forward more so because we've taken actions already to let's say, prune our order books for the beginning of next year to make sure that we're able to deliver against the expectation of our partners and our own direct consumer. 
What we're seeing now is more of a logistics and transportation challenge. And the majority, we believe in the medium term here, in other words, from the end of this coming quarter going forward is going to be inbound more so than outbound. And that has to do with just congestion at every step of the chain, right, whether it's a container or a chassis or access to port or unloading a port and then the entire journey once it lands in inbound. So we see the logistics and shipment being the biggest concern for us, let's say, in the medium term here as we turn the corner into '22."

We see some minimal impacts for Q4 of this year, which is already assumed in the outlook we gave, definitely incurring a fair amount more in inbound freight costs to get things here and catch up a little bit. And that is an impact for Q4 on gross margin. And then calendar Q1 and calendar Q2 is probably where we see a little bit of the bigger revenue impact because of the canceled POs to be able to realistically get the factories back up and caught up and not be missing POs to customers. So we've worked with our customers on those PO cancellations. So that's a bigger impact on calendar Q1 and calendar Q2. 
And then after that, it should start to dissipate, and we're continuing to work through it. So I think we have really good partnerships with our suppliers. But some of the challenges down the pipeline that Patrik mentioned on once the product actually gets to the inbound port are still a pretty big challenge."

And really, this year, to pivot a little bit into your second question around marketing, we've really activated against this concept of the journey to compete through the same campaign that we started last year, the only way is through change your game and being on the offensive. 
And I think for us, that marketing spend and the activation that we're able to do is being done much better now. And it's being done better because we understand through our return on marketing investment models that we're able to run, how to do it better.

But I would say that although we're going to run a higher percentage of revenue this year, we do expect to be able to leverage marketing as a percentage of revenue as we go into next year and the following year because we need to leverage every area of our cost structure going forward, and we feel confident about being able to do that and still get more return and more bang for the buck based on what we've been doing this year. And based on all the ROI work we've been doing from a marketing perspective and changing the mix and how we spend through the restructuring activities as well. 
So you will probably see some leverage in marketing as a percentage of revenue as we go into next year and beyond. But I don't think you will see any decrease in the power of our marketing. If anything, you should see an increase in the power."

I think Dave, if you've got any additional comments once I've commented on this. I think, in general, in terms of the operating ability that we currently have, the agility that we have and the improvements we've made in our supply chain and our vendor base over the last years have now put us in a position where we can go both ways. We've talked a little bit here today about our ability to navigate through a pandemic where we had to scale our orders back by 30% and then ramping it up again for '21 and kind of going through what is now a logistic and transportation quagmire and navigating through that, adjusting again our order base a little bit for first half of '22. All of those different things are not possible unless you run an efficient and effective machine. And I think that's what you're really seeing from Under Armour at this point in time.
It's an ability to navigate anything that's thrown at us and do so in the most efficient way possible. Just think about the last 2 quarters. I mean, our inventory position in the last quarter was down 26%. It's now down 21%. And we're guiding to a flattish end to the year. I think that is a testament to how we're able to navigate and understand demand much better and then throwing that over to supply chain to execute more efficiently and better. 
And I think also, going back to what Dave talked about earlier as it relates to our off-price or what we're selling into that channel, being also able to manage that in combination with how we think about our wholesale and our own direct-to-consumer. All of that coming together and being able to navigate the last 2 years, should give you an indication of the ability of this team's ability to execute.

We are, I would say, employing every lever possible to try and mitigate as best we can and keep the experience to our customers and our consumers strong. So  we have used a fair -- a lot of air freight this year, which we're not excited about, but it's a necessary thing with the challenges that we're all being faced with. 
And I think as we approach next year, we would expect the use of airfreight to be something that we would still employ, probably not as much as we did in this year in 2021, but still more than pre-COVID 2020. And I would say that, that is probably going to be more front half calendar 2022-focused, which will put a little bit of pressure on gross margin, but is helping us to mitigate some of those challenges from a timing perspective and try and keep that impact from being not as significant. So it is a work in process. 
There's a lot of pieces to that puzzle as we're driving through. But our supply chain has been excellent in working with our partners, not just the factories but also our logistics providers to mitigate this as best we can.

Tmall and JD that are seeing also a diminished traffic pattern on their platform. So the digital landscape in China is shifting. You're seeing resurgence of smaller platforms and commercial ventures starting up around these bigger platforms. 
The good news for us, I guess, is that we've made a lot of investments into our digital teams over there over the last few years. And when we feel that we're able to navigate this new landscape, but it is a varied landscape and it isn't necessarily 100% clear how this holiday period is going to pan out in China.

I think that you're seeing more of a discounted environment in China right now in APAC and with softness in traffic patterns. In Europe, we see a pretty interesting phenomenon where actually the consumer has gone back to brick-and-mortar more strongly than we would have anticipated. Actually, creating a bit of softness in the e-commerce digital channels, not just for us but also for the pure players in Europe. So the consumer really is enjoying being back out and shopping in stores, and they're doing so at a, let's say, premium level. So not really a very discounted level. 
And in North America, I think the consumer has stayed in digital and have continued to go back at higher rates in terms of traffic to the stores.  At a more -- and less discounts at an elevated level for us. So I think it's a mixed bag across the world. The 3 regions are behaving a little bit differently right now, which makes it a little bit challenging perhaps to, let's say, understand exactly how they're going to navigate through this next couple of months. 
But  at the end of the day, we feel confident that the forecast that we currently have given today is going to be kind of where we're heading. But it is interesting. I don't think I've seen it like this before where  everybody is at different stages with COVID. Everybody is at different stages with retail and e-commerce. But in general, in the Western world, there is definitely less discounting and more so in China, at least in terms of how we think about our sector right now."

It's been a category that we have methodically and strategically and tactically we really worked on in a meaningful way since '18 when we launched our HOVR platform. This year, we came out with our Flow platform with the Velociti Wind and the Velociti SE on the back of the Curry release last year in basketball. And I think what you're seeing now with Under Armour is really an ability to execute on running head to toe, and we're doing that across the globe, which I'm very excited about, in a premium way. 
So really, what you've seen over the last 3 years is this running effort evolving into becoming a new platform for Under Armour, across both men's and women's across apparel and footwear. And we're very excited about the innovation that we continue to drive in this category and how we think about it going forward into '22 and beyond. So more to come on this from Under Armour, but we're here, we're in it. We're in it to win it, and we're going to stay in running and do a better job there as we go forward. So very excited about that."
