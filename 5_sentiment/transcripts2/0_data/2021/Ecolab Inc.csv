With me today are Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. 
A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials, which state that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our Form 10-Q for the period ended September 20, 2020 -- pardon me, September 30, 2020, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release. 
Starting with a brief overview, fourth quarter earnings continued to show sequential improvement despite the negative impact of a greater-than-expected second COVID wave. As earnings per share decline narrowed once again, we -- as we leveraged our new business wins, increased customer penetration and digital technology, along with lower costs to show the sequentially better results. As before, roughly 80% of our aggregated business showed good sales and strong income growth. 
Our Institutional division, which is roughly 20% of our current sales, remain the most impacted, reflecting the effects of COVID-driven restrictions on global restaurants and hotels. But we also note that Institutional is a business that could benefit the most over the coming years as long-term hygiene standards continue to rise. 
In 2020, we took a number of actions and made targeted investments for post-COVID success. We believe we emerged from 2020 better positioned as our business wins, new product development, digital platform and our improved field sales force effectiveness should lead to a more effective and profitable Ecolab business. 
Looking ahead, we expect global efforts to reduce COVID spread and the expanded rollout of vaccines will lead to further global economic improvement in 2021. We believe our strengthened business will deliver full year 2021 earnings above 2019 results from continuing operations. For the first quarter, year-on-year percentage decline showing modest sequential improvement from the fourth quarter and the remaining quarters of 2021, showing strong year-on-year growth. 
In a world challenged by COVID, we saw the value of Ecolab's premium product and service expertise was, once again, underscored through strong new business growth as well as our strengthened existing customer relationships despite the difficult market conditions. Our position as leader in food safety, clean water and healthy environments has become even more important. We believe that this position, along with our long-term growth opportunities remain robust driven by our huge remaining market opportunity, our leading global market position, our focus on providing our strong customer base with improved results while lowering their water, energy and other operating costs and our strong financial position with resilient free cash flow. We believe these sustainable long-term business drivers will continue to lead superior long-term performance for Ecolab and our investors. 
And now here is Christophe Beck with his comments."

It's a pleasure for me to lead my first quarterly conference call as CEO to share with you our results and our expectations for the future. It's no understatement to say that these are exciting time",946,"Thank you so much, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure for me to lead my first quarterly conference call as CEO to share with you our results and our expectations for the future. 
It's no understatement to say that these are exciting times to lead this great company and what we do. And most importantly, the way we do it matters more than ever. Ecolab is an exceptional company built on solid foundations and strong values. I had the chance to be part of shaping where we are today and where we're going tomorrow. So do not expect any sharp turns as I will keep building on what made us strong, resilient, predictable and successful. 
The challenges the world faces today are ultimately also long-term opportunities for Ecolab, and I believe that the best is still yet to come. So I look forward to sharing with you our progress and ambition in this and other forums. 
Now on to our results. Our performance continued to improve in the fourth quarter in spite of the short-term reversal of global market trends, unlike what we and most actually thought coming out of the third quarter earnings call. COVID cases went up. Lockdowns expanded, and restrictions got tighter in most places. For instance, right after our Q3 call, Germany moved from 40% of restaurants being close to 100%, and 1/3 of the U.S. states tightened restrictions. 
Nonetheless, our adjusted EPS continued to improve and narrowed its decline, decreasing 15% in Q4 versus the minus 24 in Q3. We could have easily delivered more in Q4, but we decided instead to keep increasing our growth investments in innovation, digital technology, sales capabilities and backbone infrastructure in the quarter to be ready for the rebound and the opportunities post-COVID. 
Our consolidated sales trend held stable versus the third quarter, which is a good indication as well that our investment strategy is working. And importantly, our cash flow remains strong, and fourth quarter free cash flow improved versus the prior year. 
Excluding the Institutional division, 80% of our aggregated business grew sales 2%, and operating income increased a strong 17%. Healthcare & Life Sciences posted 22% top line growth and a very strong 65% operating income growth. 
And our largest segment, Industrial, delivered a robust 18% operating income growth with a modest sales decline of 3%. So while we will keep improving the performance of all our businesses, Institutional will remain our primary near-term focus. And here, too, progress is being made. 
While temporary closures and on-premise traffic both got worse in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter in the U.S., our Institutional sales trends remain unchanged, and our margins continue to recover. In 2020, as COVID hit, I believe we responded really well to unique situation in a global restaurant and hotel industry that's historically been highly consistent and predictable. We protected our team and our business to make sure we were ready to capture the growth when the market reopened. 
We took great care of our key customers and enjoyed one of our strongest years of both retention and new business wins. We immediately provided all of our customers with world-class scientific expertise and comprehensive programs like the new no-rinse range of premium sanitizers. It's a program that kills the COVID-19 virus in 15 seconds, we believe, faster than anything else in the world. 
And we help our customers protect their business while we are assuring their guests with Ecolab Science Certified, a new program that has quickly established itself as a leading certification program in the U.S. We've also accelerated the work started a few years ago to continuously augment our critical field sales and service capabilities. We used 2020 to accelerate implementation of our latest digital field technology. And we expect this technology to further improve our field service effectiveness, customer experience and operational performance. 
At the same time, we finalized the fine-tuning of our field sales organization started 18 months ago, so pre-COVID. And we expect this to further increase sales fire power and drive units and penetration share gains as we've mentioned over the past few calls. With all of this, I believe Institutional is well positioned to benefit from the markets reopening and from the rise of global hygiene standards. 
Now more broadly, we entered 21 in a position of real strength. While we expect COVID-19 will continue to have a significant effect on the economy and our end markets, especially in the early part of the year, we expect to see the beginning of the COVID-19 recovery for our global markets to start in the second quarter. It will then take a few quarters to fully realize the new normal. However, we believe that our strong new business wins, product and service innovation, investment in new hygiene and digital technologies and successful sales and profit initiative will deliver full year 2021 earnings above 2019 results from continuing operations. 
We expect the first quarter to show a modest improvement in year-on-year percentage decline versus the fourth quarter while the remaining quarters of 2021 will show very strong year-on-year. In other words, 2021 should be a strong rebound for Ecolab. 
With hygiene standards that are rising fast, we're ready to respond to these new trends with breakthrough solutions and a brand that inspires trust. With water and climate challenges that have just gotten tougher, we're uniquely positioned to help our customers reach the sustainability ambition at a high financial return. And with an unbeatable global team, supported by state-of-the-art digital technology, we look into the future with a great deal of confidence. I look forward to your questions. 
Mike, floor's back to you."

So as you mentioned and I've mentioned in my intro as well, those are developments that we have started a few years ago. And we've made those developments as well by working together with our teams and our technology partners as well. We've tested that as well at numerous occasions, really making sure that everything is working really well because it's so important for our team. 
And we were really aiming at 2 objectives that we've accelerated during the past few quarters because we had a unique opportunity during COVID to get it done faster. We could train our people as well during times that they had as well available. 
And the 2 things are first, it's really to help the service delivery. What does that mean for our teams is ultimately that these digital tools are helping them get their daily program that's being optimized by the system. If they get an emergency call as well that's coming within the daily program, well, it's rerouted and making sure they can do that with the minimum time and the minimum mileage as well to get there. They get all the customer information in real-time when they go and visit as well as the customer. They get tools as well to sell better any new solution, and they have training tools as well that they can share with the customers in order to make sure that those programs are being used really the best way. 
So this first objective is really about improving the customer experience. It's improving the work performance of our teams and ultimately, so for them, having more time to spend with the customer. 
The second objective, and I'll conclude on that, is really on the sales side of our team. It's to help them sell more. We've shared many times our ambition to increase penetration. Well, those systems are helping do that because they give you real-time customer information. Our teams know how the customer is performing, the products they're using, the new products that we could be adding as well to them. And they can merchandise as well the results that have been accomplished. So at the end of the day, it's easier for our team. It's better for the customer, and it costs less as a whole as well for the company."

Well, expanding our TAM has always been so part of the Ecolab strategy. So finding new growth avenues, new growth markets and lining up resources behind them has been part of the way the company has been growing. 
You're mentioning Life Science. We started this business a few years ago. It's turned into an exceptional performance. It's been obviously helped by COVID as well at the same time because the need of our pharma customers have grown so much. It's driven as well great innovation as well as for them in order to make sure they could produce vaccines, for instance, in the safest and most profitable way at the same time. 
But interestingly enough, that way of approaching things, Manav, has helped us as well, opening new markets like data centers. We've started that 2 years ago when we saw that companies were ultimately outsourcing all their IT to larger companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google and so on. And we were dealing with them, providing them with some solutions because those computers generate a lot of energy and need to be cooled down while we are providing solutions for them as many other customers. And ultimately, we've said, ""Well, that's a critical market for the future."" It's going to keep growing. We're going to create a division as well behind it, which is exactly what we did. That was before COVID, then COVID happened. Everyone used the cloud, and it's a market that's been booming as well since then. It's been a good play. 
And the last one I'll mention, Manav, here is animal health, where we knew as well that antibiotic is something that consumers, that you and I don't want to have in our food, ultimately. So how do we help animals staying healthy in the food chain at the very beginning, and that's how we've created as well a division. We've made a big acquisition as well early last year with [ Sedline ], which is creating that critical mass for that new market opportunity and which is leading to double-digit growth since we've done that as well. So just a few examples like that."

Thank you. Well, maybe to ground us in the very strong performance that we had in 2020, first of all, working capital was a net contributor to strong cash flow because although we saw a little deterioration in collections and an increase in inventory on hand from a day's perspective, the very favorable to cash flow at least, impact of declining volumes made working capital a net contributor. So 2021 will be somewhat the opposite of that, meaning as the business continues to rebound, we'll invest more in receivables and in inventory. So not significantly, but we'll invest in working capital in 2021. 
Having said that, we'll remain very focused on collections. And I've said before in earlier calls, we are very determined and have been sure to be paid for the value that we're creating for customers. And frankly, on the inventory side, just a personal comment almost, my expectation, and I know Christophe shares this sort of vibrantly, is that our goal on inventory in 2021 is to make sure that we're building the right stuff for the right customers in expectation of the rebound. And so the favorable inventory in '20 will reverse in 2021, but it won't be a big drag on overall cash flow performance."

Now she or he can really get in and have all the information, can really work immediately with the customer or the customer issues that they might have as well. And as mentioned before, so if their day is organized better, if we can really route them in a way that minimize hours and mileage, at the end of the day, they can service more customers, spending more time with the customer instead of internal administrative staff or fixing equipment that we have. 
And if that works, well, it's good for the customers, and it's good for us that, in other words, we have more sales firepower. We have improved operational efficiency in service, which net to an improvement of cost structure as well at the same time."

That's why we invest as well behind all those customers. 
So to Mike's point before and saying, so 80% of our aggregated business has been growing in 2020, well, those businesses will keep growing as well in 2021. When you think about it, this 80% have been growing. So 5% top line in 2020 and 14% operating income, well, they're going to keep growing as well so in '21. The mix is going to be a little bit different as mentioned. In Life Science, the demand was higher for natural reasons. In Healthcare, we got those national government deals as well. But underneath, you still have this 5%, 6% growth, which is good. 
Industrial is going to move towards positive growth as well. And sanitizing products, they're going to stay at a fairly high rate of growth. It's not going to be the same as in 2020 because I don't expect people to sanitize their hands the same way as they did during COVID. That would be too nice, but it's going to be more than what they did before COVID [indiscernible] in 2019. So overall, I think that the trends are going to be similar or better for most of those products."

And it's been growing strong in 2020. It's been growing strong before that as well, and we're planning for great growth as well in '21. So Life Science is going to be the continuation of a great story. 
But we need to keep in mind as well that, well, they had an exceptional year in 2020. So the comparisons that we will make in '21 will look a little bit softer. That's why it's going to be important to look at the underlying growth, which is the way we run the business anyway. 
And it's even more true for Healthcare because the growth of 20% plus that we had in the last quarter was partly driven as well by those national deals that we've made. So for some of the governments in order to fight COVID. Underlying, it's going to be 5%, 6%. That's the way we measure it. 
So when you do the comparison, Rosemarie, '21 versus '20, it will look like a much lower growth but it's just because the comparison is kind of unfair. But we will look at the underlying growth, which is ultimately what's going to be long term, and we expect it to be within the range of 5%, 6% for Healthcare."

You've seen in Q3 an improvement; Q4, not so much; Q1 is going to be the same, and Q2 is going to continue afterwards. But at the same time, we need to keep in mind as well that we have investment in the business that we're going to make in '21 as we did in 2020.

The mix is going to be unfavorable, so in '21 versus '19 just because institutions is going to be lower because it's going to be recovering towards the end of the year.

And in Institutional, we have more units, much more than we had in the second quarter last year. We have much more solutions as well. So the moment the demand is coming back, that's going to compound, which is really good news. And we expect that not to happen in the first quarter, but it's going to happen sometime in the second quarter. 
Another one is Downstream, which is related to the oil and gas demand. When coals are going to be used more, when planes are going to be flying more, when boats are going to be more traveling as well like cruise ships, obviously, so the demand for oil and gas is going to accelerate. So our objective here is the same as what we did in Institutional, more refineries and more solutions to those refineries. And that looks quite good as we speak right now.

And to your point, in Institutional, that's been the best new business generation that we've had across the company. So Institutional has done an exceptional job in terms of new business for 2 reasons mainly. 
One is obviously sort of the focus of our team on new business during that time. But the second is the one that you touched just before that during those difficult times of COVID, customers were looking for expertise, for scientific expertise. They didn't know what COVID was to begin with, how to address that issue, how to get ready for the reopening, how to get ready for the future as well. And we are the unique company that could provide that support to them in the U.S. like anywhere as well around the world. So many came to us as well during that time. 
And the last point I'll mention is also our capability to supply as well. So especially in sanitizing products, growth has been outstripping the supply so quite a bit. We've built a lot of capacity as well during that time. Well, this is capacity that customers have been asking and that we've been able as well to sell to them.

Is there something we can learn from you that we could implement as well so within our own company?"" 
And I can give you 2 examples in here. On one hand, a large consumer good company out of Europe with whom we've been working for a few years towards the end of last year said, ""We need you to help us build a plan to become water positive by 2030."" Well, those are new questions, which we know how to answer that. No one else can.

That's where we sell most of the solutions. That's where there is most demand from customers. That's where the margins are the highest and where the outcome is the best as well. And many of those companies, to the ESG point that was made before as well, are interested in driving as well a better outcome from an impact on the environment as well at the same time. 
So this is the sweet spot. This is our primary focus as well going forward. We're trying to get organized as well behind petrochemical in a very dedicated way, but that's a little bit more for the future as such whereas the traditional, all the type of refineries are less of a priority for us. So you're exactly right, and that's what we're going after. And that's the way we're getting organized to really capture that growth and the margin. And I'll just conclude on one point is basically that petrochemical in 2020 has been growing as well in a difficult environment, which is a proof of that approach working so really well."

At the same time, you need to have Institutional that turns the corner. As mentioned, it's not going to be in Q1. It's going to be very similar than what we had in Q4, but it's going to be some time in Q2. That's going to catch up as well. So Q2, Q3, Q4, where institution is going to get back towards where it used to be, so as well as pre-COVID. So that's going to drive as well towards that outcome. 
And the third point is, as you mentioned. So we have cost savings initiatives that Dan has been presenting as well that are helping. But it's important to keep in mind that we will keep investing in the business. People are going to start traveling as well more. We're going to give them merit as well as we do every year as well as such. 
So when you bring it all together, 80% of the business needs to keep humming, and it is and it will. Institutional needs to recover as of Q2 and the quarters to come. And we need to make sure that both on the cost savings and investment, we balance that in a smart way, and we will get to the right place in 2021."

With me today are Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO.  
A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials, which state that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our Form 10-Q for the period ended September 20, 2020 -- pardon me, September 30, 2020, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.  
Starting with a brief overview, fourth quarter earnings continued to show sequential improvement despite the negative impact of a greater-than-expected second COVID wave. As earnings per share decline narrowed once again, we -- as we leveraged our new business wins, increased customer penetration and digital technology, along with lower costs to show the sequentially better results. As before, roughly 80% of our aggregated business showed good sales and strong income growth.  
Our Institutional division, which is roughly 20% of our current sales, remain the most impacted, reflecting the effects of COVID-driven restrictions on global restaurants and hotels. But we also note that Institutional is the business that could benefit the most over the coming years as long-term hygiene standards continue to rise.  
In 2020, we took a number of actions and made targeted investments for post-COVID success. We believe we emerged from 2020 better positioned as our business wins, new product development, digital platform and our improved field sales force effectiveness should lead to a more effective and profitable Ecolab business.  
Looking ahead, we expect global efforts to reduce COVID spread and the expanded rollout of vaccines will lead to further global economic improvement in 2021. We believe our strengthened business will deliver full year 2021 earnings above 2019 results from continuing operations. For the first quarter, year-on-year percentage decline showing modest sequential improvement from the fourth quarter, and the remaining quarters of 2021 showing strong year-on-year growth.  
In a world challenged by COVID, we saw the value of Ecolab's premium product and service expertise was, once again, underscored through strong new business growth as well as our strengthened existing customer relationships despite the difficult market conditions. Our position as leader in food safety, clean water and healthy environments has become even more important. We believe that this position, along with our long-term growth opportunities remain robust, driven by our huge remaining market opportunity, our leading global market position, our focus on providing our strong customer base with improved results while lowering their water, energy and other operating costs, and our strong financial position with resilient free cash flow. We believe these sustainable long-term business drivers will continue to lead superior long-term performance for Ecolab and our investors.  
And now here is Christophe Beck with his comments."

It's a pleasure for me to lead my first quarterly conference call as CEO to share with you our results and our expectations for the future.  
It's no understatement to say that these are exciting times to lead this great company and what we do. And most importantly, the way we do it matters more than ever. Ecolab is an exceptional company built on solid foundations and strong values. I had the chance to be part of shaping where we are today and where we're going tomorrow. So do not expect any sharp turns as I will keep building on what made us strong, resilient, predictable and successful.  
The challenges the world faces today are ultimately also long-term opportunities for Ecolab, and I believe that the best is still yet to come. So I look forward to sharing with you our progress and ambition in this and other forums. 
Now on to our results. Our performance continued to improve in the fourth quarter in spite of the short-term reversal of global market trends, unlike what we and most actually thought coming out of the third quarter earnings call. COVID cases went up, lockdowns expanded and restrictions got tighter in most places. For instance, right after our Q3 call, Germany moved from 40% of restaurants being close to 100%, and 1/3 of the U.S. states tightened restrictions.  
Nonetheless, our adjusted EPS continued to improve and narrowed its decline, decreasing 15% in Q4 versus the minus 24% in Q3. We could have easily delivered more in Q4, but we decided instead to keep increasing our growth investments in innovation, digital technology, sales capabilities and backbone infrastructure in the quarter to be ready for the rebound and the opportunities post-COVID. 
Our consolidated sales trend held stable versus the third quarter, which is a good indication as well that our investment strategy is working. And importantly, our cash flow remains strong, and fourth quarter free cash flow improved versus the prior year.  
Excluding the Institutional division, 80% of our aggregated business grew sales 2%, and operating income increased a strong 17%. Healthcare & Life Sciences posted 22% top line growth and a very strong 65% operating income growth. And our largest segment, Industrial, delivered a robust 18% operating income growth with a modest sales decline of 3%. So while we will keep improving the performance of all our businesses, Institutional will remain our primary near-term focus. And here, too, progress is being made. 
While temporary closures and on-premise traffic both got worse in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter in the U.S., our Institutional sales trends remain unchanged, and our margins continue to recover. In 2020, as COVID hit, I believe we responded really well to unique situation in a global restaurant and hotel industry that's historically been highly consistent and predictable. We protected our team and our business to make sure we were ready to capture the growth when the market reopened.  
We took great care of our key customers and enjoyed one of our strongest years of both retention and new business wins. We immediately provided all of our customers with world-class scientific expertise and comprehensive programs like the new no-rinse range of premium sanitizers. It's a program that kills the COVID-19 virus in 15 seconds, we believe, faster than anything else in the world.  
And we help our customers protect their business while we are assuring their guests with Ecolab Science Certified, a new program that has quickly established itself as a leading certification program in the U.S. We've also accelerated the work started a few years ago, to continuously augment our critical field sales and service capabilities. We used 2020 to accelerate implementation of our latest digital field technology. And we expect this technology to further improve our field service effectiveness, customer experience and operational performance.  
At the same time, we finalized the fine-tuning of our field sales organization started 18 months ago, so pre-COVID. And we expect this to further increase sales firepower and drive units and penetration share gains, as we've mentioned over the past few calls. With all of this, I believe Institutional is well positioned to benefit from the markets reopening and from the rise of global hygiene standards.
now more broadly, we entered 21 in a position of real strength. While we expect COVID-19 will continue to have a significant effect on the economy and our end markets, especially in the early part of the year, we expect to see the beginning of the COVID-19 recovery for our global markets to start in the second quarter. It will then take a few quarters to fully realize the new normal. However, we believe that our strong new business wins, product and service innovation, investment in new hygiene and digital technologies and successful sales and profit initiative will deliver full year 2021 earnings above 2019 results from continuing operations.  
We expect the first quarter to show a modest improvement in year-on-year percentage decline versus the fourth quarter, while the remaining quarters of 2021 will show very strong year-on-year. In other words, 2021 should be a strong rebound for Ecolab.  
With hygiene standards that are rising fast, we're ready to respond to these new trends with breakthrough solutions and a brand that inspires trust. With water and climate challenges that have just gotten tougher, we're uniquely positioned to help our customers reach the sustainability ambition at a high financial return. And with an unbeatable global team, supported by state-of-the-art digital technology, we look into the future with a great deal of confidence. I look forward to your questions.

So as you mentioned, and I've mentioned in my intro as well, those are developments that we have started a few years ago. And we've made those developments as well by working together with our field teams and our technology partners as well. We've tested that as well at numerous occasions, really making sure that everything is working really well because it's so important for our team. 
And we were really aiming at 2 objectives that we've accelerated during the past few quarters because we had a unique opportunity during COVID to get it done faster. We could train our people as well during times that they had as well available.  
And the 2 things are, first, it's really to help the service delivery. What does that mean for our teams is, ultimately, that these digital tools are helping them get their daily program that's being optimized by the system. If they get an emergency call as well that's coming within the daily program, well, it's rerouted and making sure they can do that with the minimum time and the minimum mileage as well to get there. They get all the customer information in real-time when they go and visit, as well the customer. They get tools as well to sell better any new solution, and they have training tools as well that they can share with the customers in order to make sure that those programs are being used really the best way. So this first objective is really about improving the customer experience. It's improving the work performance of our teams and ultimately so, for them having more time to spend with the customer.  
The second objective, and I'll conclude on that, is really on the sales side of our team. It's to help them sell more. We've shared many times our ambition to increase penetration. Well, those systems are helping do that because they give you real-time customer information. Our teams know how the customer is performing, the products they're using, the new products that we could be adding as well to them. And they can merchandise as well the results that have been accomplished. So at the end of the day, it's easier for our team. It's better for the customer, and it costs less as a whole as well for the company."

Well, expanding our TAM has always been so part of the Ecolab strategy. So finding new growth avenues, new growth markets and lining up resources behind them has been part of the way the company has been growing. 
You're mentioning Life Science. We started this business a few years ago. It's turned into an exceptional performance. It's been obviously helped by COVID as well at the same time because the need of our pharma customers have grown so much. It's driven as well great innovation as well, so for them in order to make sure they could produce vaccines, for instance, in the safest and most profitable way at the same time. 
But interestingly enough, that way of approaching things, Manav, has helped us as well, opening new markets like data centers. We've started that 2 years ago when we saw that companies were ultimately outsourcing all their IT to larger companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google and so on. And we were dealing with them, providing them with some solutions because those computers generate a lot of energy and need to be cooled down while we are providing solutions for them as many other customers. And ultimately, we've said, ""Well, that's a critical market for the future."" It's going to keep growing. We're going to create a division as well behind it, which is exactly what we did. That was before COVID. Then COVID happened, everyone used the cloud, and it's a market that's been booming as well since then. It's been a good play.  
And the last one I'll mention, Manav, here is animal health, where we knew as well that antibiotic is something that consumers, that you and I don't want to have in our food, ultimately. So how do we help animals staying healthy in the food chain at the very beginning, and that's how we've created as well a division. We've made a big acquisition as well early last year with CID Lines, which is creating that critical mass for that new market opportunity and which is leading to double-digit growth since we've done that as well. So just a few examples like that."

We have good pricing power, which is good. We have raw materials that are expected to be benign right now, but the indications that we see in the last few days/weeks ultimately saw going up in terms of raw materials. So we'll have to mitigate that, but this is something that we've been doing very well for many, many situation similar that we've experienced in the past few years."

Thank you. Well, maybe to ground us in the very strong performance that we had in 2020, first of all, working capital was a net contributor to strong cash flow because although we saw a little deterioration in collections and an increase in inventory on hand from a day's perspective, the very favorable to cash flow at least, impact of declining volumes made working capital a net contributor. So 2021 will be somewhat the opposite of that, meaning as the business continues to rebound, we'll invest more in receivables and in inventory. So not significantly, but we'll invest in working capital in 2021. 
Having said that, we'll remain very focused on collections. And I've said before in earlier calls, we are very determined and have been sure to be paid for the value that we're creating for customers. And frankly, on the inventory side, just a personal comment almost, my expectation, and I know Christophe shares this sort of vibrantly, is that our goal on inventory in 2021 is to make sure that we're building the right stuff for the right customers in expectation of the rebound. And so the favorable inventory in '20 will reverse in 2021, but it won't be a big drag on overall cash flow performance."

We always want to have more dedicated people towards selling new customers, selling new solutions to existing customers. We've shared earlier as well our ambition to increase penetration by 20% as well over time. Well, we need to increase as well our sales firepower, which means people and hours behind that in order to deliver it. Technology is obviously helping as well, so for that. 
On the other side, on the service, it's to improve the customer experience that when one of our service rep is going to one of the customers, well, she or he doesn't spend a lot of time collecting data or getting papers together. Now she or he can really get in and have all the information, can really work immediately with the customer or the customer issues that they might have as well. And as mentioned before, so if their day is organized better, if we can really route them in a way that minimize hours and mileage, at the end of the day, they can service more customers, spending more time with the customer instead of internal administrative staff or fixing equipment that we have. 
And if that works, well, it's good for the customers, and it's good for us that, in other words, we have more sales firepower, we have improved operational efficiency in service, which net to an improvement of cost structure as well at the same time."

So to Mike's point before in saying, so 80% of our aggregated business has been growing in 2020, well, those businesses will keep growing as well in 2021. When you think about it, this 80% have been growing. So 5% top line in 2020 and 14% operating income. Well, they're going to keep growing as well so in '21. The mix is going to be a little bit different, as mentioned. So in Life Science, the demand was higher for natural reasons. In Healthcare, we got those national government deals as well. But underneath, you still have this 5%, 6% growth, which is good. 
Industrial is going to move towards positive growth as well. And sanitizing products, they're going to stay at a fairly high rate of growth. It's not going to be the same as in 2020 because I don't expect people to sanitize their hands the same way as they did during COVID. That would be too nice, but it's going to be more than what they did before COVID's peak in 2019. So overall, I think that the trends are going to be similar or better for most of those products."

And it's been growing strong in 2020. It's been growing strong before that as well, and we're planning for great growth as well in '21. So Life Science is going to be the continuation of a great story. 
But we need to keep in mind as well that, well, they had an exceptional year in 2020, so the comparisons that we will make in '21 will look a little bit softer. That's why it's going to be important to look at the underlying growth, which is the way we run the business anyway. 
And it's even more true for Healthcare because the growth of 20% plus that we had in the last quarter was partly driven as well by those national deals that we've made, so for some of the governments in order to fight COVID. Underlying, it's going to be 5%, 6%. That's the way we measure it. 
So when you do the comparison, Rosemarie, '21 versus '20, it will look like a much lower growth but it's just because the comparison is kind of unfair.

So the moment the demand is coming back, that's going to compound, which is really good news. And we expect that not to happen in the first quarter, but it's going to happen sometime in the second quarter. 
Another one is Downstream, which is related to the oil and gas demand when cars are going to be used more, when planes are going to be flying more, when boats are going to be more traveling as well like cruise ships, obviously, so the demand for oil and gas is going to accelerate. So our objective here is the same as what we did in Institutional, more refineries and more solutions to those refineries. And that looks quite good as we speak right now.

And to your point, in Institutional, that's been the best new business generation that we've had across the company. So Institutional has done an exceptional job in terms of new business, for 2 reasons mainly. 
One is obviously so the focus of our team on new business during that time. But the second is the one that you touched just before that during those difficult times of COVID, customers were looking for expertise, for scientific expertise. They didn't know what COVID was to begin with, how to address that issue, how to get ready for the reopening, how to get ready for the future as well. And we are the unique company that could provide that support to them in the U.S., like anywhere as well around the world. So many came to us as well, so during that time. 
And the last point I'll mention is also our capability to supply as well. So especially in sanitizing products, growth has been outstripping the supply so quite a bit. We've built a lot of capacity as well, so during that time. Well, this is capacity that customers have been asking and that we've been able as well to sell to them.

We've had always more customers coming to us for 2 reasons, interestingly enough. On one hand, saying, ""Well, can you help us get towards our ambition in terms of ESG, in terms of water usage, in terms of climate, so CO2 emissions, waste that we generate as well?"" And there was the second dimension, which is an interesting new one for us. Many customers coming to us and saying, ""Well, you guys as a company have done so well from an ESG perspective. Is there something we can learn from you that we could implement as well, so within our own company?"" 
And I can give you so 2 examples in here. On one hand, a large consumer good company out of Europe with whom we've been working for a few years towards the end of last year said, ""We need you to help us build a plan to become water positive by 2030."" Well, those are new questions, which we know how to answer that. No one else can. 
And on the other hand, so you've seen Microsoft as well announcing their ambition to be water positive by 2030. We've done that plan together with them. We are helping them getting there as well. So those are examples that are 2 of many of those companies so coming to us. So yes, there is an inflection point that's turning bigger, better than what I would have thought."

And if there's one thing that we've learned during COVID, especially in Institutional, is that customers need comprehensive solutions.

The floors, the drains, the water, that the food is safe, that you don't have any pests in there. It's really -- infection is related to the weakest point that you would have in that unit. And seen from the customer side is basically who is the partner that can help me protect everything I have in my unit? And the only one that can do that today at least is Ecolab as such. 
So that's the way the customer is looking at us. So it's really making sure that we offer programs that answer that. And the Ecolab Science Certified as well is ultimately bringing it all together. If a unit has all the programs, is as safe as it can be, well, they get the feel, and we promote that as well.

So you're exactly right, and that's what we're going after, and that's the way we're getting organized to really capture that growth and the margin.

It's going to be very similar than what we had in Q4, but it's going to be some time in Q2. That's going to catch up as well. So Q2, Q3, Q4, where institution is going to get back towards where it used to be, so as well so pre-COVID. So that's going to drive as well towards that outcome.

With me today are Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. 
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials which state that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release. 
Starting with a brief overview. The first quarter showed continued sequential business improvement that was offset by the Texas freeze. Adjusted EPS were $0.81. That EPS included the impact of short-term supply chain and customer disruption from the freeze that were estimated to be $0.10 per share. Healthcare and Life Sciences segment showed further strong sales growth. The industrial segment experienced a modest sales decline as its growth was offset by the freeze impact. The other segment significantly narrowed its sales decline from the fourth quarter and Institutional and Specialty segment sales decline narrowed slightly from the fourth quarter as sales trends within our U.S. institutional business improved through the end of the first quarter. 
Our markets are broadly improving and increasing rate of vaccination, along with the easing of social restrictions, provides further support of the global economic recovery. We expect that broad improvement, leveraged by our investments and the work we have done to further our critical innovation, service and digital business drivers as well as our cost efficiency measures, will help drive strong comparisons against 2020 results over the balance of the year and result in 2021 adjusted earnings per share that exceed 2019 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the estimated $0.15 per share impact from the Texas freeze. 
Over the past year, we've seen the value of Ecolab's premium product and service expertise, once again underscored through continued strong new business growth as well as our strengthened customer relationships despite the difficult market conditions. Our position as leader in food safety, clean water and healthy environments has become even more important. We believe this position, along with our strong long-term growth opportunities remain robust, driven by our huge remaining market opportunity, our leading global market positions, our focus on providing our strong customer base with improved results while lowering their water, energy and other operating costs, and through that, our ability to help them meet their growing ESG ambitions. We believe these sustainable long-term business drivers will continue to yield superior long-term performance for Ecolab and our investors. 
And now here's Christophe Beck with his comments."

I'm very pleased with our first quarter, which was right in line with our expectations.

I'm very pleased with our first quarter, which was right in line with our expectations. Excluding the Texas freeze, which we discussed earlier, our business continued to show solid fundamental improvement that gives us confidence in our full year outlook. Our underlying business momentum as well as margin development kept improving across the board, leading to strong results in the first quarter. Excluding the short-term impact of the Texas freeze, our Q1 adjusted EPS showed a significantly narrowing decline versus the prior year, continuing our improving quarterly trends. It's also ahead of what we delivered in Q1 2019, which is a good indication for our expected full year delivery. We did all this while continuing to invest in our major growth initiatives and in our global team capabilities to leverage our position as the markets reopen. 
Excluding the freeze, all segments stayed strong or showed continued sequential improvement. Our fundamental business trends kept gaining momentum, especially in our institutional division, which saw a definite pick up as we exited March. Our Industrial segment, which was most impacted by the Texas freeze, delivered improved underlying growth trends versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and continue to further strengthen its margin. Healthcare and Life Sciences maintained a strong double-digit growth and solid margin improvement. This good start strengthens our confidence for the full year and beyond. Our general market outlook remains largely unchanged versus what we said in previous calls. North America and China are moving ahead of our previous expectations, while Europe and several emerging markets remain behind as they recover from extended lockdowns and are still impacted by a rather slow pace of vaccination. 
So while the exact timing of the global reopenings might shift a few months, which might also shift some of the recovery into Q3, we expect strong growth in the second quarter, driven by improving end markets and accelerated underlying growth momentum. We expect these trends to continue in the second half of the year. Our objective has been to start the year in a position of strength. And Q1 shows, we clearly achieved this. Our net new business pipeline increased to record highs, and our global market shares are strengthening. Our differentiated innovations are continuing to help our customers protect their consumers and our world-class programs help them preserve vital natural resources while generating very attractive financial returns. 
And with our new Ecolab Science Certified Assurance Program, we have become the brand that reissues customers and consumers in times they need it the most. All this underscores our confidence that we are on a path to deliver full year '21 adjusted EPS ahead of 2019 EPS, excluding the estimated $0.15 impact of the Texas freeze. 
Looking beyond the pandemic, our longer-term position is better than ever. In a world where hygiene standards are rising, where food safety and infection risk awareness has reached new levels, where the expected gap between water supply and what the demand is water than ever, our differentiated value proposition as the global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention services and technologies positions us uniquely to capture this accelerating growth trends. The combination of this unmatched value proposition and the breadth of our comprehensive offering makes us the obvious partner for global companies to help them deliver on their most ambitious sustainability commitment. Our ability to serve customers at 3 million locations in 172 countries with 25,000 dedicated underground experts in 40 industries allows us to deliver the same standards of quality and performance anywhere around the world. And our new business pipeline, breakthrough innovation, unmatched digital footprint, world-class scientific expertise and passion for exceptional execution will continue to lead to sustained growth momentum and continued double-digit earnings growth for the years to come. I look forward to your question. 
So Mike, back to you."

And on the other hand, we have Europe in a few emerging markets that are behind, as we can see restrictions with lockdowns, with a slow pace of vaccinations, especially in Europe as well. So that's the balance that we are trying to manage. When I think about how institutional did during the first quarter, we saw a nice pickup in March. It's been confirmed in April right now in the second quarter. So net-net, Q2 should be more or less as expected. If there is 1 caveat might be so the timing of reopening in Europe and some of the emerging markets that might shift some of that growth in Q3, but for the full year, I confirm the outlook the way we described it in the previous call."

And if I look at '21, it's kind of an on off approach that they are having. So first, I'd like to put on the site to the U.K., which are partly reopen, as we know, so way ahead in terms of vaccinations versus continental Europe. So U.K., we see a good development over there. Continental Europe, so most of the countries are in complete lockdown. So most of the large countries have curfews even as well. That's true for Germany and for France, for instance, as well. So most, if not all of the restaurants and hotels are, for the most part, closed, which is something that's going to change, hopefully before the summer. They're all talking about reopening in order to protect the summer season. I hope that, that's going to be true. It's going to be a bit later than what I had expected ultimately here, but then it's going to drive a rebound, which is going to be positive in Q3.

We expanded it at the time we announced the ChampionX and covered things like stranded costs and anticipated costs related to ChampionX. We expanded it again to cover some aspects supply chain industrial business and most recently to cover some restructuring or really some reshaping maybe of our institutional business to improve principally steel delivery. So you add all that up, and we have a targeted cost savings of about $365 million. Some of that is in gross margin. The big bulk of it is in SG&A.

And as you know, we're supporting that as well as a brand in the media, which gets always more recognized by consumers or guests, as we call them in that industry. So all in all, this is really good to grow our market share in Institutional."

And when I think about infection prevention, well, short term, we all think COVID-19, but mid to longer term, we think about any infection that could happen out there and surfaces like human contacts are a big vector, as we know. One example is that in hospitals, the #1 vector of infection is through the hands as well, not for COVID, but for many other infections as well. So overall, making sure that you reduce the number of infection in a public setting turn. Well, you need to have surfaces at is impacted as you can."

So you're right. We built significant inventory versus the same time last year also versus year-end 2020. And my guess is that we will continue to because we'll have the right stuff where we and our customers both need it. If you think about the recovery of the business generally, rebuilding the balance sheet means that there will be some pull on inventory, accounts receivables, too, which are in very good shape from a payment perspective, but as people buy more stuff, we'll have more on the balance sheet and accounts receivable. We'll continue to manage our vendors in what we purchase with appropriate discipline. But look, there'll be an investment in working capital as the business rebuilds, which is to be expected and completely appropriate. The net, though, of our cash flow delivery for the full year, even including the higher level of CapEx that we will continue to invest in the business in 2021, our cash flow will continue to be bigger.

Obviously, you talked about some of the large governmental orders and other things that probably helped your fixed cost leverage in that segment over the past 12 months. I was just wondering, as those comparisons are now stiffer and the business starts to normalize above historical levels, but starts to normalize from last year at least. If you think that some of the fixed cost leverage goes away, if that's the appropriate way of thinking about that segment's margins in the 12 months ahead? And then secondarily, just maybe a little bit more detail on the Institutional segment margins. Obviously, the volume declines were significant and it all makes sense, what happened to the margins so far. But on the way back up with the cost reductions and programs that you've put in place, do you think that when the revenue level gets back to 2019 levels, is there any reason to think that the margins would be any different in that business than they were pre-COVID just recognizing that the customer base is probably going to be somewhat changed, maybe not so much given national accounts, but there are a lot of changes to hospitality and foodservice.

So in Healthcare, first of all, very pleased with the underlying growth performance or moving towards this 5%, which was an objective for a long time. It's taken us so many years so to get there. And COVID has helped because the infection prevention, awareness of customers and patients, in that case, well, has gone up very clearly during COVID-19, so which is good. So underlying growth, solid in Healthcare, and that's here to stay. Second, on margins, very good improvement last year. In some cases, helped partly with the one-offs, those government deals that we talked about earlier. But I feel really good that margins is going to keep improving in '21 and in the future as well. So this is here to stay. So good story in Healthcare. And for me, that's not the end of the story. It's clearly so up to us to improve it further. That's on Healthcare. Institutional is a very different story, especially coming out of 2020, which is a business that's been impacted the most in our company. 90% plus of the COVID impact at Ecolab was on Institutional division, as we all know, which is 20% of our overall company as such. So when I think about the margins, I'd say 2 things, Andy. The first one is every quarter, it's going to improve, and we're going to get a lot back from what we lost in 2020, and we'll get close to where we were in 2019, pre-pandemic. So probably not at the end of this year, but early in 2022. And the second part of your question, so post-pandemic, if I can call it that way. Well, we've invested in our organizational development/restructure. We've invested as well in field technology that's going to help us well the performance.

It started 30 years ago, actually, it was called differently obviously back then, that was true when we did remote monitoring of pools and spa in Institutional and that was especially true, so we 3D TRASAR in industrial water business as well. And if I fast forward, ultimately, so for 2020 things have accelerated because in many instances, we could not go to customer locations for obvious reasons related to COVID. So customers and our teams have embraced digital solutions even more than before. Keep in mind as well that we've invested over the past 5 years, over $150 million a year in digital. So we were ready for that moment during the pandemic that was more luck than genius, obviously, as such, but it came very handy as well as such. So when I think about the 3 main drivers for us in digital at Ecolab, the first one is to drive customer value. So it's subscriptions, it's a Legionella prevention programs, for instance, as well. They're all driven by digital technology. We sell that technology. This is growing very nicely. The second one is our field solutions in order to improve the productivity and the value created by our 25,000 people around the world. Institutional has rolled out everywhere around the world, the new platform doing COVID, and that's going to help us as well. So for post-pandemic, that's what I just answered as well before, which is one of the reasons why our performance in institutional will improve. And the last pillar give the customer experience, e-commerce, for instance, that has gained traction in 2020 also because of the remote nature of the customer relationship that we had during the pandemic. So all 3 fronts, good progress in 2020. And when I look at the progress we're making in digital in 2021, our digital-enabled sales are roughly $1.5 billion and growing double-digit as we speak.

And since then, this business has been growing strong double-digit, operating income improvement very strong as well. And interestingly enough, so the customers that we serve, which are the tech companies, the ones are owning those data centers operations, at the same time, have made big commitments in terms of water and carbon savings. Well, this is the work we do for them because that's ultimately where they use the water or emit CO2 because of the energy that they need to use for the computers as such, which brought them back to us. You've heard from Microsoft as well. They've shared it openly publicly, so it's not a secret that they've committed for the net 0 water by 2030, and that's a plan that we've developed with them. That's all driving the growth in that new vertical, which is very promising."

If I think about our end markets, it's not going to be true for everyone. For the independents, it's being difficult, obviously, for individual restaurants during the endemic financially so to survive. Those ones have more hot ship than the chain customers, which is the vast majority of our business. So corporate account customers, as we call them, or the chains, are the ones who have well survived, the ones who have invested in the operations and the one who are expanding as well in terms of units. This is all we serve first and foremost. So that's a good situation to be in for us. Then to your question on the restaurant or the hotel of the future. To know exactly how it's going to be is hard to tell. But a few things we know. On one hand, so the hygiene standards are expected by the guests will be up versus 2019. It's going to be a little bit lower than during the pandemic, thank god, but it's going to be higher than 2019 and that's pretty sure. And we are asking guests or consumers all the time in order to understand. So what's happening in their mind, and they're clearly telling us that they're expecting higher hygiene standards, more clean, they want to see clean in action in order to feel safe, which is good. Second, the labor shortage is going to become a bigger issue. It was an issue pre-pandemic. It's going to be even more. So going forward, as we read in the newspaper. Well, our solutions are helping them deliver more with less labor. Which is good as well as search. And the last thing, which is harder to grasp completely is how much the takeout, the delivery is going to grow. It's going to keep growing for sure. And those are new opportunities for us because those are new businesses as well. We haven't figured it out completely, but I see that as upside. So net-net, for our customers, the chain customers, it's going to be different than '19, but it's going to be better for us as a company going forward."

And as you remember, in Q4, lockdown so went backwards in Q4 versus Q3. Well, that was not exactly a great news. And still, we improved our performance in Q4 versus Q3. So the question was, how is it going to continue in Q1. And that we didn't know, obviously as we started our year '21. So we were hoping that things would be improving. And ultimately, they did. But they did not in January or February, they did in March. So we were thinking, so Q1 would be a difficult quarter compared versus Q4, so modest improvement. Ultimately, ex Texas, it was better than what we felt in Q1. So if I look at that, the reopening in the U.S. states is a good news. Obviously, so for us going forward, China has been good since the beginning of the year. So those 2 markets are really on the positive side of the ledger. The other hand, so you have Europe and some emerging markets like Brazil or India that are in a more difficult situation. So net-net, it's basically as expected. And the last thing that I would say is that because of the timing of the reopenings in Europe, that's going to happen. So towards the end of Q2, some of the growth that we had expected in Q2 might shift in the but all in all, so I feel that net-net, the trends are as expected. Our cost structure is as expected. The timing might be a little bit different than what we had in mind initially, but at the end of the year, so it ends up to this full year delivery that's ahead of the EPS '19 excluding this Texas impact."

With me today are Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results, are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials which state that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview. The first quarter showed continued sequential business improvement that was offset by the Texas freeze. Adjusted EPS were $0.81. That EPS included the impact of short-term supply chain and customer disruption from the freeze that were estimated to be $0.10 per share. Healthcare and Life Sciences segment showed further strong sales growth. The Industrial segment experienced a modest sales decline as its growth was offset by the freeze impact. The Other segment significantly narrowed its sales decline from the fourth quarter and Institutional & Specialty segment sales decline narrowed slightly from the fourth quarter as sales trends within our U.S. Institutional business improved through the end of the first quarter.
Our markets are broadly improving and increasing rate of vaccination, along with the easing of social restrictions, provides further support for the global economic recovery. We expect that broad improvement, leveraged by our investments and the work we have done to further our critical innovation, service and digital business drivers, as well as our cost efficiency measures, will help drive strong comparisons against 2020 results over the balance of the year and result in 2021 adjusted earnings per share that exceed 2019 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the estimated $0.15 per share impact from the Texas freeze.
Over the past year, we've seen the value of Ecolab's premium product and service expertise once again underscored through continued strong new business growth as well as our strengthened customer relationships despite the difficult market conditions. Our position as leader in food safety, clean water and healthy environments has become even more important. We believe this position, along with our strong long-term growth opportunities, remain robust, driven by our huge remaining market opportunity, our leading global market position, our focus on providing our strong customer base with improved results while lowering their water, energy and other operating costs, and through that, our ability to help them meet their growing ESG ambitions. We believe these sustainable long-term business drivers will continue to yield superior long-term performance for Ecolab and our investors.
And now, here's Christophe Beck with his comments."

I'm very pleased with our first quarter, which was right in line with our expectations.

I'm very pleased with our first quarter, which was right in line with our expectations. Excluding the Texas freeze, which we discussed earlier, our business continued to show solid fundamental improvement that gives us confidence in our full year outlook. Our underlying business momentum as well as margin development kept improving across the board, leading to strong results in the first quarter. Excluding the short-term impact of the Texas freeze, our Q1 adjusted EPS showed a significantly narrowing decline versus the prior year, continuing our improving quarterly trends. It's also ahead of what we delivered in Q1 2019, which is a good indication for our expected full year delivery. We did all this while continuing to invest in our major growth initiatives and in our global team capabilities to leverage our position as the markets reopen.
Excluding the freeze, all segments stayed strong or showed continued sequential improvement. Our fundamental business trends kept gaining momentum, especially in our Institutional division, which saw a definite pick up as we exited March. Our Industrial segment, which was most impacted by the Texas freeze, delivered improved underlying growth trends versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and continue to further strengthen its margin. Healthcare and Life Sciences maintained a strong double-digit growth and solid margin improvement. This good start strengthens our confidence for the full year and beyond. Our general market outlook remains largely unchanged versus what we said in previous calls. North America and China are moving ahead of our previous expectations, while Europe and several emerging markets remain behind as they recover from extended lockdowns and are still impacted by a rather slow pace of vaccination.
So while the exact timing of the global reopenings might shift a few months, which might also shift some of the recovery into Q3, we expect strong growth in the second quarter, driven by improving end markets and accelerated underlying growth momentum. We expect these trends to continue in the second half of the year. Our objective has been to start the year in a position of strength. And Q1 shows we clearly achieved this. Our net new business pipeline increased to record highs, and our global market shares are strengthening. Our differentiated innovations are continuing to help our customers protect their consumers and our world-class programs help them preserve vital natural resources while generating very attractive financial returns.
And with our new Ecolab Science Certified assurance program, we have become the brand that reissues customers and consumers in times they need it the most. All this underscores our confidence that we are on a path to deliver full year '21 adjusted EPS ahead of 2019 EPS, excluding the estimated $0.15 impact of the Texas freeze. Looking beyond the pandemic, our longer-term position is better than ever. In a world where hygiene standards are rising, where food safety and infection risk awareness has reached new levels, where the expected gap between water supply and water demand is wider than ever, our differentiated value proposition as the global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention services and technologies positions us uniquely to capture this accelerating growth trends. 
The combination of this unmatched value proposition and the breadth of our comprehensive offering makes us the obvious partner for global companies to help them deliver on their most ambitious sustainability commitment. Our ability to serve customers at 3 million locations in 172 countries with 25,000 dedicated underground experts in 40 industries allows us to deliver the same standards of quality and performance anywhere around the world. And our new business pipeline, breakthrough innovation, unmatched digital footprint, world-class scientific expertise and passion for exceptional execution will continue to lead to sustained growth momentum and continued double-digit earnings growth for the years to come. I look forward to your question.  
So Mike, back to you."

And if I look at '21, it's kind of an on-off approach that they are having. So first, I'd like to put on the sites of the U.K., which are partly reopen, as we know, so way ahead in terms of vaccinations versus Continental Europe. So U.K., we saw a good development over there. Continental Europe, so most of the countries are in complete lockdown. So most of the large countries have curfews even as well. 
That's true for Germany and for France, for instance, as well. So most, if not all, of the restaurants and hotels are, for the most part, closed, which is something that's going to change, hopefully, before the summer. They're all talking about reopening in order to protect the summer season. I hope that, that's going to be true. It's going to be a bit later than what I had expected ultimately here, but then it's going to drive a rebound, which is going to be positive in Q3. So as mentioned before, we might have some of the growth we were expecting in Q2 shifting to Q3. But all in all, so for the full year, it's going to be similar than what we had thought."

Just for common reference maybe, it's probably helpful, again, to build up the pieces of our cost savings program, which you'll recall was originally announced clear back in 2018 as Accelerate 2020. This was the initiative to capture the investments in our digital offering with a $200 million cost savings target. We expanded it at the time we announced the ChampionX and covered things like stranded costs and anticipated costs related to ChampionX. We expanded it again to cover some aspects of supply chain industrial business and most recently to cover some restructuring or really some reshaping maybe of our institutional business to improve principally steel delivery. 
So you add all that up and we have a targeted cost savings of about $365 million. Some of that is in gross margin. The big bulk of it is in SG&A. Year-on-year, the incremental piece that we expect to capture in 2021 is in the neighborhood, if you look just at the SG&A piece, $120 million-ish range. So it's a big help in 2021. Mind you there's a lot of -- $91 million, I'm sorry. There's a big piece that is captured. But the net of it is that we think that this entire program will essentially be delivered by the end of 2021.

So we're measuring as well so the number of locations that are certified by -- Ecolab Science Certified. It's pretty large.

So you're right. We built significant inventory versus the same time last year, also versus year-end 2020. And my guess is that we will continue to because we'll have the right stuff where we and our customers both need it. 
If you think about the recovery of the business generally, rebuilding the balance sheet means that there will be some pull on inventory, accounts receivables, too, which are in very good shape from a payment perspective, but as people buy more stuff, we'll have more on the balance sheet and accounts receivable. We'll continue to manage our vendors in what we purchase with appropriate discipline. But look, there'll be an investment in working capital as the business rebuilds, which is to be expected and completely appropriate. The net, though, of our cash flow delivery for the full year, even including the higher level of CapEx that we will continue to invest in the business in 2021, our cash flow will continue to be bigger. And also, it will be -- if you think about the metric that matters most to me in terms of conversion, it will continue to be in the mid-90% range, which I think is a very good number for the company and for the model, okay?"

There will be times with raw materials and pricing, where quarter-over-quarter things might lag a little bit. But generally, margins will continue to improve in Industrial, especially because the value that we provide to our customers is unmatched. 
As mentioned before, most of the customers are coming to us, especially in our water business, is to help them reach the ESG commitments that they've made for 2030 or 2050. Well, there's no one else that can truly help them as we can. This is something that is driving growth, and it's driving margins as well for us because they need better technology, which is where we invest most in research as well. That's where we have the highest margin. So it's good growth driven by good natural impact, which is driving as well our margin.

Obviously, when there are raw material increases, like we are and will be experiencing in the next quarters and probably years to come, well, we add that to the equation. We've been quite successful over the past few years in doing that. That's been one of the reasons why margins have improved so well over the past few years and especially as well last year.

But on the other hand, it's also in times where performance -- cost performance becomes more important. Think about some of the end markets are economically challenged right now. 
Well, our solutions usually are very healthy for those customers because it helps them improve their cost competitiveness because you can do the same work -- the same outcome or better outcome with much less labor or creating less waste or using less natural resources as well. So it's a good financial deal. So on both sides for customers in most segments, well, they need more of what we do in order to reduce the impact on the environment.

Obviously, you talked about some of the large governmental orders and other things that probably helped your fixed cost leverage in that segment over the past 12 months. I was just wondering, as those comparisons are now stiffer and the business starts to normalize above historical levels, but starts to normalize from last year at least, if you think that some of the fixed cost leverage goes away, if that's the appropriate way of thinking about that segment's margins in the 12 months ahead? 
And then, secondarily, just maybe a little bit more detail on the Institutional segment margins. Obviously, the volume declines were significant and it all makes sense, what happened to the margins so far. But on the way back up with the cost reductions and programs that you've put in place, do you think that when the revenue level gets back to 2019 levels, is there any reason to think that the margins would be any different in that business than they were pre-COVID just recognizing that the customer base is probably going to be somewhat changed, maybe not yours so much given national accounts, but there are a lot of changes to hospitality and foodservice.

Maybe starting with Healthcare, very different dynamic, obviously, than in Institutional. So in Healthcare, first of all, very pleased with the underlying growth performance moving towards this 5%, which was an objective for a long time. It's taken us so many years to get there. And COVID has helped because the infection prevention, awareness of customers and patients, in that case, well, has gone up very clearly during COVID-19, so which is good. So underlying growth, solid in Healthcare, and that's here to stay. 
Second, on margins, very good improvement last year. In some cases, helped partly with the one-offs, those government deals that we talked about earlier. But I feel really good that margins is going to keep improving in '21 and in the future as well. So this is here to stay. So good story in Healthcare. And for me, that's not the end of the story. It's clearly so up to us to improve it further. That's on Healthcare. Institutional is a very different story, especially coming out of 2020, which is a business that's been impacted the most in our company. 90% plus of the COVID impact at Ecolab was on Institutional division, as we all know, which is 20% of our overall company as such. 
So when I think about the margins, I'd say 2 things, Andy. The first one is every quarter, it's going to improve, and we're going to get a lot back from what we lost in 2020, and we'll get close to where we were in 2019 pre-pandemic. So probably not at the end of this year, but early in 2022. And the second part of your question, so post-pandemic, if I can call it that way, well, we've invested in our organizational development/restructure. We've invested as well in field technology that's going to help us well the performance. So if anything, the margins of Institutional over the midterm should improve versus what we have seen pre-pandemic."

It started 30 years ago. Actually, it was called differently obviously back then. That was true when we did remote monitoring of pools and spa in Institutional and that was especially true with 3D TRASAR in industrial water business as well. And if I fast forward, ultimately, so for 2020 things have accelerated because, in many instances, we could not go to customer locations for obvious reasons related to COVID. So customers and our teams have embraced digital solutions even more than before. 
Keep in mind as well that we've invested over the past 5 years over $150 million a year in digital. So we were ready for that moment during the pandemic. That was more luck than genius, obviously, as such, but it came very handy as well as such. So when I think about the 3 main drivers for us in digital at Ecolab, the first one is to drive customer value. So it's subscriptions. It's a Legionella prevention programs, for instance, as well. They're all driven by digital technology. We sell that technology. This is growing very nicely. The second one is our field solutions in order to improve the productivity and the value created by our 25,000 people around the world. 
Institutional has rolled out everywhere around the world the new platform during COVID, and that's going to help us as well. So for post-pandemic, that's what I just answered as well before, which is one of the reasons why our performance in institutional will improve. And the last pillar is the customer experience, e-commerce, for instance, that has gained traction in 2020 also because of the remote nature of the customer relationship that we had during the pandemic. So on all 3 fronts, good progress in 2020. And when I look at the progress we're making in digital in 2021, our digital-enabled sales are roughly $1.5 billion and growing double-digit as we speak. So a very good story all in all."

And since then, this business has been growing strong double-digit, operating income improvement, very strong as well. 
And interestingly enough, so the customers that we serve, which are the tech companies, the ones are owning those data centers operations, at the same time, have made big commitments in terms of water and carbon savings. Well, this is the work we do for them because that's ultimately where they use the water or emit CO2 because of the energy that they need to use for the computers as such, which has brought them back to us. You've heard from Microsoft as well. They've shared it openly publicly, so it's not a secret that they've committed for the net 0 water by 2030, and that's a plan that we've developed with them.

Those ones have more hardship than the chain customers, which is the vast majority of our business. So corporate account customers, as we call them, or the chains, are the ones who have well survived, the ones who have invested in the operations and the one who are expanding as well in terms of units. This is who we serve first and foremost. So that's a good situation to be in for us. 
Then to your question on the restaurant or the hotel of the future. To know exactly how it's going to be is hard to tell. But a few things we know. On one hand, so the hygiene standards expected by the guests will be up versus 2019. It's going to be a little bit lower than during the pandemic, thank God, but it's going to be higher than 2019, that's pretty sure. And we are asking guests or consumers all the time in order to understand so what's happening in their mind, and they're clearly telling us that they're expecting higher hygiene standards, more clean. They want to see cleaning action in order to feel safe, which is good. 
Second, the labor shortage is going to become a bigger issue. It was an issue pre-pandemic. It's going to be even more. So going forward, as we read in the newspaper. Well, our solutions are helping them deliver more with less labor, which is good as well as such. And the last thing, which is harder to grasp completely, is how much the takeout, the delivery is going to grow. It's going to keep growing for sure. And those are new opportunities for us because those are new businesses as well. We haven't figured it out completely, but I see that as upside. So net-net, for our customers, the chain customers, it's going to be different than '19, but it's going to be better for us as a company going forward."

And as you remember, in Q4, the lockdown so went backwards in Q4 versus Q3. Well, that was not exactly a great news. And still, we improved our performance in Q4 versus Q3. So the question was, how is it going to continue in Q1. And that we didn't know, obviously, as we started our year '21. So we were hoping that things would be improving. And ultimately, they did. But they did not in January or February. They did in March. So we were thinking, so Q1 would be a difficult quarter compared -- versus Q4, so modest improvement. 
Ultimately, ex Texas, it was better than what we felt in Q1. So if I look at that, the reopening in the U.S. states is a good news. Obviously, so for us going forward, China has been good since the beginning of the year. So those 2 markets are really on the positive side of the ledger. On the other hand, so you have Europe and some emerging markets like Brazil or India that are in a more difficult situation. So net-net, it's basically as expected. And the last thing that I would say is that because of the timing of the reopenings in Europe, that's going to happen, so towards the end of Q2, some of the growth that we had expected in Q2 might shift in Q3. But all in all, so I feel that net-net, the trends are as expected. Our cost structure is as expected. The timing might be a little bit different than what we had in mind initially, but at the end of the year so it ends up sort of this full year delivery that's ahead of the EPS '19, excluding this Texas impact."

With me today are Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results, are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. 
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials, which state that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release. 
Starting with a few -- brief overview. Strong second quarter results reflected significant year-on-year sales and earnings growth, driven by recovering markets, accelerating pricing and new business wins, which more than offset increased delivered product costs and the slower pace of reopenings outside the U.S. We've implemented aggressive pricing actions to offset increase over product costs leveraging the strong product and service value we deliver to customers. When combined with our strong new business wins, we expect to once again successfully manage the current inflation challenges and uneven global economic recovery to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth in 2021. 
Our position as a leader in food safety, clean water and healthy environments has become even more important in the last 18 months. We believe this position, along with our strong long-term growth opportunities, remain robust driven by our huge remaining market opportunity, our leading global market positions, our focus on providing our strong customer base with improved results while lowering their water, energy and other operating costs and, through that, our ability to help them meet their growing ESG ambitions. We believe that these sustainable long-term business drivers will continue to yield superior long-term performance for Ecolab and our investors. And now here's Christophe Beck with his comments."

As expected, Q2 was indeed a very strong quarter for our company. Acquisition adjusted sales rose 12%, driven by the U.S. and China with the reopening of Europe and the rest of the world expected to follow progressively. Adjusted earnings per share ended up a strong 88% over last year. U.S. institutional sales more than doubled in the second quarter versus the same quarter in 2020, clearly outperforming the industry. The number of restaurants we serve as well as the number of solutions they buy from us ended up almost back to 2019 levels and are growing fast. Both are strong signs of how much business we've gained during the pandemic and the growth potential we have as markets reopen. 
Industrial accelerated to 3% in Q2, driven by strong business -- strong new business generated during the pandemic and accelerated pricing. Water sales were up 7% with light industries up 12% driven by strong momentum in new segments like data centers, which, by the way, grew 53% in the quarter. Paper was up 10% driven by strong demand for our innovative solutions in board and packaging, while Food and Beverage kept improving. Downstream remained a bit challenged in the quarter as it repositions itself from a focus on operational efficiency to a new promising sustainability offerings. Healthcare and Life Sciences also had very strong and consistent underlying sales growth in Q2 with mid-single and double-digit growth, respectively. Reported sales were only down as they respectively compared to exceptional growth of 13% and 53% in 2020, largely [Audio Gap] made in digital technology during the pandemic as well as overall pricing that accelerated to 2% in the second quarter. 
With this backdrop and for the full year, we remain confident of our ability to deliver adjusted earnings that are better than 2019, excluding the Texas raise. How much better is the only question, considering the delta variant, the timing of your opening in Europe and in the rest of the world as well as the speed and amplitude of the rise of inflation. 
More broadly, our longer-term outlook has never been stronger. Our new business and innovation pipelines are at record levels. Our new growth engines like life sciences, health care, high tech and data centers are all very well positioned to drive incremental growth. And our digital capabilities continue to increase customer value, field productivity and customer experience. 
Our main focus right now will be to leverage this positive pricing environment to protect and strengthen our margins and do so while further enhancing value for our customers. This is something we've accomplished many times in the past and expect to successfully accomplish once again. Therefore, we've now embarked on a third round of price increases, which will progressively cover the new rapid rise of input costs that we've seen in Q2 with the biggest impact to be seen in Q4 when we expect pricing to reach 4%. 
Overall, we feel good about our ability to deliver the second half of '21 even if the pacing between the next 2 quarters will be slightly different than initially anticipated. We now expect attractive sequential improvement in the third quarter and a more significant one in the fourth as pricing actions will hit the P&L. 
And finally, global trends in people health, like infection prevention and food safety; as well as planet health, like water and carbon emissions are becoming front and center for every business leader. And there's no one positioned to help customers on both fronts better than Ecolab while helping them ensure strong and long-term business sales. In other words, we're strengthening our global position as the natural sustainability partner for our customers. All this, combined with the strengthened highly innovative portfolio, strong business momentum, terrific new wins, accelerated pricing and unique digital capabilities to position us with great momentum for '22 and will contribute to drive continued strong digital -- double-digit earnings growth for the years to come. With that, I look forward to your questions."

We've engaged those new plants as well with the whole team. We have indicated that as well to customers and progress is good. So we were ahead.

But let's keep in mind as well that in order to get the margins back to where they used to be, we need to double the pricing versus the input costs since we have a gross margin of 50%.

What's important for me is really to look at the underlying growth. So when we strip out -- so the unusual demand of 2020 and one-timers, you see Healthcare, so in mid-single digit, which is better than where we used to be. So this 2%, 3% in the past has moved so closer to the 5%-ish.

But if I just unpack them, just for you, you saw industrial first. Yes, it's growing. But as mentioned before, so it's impacted the most by the input cost, as is always the case. So nothing unusual in here. They have also the biggest share in pricing, and they're really good at it as well at the same time. So there are different elements of cost and price are different, but ultimately so, industrial is going to keep its development in gross margin, and we expect the overall year to stay fairly close to where it used to be as well so last year. 
Healthcare and Life Science, it's -- as mentioned before, so we're comparing to very unusual growth numbers in Q2 as well last year. And if you strip that out, ultimately, so our margins have improved very nicely in 2020. And we expect as well in Healthcare, Life Science to get quite close to where we were in terms of record margins in '21. And as you mentioned, so institutional is on its path to recover as such. So it's maybe so the business where the margin we had in Q2, the improvement in Q2, so it was a bit overstated as such because we compare in 2020 as well with 2 special events. The first one was the bad debt that we recorded for obvious reasons in Q2 during the beginning of the pandemic. And second, we foregone as well so the lease payments for dishmachines. So you compare something that was lower. As such, it's going to change a little bit in Q3 and Q4. 
But overall, for the company, good situation in margin and assuming that our assumption obviously is for roles and pricing happen as planned, which I do ultimately, so margins should keep evolving as expected."

We've been growing for a long time. We are still growing right now, and we were growing during the pandemic. So this is an end market we like in an end market that we want to further focus on and we're bringing new solutions as well to recycle better plastic, for instance, which is very traditional with our sustainable solutions approach for this business. 
And then the last point is refining, which is an industry that is in a complete transformation. As we all know, they have to reduce their footprint in terms of carbon footprint as well in here. And that's going to take a few years. So for us to get it right in the way that we have refineries produce with a lower carbon footprint and very good pilot project in there and help those companies as well refocus on renewable as well.

Actually, it's one of the areas where we've made the most progress which is really good news. Industrial is doing really well in Healthcare as well as Life Science has always been great at it, which we see in the numbers as such. So a really good story. I would say one of the new emerging stories in your business is, interestingly enough, our strengthening our relationships with them because they need our help even more than before, and that's growing as well as our new business opportunities because they need our help in all the units around the world and need much more solutions as well from us in order to get closer to the net zero ambition. So that's one of the new drivers that we're seeing emerging, which is good for our company."

In the past, we've created a dedicated unit 12 or 18 mo",333,"Yes. So starting with data centers. As mentioned earlier, we've been growing I think, 53% in the second quarter. It's been a terrific story. It used to be part of our light water industries business. In the past, we've created a dedicated unit 12 or 18 months ago, which is really a division that's focused on data centers and microelectronics, by the way, the Intel of that world as well. And interestingly enough, its new expertise that we could build, its new offering that we could provide to those companies that are really interested in close to 100% uptime for all the reasons that we understand, our secure solutions as well from a digital technology perspective, they want to make sure that any access that we have with them is done in a totally secure way as well. And those are companies that are very sustainability-friendly as well. So they all want to get -- so close to the net zero as fast as they can. All that is really driving that business in a great way. 
Animal health is a complete different story. Obviously, as such, this is something that takes time as well. We've created a dedicated unit. We've made acquisitions as well in that field, underlying. I like where we're going. Q2 has been a bit subpar because we compare it to a very high Q2 in 2020, but that's a business that's going to be very interesting going forward for at least one important reason that most of the farmers won't be or are not allowed to use antibiotics to protect the animals, and they need way more solutions in order to make sure that they are in a healthy environment in order not to get sick. And this is exactly what animal health is doing in our business. So it's an evolving proposition, but that's clearly aligned with the longer-term trends that customers and consumers like you and I ultimately are expecting -- so from the food manufacturers."

So in order to get there, you need to have digital technology because you need to understand to make it easy to recycle water, which is a physical product.

With me today are Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results, are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. 
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials, which state that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release. 
Starting with a few -- brief overview. Strong second quarter results reflected significant year-on-year sales and earnings growth, driven by recovering markets, accelerating pricing and new business wins, which more than offset increased delivered product costs and the slower pace of reopenings outside the U.S. We've implemented aggressive pricing actions to offset increase over product costs leveraging the strong product and service value we deliver to customers. When combined with our strong new business wins, we expect to once again successfully manage the current inflation challenges and uneven global economic recovery to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth in 2021. 
Our position as a leader in food safety, clean water and healthy environments has become even more important in the last 18 months. We believe this position, along with our strong long-term growth opportunities, remain robust driven by our huge remaining market opportunity, our leading global market positions, our focus on providing our strong customer base with improved results while lowering their water, energy and other operating costs and, through that, our ability to help them meet their growing ESG ambitions. We believe that these sustainable long-term business drivers will continue to yield superior long-term performance for Ecolab and our investors. And now here's Christophe Beck with his comments."

As expected, Q2 was indeed a very strong quarter for our company. Acquisition adjusted sales rose 12%, driven by the U.S. and China with the reopening of Europe and the rest of the world expected to follow progressively. Adjusted earnings per share ended up a strong 88% over last year. U.S. institutional sales more than doubled in the second quarter versus the same quarter in 2020, clearly outperforming the industry. The number of restaurants we serve as well as the number of solutions they buy from us ended up almost back to 2019 levels and are growing fast. Both are strong signs of how much business we've gained during the pandemic and the growth potential we have as markets reopen. 
Industrial accelerated to 3% in Q2, driven by strong business -- strong new business generated during the pandemic and accelerated pricing. Water sales were up 7% with light industries up 12% driven by strong momentum in new segments like data centers, which, by the way, grew 53% in the quarter. Paper was up 10% driven by strong demand for our innovative solutions in board and packaging, while Food and Beverage kept improving. Downstream remained a bit challenged in the quarter as it repositions itself from a focus on operational efficiency to a new promising sustainability offerings. Healthcare and Life Sciences also had very strong and consistent underlying sales growth in Q2 with mid-single and double-digit growth, respectively. Reported sales were only down as they respectively compared to exceptional growth of 13% and 53% in 2020, largely driven by unusual high demand and onetimers during the pandemic. And finally, the other segments grew 23% driven by continued strength of pest elimination, which was up 21% in the quarter, benefiting from further market reopening and very strong in the business. 
On the margin front, things progressed very well, too, with overall margins improving 420 basis points. Beyond the U.S. institutional recovery, our continued progress benefited from accelerated investment made in digital technology during the pandemic as well as overall pricing that accelerated to 2% in the second quarter. 
With this backdrop and for the full year, we remain confident of our ability to deliver adjusted earnings that are better than 2019, excluding the Texas raise. How much better is the only question, considering the delta variant, the timing of your opening in Europe and in the rest of the world as well as the speed and amplitude of the rise of inflation. 
More broadly, our longer-term outlook has never been stronger. Our new business and innovation pipelines are at record levels. Our new growth engines like life sciences, health care, high tech and data centers are all very well positioned to drive incremental growth. And our digital capabilities continue to increase customer value, field productivity and customer experience. 
Our main focus right now will be to leverage this positive pricing environment to protect and strengthen our margins and do so while further enhancing value for our customers. This is something we've accomplished many times in the past and expect to successfully accomplish once again. Therefore, we've now embarked on a third round of price increases, which will progressively cover the new rapid rise of input costs that we've seen in Q2 with the biggest impact to be seen in Q4 when we expect pricing to reach 4%. 
Overall, we feel good about our ability to deliver the second half of '21 even if the pacing between the next 2 quarters will be slightly different than initially anticipated. We now expect attractive sequential improvement in the third quarter and a more significant one in the fourth as pricing actions will hit the P&L. 
And finally, global trends in people health, like infection prevention and food safety; as well as planet health, like water and carbon emissions are becoming front and center for every business leader. And there's no one positioned to help customers on both fronts better than Ecolab while helping them ensure strong and long-term business sales. In other words, we're strengthening our global position as the natural sustainability partner for our customers. All this, combined with the strengthened highly innovative portfolio, strong business momentum, terrific new wins, accelerated pricing and unique digital capabilities to position us with great momentum for '22 and will contribute to drive continued strong digital -- double-digit earnings growth for the years to come. With that, I look forward to your questions."

Healthcare and Life Science, it's -- as mentioned before, so we're comparing to very unusual growth numbers in Q2 as well last year.

So it's maybe so the business where the margin we had in Q2, the improvement in Q2, so it was a bit overstated as such because we compare in 2020 as well with 2 special events. The first one was the bad debt that we recorded for obvious reasons in Q2 during the beginning of the pandemic. And second, we foregone as well so the lease payments for dishmachines.

The mining point, moving away from coal and refocusing towards fertilizers, for instance, which are related to ag and to food, is something that we started, obviously, way before the pandemic, and it's working really well. So our exposure to coal so has become minimal over the past years, and our exposure to the growth segment has become much better as well. So risks are lower and growth potential are higher, which is good. 
On the downstream side, it's a bit different. Downstream, it's a bit of a tale of 2 stories in here. So you have petrochem kind of plastics, which is an end market that's doing well. We've been growing for a long time. We are still growing right now, and we were growing during the pandemic. So this is an end market we like in an end market that we want to further focus on and we're bringing new solutions as well to recycle better plastic, for instance, which is very traditional with our sustainable solutions approach for this business. 
And then the last point is refining, which is an industry that is in a complete transformation. As we all know, they have to reduce their footprint in terms of carbon footprint as well in here. And that's going to take a few years. So for us to get it right in the way that we have refineries produce with a lower carbon footprint and very good pilot project in there and help those companies as well refocus on renewable as well.

Early Q3. Let's put it that way, as you've read as well in the newspaper, I had a chance as well to spend a few weeks as well in Europe. So towards the end of June. And Europe was clearly close until June, then suddenly, we opened everything. So we've really seen a pickup in our institutional business, so first and foremost, because kind of went from 0 to kind of open. Obviously, that's quite a dramatic change, and we've seen that in our numbers, so very encouraging trends in institutional Europe. 
And we see industrial, which was in a very different place, they were not closed, obviously, like restaurants and hotels, improving as well. So overall, Europe doing okay so far. -- an international overall as well, it's an interesting perspective as well to keep in mind where last year, international was kind of flat, which means outside North America. So it was kind of flat for the whole company. And we see it coming back to growth, not only in Q2, but it's going to get even better in Q3. So good news on that front, too."

I like where we're going. Q2 has been a bit subpar because we compare it to a very high Q2 in 2020, but that's a business that's going to be very interesting going forward for at least one important reason that most of the farmers won't be or are not allowed to use antibiotics to protect the animals, and they need way more solutions in order to make sure that they are in a healthy environment in order not to get sick.

So customers that are asking us to partner with us in order to find a path in order to get to net zero or positive water or carbon, Microsoft being one of the obvious ones. And it's not a secret since they've been expressing that on CNN over the past year or so. 
So in order to get there, you need to have digital technology because you need to understand to make it easy to recycle water, which is a physical product. We need to understand in real time the quality of the water or like thereof actually, which indicates what kind of chemistry we need or what kind of technology is required in order to bring it back to the standard level that's being used in a data center or in a food plant as such. This is a direct application of our digital technology. 
And second is the  how. Since we are serving thousands of locations out there in the world, we are uniquely placed to know what's the world-class performance that can be achieved. Take a brewery, for instance, how much water per hectoliter of beer that's being produced. Well, we can compare within a company, a brewing company, how does the performance of the individual plants compared to the best in class. We can compare across brewers as well. We can compare across industries as well as a company as well. So we can provide customers with good benchmark of what good looks like; and second, how to get there as well. That's all enabled by digital technology that we've been building, developing and implementing, so over the last 10, 20 years around the world."

With me today are Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results, are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials, which state that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a few -- brief overview. Strong second quarter results reflected significant year-on-year sales and earnings growth driven by recovering markets, accelerating pricing and new business wins, which more than offset increased delivered product costs and the slower pace of reopenings outside the U.S. We have implemented aggressive pricing actions to offset increased over product costs, leveraging the strong product and service value we deliver to customers. When combined with our strong new business wins, we expect to once again successfully manage the current inflation challenges and uneven global economic recovery to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth in 2021.
Our position as a leader in food safety, clean water and healthy environments has become even more important in the last 18 months. We believe this position, along with our strong long-term growth opportunities, remain robust driven by our huge remaining market opportunity, our leading global market positions, our focus on providing our strong customer base with improved results while lowering their water, energy and other operating costs and through that, our ability to help them meet their growing ESG ambitions. We believe that these sustainable long-term business drivers will continue to yield superior long-term performance for Ecolab and our investors.
And now here's Christophe Beck with his comments."

As expected, Q2 was indeed a very strong quarter for our company. Acquisition adjusted sales rose 12% driven by the U.S. and China, with the reopening of Europe and the rest of the world expected to follow progressively. Adjusted earnings per share ended up a strong 88% over last year. U.S. Institutional sales more than doubled in the second quarter versus the same quarter in 2020, clearly outperforming the industry. The number of restaurants we serve as well as the number of solutions they buy from us ended up almost back to 2019 levels and are growing fast. Both are strong signs of how much business we've gained during the pandemic and the growth potential we have as markets reopen.
Industrial accelerated to 3% in Q2 driven by strong business -- strong new business generated during the pandemic and accelerated pricing. Water sales were up 7%, with light industries up 12% driven by strong momentum in new segments like data centers, which, by the way, grew 53% in the quarter. Paper was up 10% driven by strong demand for our innovative solutions in board and packaging, while Food & Beverage kept improving.
Downstream remained a bit challenged in the quarter as it repositions itself from a focus on operational efficiency, toward new promising sustainability offerings. Healthcare & Life Sciences also had very strong and consistent underlying sales growth in Q2, with mid-single and double-digit growth, respectively. Reported sales were only down as they respectively compare to exceptional growth of 13% and 53% in 2020, largely driven by unusual high demand and onetimers during the pandemic. And finally, the Other segment grew 23% driven by continued strength of Pest Elimination, which was up 21% in the quarter, benefiting from further markets reopening and very strong new business.
On the margin front, things progressed very well too, with overall margins improving 420 basis points. Beyond the U.S. Institutional recovery, our continued progress benefited from accelerated investment made in digital technology during the pandemic as well as overall pricing that accelerated to 2% in the second quarter.
With this backdrop and for the full year, we remain confident of our ability to deliver adjusted earnings that are better than 2019, excluding the Texas freeze. How much better is the only question, considering the Delta variant, the timing of the opening in Europe and in the rest of the world as well as the speed and amplitude of the rise of inflation.
More broadly, our longer-term outlook has never been stronger. Our new business and innovation pipelines are at record levels. Our new growth engines, like Life Sciences, Healthcare, high tech and data centers, are all very well-positioned to drive incremental growth. And our digital capabilities continue to increase customer value, field productivity and customer experience.
Our main focus right now will be to leverage this positive pricing environment to protect and strengthen our margins and do so while further enhancing value for our customers. This is something we've accomplished many times in the past and expect to successfully accomplish once again. Therefore, we have now embarked on a third round of price increases, which will progressively cover the new rapid rise of input costs that we've seen in Q2, with the biggest impact to be seen in Q4 when we expect pricing to reach 4%.
Overall, we feel good about our ability to deliver the second half of '21, even if the pacing between the next 2 quarters will be slightly different than initially anticipated. We now expect attractive sequential improvement in the third quarter and a more significant one in the fourth as pricing actions will hit the P&L.
And finally, global trends in people health, like infection prevention and food safety, as well as planet health, like water and carbon emissions, are becoming front and center for every business leader. And there's no one positioned to help customers on both fronts better than Ecolab, while helping them ensure strong and long-term business sales. In other words, we're strengthening our global position as the natural sustainability partner for our customers. All this, combined with the strengthened highly innovative portfolio, strong business momentum, terrific new wins, accelerated pricing and unique digital capabilities, to position us with great momentum for '22 and will contribute to drive continued strong digital -- double-digit earnings growth for the years to come.
With that, I look forward to your questions."

Now what has changed is that the indices as we've all seen, you've seen that as well, so during the second quarter so have changed for the much higher -- for the second half. And that has indicated we had to change our pricing plans quite significantly.
It's been the third time we've done it so over the last 12 months. We've engaged those new plans as well with the whole team. We have indicated that as well so to customers, and progress is good. So we were ahead. Market has changed a little bit, which forced us to change our plans as well. And I feel good right now that we will be in a good place so for the second half, both in terms of dollar and progressively improving the margin.
And now, to that point, it's going to impact mostly Q4 obviously because it takes some time obviously to agree with customers to get to that new pricing. So we will see a better improvement in Q4 than what we have expected and a lower improvement in Q3 than what we had expected.

The Delta variant is something that is really unusual, hard to predict as well. So that's the only question mark that we have out there.

But obviously, so the input cost has changed quite dramatically and the pricing has changed as well so quite a bit. We had initially thought so for the full year that our input cost would increase kind of mid-single digit. That was the initial plan. The way we look at it for the full year now, so it's closer to double digit numbers, so quite a change.
And we've changed pricing as well for that. We're good at it as well. But let's keep in mind as well that in order so to get the margins back to where they used to be, we need to double the pricing versus the input costs since we have a gross margin of 50%, so easy math as such. So overall, a good situation in terms of pricing versus input cost. Second half is going to deliver a similar improvement than what we had expected. But as mentioned earlier, the pacing between Q3 and Q4 will be different just because we need some time in order to get the agreement with customers."

And the dine-in traffic, which means, so in the dining room, so it was down 37% as well in the second quarter.
So with us being 91% of where we were before, so it's much better than where the market is. And the second perspective is also we measure how many restaurants, or hotels for that matter, so we serve and how many solutions they buy as well. And we are back to the levels that we were in 2019, knowing that the traffic is not as high as it used to be.

What's important for me is really to look at the underlying growth. So when we strip out so the unusual demand of 2020 and onetimers, you see Healthcare so in mid-single digit, which is better than where we used to be. So this 2%, 3% in the past has moved so closer to the 5%-ish. And Life Sciences as well underlying is in the double-digit territory, which is very good, so kind of sustained growth as well going forward.

But outside of Institutional, which presumably will continue to see the margin recover with revenue, for the other 3 businesses, is the margin this quarter a reasonable number to use to think about moving forward other than maybe a little bit of raw material hit in Q3 and maybe you get that back in Q4?

But if I just unpack them, just for you, so Industrial first. Yes, it's growing. But as mentioned before, so it's impacted the most by the input cost as is always the case. So nothing unusual in here. They have also the biggest share in pricing, and they're really good at it as well at the same time. So there are different elements of cost, and price are different. But ultimately, so industrial is going to keep its development so in gross margin, and we expect the overall year so to stay fairly close to where it used to be as well so last year.
Healthcare and Life Sciences, it's as mentioned before, so we're comparing to very unusual so growth numbers in Q2 as well last year. And if you strip that out, ultimately, so our margins have improved very nicely in 2020. And we expect as well in Healthcare, Life Sciences, so to get quite close to where we were in terms of record margins in '21. And as you mentioned, so Institutional so is on its path to recover as such, so it's maybe so the business where the margin we had in Q2, the improvement in Q2, so it was a bit overstated as such because we compare in 2020 as well with 2 special events. The first one was the bad debt that we recorded for obvious reasons in Q2 during the beginning of the pandemic. And second, we foregone as well so the lease payments for dishmachines. So you compare to something that was lower. As such, so it's going to change a little bit in Q3 and Q4.
But overall, for the company, a good situation in margin. And assuming that our assumption obviously, so for raws and pricing, happen as planned, which I do ultimately, so margins should keep evolving as expected."

So it's really so refocusing the portfolio towards the better opportunities. The mining point, moving away from coal and refocusing towards fertilizers, for instance, which are related to ag and to food, is something that we started, obviously, so way before the pandemic, and it's working really well. So our exposure to coal so has become minimal over the past years, and our exposure to the growth segment so has become much better as well. So risks are lower and growth potential are higher, which is good.
On the Downstream side, it's a bit different. Downstream, it's a bit of a tale of 2 stories in here. So you have petrochem, kind of plastics, which is an end market that's doing well. We've been growing for a long time. We are still growing right now, and we were growing during the pandemic. So this is an end market that we like and an end market that we want to further focus on. And we're bringing new solutions as well so to recycle better plastic, for instance, which is very traditional with our sustainable solutions approach for this business.
And then the last point is refining, which is an industry that is in a complete transformation. As we all know, they have to reduce their footprint in terms of carbon footprint as well in here. And that's going to take a few years. So for us, so to get it right in the way that we have refineries first to produce with a lower carbon footprint and very good pilot project in there and help those companies as well refocus on renewables as well.
So I like where we're going here, but that's going to take quite some time in order to get to a place where it's sustained high-level growth as well in refining. So that's the way I would express it."

But it's going to take us a year or 2 to get to the right place where we can say so we truly like the trajectory of that business. It's an industry that is in total transformation as well.
The good news is that we are uniquely positioned to work with those companies to help them get to the better place. I've had great discussions with some of the CEOs of those companies lately as well. They need us more than ever. That's especially true with European companies, but also in the U.S. So longer-term, I think it's going to be a very good opportunity for us."

I would say one of the new emerging stories in new business is, what many call, is net zero, with many customers, are trying to get closer to the sustainability ambitions, so water-neutral or water-positive or carbon-neutral, carbon-positive. And those discussions with those forward-looking companies, interestingly enough, are strengthening our relationships with them because they need our help even more than before.

In the past, we've created a dedicated unit, 12 or 18 months ago, which is really a division that's focused on data centers and microelectronics, by the way, the Intel of that world as well.
And interestingly enough, it's new expertise that we could build, it's new offering that we could provide to those companies that are really interested in close to 100% uptime for all the reasons that we understand, our secure solutions as well from a digital technology perspective, they want to make sure that any access that we have with them is done in a totally secure way as well. And those are companies that are very sustainability-friendly as well. So they all want to get so close to the net zero as fast as they can. All that is really driving that business in a great way.
Animal health is a complete different story. Obviously, as such, this is something that takes time as well. We've created a dedicated unit. We've made acquisitions as well in that field. Underlying, I like where we're going. Q2 has been a bit subpar because we compare it to a very high Q2 in 2020, but that's a business that's going to be very interesting going forward for at least one important reason, that most of the farmers won't be or are not allowed so to use antibiotics to protect the animals, and they need way more solutions in order to make sure that they are in a healthy environment in order not to get sick. And this is exactly what animal health is doing in our business. So it's an evolving proposition, but that's clearly aligned with the longer-term trends that customers and consumers like you and I ultimately are expecting so from the food manufacturers."

So customers that are asking us, so partner with us in order to find a path, in order to get to net zero or positive water or carbon, Microsoft being one of the obvious ones, and it's not a secret since they've been expressing that in -- on CNN so over the past year or so.
So in order to get there, you need to have digital technology because you need to understand to make it easy to recycle water, which is a physical product. We need to understand in real-time the quality of the water or lack thereof, actually, which indicates what kind of chemistry we need or what kind of technology is required in order to bring it back to the standard level that's being used in a data center or in a food plant as such. This is the direct application of our digital technology.
And second is the how. Since we are serving thousands of locations out there in the world, we are uniquely placed to know what's the world-class performance that can be achieved. Take a brewery, for instance, how much water per hectoliter of beer that's being produced. Well, we can compare within a company, a brewing company, how does the performance of the individual plants compared to the best-in-class. We can compare across brewers as well. We can compare across industries as well as a company as well. So we can provide customers with good benchmark of what good looks like and second, how to get there as well.

With me today are Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials which state that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release. Starting with a brief overview. -- strong third quarter results were driven with the continued recovery in the U.S. and improving European markets more than offset significantly increased delivered product and other costs. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect both accelerating sales volume and pricing momentum to leverage an expected continuing though uneven global recovery. We expect these drivers to result in the fourth quarter showing better year-on-year sales growth than the third quarter. We have also experienced continued substantial delivered product and other cost inflation that we believe will increase fourth quarter costs by nearly $0.20 per share. 
As a result, we expect fourth quarter earnings to grow double digits, though not as strong as the third quarter. We expect to once again successfully manage the current inflation challenges and uneven global economic recovery to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth in 2021 as the strong volume and pricing gains, along with productivity and cost reduction actions enabled us to offset the higher costs and yield double-digit earnings growth. 
Recent programs, including Ecolab Science Certified and Net Zero have further differentiated Ecolab's value proposition and enable us to help create better customer outcomes and reduce environmental impact while simultaneously reducing their costs. Our new business wins and innovative pipelines are at record levels. New market focus areas are positioned well to drive growth, and our leading digital capabilities continue to add competitive advantage. 
Our strong business momentum, along with enhanced value proposition and favorable macro trends position us well to leverage the post-COVID environment and deliver further superior shareholder returns next year and for the future. And now here's Christophe Beck with his comments."

Great to be together with you today. So Q3 has been another very good quarter for Ecolab, demonstrating once again that Ecolab is in a great shape with strong top line momentum and a proven ability to effectively mitigate the adverse effect of inflation and the so-called supply shortages. 
Underlying sales trends were strong across the board. In a complex environment, we delivered 10% reported and 8% fixed currency organic sales growth, driven, first and foremost, by continued strong momentum in Institutional and Specialty that delivered 17% sales growth in the quarter and 24% from the Institutional division. We also saw accelerated momentum in Industrial ads with 7% growth and 13% in other segments, driven by sustained high performance in Pest Elimination. Healthcare & Life Sciences posted negative sales growth year-on-year as they compare to exceptional growth during the pandemic as we know. However, the respective underlying sales growth stayed on a healthy mid-single and double-digit trajectory. 
This top line momentum, combined with accelerating pricing and structure productivity that's benefiting from our state-of-the-art digital automation drove the strong adjusted EPS delivery, more than offsetting short-term impact from Hurricane Ida and the rapid acceleration of global cost inflation. The team did an exceptional job minimizing the impact of Hurricane Ida, which we were able to successfully manage to be a much lower impact than initially expected at only $0.03 in the quarter. 
Most importantly, the team mitigated the impact of additional significant supply shortages to ensure exceptional service to customers while driving continued new business wins and strong price increases, contributing to a 31% increase in free cash flow. Current sales momentum is strong, and we expect it to accelerate. Strong new business and breakthrough innovation are expected to continue to drive top line growth. Also, pricing will keep accelerating towards 4%. 
The strong volume and price momentum is expected to result in Q4 showing better year-over-year sales growth than what we've seen in Q3. At the same time, delivered product costs will keep increasing rapidly, which we'll continue to mitigate with great pricing. However, as we know with our model, this takes time to do well in a way that's sustainable long term and aligned with the incremental value we create for customers. We therefore estimate that the time line between pricing and cost inflation will impact the fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.20 versus what we expected just a few months ago. But that, too, will address over the next few quarters. 
Next, we expect Q4 EPS to continue to grow double digits though not as strong as in Q3, which will help us exceed the year with great momentum. With strong volume growth, continued pricing and delivered product cost hopefully nearing its peak, we'll then enter 2022 in great position to deliver another great year for Ecolab. This strong fundamental business momentum combined with continued market recovery provides us with great confidence in the future and especially for '22. 
In a world full of uncertainties, we keep driving strong business wins and a competitive differentiation. In a world where customers struggle to find reliable partners for innovation, especially product supply and expertise to help them run the operations efficiently and serve their customers safely, we have substantially strengthened our position as their clear innovative and reliable global partner. 
In a world where our institutional and specialty customers and consumers, especially and concerned about increased risks of infection, Ecolab's certified has become deep reference that provides guests with the assurance they're looking for. And in a world where environmental impact has become front and center, our net 0 offering is providing industrial segment customers, especially leading in innovative ways to deliver on their commitments while improving their own financial returns. All this provides us with confidence that '22 will be another strong year for Ecolab with sales and earnings growth above our long-term trends. 
So with that, I look forward to your questions."

Volume is going up as well. So it's kind of the short-term inflationary pressure, which is quite strong, which is growing so quicker than the way we price for all good reasons since we want to make sure that we keep our customers while we do that and that we drive the value we create as well. Ultimately, when the delivered product cost curve is going to ease margin is going to improve again, as you've seen last year, by the way, which was the end of another cycle as well in industrial."

So the whole distribution channel is also struggling with that. So getting trucks unloaded from our plant to the distribution center and then afterwards getting the picking right as well. So for our customers. It's an interesting world out there. 
But I'd like to say as well, what's really important is that most, if not all of our customers, including the just to make sure that we can deliver to our distributors and to our customers, which is, first and foremost, what needs to happen, especially with Hurricane Ida that didn't help, but I think that we've ended up in a very good place in terms of service level. 
Now to your question on the staffing. If you just look at the numbers, just to be clear. So institutional business, up 24%. So very good progression. We are almost at the same level as 2019 in terms of customers that we're serving as well. We have our restaurant sales that are not even 10% down so versus last year when the dine-in food traffic is down over 20%. So generally, we're doing very well versus the market. 
But at the same time, when you go to restaurants, you see that they can't serve all the tables, so they can't be open every single day of the week as well. So it's basically showing an indication that we could be even better or will be better at the moment that they get on the staffing right. 
And last but not least, your point on how we help them get there. Obviously, the service that we provide on a regular basis going there, well, it's very helpful for them because if the kitchens, if the housekeeping, if the way washing is not properly, well, it's even worse because they usually don't have people who can truly do the work since they all knew, changing so often as well that's problematic. 
And we provide a lot of products as well that need much less labor as well at the same time. You think about the disinfectants we talked about against COVID. Well, you don't need your rent, for instance, as well. So you save a lot of time doing the same work that other companies offer. So that's helping as well with the labor shortage."

The main 1 we have is really sort of the new business generation. It's not new. You're familiar with that. We have close to 1,000 people managing some corporate accounts as we call them, and we're very proud of that team. And net new business generation is at an all-time high, which is good because it's the pipeline of new business as well for the future. And it's driven by 2 main drivers, if I may say. One you mentioned. It's the Ecolab Science Certified, especially on the institutional side. So customers are looking for ways to provide the right confidence for their own customers, their guests as they call them. And since certified requires the full Ecolab program to be certified, well, that means higher penetration of most of the solutions as solve. So we get more units and more solutions within the existing units. One of the latest, as I mentioned on Investor Day, so it's which has been a great story with them endorsing Science Certified. 
And On the industrial side, is our net 0 program is getting some very interesting traction because many of our customers, if not most, have made a lot of sustainability commitments out there that some of them have a hard time so to read or get closer to stay on track for that. So they need our help even more in order to get to their own commitment, that's helping generating as well new business. 
And last but not least, new engines like data centers and high-tech are extraordinary growth drivers, really addressing new needs that existed pre-pandemic, but the pandemic has given a huge boost to cloud computing, as we all know, since we're all using these virtual technologies. Well, that's driving our own business as well at the same time."

Interestingly enough, Institutional has not made as much progress as all the other businesses in Europe because there was so much fundamental work that had to be done in terms of organization, in terms of systems, in terms of leadership, in terms of innovation. Well, it's taken us more time. But I would say the pandemic has helped us in a way, it's hurt us short term, obviously, whenever things was shut down. But ultimately, our customers have seen that they needed a partner that could help them to provide the assurance to their guests, which was new. That was not exactly the focus that we're having prepandemic. And now so we're getting the fruit of all the work we've done over the past few years where customers are recognizing that we're adding value that other suppliers can't provide."

And in terms of mix and not so much seasonality, driving profitability in health care is mostly the surgical part and COVID, as you know, also has shifted way the active surgery is, we just shifted our business as well. So towards a lower profitability type of business. But this is short term. It's driven by COVID at the moment that surgeries are coming back ultimately.

So if today, we have almost the same number of units and the same number of solutions within units out there, while is going to compound. Now afterwards, once we get more units more days that are going to be open, more staffing in the restaurants as mentioned as well before. So all those elements ultimately are going to help institutional accelerate versus what we saw in '19, pre-pandemic as well. 
On top of it, you have pricing that's also evolving in the right direction as in every business that we have in the company. Institutional has done remarkable work in terms of field organization system implementation that will help as well drive an even better leverage in that business. So overall, trending in the right direction going to take a few quarters in order to get there, but I feel confident that we really saw on a good path."

So that's one. So that's something we can't control, obviously. 
What we can control, though is making sure that we can supply our customers in a way that doesn't stop or impact their own operations. And in this crazy world of shortages and hurricane in Texas resend you name it ultimately. Not one customer had to stop ultimately because of what we were not able to supply, have met a bunch of CEOs over the past few months as well and all have been very complementary as well in our ability to serve them in a difficult environment.

There are many suppliers as well in the U.S. who have gone through force majeures as well over the past few months, sometimes for great reasons and sometimes not so much just to get some more margins as well with costs going up as well. So the way we're thinking through that is that as mentioned earlier, I expect the inflationary pressure in dollars in '22 to be very similar to the one in '21 with kind of easing plateauing during the second half of next year, which is why on one hand, thank God, we've gotten very well organized in order to become more resilient in order to make sure we can supply our customers.

You have years with higher pricing and some with lower pricing. And in average, you get to 1% plus something like that, which is a good indication of the fact that pricing is something that we hold going forward. And why that is? Because we always link the pricing that we're asking with the value that we're creating so for our customers, how much dollar value we've helped them create by reducing the usage of natural resources, there improved productivity, reduce waste and so on, ultimately, that doesn't go away when the raw materials will go down, ultimately, which is, on one hand, the reason why pricing is always going to go up, and second, that the margins ultimately so or the company gets better because you get lower input cost for a price that keeps going up as well.

Well, unfortunately, a few hours before it changed and it hit exactly one of our main plants in the U.S. And with the damage we had there, we thought the plant would be closed for 3 months. And our supply chain team that fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you want to look at it, has had a lot of practice this year with natural catastrophes as such. Well, has brought all the teams we had from other plants as well in order to help them rebuild part of the production line that had been damaged because you couldn't find contractors in the area either for all the reasons we know. 
Well, that has helped us reduce the 3-month stop to 3 weeks ultimately. Well, that has been great for our customers, first and foremost. And second, it's allowed us to reduce the impact quite dramatically. So that's an additional point to the ones you mentioned."

We do that once a year, and it's a very natural practice that the company has, where we discussed the plan for next year, how much value we're creating for the customer, what's going to be our share of that. In other words, the price that we're going to get for it as well and making sure that the return for customers to improve. That's normal practice once a year. We did 3 times in average this year, so very unusual. I assume it's going to be similar next year, so between 1x and 3x, it's going to be more than 1 that I'm sure. So we go for a bunch of pricing rounds. 
Now to your question, Q4 versus Q3. We're heading towards 4% to enter 2022. So is it going to be the full quarter in Q4? I'm not totally sure yet, it's going to happen sometime during the fourth quarter. So depending on when we get it done, it will be for the full quarter or it's going to be as we enter to '22. But I have a high confidence level that we're going to get the pricing that we're looking for."

They've done some very good work as well in our downstream team in terms of new business. This is helping and not directly related to the price of oil for sure. And when you talk about the net 0. It's very interesting early discussions as such. But to take 1 example of 1 European company actually with whom we are working on that net 0 program. They're basically saying, you need to help us improve the environmental footprint of our old energy, which is the refining part before we can focus on the new energy, the renewables as such. 
So we've really helped them understand that by reducing the water consumption in a refinery, which, by the way, is the #1 natural resource that's being used in a refinery, where you reduce the energy usage as well, electricity so for the most part as well. So they've reduced their water consumption, they've reduced their carbon footprint by doing it, and they've reduced their cost as well. 
So interestingly enough, it's an industry that was not so much interested in even having that discussion that has changed dramatically, and that's helping create new demand for us."

In terms of new markets, I'll mention a few. So the 1 I expressed before, our data center business, which is driven by the whole boom of cloud computing. We created at High-tech division, which is really dedicated to those companies with their own needs, uptime, quality, cybersecurity and all that, which is growing extremely fast. So that's 1 of the new markets Animal Health is another one, which has been hit a bit by the pandemic and some difficulties in some countries. But ultimately, that's also 1 that's going to grow very fast in the years to come. And most importantly, you have life science, which is a business that we created 5 years ago. It's a $300 million business growing double digit with extremely high profitability as well. This 1 is just at the beginning of its growth story. And as you know, Life Science is serving mostly the pharma industry, which is a $1 trillion industry growing double-digit. And for me, we have so much to offer to that industry. I think that's going to be the #1 new market to use you term that's going to help us grow as well next year and the years to come."

With me today are: Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. 
The discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials, which states that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release. 
Starting with a brief overview. Strong third quarter results were driven by robust new business wins and accelerating pricing, which along with the continued recovery in the U.S. and improving European markets, more than offset significantly increased delivered product and other costs.  
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect both accelerating sales volume and pricing momentum to leverage an expected continuing, though uneven, global recovery. We expect these drivers to result in the fourth quarter showing better year-on-year sales growth than the third quarter. We have also experienced continued substantial delivered product and other cost inflation that we believe will increase fourth quarter costs by nearly $0.20 per share.  
As a result, we expect fourth quarter earnings to grow double digits, though not as strong as the third quarter. We expect to once again successfully manage the current inflation challenges and uneven global economic recovery to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth in 2021 as the strong volume and pricing gains, along with productivity and cost reduction actions, enabled us to offset the higher costs and yield double-digit earnings growth.  
Recent programs, including Ecolab Science Certified and Net Zero, have further differentiated Ecolab's value proposition and enable us to help create better customer outcomes and reduce environmental impact while simultaneously reducing their costs. Our new business wins and innovative pipelines are at record levels. New market focus areas are positioned well to drive growth, and our leading digital capabilities continue to add competitive advantage.  
Our strong business momentum, along with enhanced value proposition and favorable macro trends, position us well to leverage the post-COVID environment and deliver further superior shareholder returns next year and for the future. 
And now here's Christophe Beck with his comments."

Great to be together with you today. So Q3 has been another very good quarter for Ecolab, demonstrating once again that Ecolab is in a great shape with strong top line momentum and a proven ability to effectively mitigate the adverse effect of inflation and the so-called supply shortages.  
Underlying sales trends were strong across the board. In a complex environment, we delivered 10% reported and 8% fixed currency organic sales growth, driven, first and foremost, by continued strong momentum in Institutional and Specialty that delivered 17% sales growth in the quarter and 24% from the Institutional division. We also saw accelerated momentum in Industrial sales with 7% growth, and 13% in other segments, driven by sustained high performance in Pest Elimination. Healthcare & Life Sciences posted negative sales growth year-on-year as they compare to exceptional growth during the pandemic as we know. However, the respective underlying sales growth stayed on a healthy mid-single and double-digit trajectory. 
This top line momentum, combined with accelerating pricing and structure productivity that's benefiting from our state-of-the-art digital automation, drove the strong adjusted EPS delivery, more than offsetting short-term impact from Hurricane Ida and the rapid acceleration of global cost inflation. The team did an exceptional job minimizing the impact of Hurricane Ida, which we were able to successfully manage to be a much lower impact than initially expected at only $0.03 in the quarter.  
Most importantly, the team mitigated the impact of additional significant supply shortages to ensure exceptional service to customers while driving continued new business wins and strong price increases, contributing to a 31% increase in free cash flow. Current sales momentum is strong, and we expect it to accelerate. Strong new business and breakthrough innovation are expected to continue to drive top line growth. Also, pricing will keep accelerating towards 4%.  
The strong volume and price momentum is expected to result in Q4 showing better year-over-year sales growth than what we've seen in Q3. At the same time, delivered product costs will keep increasing rapidly, which we'll continue to mitigate with great pricing. However, as we know with our model, this takes time to do well in a way that's sustainable long term and aligned with the incremental value we create for customers. We therefore estimate that the time lag between pricing and cost inflation will impact the fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.20 versus what we expected just a few months ago. But that, too, we'll address over the next few quarters. 
Next, we expect Q4 EPS to continue to grow double digits, though not as strong as in Q3, which will help us exceed the year with great momentum. With strong volume growth, continued pricing and delivered product cost hopefully nearing its peak, we'll then enter 2022 in great position to deliver another great year for Ecolab. This strong fundamental business momentum combined with continued market recovery provides us with great confidence in the future and especially for '22. 
In a world full of uncertainties, we keep driving strong business wins and a competitive differentiation. In a world where customers struggle to find reliable partners for innovation, especially product supply and expertise to help them run their operations efficiently and serve their customers safely, we have substantially strengthened our position as their clear innovative and reliable global partner. 
In a world where our institutional and specialty customers and consumers especially and concerned about increased risks of infection, Ecolab Science Certified has become deep reference that provides guests with the assurance they're looking for. And in a world where environmental impact has become front and center, our net 0 offering is providing industrial segment customers especially leading in innovative ways to deliver on their commitments while improving their own financial returns. All this provides us with confidence that '22 will be another strong year for Ecolab with sales and earnings growth above our long-term trends.  
So with that, I look forward to your questions."

I saw industrial margins took another step back this quarter. But I know you guys have talked about maintaining these margins and building upon the gains you made in 2020.

Pricing is going up quarter-over-quarter in industrial, like in other businesses, by the way, as well. Volume is going up as well. 
So it's kind of the short-term inflationary pressure, which is quite strong, which is growing so quicker than the way we price, for all good reasons since we want to make sure that we keep our customers while we do that and that we drive the value we create as well. Ultimately, so when the delivered product cost curve is going to ease margin is going to improve again, as you've seen last year, by the way, which was the end of another cycle as well in industrial."

So the whole distribution channel is also struggling with that. So getting trucks unloaded from our plant to the distribution center and then afterwards getting the picking right as well, so for our customers, it's an interesting world out there.  
But I'd like to say as well, what's really important is that most, if not all of our customers, including the just to make sure that we can deliver to our distributors, so are clearly underlining our service quality. We've done huge efforts to make sure that we can deliver to our distributors and to our customers, which is, first and foremost, what needs to happen, especially with Hurricane Ida, that didn't help, but I think that we've ended up in a very good place in terms of service level.  
Now to your question on the staffing. If you just look at the numbers, I'd be clear, so institutional business, up 24%. So very good progression. We are almost at the same level as 2019 in terms of customers that we're serving as well. We have our restaurant sales that are not even 10% down so versus last year when the dine-in food traffic is down over 20%. So generally, we're doing very well versus the market. But at the same time, when you go to restaurants, you see that they can't serve all the tables, so they can't be open every single day of the week as well. So it's basically showing an indication that we could be even better or will be better the moment that they get so the staffing right.  
And last but not least, to your point on how we help them get there. Obviously, the service that we provide on a regular basis going there, well, is very helpful for them because if the kitchens, if the housekeeping, if the way washing is not done properly, well, it's even worse because they usually don't have people who can truly do the work since they're all new, changing so often as well. That's problematic. And we provide a lot of products as well that need much less labor as well at the same time. You think about the disinfectants we talked about against COVID. Well, you don't need your rinse, for instance, as well. So you save a lot of time doing the same work that other companies offer. So that's helping as well with the labor shortage."

And net new business generation is at an all-time high, which is good because it's the pipeline of new business as well for the future. And it's driven by 2 main drivers, if I may say. One you mentioned. It's the Ecolab Science Certified, especially on the institutional side. 
So customers are looking for ways to provide the right confidence for their own customers, their guests as they call them. And Science Certified requires the full Ecolab program to be certified, well, that means higher penetration of most of the solutions, assets. So we get more units and more solutions within the existing units in order for those customers that you get to the certification. One of the latest, as I mentioned on Investor Day, so it's McDonald's, which has been a great story with them endorsing Science Certified.  
And on the industrial side is our net 0 program is getting some very interesting traction because many of our customers, if not most, have made a lot of sustainability commitments out there that some of them had a hard time so to reach or get closer to, to stay on track for that. So they need our help even more in order to get to their own commitment that's helping generating as well new business. And last but not least, new engines like data centers and high-tech are extraordinary growth drivers, really addressing new needs that existed pre-pandemic, but the pandemic has given a huge boost to cloud computing, as we all know, since we're all using these virtual technologies.

Well, it's taken us more time. But I would say the pandemic has helped us in a way, it's hurt us short term, obviously, whenever things was shut down. But ultimately, our customers have seen that they needed a partner that could help them so provide the assurance to their guests, which was new.

And you commented you thought volumes in the next 3 to 6 months would get back to pre-pandemic levels, does that equate to that revenue gap getting back to pre-pandemic levels? Or are there other puts and takes that could lead revenue to take longer? And as part of that, I guess I also wondered, what sort of unit level, customer level, do you think it'll be at when revenue gets to pre-pandemic levels? And I ask that from the perspective of you've talked about more products per unit, particularly for those clients that are using Ecolab Science Certified?"

So Gary, big picture, as mentioned earlier, Institutional is expected so early '22, so to get back to 2019 levels, at the top line level or exactly which months that's going to be. But within the next 6 months, it's going to be the case, which is a very steady and healthy recovery. With that, the fact that we had very good new business, well, that's going to be installed as well in the months to come. So if today, we have almost the same number of units and the same number of solutions within units out there, well, is going to compound. Then afterwards, once we get more units, more days that are going to be open, more staffing in the restaurants as mentioned as well before, so all those elements ultimately are going to help Institutional accelerate versus what we saw in '19 pre-pandemic as well. 
On top of it, you have pricing that's also evolving in the right direction as in every business that we have in the company. That's going to add to it as well. And last but not least, from an earnings perspective as well, Institutional has done remarkable work in terms of field organization, system implementation that will help as well drive an even better leverage in that business. So overall, trending in the right direction, it's going to take a few quarters in order to get there, but I feel confident that we're really so on a good path."

The chip shortage that's happening out there, well, has nothing to do with our own operation, but it's reducing the demand just because there are less cars being produced because they can't produce them because of the chips, ultimately, out there. So that's one. So that's something we can't control, obviously. 
What we can control, though, is making sure that we can supply our customers in a way that doesn't stop or impact their own operations. And in this crazy world of shortages and hurricane and Texas freeze and you name it, ultimately, not one customer had to stop ultimately because of what -- we were not able to supply, have met a bunch of CEOs over the past few months as well, and all have been very complementary as well in our ability to serve them in a difficult environment. So net-net, yes, it's not helping growth. If there were no shortage, we would be probably growing faster, but I don't think that it's a major impact on us."

You're familiar with the China U.S. transport issues that are existing as well. There are many suppliers as well in the U.S. who have gone through force majeures as well over the past few months, sometimes for great reasons and sometimes not so much, just to get some more margins as well with costs going up as well. 
So the way we're thinking through that is that as mentioned earlier, I expect the inflationary pressure in dollars in '22 to be very similar to the one in '21 with kind of easing, plateauing during the second half of next year, which is why on one hand, thank God, we've gotten very well organized in order to become more resilient in order to make sure we can supply our customers. And second, that we're doubling our pricing, so from 2% to 4%, '21 versus '22 in order to address that. And if the world gets better earlier, well, we're all going to be happy here."

You have years with higher pricing and some with lower pricing. And in average, you get to 1%-plus, something like that, which is a good indication of the fact that pricing is something that we hold going forward. 
And why that is? Because we always link the pricing that we're asking with the value that we're creating so for our customers, how much dollar value we've helped them create by reducing the usage of natural resources, their improved productivity, reduced waste and so on, ultimately. That doesn't go away when the raw materials will go down, ultimately, which is, on one hand, the reason why pricing is always going to go up. And second, that the margins ultimately so or the company gets better because you get lower input cost for a price that keeps going up as well. And the last point is innovation as well, which is always brought in the market with higher margin, that helps as well improving the leverage in a much more natural way."

So they want to be so carbon positive and water positive as well, which means are kind of giving back all they've used since the beginning being in operations, whenever that was, early '90s as Microsoft. So there, we use a lot of new technology for that. 
And the last one, I'll just mention, Eric, which is becoming very interested, that was not interested 6 months ago, interestingly enough is downstream in oil and gas because while investors and consumers are truly asking them to shift and those ones are coming to us, and they did not 12 months ago.

So I think that the runway is quite long and it's been much more successful than I thought it would be. Initially, I thought it would be just COVID-related. Well, this is not the case. Interestingly enough, lodging customers or hotel are becoming increasingly interested in that program because guests want to have that feeling of well-being when they go to a hotel, the same for offices as well.

To give you some color on the Hurricane Ida, we have systems showing where the hurricanes are going to go through, what's the path of the hurricane. And we initially thought that it would really so avoid one of the large plants that we have in Louisiana, in Garyville. Well, unfortunately, a few hours before, it changed and it shift exactly, so one of our main plants in the U.S. And with the damage we had there, we thought the plant would be closed for 3 months. And our supply chain team that fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you want to look at it, has had a lot of practice this year with natural catastrophes as such, well, has brought all the teams we had, so from other plants as well in order to help them rebuild part of the production line that had been damaged because you couldn't find contractors in the area either for all the reasons we know.

So we've really helped them understand that by reducing the water consumption in a refinery, which, by the way, is the #1 natural resource that's being used in a refinery, well, you reduce the energy usage as well, electricity, so for the most part as well.

You have Textile Care that's in there, and you have so CTG, our Colloidal Technology Group. Very different businesses, obviously. So it's hard to talk about an average as such. The main driver is Pest Elimination, that has done a remarkable work during the pandemic, by the way, so they've recovered very quickly during 2020 and kept growing as well in '21. And at the same time, have managed as well to improve their profitability versus '19, 3.5 percentage points as such. So large business growing very nicely, profitable and getting more profitable. Obviously, you get a lot of leverage. And Scott, that drives so the good results that you've seen in our so-called other segments."

It always feels a bit mundane, but we have this mantra in the company that in doubt, go and sell something. And it's really so having everyone trying to sell new customers, new solutions to existing customers. This is job one. And we want to make sure that we don't lose, obviously. So that art. And interestingly enough, when you do more pricing, that has an impact as well on how much new business. So it's not a perfect science, but we manage that reasonably well, or very well, if I may say. 
In terms of new markets, I'll mention a few. So the one I expressed before, our data center business, which is driven by the whole boom of cloud computing. We created that high-tech division, which is really dedicated to those companies with their own needs, uptime, quality, cybersecurity and all that, which is growing extremely fast. So that's one of the new markets. Animal health is another one, which has been hit a bit by the pandemic and some difficulties in some countries. But ultimately, that's also one that's going to grow very fast in the years to come. 
And most importantly, you have Life Science, which is a business that we created 5 years ago. It's a $300 million business, growing double digit with extremely high profitability as well. This one is just at the beginning of its growth story. And as you know, Life Science is serving mostly the pharma industry, which is a $1 trillion industry, growing double-digit. And for me, we have so much to offer to that industry. I think that's going to be the #1 new market, to use your term, that's going to help us grow as well next year and the years to come."

It's been a steady business for many, many years because of all the right reasons is that water scarcity becomes a bigger issue. And by reducing the water usage, you reduce energy usage, you reduce your carbon footprint. So it fits really well with the net 0 idea. So the water business, which is a very large business, well, the company has been successful for years, and will keep going well because customers need it even more because of this net 0 approach as such there. 
Now on paper, it's been an unbelievable year. In Q3, so growing so 19%. You have kind of 1/3 of it is pricing, 2/3 is volume. Some is comp, but a lot of new business as well has been generated in our paper division. So it's not going to stay at that high level as such because the comp are going to normalize going forward. But it's going to remain a healthy business going forward with very nice profitable margin as well."
