I'll give you my perspective on how the virus is playing out on the trends we see today and going forward, and I'll speak about our physical and financial",2847,"Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter. I'll give you my perspective on how the virus is playing out on the trends we see today and going forward, and I'll speak about our physical and financial progress. Then Aldo will give you a more detailed review of the financials.
To start with. I'll just say, we are encouraged by the quarter. It was strong, but we believe we can reach even higher. This year was something, a lot of unusual events. But when you look through it all, Snap-on saw headwinds, but we met those challenges, absorb the shot, developed accommodations to the environment, moved forward on a clear recovery and we believe we exited the year stronger than ever. We did have disparities from group-to-group and within each group, but our overall sales and profitability improved both sequentially and year-over-year for the second straight quarter, achieving new heights despite the virus.
Through the year, the Snap-on team continue to make progress, accommodating to the threat, pursuing our essential commercial opportunities safely. And moving along upward trajectory is consistent with our general projections on how the days of the virus would unfold. Geographically, the impact of the COVID continues to be varied for us. Asia Pacific remains virus challenge. Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And while the U.S. and Europe actually seem to be further ahead in accommodation and are moving onto, what we call, psychological recovery.
For the business segments, we saw the essential nature of our markets rising through the turbulence along our runways for growth, demand for vehicle repair technicians to our franchisee network, directly selling off the vans. It was robust. Again, this quarter, it was robust. Volume repair shop owners and managers continued to gain and activity in critical industries advanced despite certain sectors like education, oil and gas, U.S. aviation, not returning to growth yet. But you would kind of expect that.
Going forward, we are convinced that we're well positioned on a strong base. But we know we have much more work to do. The environment throughout the world is still impacted by the virus, and many of our businesses have not yet fully recovered against the great withering. But having recognized these headwinds, however, we're also convinced that there will be abundant opportunities as the sky is clear and society pivots toward suburban locations and to more individual transportation. This is great news for the vehicle repair industry. I got to tell you. And because of that, we're keeping focus on Snap-on value creation, safety, important at these times, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement or RCI. We've been unrelenting in advancing our advantage in products that solve the most critical tasks in brands that serve as the outward sign -- in our brand that serves the outward sign of the pride and dignity working men and women taking their profession and in our people. We are deeply committed and very capable.
Snap-on team is a great asset, and we've maintained it through these days of the virus. We've advanced each of these strengths in the turbulence, and it's enabled snap-on to achieve new heights, and the numbers show it. So that's the overview.
Now the results. Fourth quarter as reported sales of $1.744 billion were up 12.5% from 2019, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translations and $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Organic sales rose 10.6% volume gains in the van channel, in OEM dealerships and diagnostics and repair information in our European hand tools business, all demonstrating the abundant opportunities on our runway and our increased ability to take advantage of those opportunities.
From an earnings perspective, operating income, opco OI from the quarter of $216.2 million, including $2.8 million of direct costs associated with the virus, $1 million of restructuring charges for actions outside the United States and $1.5 million hit from unfavorable currency was up 26.1% in the opco operating margin. It was 20.1%, up 220 basis points, overcoming 30 basis points of unfavorable currency, 30 basis points, 30 points of COVID cost impact and 10 basis points of restructuring. For financial services, operating income of $68.5 million increased 10.1% from 2019, all while keeping 60-day delinquencies flat to last year in the midst of the pandemic stress test and that result it combined with opco for a consolidated operating margin of 24.4%, 190 basis point improvement. The overall quarterly EPS was $3.82, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring, and that result compared to $3.08 last year, an increase of 24% and I did say new heights.
Now for the full year, sales were $3.593 billion, a 3.8% organic decline, principally on the first and second quarter shop of the virus before the sequential gains of accommodation took hold. Opco OI $631.9 million, including $12.5 million of restructuring charges a $11.9 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and $13.1 million of unfavorable currency compared to $716.4 million in 2019, which benefited from $11.6 million legal settlement in a patent related litigation matter. Opco OI margin, including a 30 basis point impact associated with restructuring, 30 points of direct pandemic expenses, 30 points of unfavorable currency was 17.6% and compared with 19.2% in 2019, which incorporated 30 basis points of the nonrecurring benefit for the legal settlement. That's a mouthful, right? But what it says is that despite the great disruption, our full year OI margin was down only 40 basis points, apples-to-apples, demonstrating the special snap-on resilience that has enabled us to pay dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single deduction.
For the year, financial services registered OI of $248.6 million versus the $245.9 million in 2019. Overall, EPS for the period of $11.44 was down 7.8% from the [ $12.41 ] reported last year -- 2019. Adjusting for the restructuring in the current year and the onetime legal benefit in the prior year, 2020 EPS as adjusted reached $11.63, down 5.1%.
So now let's go on to the individual operating groups. In C&I, volume in the fourth quarter of $364.4 million, including $7.5 million from acquisitions and $6.5 million of favorable foreign currency was up 3.3% as reported. The activity was essentially flat organically, but represented a continuing sequential C&I rise all the way back to the early shot. Notably, in these numbers, the C&I year-over-year sales were marked by a strong double-digit rise in our European-based hand tool business growing broadly across Western Europe against the twin challenges of COVID and the Brexit disruption.
There are also offsetting decreases in sales to our customers in critical industries in Asia Pacific. But both these operations joined the overall group and registering substantial quarter-to-quarter sequential improvement. They're still down, but they're clearly recovering. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $56.2 million increased $11.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1 million of COVID-related costs with sales up 3.3% as reported, flat organically. OI grew 24.9%, a nice operating improvement. And the OI margin for the group was 15.4%, up 260 basis points from last year, overcoming 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and 30 points of direct COVID costs. The benefits of RCI and margin gains in the critical industries made all the difference.
Speaking of the critical industries, we did see selective gains, international aviation and heavy-duty registered double-digit improvements. But you might expect and I referenced before, education, oil and gas and U.S. aviation continue to be down. And in the quarter, our military sales were also impacted by the wind down of one of our major kitting programs. But we do remain confident in and committed to extending in the critical industries, and we see growing opportunities moving forward. And a principal path to that possibility is customer connection and innovation, creating powerful new products. You heard about our European hand tool business. It showed significant resiliency in the quarter, and it was aided by a good dose of innovation, products like our recent expansion of our [ pop-up ] custom kitting system, extending our direct to user possibilities. Our new fit and go product line allows buyers to quickly develop semi bespoke kits in foam tool control, consists of more than 200 preconfigured different tool sets designed around a 26-inch wide Bahco cash available in 3 standard foam configurations, 1/3 to our 2/3 straw and a full draw. Customers can choose the particular box, draw configuration. And the tool array needed right from our bahco.com website, reaching end users without distributor interaction. And a wider range of specialization, and sometimes it is, specialization is required.
Our sales reps can help develop just the right unit using the full breadth of the Bahco system. We've had great success with our new fit and go. It's an important extension of our hand tool presence in Europe. And in the quarter, it helped boost SNA Europe to achieve the double-digit growth in a very challenging environment. I think everybody would agree. C&I demonstrating further accommodation with continuing continued sequential gains, serving the essential. Each of the business is generating a positive trajectory and exiting the quarter stronger than when they entered and product authored a big piece of that progress.
Now I'll onto the Tools Group. As reported, sales of 20.2% to $494.9 million, including $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency and an $81 million or 19.6% organic increase, the second straight quarter of strong gain with the U.S. and international businesses both growing at double digits. In the Tools Group operating earnings, $93.6 million, including $1.2 million of virus-related costs, that [ 93 ] points, including -- that $93.6 million included $1.2 million of virus-related costs. And that $93.6 million compared to last year's $54.3 million, and over 70% improvement.
Actually, the Tools Group recovered to positive territory for the full year, sales were up 2% organically, with OI rising almost 9% and OI margins up 110 basis points. The continued operating gains of the tools to provide further affirmation of our view of the COVID trajectory on the resilience of the vehicle repair business. And on the strength of our direct face-to-face van model, it turns out that deep in direct connection with the customers is a differentiator even in a pandemic. And in the quarter and throughout the year, the tools would confirm the market-leading position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger. That's clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. They continue to trend favorably, and that was acknowledged by a number of respective public patients, all listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice. One was the franchise business review, where we were again recognized and the Magazine's latest rankings for franchisee satisfaction as a top 50 franchise, marking the 14th consecutive year that Snap-on received that award.
Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and our van business in general. And it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new product developed through our strong customer connections. Throughout the storm, we've added every day to our already considerable insight and experience in the changing vehicle environment. And because of that, we're able to bring forward innovation after innovation, great products, like our newly released 8-inch Talen Flank Jaw players, we call it the HD 47 ACF with a unique design for significant versatility in both removing and tightening fastness. First, our unique Flank Jaw, formed as a specially designed, smooth and unsure mating area allows the user to grip a heck shape only on the flat service positioning the load away from the corners. That's similar to our Flank Drive systems on pocket, 30% more torque applied to the fan center while still minimizing damages, eliminating rounded edges. Second, when the fasteners have already been heavily rounded and are tough to grip, our talent grip. Diamond sated jaws, joined it, located at the player's tip. Generate unparallel clamping force is up 57% -- up to a 57% increase in turning power. With the Snap-on talent, technicians can remove even the most damaged and rounded he fasteners. And for the icing on the versatility cake, the new pliers also feature a patented 3-position slip joint design for easy changes to the grip position. The HD 47 ACF manufactured right here and in Milwaukee plant.
In the U.S., and it's been very well received, putting it on a clear path to becoming another 1 of our hit products, million dollar selling products just in one quarter. We also worked hard during the code to maintain and further strengthen our brands celebrating our 100th year, continuing our presence in racing. And most importantly, I think, servicing our customers every day, reinforcing that what they do really is essential and that the display of the Snap-on brand confirms that it's sold. For some time, the Tools group has also been working to span franchisee selling capacity. And that effect continued with focus through the pandemic. And the days of the early shock, access to the shops and to the technicians very widely. And the Tools Group worked to engage social media and bridging the gap. This turned into a powerful tool for pre briefing customers on products and promotions reserving the actual face-to-face interaction for closing the deal, providing a significant franchisee opportunity for selling more products and reaching new customers. Why do you think we're up? The Tools Group also made strides in redeploying the time stayed from restricted travel, everybody stay at home more today, streamlining the van sales process to RCI and developing more concise customer presentation, so important in pitching products of ever rising complexity; social media and engagement, RCI selling and more effective trading. It made the difference, raising franchisee selling capacity to match the strength and capacity of our new product and the results back it up well, that's the Tools Group. Moving through AV shaped recovery, recording 2 straight quarters of double digit expansion, continuing to stream in new products, building the brand, raising selling capacity and strengthening for the future.
Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I group, continuing the combination and extending its positive trend. Sales of $361.1 million in the fourth quarter, up 7.8%, 7% organically, excluding a $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency. A steep recovery from the depths of the pandemic. The rise was due to double-digit gains in OEM dealerships as auto manufacturers began to release new models and launch more essential programs. A high single-digit gain in the sales of our powerful diagnostics and repair information products, independent repair shop owners and managers and then offsetting low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment were garage owners haven't developed sufficient confidence to invest to get it invest broadly in upgrading or expanding their facilities. RS&I operating earnings of $90 million improved $2.8 million as the mix of lower-margin OEM project sales diluted the volume improvement. And as the group recorded $1 million in charges for a small European-focused restructuring. Our diagnostics and information based operations have recorded continuous growth for some time, the sales to independent repair shop owners and managers. They've had continuous growth for some time, and innovative new products are the key to that success, and the fourth quarter was no exception. We just began shipping our new 20.4 software update for our diagnostics platforms in North America. Full coverage for the 2020 vehicles, additional reprogramming facility, increased functional test capabilities and an expansion of our unique advanced driver assistance or ADAS content, so critical these days for engaging vehicle automation. This software represents another move forward in our already powerful, already market-leading intelligent diagnostics and repair information product lines. And it's being well received. Thousands of technicians all across the U.S. and Canada will be upgrading to this very capable new addition before the next update is released in May. And then we'll start again. RS&I is building a powerful position in the vehicle repair in vehicle repair software that meets the changing mobility environment. And the 20.4 is another step in that direction. We're confident in the strength of RS&I, and we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. And that's our fourth quarter. Absorbing a shot, driving accommodation, moving onto psychological recovery, keeping our people safe while we serve the essential, all of that is working, building Snap-on's advantage and the results show us sequential gains from the third quarter and significant growth from last year, sales up 12.5%, 10.6% organically. OI margin, 20.1%, 220 basis points higher. Financial service is continuing to deliver, navigating the virus with strength and without disruption, an EPS of $3.82, up 24%, all achieved while maintaining and expanding our advantages in products, brands and people. Ending the year stronger, ready for more opportunities to come. It was an encouraging quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Fourth quarter of 2020 was strong with respect to Snap-on's financial performance.

Fourth quarter of 2020 was strong with respect to Snap-on's financial performance. Sales development was robust, both year-over-year and sequentially. Gross profit and operating earnings margins expanded, and cash flow generation was again healthy. Net sales of $1.744 billion in the quarter compared to $955.2 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain, $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales.
The organic increase principally reflected double-digit growth across the Snap-on Tools segment and high single-digit gains with repair shop owners and managers in the repair systems and information segment. We've again identified direct costs associated with COVID-19, which totaled $2.8 million this quarter. These costs include direct labor and underabsorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantine associates and event cancellation fees as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment.
Also in the quarter, we recorded $1 million of restructuring cost actions for Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48% compared to 47.2% last year. The 80 basis point improvement primarily reflects the higher sales volume and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct cost associated with COVID-19.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.9%, improved 140 basis points from 29.3% last year, primarily reflecting the impact of the higher sales, which more than offset the 30 basis points related to restructuring and direct costs associated with COVID-19.
Operating earnings before financial services of $216.2 million, including $2.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and of restructuring costs and $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $171.4 million in 2019, reflecting a 26.1% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.1%, including 30 basis points of direct costs associated to the COVID-19 pandemic and 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, improved 220 basis points from 17.9% last year.
As you may know, Snap-on operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every 6 years. As a result, our 2020 fiscal year contains 53 weeks of operating results with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-on's consolidated fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings, our Financial Services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio.
At the consolidated level, the net earnings benefit from the additional week of Financial Services interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses, primarily personnel-related costs and interest expense. With that said, Financial Services revenue of $93.4 million in the quarter of 2020 compared to $83.9 million last year, primarily reflecting the extra week of interest income and the growth in the Financial Services portfolio.
Financial Services operating earnings of $68.5 million increased $6.3 million from 2019 levels, principally due to the higher revenue, but partially offset by increased variable compensation and other costs. Consolidated operating earnings of $284.7 million, including $2.8 million of direct COVID-related costs, $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $233.6 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.4% compared to 22.5% in 2019.
Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.8% compared to 22.3% last year. Finally, net earnings of $208.9 million or $3.82 per diluted share, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring increased $38.3 million or $0.74 per share from 2019 levels, representing a 24% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.4 million increased 3.3% from $352.9 million last year, reflecting $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a [ 0.6% ] organic sales decline. While organic sales were essentially flat as compared to last year, they did improve sequentially in a more meaningful manner than what we see in our typical seasonal patterns with organic sales up 14.6% from the third quarter of 2020.
As compared to last year, the organic sales decline primarily reflects a mid- single-digit decrease in our Asia Pacific operations and a low single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, offset by double-digit gains in the segment's European-based hand tools business. Within Asia, similar to last quarter, sales to customers in India and Southeast Asia continue to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Across critical industries, while year-over-year sales declined in natural resources, including oil and gas, U.S. aviation and technical education, sales into these markets have improved from third quarter comparisons. This quarter's year-over-year gains were reflected across international aviation, heavy-duty and nonmilitary government-related activity. Sales to the U.S. military were lower as compared to the prior year as the fourth quarter of 2019 included sales for a major project that is winding down.
Sales increases in our European-based hand tool business were evident across the region, particularly in France and the United Kingdom as well as in our Scandinavian and export markets. Gross margin of 37.8% improved 230 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and higher gross margin businesses and declines in lower gross margin sales to the military as well as from benefits of RCI initiatives. These increases were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 20 basis points of direct COVID-19 cost.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales, 22.4% improved 30 basis points as compared to last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $56.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1 million of direct COVID-19 cost compared to $45 million last year. The operating margin of 15.4% compared to 12.8% a year ago.
Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $494.9 million increased 20.2% from $411.7 million in 2019, reflecting a 19.6% organic sales gain and $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency translations. The organic sales increase reflects double-digit gains in both our U.S. and international operations. This reflects a 9.5% organic sequential gain over a strong third quarter 2020 sales performance.
Gross margin of 42.9% in the quarter improved 270 basis points, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% and improved from 27% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions, which more than offset $1 million or 30 basis points of COVID-19-related costs.
Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $93.6 million compared to $54.3 million last year. The operating margin of 18.9% compared to 13.2% a year ago, an increase of 570 basis points.
Turning to the RS&I group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $361.1 million compared to $335 million a year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain and $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships, particularly in sales related to OEM facilitation programs and a high single-digit increase in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These increases were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment. Sequentially, RS&I organic sales improved by 13.2%. Gross margin of 46.1%, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, declined 160 basis points from last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales of lower gross margin businesses, including facilitation program related sales to OEM dealerships.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.2%, including 30 basis points of cost from restructuring, improved 50 basis points from 21.7% last year, largely reflecting the mix of business activity in the quarter. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $90 million compared to $87.2 million last year. The operating margin of 24.9%, including the effects of 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19 compared to 26% a year ago.
Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $93.4 million compared to $83.9 million last year. This includes the additional days of accrued interest associated with the 53rd week in our 2020 fiscal calendar. Financial Services operating earnings of $68.5 million compared to $62.2 million in 2019. Financial Services expenses of $24.9 million increased $3.2 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher variable compensation and other costs, partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in provisions for credit losses. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, provisions for credit losses were lower by $700,000, while net charge-offs of bad debts were lower by $1.3 million. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.1% and 1% in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In the fourth quarter, the average yield on finance receivables of 17.7% in 2020 compared to 17.5% in 2019. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 9.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the quarter, approximately $13 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $272.4 million in the quarter increased $10 million or 3.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a 4.5% increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were essentially flat.
Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide gross Financial Services portfolio increased $20.8 million. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for the United States, extended credit is unchanged from last year and reflects the seasonal increase we typically experience in the fourth quarter.
As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $45.6 million represented 2.62% of outstandings at quarter-end, down 8 basis points sequentially and down 29 basis points as compared to the same period last year.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $317.6 million in the quarter increased $120.9 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $53.5 million decrease in working investment, primarily driven by inventory reductions in the period.
Net cash used by investing activities of $73.6 million included $35.4 million for the acquisition of Auto Group, capital expenditures of $26.5 million and net additions to finance receivables of $15.9 million. Free cash flow during the quarter of $275.2 million was 129% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $111.6 million included cash dividends of $66.8 million and the repurchase of 460,000 shares of common stock for $78.7 million under our existing share repurchase program.
Full year 2020 share repurchases totaled [ 1,109,000 ] shares for $174.3 million. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $275.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations.
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable decreased $53.9 million from 2019 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 64 days compared to 67 days of 2019 year-end. Inventories decreased $13.9 million 10 year-end, including a $40.1 million inventory reduction, partially offset by increases from $23.2 million of currency translation and $3 million from acquisitions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of [ 2.4 ] compared to [ 2.6 ] at year-end 2019 and [ 2.4 ] at the end of the third quarter 2020. Our year-end cash position of $923.4 million compared to $184.5 million at year-end 2019. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 12.1% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019.
In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate, absent of any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

You see, we believe that we exit 2020 stronger, more capable and more advantaged than when we entered the year. The virus came we absorbed the shock. We accommodated to the turbulence, and we forged the V-shaped recovery as we anticipated in the depths of the difficulty.
We believe the year is Vivid testimony to snap-on's resilience into our ability in turning change and challenge to our advantage, and the fourth quarter performance says it's sold. Sales up 12.5% as reported, 10.6% organically. OI margin, 20.1%, up 220 basis points against 30 basis points of unfavorable currency, 10 basis points of restructuring charges 30 basis points of direct COVID cost, strong improvement.
C&I sales, clear sequential gains. OI margin of 15.4%, rising 260 points. [ Artie ] sales up 7% organically, OI of 24.9% down, but still in heavy territory. Financial services revenue and profits all up portfolio solid in the storm. And finally, the Tools Group. Sales of 19.6% organically, profits up 72.4% OI margin of 18.9%, rising 570 basis points, good numbers. But more importantly, underscoring our belief that the franchisee selling capacity has expanded and is positioned for more gains. And all of that, it all came together to author an EPS in the quarter of $3.82, up 24% from 2019. New heights in the great turbulence of 2020. And these highs were achieved while still nurturing our product, our brand and our people, preserving and amplifying our natural advantages.
We do believe we leave the year at full and expanded strength and ready to reach higher and farther amid the abundant opportunities of 2021 and the years beyond.
Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. We celebrate your contributions as you perform your essential task. And we're confident your effort in preserving our society will be remembered for years for years to come. For your success in authoring the encouraging results of our fourth quarter, you have my congratulations. And for your steadfast commitment to our present and for your unwavering belief in our future, you have my thanks.

Those deep days of the virus in the end of the first quarter and second quarter. Fourth quarter, it's harder to judge that. We think the expanded capacity and the impact of the new products coming out of the SFC drove things. Now you can step back and look at one other thing is that, gee, if you're attempted to think about that, realize that sales off the van kind of matched off. And sales off the van were up significantly more than the sales to the van in the year. So I would say things are kind of chunking along. We can talk about what's up and down and so on.

But like I said, our hand tools are stronger this quarter than others because people haven't been investing in big-ticket items as much, but the big-ticket items are still up. Diagnostics was strong, and diagnostics is kind of a mix. It doesn't all go to EC. Dave, increasingly, because as the franchisees get more well healed, they turn -- they often use them on revolving accounts. So they'll put them on their 15-week deal or they may stretch it a little bit, and they don't go to easy. So you get a mix of those things. So if you're trying to figure out where origination is going to go, you have time displacement and you have the split of EC between RA, I mean about diagnostics between RA and EC and then you have tool storage on top of that.

I don't think -- it plays out what we've learned is since we've -- over the last few years, been bigger in collision, it plays out in the collision business. So you're very right. I mean, collision is down significantly as an industry year-over-year, and we see that, and you're seeing that in our equipment numbers, that isn't in the Tools Group numbers so much. You might see some garages -- the garages we visit, but it isn't a big factor in that situation. Miles driven, I think it's not so much the short term. But we think longer term, it's going to start going up, and there are going to be more cars because people are going to go to smaller -- to individual vehicles, who wants to get on a subway. How many people want to live in a 40 -- work in a 40-story building in the future. Maybe you guys -- I don't know, but I think there's going to be a motion, a reversal of that. We see -- we saw that in China. So we see car ownership and miles driven in a long way of getting better, and that drives our business. What that means for us in 2021, unclear, but we think it's opportunity. Now we think it's opportunity in the longer term. We're going to play out quarter-by-quarter. What I will tell you is we feel good about the momentum we've had going through the year, closing out the year. We feel good about that. We feel good about how our products are being received. We feel good about the efficacy of our software in the complex business. We feel good about the idea that our van drivers have more time selling. That's what I would tell you."

Today, I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter. I'll give you my perspective on how the virus is playing out on the trends we see today and going forward, and I'll speak about our physical and financial",2831,"Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter. I'll give you my perspective on how the virus is playing out on the trends we see today and going forward, and I'll speak about our physical and financial progress. Then Aldo will give you a more detailed review of the financials. 
To start with. I'll just say, we are encouraged by the quarter. It was strong, but we believe we can reach even higher. This year with some -- a lot of unusual events. But when you look through it all, Snap-on saw headwinds, but we met those challenges, absorbed the shock, developed accommodations to the environment, moved forward on a clear recovery, and we believe we exited the year stronger than ever. We did have disparities from group-to-group and within each group, but our overall sales and profitability improved both sequentially and year-over-year for the second straight quarter, achieving new heights despite the virus. 
Through the year, the Snap-on team continue to make progress, accommodating to the threat, pursuing our essential commercial opportunities safely. And moving along upward trajectory is consistent with our general projections on how the days of the virus would unfold. Geographically, the impact of the COVID continues to be varied for us. Asia-Pacific remains virus challenged. Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And while the U.S. and Europe actually seem to be further ahead in accommodation and are moving onto, what we call, psychological recovery. 
For the business segments, we saw the essential nature of our markets rising through the turbulence along our runways for growth, demand for vehicle repair technicians to our franchisee network, directly selling off the vans. It was robust. Again, this quarter, it was robust. Volume of repair shop owners and managers continued to gain and activity in critical industries advanced despite certain sectors like education, oil and gas, U.S. aviation, not returning to growth yet. But you would kind of expect that.
Going forward, we are convinced that we're well positioned on a strong base. But we know we have much more work to do. The environment throughout the world is still impacted by the virus, and many of our businesses have not yet fully recovered against the great withering. But having recognized these headwinds, however, we're also convinced that there will be abundant opportunities as the sky is clear and society pivots toward suburban locations and to more individual transportation. This is great news for the vehicle repair industry. I got to tell you. And because of that, we're keeping focus on Snap-on value creation, safety, important use [indiscernible] safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. We've been unrelenting in advancing our advantage in products that solve the most critical of tasks, in brands that serve as the outward sign -- our brands that serve as the outward sign of the pride and dignity, working men and women taking their profession and in our people who're deeply committed and very capable. 
Snap-on team is a great asset, and we've maintained it through these days of the virus. We've advanced each of these strengths in the turbulence, and it's enabled Snap-on to achieve new heights, and the numbers show it. So that's the overview. 
Now the results. Fourth quarter as reported sales of $1.0744 billion were up 12.5% from 2019, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translations and $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Organic sales rose 10.6% volume gains in the van channel, in OEM dealerships and diagnostics and repair information, in our European hand tools business, all demonstrating the abundant opportunities on our runway and our increased ability to take advantage of those opportunities. 
From an earnings perspective, operating income, opco OI from the quarter of $216.2 million, including $2.8 million of direct costs associated with the virus, $1 million of restructuring charges for actions outside the United States and $1.5 million hit from unfavorable currency was up 26.1%. And the opco operating margin, it was 20.1%, up 220 basis points, overcoming 30 basis points of unfavorable currency, 30 basis points, 30 points of COVID cost impact and 10 basis points of restructuring. For financial services, operating income of $68.5 million increased 10.1% from 2019, all while keeping 60-day delinquencies flat to last year in the midst of the pandemic stress test and that result combined with opco for consolidated operating margin of 24.4%, 190 basis points improvement. The overall quarterly EPS was $3.82, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring and that result compared to $3.08 last year, an increase of 24%, I did say new heights. 
Now for the full year, sales were $3.593 billion, a 3.8% organic decline, principally on the first and second quarter shock of the virus before the sequential gains of accommodation took hold. Opco OI $631.9 million, including $12.5 million of restructuring charges, $11.9 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and $13.1 million of unfavorable currency compared to $716.4 million in 2019, which benefited from $11.6 million legal settlement in a patent-related litigation matter. Opco OI margin, including a 30 basis point impact associated with restructuring, 30 points of direct pandemic expenses, 30 points of unfavorable currency was 17.6% and compared with 19.2% in 2019, which incorporated 30 basis points of the nonrecurring benefit for the legal settlement. That's a mouthful right? But what it says is that despite the great disruption, our full year OI margin was down only 40 basis points, apples-to-apples, demonstrating the special Snap-on's resilience that has enabled us to pay dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single deduction. For the year, financial services registered OI of $248.6 million versus the $245.9 million in 2019. Overall, EPS for the period of $11.44 was down 7.8% from the $12.41 reported last year -- 2019. Adjusting for the restructuring in the current year and the onetime legal benefit in the prior year, 2020 EPS as adjusted reached $11.63, down 5.1%. 
So now let's go on to the individual operating groups. In C&I, volume in the fourth quarter of $364.4 million, including $7.5 million from acquisitions and $6.5 million of favorable foreign currency, was up 3.3% as reported. The activity was essentially flat organically, but represented a continuing sequential C&I rise all the way back to the early shock. Notably, in these numbers, the C&I year-over-year sales were marked by a strong double-digit rise and our European-based hand tool business growing broadly across Western Europe against the twin challenges of COVID and the Brexit disruption. 
There are also offsetting decreases in sales to our customers in critical industries in Asia Pacific. But both these operations joined the overall group and registering substantial quarter-to-quarter sequential improvement. They're still down, but they're clearly recovering. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $56.2 million increased $11.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1 million of COVID-related costs with sales up 3.3% as reported, flat organically. OI grew 24.9%, a nice operating improvement. And the OI margin for the group was 15.4%, up 260 basis points from last year, overcoming 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and 30 points of direct COVID costs. The benefits of RCI and margin gains in the critical industries made all the difference. 
Speaking of the critical industries, we did see selective gains, international aviation and heavy-duty registered double-digit improvements. But as you might expect and I referenced before, education, oil and gas and U.S. aviation continue to be down. And in the quarter, our military sales were also impacted by the wind down of one of our major kitting programs. But we do remain confident in and committed to expanding in the critical industries, and we see growing opportunities moving forward. And a principal path to that possibility is customer connection and innovation, creating powerful new products. You heard about our European hand tool business. It showed significant resiliency in the quarter, and it was aided by a good dose of innovation, products like our recent expansion of our pop-up custom kitting system, extending our direct-to-user possibilities. Our new fit and go product line allows buyers to quickly develop semi bespoke kits in foam tool control, consists of more than 200 preconfigured different tool sets designed around 26-inch wide Rock N’ Roll Cab available in 3 standard foam configurations, 1/3 drawer, 2/3 drawer and a full drawer. Customers can choose the particular box, drawer configuration and the tool array needed right from our bahco.com website, reaching end users without distributor interaction and with wider range of specialization, and sometimes it is, specialization is required, our sales reps can help develop just the right unit using the full breadth of the Bahco system. We've had great success with our new fit and go.  It's an important extension of our hand tool presence in Europe. And in the quarter, it helped boost SNA Europe to achieve the double-digit growth in a very challenging environment. I think everybody would agree. C&I demonstrating further accommodation with continuing -- continued sequential gains, serving the essential. Each of the business is generating a positive trajectory and exiting the quarter stronger than when they entered and product authored a big piece of that progress. 
Now onto the Tools Group. As reported, sales of 20.2% to $494.9 million, including $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency and an $81 million or 19.6% organic increase, the second straight quarter of strong gain with the U.S. and International businesses both growing at double digits. In the Tools Group operating earnings, $93.6 million, including $1.2 million of virus-related costs, that 93 points, including -- in fact $93.6 million included $1.2 million of virus-related costs. And that $93.6 million compared to last year's $54.3 million, an over 70% improvement. 
Actually, the Tools Group recovered to positive territory for the full year, sales were up 2% organically, with OI rising almost 9% and OI margins up 110 basis points. The continued operating gains of the Tools Group are further affirmation of our view of the COVID trajectory on the resilience of the vehicle repair business and on the strength of our direct face-to-face van model. It turns out that deep and direct connection with the customers is a differentiator even in a pandemic. And in the quarter and throughout the year, the Tools Group confirm the market-leading position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger. That's clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. They continue to trend favorably, and that was acknowledged by a number of respective public patients, all listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice. One was the franchise business review, where we were again recognized in the magazine's latest rankings for franchisee satisfaction as a top 50 franchise, marking the 14th consecutive year that Snap-on received that award. 
Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and our van business in general. And it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new product developed through our strong customer connections. Throughout the storm, we've added every day to our already considerable insight and experience in the changing vehicle environment. And because of that, we're able to bring forward innovation after innovation, great products, like our newly released 8-inch Talon Grip FlankJaw pliers, we call it the HJ47ACF with a unique design for significant versatility in both removing and tightening fastness. First,  our unique FlankJaw, [ formed ] as a specially designed, smooth and serrated mating area allows the user to grip a hex shape only on the flat service positioning the load away from the corners. That's similar to our Flank Drive systems on socket, 30% more torque applied to the fastener while still minimizing damages, eliminating rounded edges. Second, when the fasteners have already been heavily rounded and are tough to grip, our TalonGrip, diamond-serrated jaws, joined at -- located at the pliers tip, generate unparallel clamping forces up 57% -- up to a 57% increase in turning power. 
With the Snap-on Talon, technicians can remove even the most damaged and rounded hex fasteners. And for the icing on the versatility cake, the new pliers also feature a patented 3 position slip joint design for easy changes to the grip position, the HJ47ACF manufactured right here in Milwaukee plant in the U.S., and it's been very well received, putting on a clear path to becoming another one of our hit products, million-dollar selling products just in one quarter. We also worked hard during the COVID to maintain and further strengthen our brands celebrating our 100th year, continuing our presence in racing. And most importantly, I think, servicing our customers every day, reinforcing that what they do really is essential and that the display of the Snap-on brand confirms that it's [ sold. ] 
Some time, the Tools Group has also been working to expand franchisee selling capacity. And that effect continued with focus through the pandemic, in the days of the early shock, access to the shops and to the technicians very widely.  And the Tools Group worked to engage social media and bridging the gap. This turned into a powerful tool for pre briefing customers on products and promotions reserving the actual face-to-face interaction for closing the deal, providing a significant franchisee opportunity for selling more products and reaching new customers. Why do you think we're up?  The Tools Group also made strides in redeploying the time stayed from restricted travel, everybody stay at home more today, streamlining the van sales process to RCI and developing more concise customer presentation, so important in pitching products of ever rising complexity; social media engagement, RCI selling and more effective trading, it made the difference, raising franchisee selling capacity to match the strength and capacity of our new product and the results back it up. 
Well, that's the Tools Group. Moving through a V-shaped recovery, recording 2 straight quarters of double digit expansion, continuing to stream in new products, building the brand, raising selling capacity and strengthening for the future. 
Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I Group, continuing the accommodation and extending its positive trend. Sales of $361.1 million in the fourth quarter, up 7.8%, 7% organically, excluding a $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency, a steep recovery from the depths of the pandemic. The rise was due to double-digit gains in OEM dealerships, as auto manufacturers began to release new models and launch more essential programs. A high single-digit gain in the sales of our powerful diagnostics and repair information products, independent repair shop owners and managers and then offsetting low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment where garage owners haven't developed sufficient confidence to invest -- to get it invest broadly in upgrading or expanding their facilities. RS&I operating earnings of $90 million improved $2.8 million as the mix of lower-margin OEM project sales diluted the volume improvement and as the group recorded $1 million in charges for a small European-focused restructuring. Our diagnostics and information based operations have recorded continuous growth for some time, the sales to independent repair shop owners and managers. They've had continuous growth for some time, and innovative new products are the key to that success. And the fourth quarter was no exception. We just began shipping our new 20.4 software update for our diagnostics platforms in North America, full coverage for the 2020 vehicles, additional reprogramming facility, increased functional test capabilities and an expansion of our unique advanced driver assistance or ADAS content, so critical these days for engaging vehicle automation. 
This software represents another move forward in our already powerful, already market-leading intelligent diagnostics and repair information product lines. And it's being well received. Thousands of technicians all across the U.S. and Canada will be upgrading to this very capable new addition before the next update is released in May. And then we'll start again. RS&I is building a powerful position in the vehicle repairs -- in vehicle repair software that meets the changing mobility environment. And the 20.4 is another step in that direction. We're confident in the strength of RS&I, and we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. And that's our fourth quarter; absorbing a shock, driving accommodation, moving onto psychological recovery, keeping our people safe while we serve the essential, all of that is working, building Snap-on's advantage and the results show us sequential gains from the third quarter and significant growth from last year, sales up 12.5%, 10.6% organically, OI margin, 20.1%, 220 basis points higher. Financial service is continuing to deliver, navigating the virus with strength and without disruption, an EPS of $3.82, up 24%, all achieved while maintaining and expanding our advantages in products, brands and people, ending the year stronger, ready for more opportunities to come. It was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"
303646,701874226,2192345,"Snap-on Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Snap-on Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Fourth quarter of 2020 was strong with respect to Snap-on's financial performance. Sales development was robust, both year-over-year and sequentially. Gross profit and operating e",2134,"Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Fourth quarter of 2020 was strong with respect to Snap-on's financial performance. Sales development was robust, both year-over-year and sequentially. Gross profit and operating earnings margins expanded, and cash flow generation was again healthy. Net sales of $1.0744 billion in the quarter compared to $955.2 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain, $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales. 
The organic increase principally reflected double-digit growth across Snap-on Tools segment and high single-digit gains with repair shop owners and managers in the Repair Systems & Information segment. We've again identified direct costs associated with COVID-19, which totaled $2.8 million this quarter. These costs include direct labor and underabsorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantined associates and event cancellation fees as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. 
Also in the quarter, we recorded $1 million of restructuring cost actions for Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48% compared to 47.2% last year. The 80 basis point improvement primarily reflects the higher sales volume and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct cost associated with COVID-19. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.9%, improved 140 basis points from 29.3% last year, primarily reflecting the impact of the higher sales, which more than offset the 30 basis points related to restructuring and direct costs associated with COVID-19. 
Operating earnings before financial services of $216.2 million, including $2.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19, $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $171.4 million in 2019, reflecting a 26.1% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.1%, including 30 basis points of direct costs associated to the COVID-19 pandemic and 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, improved 220 basis points from 17.9% last year.  As you may know, Snap-on operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every 6 years. As a result, our 2020 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-on's consolidated fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings, our financial services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio. 
At the consolidated level, the net earnings benefit from the additional week of financial services interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses, primarily personnel-related costs and interest expense. With that said, financial services revenue of $93.4 million in the quarter of 2020 compared to $83.9 million last year, primarily reflecting the extra week of interest income and the growth in the financial services portfolio.  Financial services operating earnings of $68.5 million, increased $6.3 million from 2019 levels, principally due to the higher revenue but partially offset by increased variable compensation and other costs; consolidated operating earnings of $284.7 million, including $2.8 million of direct COVID-related costs, $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $233.6 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.4% compared to 22.5% in 2019.  Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.8% compared to 22.3% last year. Finally, net earnings of $208.9 million or $3.82 per diluted share, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring increased $38.3 million or $0.74 per share from 2019 levels, representing a 24% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.4 million increased 3.3% from $352.9 million last year, reflecting $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by 0.7% organic sales decline. While organic sales were essentially flat as compared to last year, they did improve sequentially in a more meaningful manner than what we see in our typical seasonal patterns with organic sales up 14.6% from the third quarter of 2020.  As compared to last year, the organic sales decline primarily reflects a mid- single-digit decrease in our Asia Pacific operations and a low single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, offset by double-digit 
gains in the segment's European-based hand tools business. Within Asia, similar to last quarter, sales to customers in India and Southeast Asia continue to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Across critical industries, while year-over-year sales declined in natural resources, including oil and gas, U.S. aviation and technical education, sales into these markets have improved from third quarter comparisons. This quarter's year-over-year gains were reflected across international aviation, heavy-duty and nonmilitary government-related activity. Sales to the U.S. military were lower as compared to the prior year, as the fourth quarter of 2019 included sales for a major project that is winding down.
Sales increases in our European-based hand tool business were evident across the region, particularly in France and the United Kingdom as well as in our Scandinavian and export markets. Gross margin of 37.8% improved 230 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and higher gross margin businesses and declines in lower gross margin sales to the military, as well as from benefits of RCI initiatives. These increases were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 20 basis points of direct COVID-19 cost.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales, 22.4% improved 30 basis points as compared to last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $56.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1 million of direct COVID-19 cost compared to $45 million last year. The operating margin of 15.4% compared to 12.8% a year ago.
Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $494.9 million increased 20.2% from $411.7 million in 2019, reflecting a 19.6% organic sales gain and $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects double-digit gains in both our U.S. and international operations. This reflects a 9.5% organic sequential gain over a strong third quarter 2020 sales performance.
Gross margin of 42.9% in the quarter improved 270 basis points, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved from 27% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions, which more than offset $1 million or 30 basis points of COVID-19-related costs.  Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $93.6 million compared to $54.3 million last year. The operating margin of 18.9% compared to 13.2% a year ago, an increase of 570 basis points.
Turning to the RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $361.1 million compared to $335 million a year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain and $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships, particularly in sales related to OEM facilitation programs and a high single-digit increase in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These increases were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment. Sequentially, RS&I organic sales improved by 13.2%. Gross margin of 46.1%, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, declined 160 basis points from last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales of lower gross margin businesses, including facilitation program related sales to OEM dealerships.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.2%, including 30 basis points of cost from restructuring, improved 50 basis points from 21.7% last year, largely reflecting the mix of business activity in the quarter. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $90 million compared to $87.2 million last year. The operating margin of 24.9%, including the effects of 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19 compared to 26% a year ago.
Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $93.4 million compared to $83.9 million last year. This includes the additional days of accrued interest associated with the 53rd week in our 2020 fiscal calendar. Financial services operating earnings of $68.5 million compared to $62.2 million in 2019. Financial services expenses of $24.9 million increased $3.2 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher variable compensation and other costs, partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in provisions for credit losses. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, provisions for credit losses were lower by $700,000, while net charge-offs of bad debts were lower by $1.3 million. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1% in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In the fourth quarter, the average yield on finance receivables of 17.7% in 2020 compared to 17.5% in 2019. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 9.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations in dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the quarter, approximately $13 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $272.4 million in the quarter increased $10 million or 3.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a 4.5% increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were essentially flat.
Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $20.8 million. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for the United States extended credit is unchanged from last year and reflects the seasonal increase we typically experience in the fourth quarter.
As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $45.6 million represented 2.62% of outstandings at quarter end, down 8 basis points sequentially and down 29 basis points as compared to the same period last year.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $317.6 million in the quarter increased $120.9 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $53.5 million decrease in working investment, primarily driven by inventory reductions in the period.
Net cash used by investing activities of $73.6 million included $35.4 million for the acquisition of AutoCrib, capital expenditures of $26.5 million and net additions to finance receivables of $15.9 million. Free cash flow during the quarter of $275.2 million was 129% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $111.6 million included cash dividends of $66.8 million and the repurchase of 460,000 shares of common stock for $78.7 million under our existing share repurchase program.
Full year 2020 share repurchases totaled 110,900 shares for $174.3 million. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $275.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations.
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable decreased $53.9 million from 2019 year-end, days sales outstanding of 64 days compared to 67 days of 2019 year-end, inventories decreased $13.9 million from 2019 year-end, including a $40.1 million inventory reduction, partially offset by increases from $23.2 million of currency translation and $3 million from acquisitions, on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.6 at year-end 2019 and 2.4 at the end of the third quarter 2020, our year-end cash position of $923.4 million compared to $184.5 million at year-end 2019, our net debt-to-capital ratio of 12.1% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019.
In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate absent of any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%.

The virus came, we absorbed the shock, we accommodated to the turbulence, and we forged the V-shaped recovery, as we anticipated in the depths of the difficulty.
We believe the year is vivid testimony to Snap-on's resilience into our ability in turning change and challenge to our advantage, and the fourth quarter performance says it so. Sales up 12.5% as reported, 10.6% organically. OI margin, 20.1%, up 220 basis points against 30 basis points of unfavorable currency, 10 basis points of restructuring charges and 30 basis points of direct COVID cost, strong improvement.
C&I sales, clear sequential gains. OI margin of 15.4%, rising 260 points. Organic sales up 7% organically, OI of 24.9% down, but still in heavy territory. Financial services revenue and profits all up, portfolio solid in the storm. And finally, the Tools Group. Sales up 19.6% organically, profits up 72.4%, OI margin of 18.9%, rising 570 basis points, good numbers. But more importantly, underscoring our belief that the franchisee selling capacity has expanded and is positioned for more gains. And all of that, it all came together to author an EPS in the quarter of $3.82, up 24% from 2019; new heights in the great turbulence of 2020. And these heights were achieved while still nurturing our product, our brand and our people, preserving and amplifying our natural advantages.
We do believe we leave the year at full and expanded strength and ready to reach higher and farther, amid the abundant opportunities of 2021 and the years beyond.

We think the expanded capacity and the impact of the new products coming out of the SFC drove things. Now you can step back and look at one other thing is that, gee, if you're tempted to think about that, realize that sales off the van kind of matched off.  And sales off the van were up significantly more than the sales to the van in the year. So I would say things are kind of chunking along. We can talk about what's up and down and so on.

So there's a trailing effect that's there. But historically, if you look back, Luke, we've had these types of gyrations in steel from time-to-time, and we deal with it, we do have pricing power. Then again, I remind everyone, Snap-on is very vertically integrated. So in a way, the good news factor is steel is not as much a percent of the final end product as some people might imagine.

Diagnostics was strong, and diagnostics is kind of a mix. It doesn't all go to EC, Dave, increasingly, because as the franchisees get more well healed, they turn -- they often use them on revolving accounts. So they'll put them on their 15-week deal or they may stretch it a little bit, and they don't go to EC. So you get a mix of those things. So if you're trying to figure out where origination is going to go, you have time displacement and you have the split of EC between RA -- I mean about diagnostics between RA and EC and then you have tool storage on top of that.

Today, I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter. I'll give you my perspective on how the virus is playing out on the trends we see today and going forward, and I'll speak about our physical and financial",2832,"Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter. I'll give you my perspective on how the virus is playing out on the trends we see today and going forward, and I'll speak about our physical and financial progress. Then Aldo will give you a more detailed review of the financials. 
To start with. I'll just say, we are encouraged by the quarter. It was strong, but we believe we can reach even higher. This year with some -- a lot of unusual events. But when you look through it all, Snap-on saw headwinds, but we met those challenges, absorbed the shock, developed accommodations to the environment, moved forward on a clear recovery, and we believe we exited the year stronger than ever. We did have disparities from group-to-group and within each group, but our overall sales and profitability improved both sequentially and year-over-year for the second straight quarter, achieving new heights despite the virus. 
Through the year, the Snap-on team continued to make progress, accommodating to the threat, pursuing our essential commercial opportunities safely. And moving along upward trajectories consistent with our general projections on how the days of the virus would unfold. Geographically, the impact of the COVID continues to be varied for us. Asia-Pacific remains virus challenged. Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And while the U.S. and Europe actually seem to be further ahead in accommodation and are moving onto, what we call, psychological recovery. 
For the business segments, we saw the essential nature of our markets rising through the turbulence along our runways for growth, demand for vehicle repair technicians to our franchisee network, directly selling off the vans. It was robust. Again, this quarter, it was robust. Volume of repair shop owners and managers continued to gain and activity in critical industries advanced despite certain sectors like education, oil and gas, U.S. aviation, not returning to growth yet. But you would kind of expect that.
Going forward, we are convinced that we're well positioned on a strong base. But we know we have much more work to do. The environment throughout the world is still impacted by the virus, and many of our businesses have not yet fully recovered against the great withering. But having recognized these headwinds, however, we're also convinced that there will be abundant opportunities as the skies clear and society pivots toward suburban locations and to more individual transportation. This is great news for the vehicle repair industry. I got to tell you. And because of that, we're keeping focus on Snap-on value creation, safety, important in these times -- safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. We've been unrelenting in advancing our advantage in products that solve the most critical of tasks, in brands that serve as the outward sign -- in our brands that serve as the outward sign of the pride and dignity working men and women take in their profession and in our people who're deeply committed and very capable. 
Snap-on team is a great asset, and we've maintained it through these days of the virus. We've advanced each of these strengths in the turbulence, and it's enabled Snap-on to achieve new heights, and the numbers show it. So that's the overview. 
Now the results. Fourth quarter as reported sales of $1.0744 billion were up 12.5% from 2019, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translations and $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Organic sales rose 10.6% volume gains in the van channel, in OEM dealerships and diagnostics and repair information, in our European hand tools business, all demonstrating the abundant opportunities on our runway and our increased ability to take advantage of those opportunities. 
From an earnings perspective, operating income, opco OI from the quarter of $216.2 million, including $2.8 million of direct costs associated with the virus, $1 million of restructuring charges for actions outside the United States and $1.5 million hit from unfavorable currency, was up 26.1%. And the opco operating margin, it was 20.1%, up 220 basis points, overcoming 30 basis points of unfavorable currency, 30 basis points -- 30 points of COVID cost impact and 10 basis points of restructuring. For financial services, operating income of $68.5 million increased 10.1% from 2019, all while keeping 60-day delinquencies flat to last year in the midst of the pandemic stress test and that result combined with opco for consolidated operating margin of 24.4%, 190 basis point improvement. The overall quarterly EPS was $3.82, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring; and that result compared to $3.08 last year, an increase of 24%.  I did say new heights. 
Now for the full year, sales were $3.593 billion, a 3.8% organic decline, principally on the first and second quarter shock of the virus before the sequential gains of accommodation took hold. Opco OI $631.9 million, including $12.5 million of restructuring charges, $11.9 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and $13.1 million of unfavorable currency compared to $716.4 million in 2019, which benefited from $11.6 million legal settlement in a patent-related litigation matter. Opco OI margin, including a 30 basis point impact associated with restructuring, 30 points of direct pandemic expenses, 30 points of unfavorable currency was 17.6% and compared with 19.2% in 2019, which incorporated 30 basis points of the nonrecurring benefit for the legal settlement. That's a mouthful, right? But what it says is that despite the great disruption, our full year OI margin was down only 40 basis points, apples-to-apples, demonstrating the special Snap-on resilience that has enabled us to pay dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single reduction. For the year, financial services registered OI of $248.6 million versus the $245.9 million in 2019. Overall, EPS for the period of $11.44 was down 7.8% from the $12.41 reported last year -- 2019. Adjusting for the restructuring in the current year and the onetime legal benefit in the prior year, 2020 EPS as adjusted reached $11.63, down 5.1%. 
So now let's go on to the individual operating groups. In C&I, volume in the fourth quarter of $364.4 million, including $7.5 million from acquisitions and $6.5 million of favorable foreign currency, was up 3.3% as reported. The activity was essentially flat organically, but represented a continuing sequential C&I rise all the way back to the early shock. Notably, in these numbers, the C&I year-over-year sales were marked by a strong double-digit rise in our European-based hand tool business growing broadly across Western Europe against the twin challenges of COVID and the Brexit disruption. 
There are also offsetting decreases in sales to our customers in critical industries in Asia Pacific. But both these operations joined the overall group in registering substantial quarter-to-quarter sequential improvement. They're still down, but they're clearly recovering. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $56.2 million increased $11.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1 million of COVID-related costs with sales up 3.3% as reported, flat organically. OI grew 24.9%, a nice operating improvement. And the OI margin for the group was 15.4%, up 260 basis points from last year, overcoming 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and 30 points of direct COVID costs. The benefits of RCI and margin gains in the critical industries made all the difference. 
Speaking of the critical industries, we did see selective gains, international aviation and heavy-duty registered double-digit improvements. But as you might expect and I referenced before, education, oil and gas and U.S. aviation continue to be down. And in the quarter, our military sales were also impacted by the wind-down of one of our major kitting programs. But we do remain confident in and committed to expanding in the critical industries, and we see growing opportunities moving forward. And a principal path to that possibility is customer connection and innovation, creating powerful new products. You heard about our European hand tool business. It showed significant resiliency in the quarter, and it was aided by a good dose of innovation, products like our recent expansion of our Bahco custom kitting system, extending our direct-to-user possibilities. Our new fit and go product line allows buyers to quickly develop semi bespoke kits in foam tool control, consists of more than 200 preconfigured different tool sets designed around 26-inch wide Bahco roll cabs available in 3 standard foam configurations, 1/3 drawer, 2/3 drawer and a full drawer. Customers can choose the particular box, drawer configuration and the tool array needed right from our bahco.com website, reaching end users without distributor interaction and with wider range of specialization, and sometimes it is, specialization is required, our sales reps can help them develop just the right unit using the full breadth of the Bahco system. We've had great success with our new fit and go.  It's an important extension of our hand tool presence in Europe. And in the quarter, it helped boost SNA Europe to achieve the double-digit growth in a very challenging environment. I think everybody would agree. C&I demonstrating further accommodation with continuing -- continued sequential gains, serving the essential. Each of the businesses generating a positive trajectory and exiting the quarter stronger than when they entered and product authored a big piece of that progress. 
Now onto the Tools Group. As reported, sales up 20.2% to $494.9 million, including $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency and an $81 million or 19.6% organic increase, the second straight quarter of strong gain with the U.S. and International businesses both growing at double digits. In the Tools Group operating earnings, $93.6 million, including $1.2 million of virus-related costs, that 93 points, including -- in fact $93.6 million included $1.2 million of virus-related costs. And that $93.6 million compared to last year's $54.3 million, an over 70% improvement. 
Actually, the Tools Group recovered to positive territory for the full year, sales were up 2% organically, with OI rising almost 9% and OI margins up 110 basis points. The continued operating gains of the Tools Group are further affirmation of our view of the COVID trajectory on the resilience of the vehicle repair business and on the strength of our direct face-to-face van model. It turns out that deep and direct connection with the customers is a differentiator even in a pandemic. And in the quarter and throughout the year, the Tools Group confirmed the market-leading position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger. That's clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. They continue to trend favorably, and that was acknowledged by a number of respected public [ patients, ] all listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice. One was the franchise business review, where we were again recognized in the magazine's latest rankings for franchisee satisfaction as a top 50 franchise, marking the 14th consecutive year that Snap-on received that award. 
Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and our van business in general. And it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new product developed through our strong customer connections. Throughout the storm, we've added every day to our already considerable insight and experience in the changing vehicle environment. And because of that, we're able to bring forward innovation after innovation, great products, like our newly released 8-inch Talon Grip FlankJaw pliers, we call it the HJ47ACF with a unique design for significant versatility in both removing and tightening fasteners. First,  our unique FlankJaw, formed with a specially designed, smooth and unserrated mating area allows the user to grip a hex shape only on the flat service positioning the load away from the corners. That's similar to our Flank Drive systems on socket, 30% more torque applied to the fastener while still minimizing damages, eliminating rounded edges. Second, when the fasteners have already been heavily rounded and are tough to grip, our TalonGrip, diamond-serrated jaws, joined at -- located at the pliers tip, generate unparallel clamping forces up 57% -- up to a 57% increase in turning power. 
With the Snap-on Talon, technicians can remove even the most damaged and rounded hex fasteners. And for the icing on the versatility cake, the new pliers also feature a patented 3 position slip joint design for easy changes to the grip position, the HJ47ACF manufactured right here in our Milwaukee plant in the U.S., and it's been very well received, putting on a clear path to becoming another one of our hit products, million-dollar selling products, just in one quarter. We also worked hard during the COVID to maintain and further strengthen our brands celebrating our 100th year, continuing our presence in racing. And most importantly, I think, servicing our customers every day, reinforcing that what they do really is essential and that the display of the Snap-on brand confirms that it's so. 
At the same time, the Tools Group has also been working to expand franchisee selling capacity. And that effect continued with focus through the pandemic, in the days of the early shock, access to the shops and to the technicians varied widely.  And the Tools Group worked to engage social media and bridging the gap. This turned into a powerful tool for pre briefing customers on products and promotions reserving the actual face-to-face interaction for closing the deal, providing a significant franchisee opportunity for selling more products and reaching new customers. Why do you think we're up?  The Tools Group also made strides in redeploying the time stayed from restricted travel, everybody stayed at home more today, streamlining the van sales process to RCI and developing more concise customer presentation, so important in pitching products of ever rising complexity; social media engagement, RCI selling and more effective trading, it made the difference, raising franchisee selling capacity to match the strength and capacity of our new product and the results back it up. 
Well, that's the Tools Group. Moving through a V-shaped recovery, recording 2 straight quarters of double digit expansion, continuing to stream in new products, building the brand, raising selling capacity and strengthening for the future. 
Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I Group, continuing the accommodation and extending its positive trend. Sales of $361.1 million in the fourth quarter, up 7.8%, 7% organically, excluding a $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency, a steep recovery from the depths of the pandemic. The rise was due to double-digit gains in OEM dealerships, as auto manufacturers began to release new models and launch more essential programs. A high single-digit gain in the sales of our powerful diagnostics and repair information products, independent repair shop owners and managers and then offsetting low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment where garage owners haven't developed sufficient confidence to invest -- to yet invest broadly in upgrading or expanding their facilities. RS&I operating earnings of $90 million improved $2.8 million as the mix of lower-margin OEM project sales diluted the volume improvement and as the group recorded $1 million in charges for a small European-focused restructuring. Our diagnostics and information based operations have recorded continuous growth for some time, the sales to independent repair shop owners and managers. They've had continuous growth for some time, and innovative new products are the key to that success. And the fourth quarter was no exception. We just began shipping our new 20.4 software update for our diagnostics platforms in North America, full coverage for the 2020 vehicles, additional reprogramming facility, increased functional test capabilities and an expansion of our unique advanced driver assistance or ADAS content, so critical these days for engaging vehicle automation. 
This software represents another move forward in our already powerful, already market-leading intelligent diagnostics and repair information product lines. And it's being well received. Thousands of technicians all across the U.S. and Canada will be upgrading to this very capable new addition before the next update is released in May. And then we'll start again. RS&I is building a powerful position in the vehicle repairs -- in vehicle repair software that meets the changing mobility environment. And the 20.4 is another step in that direction. We're confident in the strength of RS&I, and we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. And that's our fourth quarter; absorbing a shock, driving accommodation, moving onto psychological recovery, keeping our people safe while we serve the essential, all of that is working, building Snap-on's advantage and the results show it, sequential gains from the third quarter and significant growth from last year, sales up 12.5%, 10.6% organically; OI margin, 20.1%, 220 basis points higher; financial service is continuing to deliver, navigating the virus with strength and without disruption; an EPS of $3.82, up 24%.  All achieved while maintaining and expanding our advantages in products, brands and people, ending the year stronger, ready for more opportunities to come. It was an encouraging quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Fourth quarter of 2020 was strong with respect to Snap-on's financial performance.

Fourth quarter of 2020 was strong with respect to Snap-on's financial performance. Sales development was robust, both year-over-year and sequentially. Gross profit and operating earnings margins expanded, and cash flow generation was again healthy. Net sales of $1.0744 billion in the quarter compared to $955.2 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain, $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales. 
The organic increase principally reflected double-digit growth across Snap-on Tools segment and high single-digit gains with repair shop owners and managers in the Repair Systems & Information segment. We've again identified direct costs associated with COVID-19, which totaled $2.8 million this quarter. These costs include direct labor and underabsorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantined associates and event cancellation fees as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. 
Also in the quarter, we recorded $1 million of restructuring cost actions for Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48% compared to 47.2% last year. The 80 basis point improvement primarily reflects the higher sales volume and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct cost associated with COVID-19. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.9%, improved 140 basis points from 29.3% last year, primarily reflecting the impact of the higher sales, which more than offset the 30 basis points related to restructuring and direct costs associated with COVID-19. 
Operating earnings before financial services of $216.2 million, including $2.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19, $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $171.4 million in 2019, reflecting a 26.1% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.1%, including 30 basis points of direct costs associated to the COVID-19 pandemic and 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, improved 220 basis points from 17.9% last year.  As you may know, Snap-on operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every 6 years. As a result, our 2020 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-on's consolidated fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings, our financial services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio. 
At the consolidated level, the net earnings benefit from the additional week of financial services interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses, primarily personnel-related costs and interest expense. With that said, financial services revenue of $93.4 million in the quarter of 2020 compared to $83.9 million last year, primarily reflecting the extra week of interest income and the growth in the financial services portfolio.  Financial services operating earnings of $68.5 million, increased $6.3 million from 2019 levels, principally due to the higher revenue but partially offset by increased variable compensation and other costs; consolidated operating earnings of $284.7 million, including $2.8 million of direct COVID-related costs, $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $233.6 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.4% compared to 22.5% in 2019.  Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.8% compared to 22.3% last year. Finally, net earnings of $208.9 million or $3.82 per diluted share, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring, increased $38.3 million or $0.74 per share from 2019 levels, representing a 24% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.4 million increased 3.3% from $352.9 million last year, reflecting $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by 0.7% organic sales decline. While organic sales were essentially flat as compared to last year, they did improve sequentially in a more meaningful manner than what we see in our typical seasonal patterns with organic sales up 14.6% from the third quarter of 2020.  As compared to last year, the organic sales decline primarily reflects a mid- single-digit decrease in our Asia Pacific operations and a low single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, offset by double-digit 
gains in the segment's European-based hand tools business. Within Asia, similar to last quarter, sales to customers in India and Southeast Asia continue to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Across critical industries, while year-over-year sales declined in natural resources, including oil and gas, U.S. aviation and technical education, sales into these markets have improved from third quarter comparisons. This quarter's year-over-year gains were reflected across international aviation, heavy-duty and nonmilitary government-related activity. Sales to the U.S. military were lower as compared to the prior year, as the fourth quarter of 2019 included sales for a major project that is winding down.
Sales increases in our European-based hand tool business were evident across the region, particularly in France and the United Kingdom as well as in our Scandinavian and export markets. Gross margin of 37.8% improved 230 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and higher gross margin businesses and declines in lower gross margin sales to the military, as well as from benefits of RCI initiatives. These increases were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 20 basis points of direct COVID-19 costs.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales, 22.4% improved 30 basis points as compared to last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $56.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1 million of direct COVID-19 cost compared to $45 million last year. The operating margin of 15.4% compared to 12.8% a year ago.
Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $494.9 million increased 20.2% from $411.7 million in 2019, reflecting a 19.6% organic sales gain and $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects double-digit gains in both our U.S. and international operations. This reflects a 9.5% organic sequential gain over a strong third quarter 2020 sales performance.
Gross margin of 42.9% in the quarter improved 270 basis points, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved from 27% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions, which more than offset $1 million or 30 basis points of COVID-19-related costs.  Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $93.6 million compared to $54.3 million last year. The operating margin of 18.9% compared to 13.2% a year ago, an increase of 570 basis points.
Turning to the RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $361.1 million compared to $335 million a year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain and $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships, particularly in sales related to OEM facilitation programs and a high single-digit increase in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These increases were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment. Sequentially, RS&I organic sales improved by 13.2%. Gross margin of 46.1%, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, declined 160 basis points from last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales of lower gross margin businesses, including facilitation program related sales to OEM dealerships.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.2%, including 30 basis points of cost from restructuring, improved 50 basis points from 21.7% last year, largely reflecting the mix of business activity in the quarter. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $90 million compared to $87.2 million last year. The operating margin of 24.9%, including the effects of 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19 compared to 26% a year ago.
Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $93.4 million compared to $83.9 million last year. This includes the additional days of accrued interest associated with the 53rd week in our 2020 fiscal calendar. Financial services operating earnings of $68.5 million compared to $62.2 million in 2019. Financial services expenses of $24.9 million increased $3.2 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher variable compensation and other costs, partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in provisions for credit losses. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, provisions for credit losses were lower by $700,000, while net charge-offs of bad debts were lower by $1.3 million. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1% in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In the fourth quarter, the average yield on finance receivables of 17.7% in 2020 compared to 17.5% in 2019. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 9.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations in dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the quarter, approximately $13 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $272.4 million in the quarter increased $10 million or 3.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a 4.5% increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were essentially flat.
Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $20.8 million. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for the United States extended credit is unchanged from last year and reflects the seasonal increase we typically experience in the fourth quarter.
As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $45.6 million represented 2.62% of outstandings at quarter end, down 8 basis points sequentially and down 29 basis points as compared to the same period last year.
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $317.6 million in the quarter increased $120.9 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $53.5 million decrease in working investment, primarily driven by inventory reductions in the period.
Net cash used by investing activities of $73.6 million included $35.4 million for the acquisition of AutoCrib, capital expenditures of $26.5 million and net additions to finance receivables of $15.9 million. Free cash flow during the quarter of $275.2 million was 129% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $111.6 million included cash dividends of $66.8 million and the repurchase of 460,000 shares of common stock for $78.7 million under our existing share repurchase program.
Full year 2020 share repurchases totaled 110,900 shares for $174.3 million. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $275.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations.
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable decreased $53.9 million from 2019 year-end, days sales outstanding of 64 days compared to 67 days of 2019 year-end, inventories decreased $13.9 million from 2019 year-end, including a $40.1 million inventory reduction, partially offset by increases from $23.2 million of currency translation and $3 million from acquisitions; on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.6 at year-end 2019 and 2.4 at the end of the third quarter 2020, our year-end cash position of $923.4 million compared to $184.5 million at year-end 2019.  Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 12.1% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019.
In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate absent of any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

You see, we believe that we exit 2020 stronger, more capable and more advantaged than when we entered the year. The virus came, we absorbed the shock, we accommodated to the turbulence, and we forged the V-shaped recovery, as we anticipated in the depths of the difficulty.
We believe the year is vivid testimony to Snap-on's resilience and to our ability in turning change and challenge to our advantage, and the fourth quarter performance says it's so. Sales up 12.5% as reported, 10.6% organically. OI margin, 20.1%, up 220 basis points against 30 basis points of unfavorable currency, 10 basis points of restructuring charges and 30 basis points of direct COVID costs, strong improvement.
C&I sales, clear sequential gains. OI margin of 15.4%, rising 260 points. RS&I sales up 7% organically, OI of 24.9% down, but still in heavy territory. Financial services revenue and profits all up, portfolio solid in the storm. And finally, the Tools Group. Sales up 19.6% organically, profits up 72.4%, OI margin of 18.9%, rising 570 basis points, good numbers. But more importantly, underscoring our belief that the franchisee selling capacity has expanded and is positioned for more gains. And all of that, it all came together to author an EPS in the quarter of $3.82, up 24% from 2019; new heights in the great turbulence of 2020. And these heights were achieved while still nurturing our product, our brand and our people, preserving and amplifying our natural advantages.
We do believe we leave the year at full and expanded strength and ready to reach higher and farther, amid the abundant opportunities of 2021 and the years beyond.
Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. We celebrate your contributions as you perform your essential task, and we're confident your effort in preserving our society will be remembered for years to come. For your success in authoring the encouraging results of our fourth quarter, you have my congratulations. And for your steadfast commitment to our present and for your unwavering belief in our future, you have my thanks.
Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?"

You're coming out of those deep days of the virus in the end of the first quarter and second quarter. Fourth quarter, it's harder to judge that. We think the expanded capacity and the impact of the new products coming out of the SFC drove things. Now you can step back and look at one other thing is that, gee, if you're tempted to think about that, realize that sales off the van kind of matched off.  And sales off the van were up significantly more than the sales to the van in the year. So I would say things are kind of chunking along. We can talk about what's up and down and so on.

Diagnostics was strong, and diagnostics is kind of a mix. It doesn't all go to EC, Dave, increasingly, because as the franchisees get more well-healed, they turn -- they often use them on revolving accounts. So they'll put them on their 15-week deal or they may stretch it a little bit, and they don't go to EC. So you get a mix of those things.

By contrast in the C&I segment, your expenses were down about 30 bps and RS&I, down about 50. So I guess the question is are we able to cut back on in tools that may not have presented the same opportunity in the other 2 segments? And how much of that -- I don't know, let's call it, 250 basis points of discrepancy comes back with normalized conditions in '21?"

Look, I think the reason is -- one of the reasons is, of course, the Tools Group is much more heavily direct and so because we're selling direct through our -- we're selling with our franchisees, we're out there traveling and service them in normal years. And so we're out -- we're kind of forward placed in tools more than others, although we like to be in the other places. So you would expect that to be a more target-rich situation, especially in a situation where travel is restricted. As far as going backward, I don't know, I think if you're any operating business, you feather back these operations, you want to go out and reach people when the sky is clear. Your guess is as good as mine when the sky is clear, and you're going to -- they're going to be feathered in. I don't know if it -- I doubt if it will all come back, but some of it will come back.

I don't think -- it plays out -- what we've learned is since we've -- over the last few years, been bigger in collision, it plays out in the collision business. So you're very right. I mean, collision is down significantly as an industry year-over-year, and we see that, and you're seeing that in our equipment numbers, that isn't in the Tools Group numbers so much. You might see some garages -- the garages we visit, but it isn't a big factor in that situation. Miles driven, I think it's not so much the short term. But we think longer term, it's going to start going up, and there are going to be more cars because people are going to go to smaller -- to individual vehicles.  Who wants to get on a subway?  How many people want to live in a 40 -- work in a 40-storey building in the future? Maybe you guys -- I don't know, but I think there's going to be a motion, a reversal of that. We see -- we saw that in China. So we see car ownership and miles driven in a long way of getting better, and that drives our business. What that means for us in 2021, unclear, but we think it's opportunity. Now we think it's opportunity in the longer term. We're going to play out quarter-by-quarter. What I will tell you is we feel good about the momentum we've had going through the year, closing out the year. We feel good about that. We feel good about how our products are being received. We feel good about the efficacy of our software in the complex business. We feel good about the idea that our van drivers have more time selling. That's what I would tell you."

And along the way, I'll give you my perspective. On our results, they are encouraging. In our markets, they're standing firm and on our progress, it's made us stronger than ever before. And we'll also speak about what it all means. We believe it means we're getting better and better positioned for more, even while we're still in the midst of a once in a 100-year pandemic. And after all that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
We believe our first quarter is clear confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, further accommodating to the virus environment, overcoming period-to-period variations from business to business, dealing with macroeconomic headwinds and advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.0246 billion were up 20.2%, including $19.2 million of favorable foreign exchange and $11.3 million of acquisition-related sales. Organic sales growth was 16.3%, gains in every group. It's our third straight quarter of being above our pre-pandemic levels. And ongoing contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation processes, the principles we use every day, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, they all combine to drive that progress. Progress there was. 
Opco operating income of $200.9 million was up $62 million from last year, which included $7.5 million of restructuring charges. Opco operating margin was 19.6%, up from the 2020 level of 16.3% or 17.2% as adjusted for restructuring. For Financial Services, operating income of $65.3 million increased 14.8% and the delinquencies were down, even in the midst of a pandemic stress test, during commercial trial of what we could call extraordinary proportion. And that result combined with opco for a consolidated operating margin of 23.9%, a 300 basis point improvement as reported and up 220 basis points as adjusted. First quarter EPS was $3.50, up 40.6% from last year's $2.40. And excluding the 2020 restructuring charges, EPS grew 34.6%. I said it before, and I'll say it again. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered the Great Withering. And we also believe that our first quarter results testify to just that, especially when we compare them to 2019 before the virus. 
So let's do that. Versus 2019, our sales in the past quarter grew $102.9 million or 11.2%. That reflects $15.3 million of acquisition-related sales; $11.6 million of favorable foreign; currency and a $76 million or 8.1% economic gain. The 2021 opco operating margin of 19.6% was up 50 basis points from the 2019 level as adjusted for a legal settlement in that earlier period, and that 50-point gain was achieved against 80 points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while still absorbing the COVID. 
Now to our markets. Auto repair remains quite resilient. The technicians are rolling. They know they weather the depth of the COVID shock and have learned to accommodate the virus environment and are moving to psychological recovery. There's still some air of vigilance, but their activities are robust. And they know they won't be shocked again by a spike. They're quite positive regarding the future of driving as people pivot from shared mobility to individual transportation, and it's vehicle repair with the technicians as a strong and resilient market. You can hear it. You can hear it in our franchisees' voices and you can see it written clearly across our double-digit numbers. 
Also in auto repair, there are shop owners and managers. There are signs that the auto business is rising. Demand for new and new cars is high, but dealership repair and maintenance and warranty is still attenuated. So there is a gradual gain and we're positioned to take advantage with the broader strong -- broader and stronger product line, with innovations like our TRITON-D10 diagnostics and new acquisitions like Dealer-FX putting us deeper into dealerships than ever before and providing us a clearer view of the future repair trends, new technologies and evolving vehicle platforms. Dealer-FX puts us at the right place at the right time as things change. 
Finally, let's talk about critical industries, where Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tasks of consequence. This is where C&I operates, the most international of our operations. And these are the customers that have been most impacted by the virus. They're slower to accommodate and to recover, but they have been recovering. And in the quarter, the results showed that trend, despite some significant headwinds, including the continuing impact of the virus, the February freeze in Texas, some challenged business sectors like oil and gas and troubled geographies like Southeast Asia. Despite that variation, we did see growth in critical industries, improvement in a number of areas, in aviation, and education and a heavy-duty fleet, they all combined to overcome the continuing turbulence in natural resources. 
Also in C&I, SNA Europe, SNA Europe, another quarter of double-digit growth with broad strength across its geographies in places like France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Germany and the Nordic region. And from our Asia Pacific division, up double digits as well with solid increases in key countries like China and India and Japan. So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as improving and representing clear opportunity. And coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there's clear overall progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding to repair shop owners and managers, extended critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product line, we're holding our strengthening brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the work. Understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-on people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock. About a year ago, as we entered the virus, we recognize the resilience of our markets and the strength of our model, projecting a V recovery, and that's how it played out. You can see it in the results. 
So now let's turn to the segments and discuss those results. In the C&I group, on a reported basis, including $9.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales, first quarter volume rose 15.3% compared to last year. Organic sales were up 9.5%, double-digit growth in our European hand tool business had a mid-single-digit rise and critical industries led the way. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $50.7 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable currency, represents a rise of $19.2 million compared to the $31.5 million registered in 2020, which included $4.4 million of restructuring. That all means, on an adjusted basis, an adjusted increase of over 40% --- an as adjusted increase of over 40%, and the operating margin was 14.7%. And as reported increase of 420 basis points and 290 as adjusted. 
Now when compared with 2019, the pandemic free measuring stick sales were up 7.2%, and that included $10 million or a 3.1% organic gain; $8 million of acquisitions and $5.2 million for favorable foreign currency. Once again, C&I demonstrated sequential improvement. If you go back and look at the numbers, they keep getting closer and closer, now they're above prepandemic levels despite the ongoing uncertainty. It's one of the things I think we want to remember, the virus isn't gone. We're still bearing it and we didn't have it in 2019 and C&I is above that level. As part of the trend, we remain committed to extending in critical industries. That's the C&I sweet spot. So we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise. 
And enabling that intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products, developed specially to make critical work easier. One example is our CT9010, 3/8 inch drive, 18-volt brushless impact wrench, the newest member of our MonsterLithium family, aimed at tight space sustained power, rugged durability and precise control. The 9010 features 320-pound feet of bulk breakaway torque and 240-pound feet of working torque, all the power of technician needs when they're working in confirmed quarters. It offers a variable speed trigger in 3 speed selections in Ford and [ reverts ]. That means greater control, adaptable to any applications and no overtorque-ing important. The 9010 advanced design also reduces motor temperature rise, delivering higher durability and great power to rate ratio. It's been -- and it's fitted with 100 lumen headlight that helps technicians work in dark environment, just what's needed for those close jobs. And the 18-volt battery with the 5-amp hours ensures consistent output and extended the run time, which translates to less charging and more efficient workday. And all of this comes -- and this is the best part, I think -- all of this comes in an extremely compact size. Only 6 3/4 inches in overall length that will fit into the tightest of workspace. The CT9010 is a great tool. It's had strong demand, and it's already 1 of our $1 million hit products. 
I don't want to leave C&I without mentioning SNA Europe. Double-digit sales growth again, progress by the Black ergo tool management system, expanding product customization to the needs of the task, driving progress across -- against the twin headwinds of a difficult proven environment. Europe is not so easy these days and the uncertainty of Brexit, no small feat. Well, that's C&I, continuing sequential improvement and positioned for more. 
Now on to the Tools Group. Sales of $478.3 million, up $102.4 million, including $6.7 million of favorable currency and a $95.7 million or 25% organic gain, double-digit growth, both in the U.S. and the international operations. The operating margin was 20.7%, yes, 20.7%, up 780 basis points. Compared with previrus 2019, Tools Group sales grew $68.1 million, 16.6%, including $5.2 million favorable currency translation and $62.9 million or a 15.1% organic gain. And this year's 20.7% operating margin was up 430 basis points compared with prepandemic 2019. The Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands and further enabling its franchisees. And the results show it.
We do believe our runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise network represents a continuing opportunity. And there's evidence that we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel in our franchisee metrics, the financial and physical indicators that we monitor closely. Again, this quarter, they remain clearly favorable. And based on those metrics, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger. And they say so. And our direct interactions at events like this past January's kickoff meeting held this year at a distance. It was a great affair. Well attended, strong orders, visible commitment to our brand, watch parties all over the country. I zoomed into several of myself, and they were brimming with enthusiasm and optimism. Our franchisees entrepreneurs and professionals all are pumped, confident and reaching higher. The Tools Group quarter that's a strong advantage for us. 
The Tools Group quarter was also marked with Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, offering new products. Sometimes, just an improvement on an established line, but clearly making work easier, solving problems, delivering productivity gains. All of these are born out of observing the changing work in shops on an everyday basis. We're in those shops every day. We watch the work. We author the products. One such add is our KERN681, 7-drawer, single bank EPIQ series roll cab, configured entirely with extra wide 62-inch drawers, greater flexibility and capacity and a standard footprint, making the most of limited shop space. Our franchisees are already calling an uninterrupted storage. It's the first large capacity roll cab with a full complement of extra wide drawers in the industry. It's made on our Iowa plant. I saw some of them being made there just last month. The local team is proud of them. It comes with 2 swivel and 2 rigid casters located right on the corners of the box. It doesn't seem like much of a change, but that's a clever innovation that provides mobility and tight spaces, while also greatly enhancing box stability. That's a very important feature for a high-capacity unit, the [ KER681 ] EPIQ strength, styling, and styling, 8,000 pounds of low capacity and more than 45,000 cubic inches of storage space. The franchisees are saying it's been a clear hit and they're right. 
We spent some time over several quarters, working to expand franchisee selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training and RCI and Van operations, so it's paid off. Selling capacity is up. And you can see it clearly in the 3 straight [ gangbusters ] quarters for our Tools Group. I don't need to say any more about them. 
Now let's speak about RS&I. First quarter organic sales rose 7.6% with varying gains across the board. Undercar equipment coming back, delivering double-digit rise, diagnostics and information products, independent repair shops, growing at mid-single digits. And the business focused on OEM dealerships are advancing low single digits. Operating earnings of $81.4 million, including $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.1 million from 2020, which included $3.1 million of restructuring costs. Compared with 2019, sales grew $19.7 million or 6%, including a $10 million or 3.1% organic gain, $7.3 million from acquisitions and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency. We clearly see the potential and our runways for growth in the RS&I Group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. 
RS&I's organic growth in the quarter was broad-based, but the double-digit rise in undercar equipment was especially welcome turn and was led by innovative products like our newly-introduced Tru-Point ADAS calibration system. Advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS, are active and passive aids to keep vehicle passengers safe, things like collision avoidance, lane departure warnings, automated -- automatic parking and crosswind stabilization. These new features are great. But what's really music to our ears is that they require periodic calibrations to make sure they're working with precisions, and calibrations can be complicated. Sensors and cameras vary considerably across vehicle makes and models. And if you get a faulty recalibration, it leads to rework and it's not good for safety. So our new [ John ] being [ 2.80 of calibration system ] is the fix, making sure the vehicle is physically aligned correctly, guiding calibration of the sensors and documenting that the procedure was formed appropriately. It does -- and it does so for the multitude of mix and model seen regularly in OEM and aftermarket shops. 
The new Tru-Point is easy to use. It requires minimal training. It compensates for the floor irregularities that are so common in garages and bedevils alignment and calibration. It's quick and efficient and it's OEM compliant. It's a powerful product right in the crosshairs of automated vehicle technology that's so prominent today. Progress in diagnostics and information with independent repair shop owners and managers was also clearly evident in our Diagnostics business and our RS&I activity. And in this quarter, the launch of the new TRITON-D10 handheld helped author that positive. The new TRITON is ultrafast, a 2-second boot up, and it has a best-in-class 10-inch touchscreen. It's geared to the more capable technician, offering a one-touch full diagnostic cold scan scope capabilities for performance display and guided testing of suspect components that you may want to replace, but you want to make sure there's the problem. It's loaded with our Fast Track intelligence diagnostics rooted in our proprietary database of over 200 billion vehicle events, a Snap-on only feature that enables quick and accurate diagnosis of even the most difficult and unusual repairs, ensuring an efficient and effective solution for those very, very time-consuming problems. Just what the capable and senior technician needs. 
Now as I've said, we've spent said before, we spent considerable effort working to help franchisees sell the complex tools of today efficiently. And it's paying off with TRITON. Each of our franchisees received a demonstration unit, facilitating the hands-on training guided by the video presentations that were a prominent part of our network's February sales meetings. Following that initial instruction, the demo unit could then be put immediately in the hands of a technician to physically showcase the great benefits of our powerful new tool and it worked. The launch has been a success. Our franchisees are comfortable selling new and complex tool, and many are now calling the TRITON-D10 the best diagnostic unit ever. 
Finally, RS&I got a nice boost in the quarter, as often as the case by the new -- by new technologies and OEM dealerships, helped by some significant essential tools and equipment programs supporting the new electric vehicle launches. We're quite positive about RS&I's future with repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves. It plays to our strength. So that's the highlights of the quarter, continued in strong progress. Our third straight period exceeding prepandemic levels; C&I, sequential improvement, sequential advancement; RS&I is solid; the Tools Group, strong and pumped; organic sales rising 16.3%; opco operating margin, 19.6%; EPS, $3.50 a big rise and most important, most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than when we entered. It was an encouraging quarter.

The first quarter of 2021 exhibited robust financial performance, particularly as compared to last year when we experienced the initial shock of the virus. The quarter's results also compared favorably with the first quarter of 2019, which being a prepandemic time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1.0246 billion in the quarter increased 20.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 16.3% organic sales gain, $11.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $19.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 11.2% from $921.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, including an 8.1% organic gain, $15.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $11.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. 
Consolidated gross margin of 50.1% and compared to 49.5% last year, which included 60 basis points from restructuring costs. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes will benefit from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.5% improved 270 basis points from 33.2% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs. The improvements primarily reflect the impact of higher sales and cost containment actions, partially offset by higher stock-based costs and 30 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Operating earnings before financial services of $200.9 million compared to $138.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 44.6% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.6% improved 330 basis points from 16.3% last year, which included 90 basis points for restructuring costs. 
Financial services revenues of $88.6 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $85.9 million last year, while operating earnings of $65.3 million increased $8.4 million from 2020 levels, principally due to the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Last year's provisions included a $2.6 million charge for higher reserves, resulting from the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Consolidated operating earnings of $266.2 million increased 36% from $195.8 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 23.9% compared to 20.9% in 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring costs. Excluding the restructuring costs, operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 220 basis points from last year. 
Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 23.5% compared to 24.2% last year, which included a 10 basis point increase related to the prior year quarter's restructuring charges. Finally, net earnings of $192.6 million or $3.50 per diluted share increased $55.4 million or $1.01 per share from 2020 levels, representing a 40.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Additionally, net earnings increased $14.7 million or $0.34 per share from 2019 levels, representing a 10.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Net earnings in 2020 included restructuring charges of $6 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share, and net earnings in 2019 included a benefit of $8.7 million after tax or $0.15 per diluted share from a legal settlement. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share of $3.50 in 2021 increased 34.6% from 2020 and 16.3% from 2019 levels. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $345.7 million increased 15.3% from $299.9 million last year, reflecting a 9.5% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $9.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes double-digit increases in the segment's European-based and tools business and Asia Pacific operations as well as a mid-single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries. Improvements in year-over-year sales growth were widely seen across Europe as well as in most emerging markets. Additionally, within Critical Industries, strong sales gains were achieved in aviation, heavy-duty and technical education, while year-over-year declines in the natural resources sector improved from those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020, but continue to lag pre-pandemic sales levels. 
As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 7.2% from 2019 levels, representing a 3.1% organic sales gain, $8 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 38.7% improved 190 basis points from 36.8% in the first quarter of 2020, which included 150 basis points from restructuring charges. Aside from the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring costs, contributions from higher sales volumes were partially offset by 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved 230 basis points as compared to last year, primarily as a result of the higher volumes and savings from cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.7 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $31.5 million last year. The operating margin of 14.7% compared to 10.5% a year ago. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Sales of Snap-on Tools Group of $478.3 million increased 27.2% from $375.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 25% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects double-digit gains in both our U.S. and international operations. Net sales in the period increased 16.6% from $410.2 million in the first quarter of 2019, reflecting a 15.1% organic sales gain and $5.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 45.9% in the quarter improved 320 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.2% improved from 29.8% last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $98.9 million compared to $48.6 million last year, the operating margin of 20.7% compared to 12.9% a year ago, an increase of 780 basis points. 
Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $347.6 million compared to $314.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 7.6% organic sales gain, $4 million of acquisition-related sales and $4.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a double-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment, a mid-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and a low single-digit gain in activity with OEM dealerships. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased 6%, reflecting a 3.1% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 46% declined from 47.9% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a reminder, undercar equipment as well as facilitation program-related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment's average. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.6% improved 70 basis points from 23.3% last year, which included 80 basis points of restructuring cost. Excluding the effects of restructuring benefits from the higher sales volumes were more than offset by 80 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $81.4 million compared to $77.3 million last year. The operating margin of 23.4% compared to 24.6% a year ago. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $88.6 million compared to $85.9 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $65.3 million compared to $56.9 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $23.3 million decreased to $5.7 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses resulting from $2.4 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge-offs and the absence of the previously mentioned first quarter 2020 $2.6 million charge. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1.4% in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the first quarter, the average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% in 2021 compared to 17.7% in 2020. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.4% and 9.0%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2021 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the first quarter, approximately $11 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $261.8 million in the first quarter increased $6.2 million or 2.4% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 1.7% increase in originations of finance receivables while originations of contract receivables were up 5.7%. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio decreased $25.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in net collections. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for the United States extended credit is down 10 basis points from the first quarter last year and down 20 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe this reflects the typical seasonal delinquency pattern that customarily results in a decline in the first quarter, followed by increases later in the year, usually peaking in the fourth quarter where we compete with the technicians holiday-related discretionary spending. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.9 million represented 2.55% of outstandings at quarter end, down 7 basis points sequentially and down 44 basis points as compared to the same period last year. 
Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $319.3 million in the quarter increased $105.9 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $32.1 million decrease in inventory. Net cash used by investing activities of $207.2 million included $200 million for the acquisition of dealer FX and the capital expenditures of $19.3 million, partially offset by net collections of finance receivables of $12.1 million. Free cash flow during the quarter of $312.1 million was 158% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $131 million included cash dividends of $66.7 million and the repurchase of 722,000 shares of common stock from $151.9 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plan of $93 million. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $268.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations. 
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $10.1 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year-end. Inventories decreased $16.4 million from 2020 year-end and on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2020. Our quarter-end cash position of $904.6 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 12.4% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate that absent of any changes to U.S. tax legislation, our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Another encouraging period, resilient markets through the shock and on the way to psychological recovery. The third straight quarter of upward trajectory, clear year-over-year achievement and the third straight quarter of results exceeding the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. The RS&I sales continuing upward with OI margins of 23.4%, attenuated but still strong. C&I, ongoing sequential growth across the world and OI margins 14.7%, up nicely even from 2019. And then the Tools Group. Sales up organically, 25% versus 2020, up in all product lines and in all geographies, volume up 15.1% versus 2019 and an OI margin of 20.7%. Finally, financial services in the midst of the greatest stress test, profits up, delinquencies down, rock solid. And it all came together with Snap-on sales rising organically 16.3% versus 2020 and 8.1% versus '19. OI margin, 19.6%, up significantly despite the virus, the unfavorable currency and the acquisition impacts. And the EPS, $3.50, a substantial rise versus both 2020 and 2019. 
We do believe that Snap-on is abundant opportunity as the COVID recedes, and the world shifts away from the cities and away from share transportation and as new vehicle technologies make the car park more complex. And we further believe that we are stronger today than when we entered the storm our advantages of product, brand and people are even greater, and we're in a favorable position to wield those strengths, realize the opportunities and continue our positive trajectory throughout 2021 and beyond.

I think one is, this isn't a tool storage, and it was a much more focused growth. We introduced the -- certainly, the first thing is when we had that rise, we introduced the Rock 'N Roll Cabs and the TechKnow, which really focused on more or less a particular product line, this is a broader thing, much more rooted in kind of agnostic process from a product point of view of expanding the capabilities of the tools of the franchisees. we harness social media better. We're training them better to get the elevator pitch down and with RCI, their vans. We worked on this for quarters before, maybe even in 2019, and we worked really hard in the COVID because we had time to focus on it, and that's really paying off. It's showing that these franchisees can hit this 20%. 
The other thing is, I think, boy, I think we got some good products, particularly around hand tools. We package the hand tool. So we're selling not only individual tools, but also kits, kits aimed at a particular problem and they're becoming pretty profitable. We didn't -- popular. We didn't talk about them on the call. I mean things like putting together a set of sockets that are for particular applications in phone, they're wildly popular. And then the other products we have in terms of tool storage and diagnostics, they're really [indiscernible]. And that's driving that broad appeal. 
And then the final thing, I think you could think, look, there's a lot of this is condition. You could -- people might say this is a recovery, but the sales off the van all last year exceeded the sales to the van. So you wouldn't think there'd be recovery in that not so much recovery in that situation. It's going off the van at the same level, the whole year was up. And same things happening this quarter, sales off the van are the same as we're selling to them. So you look at this. You might say it's a stimulus and a stimulus could be helping us this way. We don't know. When you talk to technicians and people in a factory, stimulus seems to be, well, it's going into bank accounts or paying off debt. 
And the other thing about it is, by the way, we think it's product and process based because the international business, U.K., Australia and Canada are up and there ain't no stimulus there."

So they tend to have a look at the what I would call the more persnickety problems that arise all the time associated with vehicles that no one ever anticipated.

They're having a lot of problems there,"" you get to understand the difficulties associated with that.So it's not so much an observational thing as is a computational thing. Those are the kinds of things that help. So it just adds to our position. 
And then we also have a non-peril position in the repair shops afterwards, after vehicles age and they end up in independent repair shops, which is what you're referring to. We're in more shops for more hours than 8 days, and that's what drives our product line. So when new technologies show in, whether you're talking about automated vehicles or electric vehicles, to roll through this, we're going to see them be a Dealer-FX probably first. Then we're going to see them be the franchisees that call on dealerships to understand the nuances of some smaller and more difficult problems that are harder to predict via just maybe the bigger problems, the 20,000-foot problems that the software might see. And then as they roll into the aftermarket, we have probably almost proprietary visibility on that. That's what generates our proprietary databases that I talked about, 200 billion repair records."

Now -- so that's what we're doing. And so we'll continue to look at that in terms of, okay, what do we learn from that, how can we invest in other places to follow that change. 
But make no mistake about it. The revelations occur in each aging of the vehicle. So things change as you roll out. When the vehicle rolls in, people think this is what's needed. And then couple of years go by. And we see that these are what's needed. And some of it isn't even This is what I was trying to say before is some of it isn't the fact that you have to repair, let's say, a particular item or you have to recalibrate the sensors.

On these particular vehicles, you need special tools just to do the because they're configured in an odd way. This is -- and we learned that as it went through.

So the education business is up principally because you're selling to the schools. And so we have a two-pronged view there. We sell to the students and the schools and we see a lot of students starting to warm up. 
And I think -- I also think in this day and age, just starting to see, if I were sitting in a community college and I'd see the Biden administration rolling in there, and I don't think it's a political statement to reveal that he has a particular bent, given his wife's orientation and things he said to community college technical training. And so I think that might be a positive view and created an area of optimism in the school. So I think that changed the dynamic some. It was -- we're pretty pleased to see it. And in fact, again the critical industry businesses got back above the pre-COVID levels. I think that -- I don't want people to miss that. We're above pre-COVID levels. And by the way, we're bearing the COVID at the same time. So I think that -- and that's where C&I was. They've been going each quarter. They've been getting a little closer to 2019. This time they flipped above it. We view that as an incredibly positive event."

So they're fundamentally buying off that. We -- I'm talking to a bunch of franchisees as they keep telling me their inventories are low on this stuff. They can -- they'd like to get more, but they don't get them. They don't have them. 
So I think this is -- the idea of the pre-buy, we didn't see any of that. Now I'm not saying franchisees are, what, 3,500 of them. So you can get windshield surveys on them and you can get different ones will have different views. I can probably get 100 different opinions when I go out. But generally, we don't see that, Dave.

As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter. And along the way, I'll give you my perspective. Our results, they are encouraging.  Our markets, they're standing firm and our progress,",2873,"Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter. And along the way, I'll give you my perspective. Our results, they are encouraging.  Our markets, they're standing firm and our progress, it's made us stronger than ever before. And we'll also speak about what it all means. We believe it means we're getting better and better positioned for more, even while we're still in the midst of a once in a 100-year pandemic. And after all that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. 
We believe our first quarter is clear confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, further accommodating to the virus environment, overcoming period-to-period variations from business to business, dealing with macroeconomic headwinds and advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.0246 billion were up 20.2%, including $19.2 million of favorable foreign exchange and $11.3 million of acquisition-related sales. Organic sales growth was 16.3%, gains in every group. It's our third straight quarter of being above our pre-pandemic levels. And ongoing contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation processes, the principles we use every day, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, they all combine to drive that progress. Progress there was. 
Opco operating income of $200.9 million was up $62 million from last year, which included $7.5 million of restructuring charges. Opco operating margin was 19.6%, up from the 2020 level of 16.3% or 17.2% as adjusted for restructuring. For financial services, operating income of $65.3 million increased 14.8% and the delinquencies were down, even in the midst of a pandemic stress test, during commercial trial of what we could call extraordinary proportion. And that result combined with opco for a consolidated operating margin of 23.9%, a 300 basis point improvement as reported and up 220 basis points as adjusted. First quarter EPS was $3.50, up 40.6% from last year's $2.40. And excluding the 2020 restructuring charges, EPS grew 34.6%. I said it before, and I'll say it again. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered the Great Withering. And we also believe that our first quarter results testify to just that, especially when we compare them to 2019 before the virus. 
So let's do that. Versus 2019, our sales in the past quarter grew $102.9 million or 11.2%. That reflects $15.3 million of acquisition-related sales; $11.6 million of favorable foreign; currency and a $76 million or 8.1% economic gain. The 2021 opco operating margin of 19.6% was up 50 basis points from the 2019 level as adjusted for a legal settlement in that earlier period, and that 50-point gain was achieved against 80 points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while still absorbing the COVID. 
Now to our markets. Auto repair remains quite resilient. The technicians are rolling. They know they weather the depth of the COVID shock and have learned to accommodate the virus environment and are moving to psychological recovery. There's still some air of vigilance, but their activities are robust. And they know they won't be shocked again by a spike. They're quite positive regarding the future of driving as people pivot from shared mobility to individual transportation, and it's vehicle repair with the technicians as a strong and resilient market. You can hear it. You can hear it in our franchisees' voices and you can see it written clearly across our double-digit numbers. 
Also on auto repair, there are shop owners and managers. There are signs that the auto business is rising. Demand for new and used cars is high, but dealership repair and maintenance and warranty is still attenuated. So there is a gradual gain and we're positioned to take advantage with the broader strong -- broader and stronger product line, with innovations like our TRITON-D10 diagnostics and new acquisitions like Dealer-FX putting us deeper into dealerships than ever before and providing us a clearer view of the future repair trends, new technologies and evolving vehicle platforms. Dealer-FX puts us at the right place at the right time as things change. 
Finally, let's talk about critical industries, where Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tasks of consequence. This is where C&I operates the most international of our operations. And these are the customers that have been most impacted by the virus. They're slower to accommodate and to recover, but they have been recovering. And in the quarter, the results showed that trend, despite some significant headwinds, including the continuing impact of the virus, the February freeze in Texas, some challenged business sectors like oil and gas and troubled geographies like Southeast Asia. Despite that variation, we did see growth in critical industries, improvement in a number of areas, in aviation, and education and heavy-duty fleet, they all combined to overcome the continuing turbulence in natural resources. 
Also in C&I, SNA Europe, SNA Europe, another quarter of double-digit growth with broad strength across its geographies in places like France, Spain, Italy, Germany and the Nordic region. And from our Asia Pacific division, up double digits as well with solid increases in key countries like China and India and Japan. So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as improving and representing clear opportunity. And coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there's clear overall progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding to repair shop owners and managers, extended critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product line, wielding our strengthening brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the work. Understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-on people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock. About a year ago, as we entered the virus, we recognize the resilience of our markets and the strength of our model, projecting a V recovery, and that's how it played out. You can see it in the results. 
So now let's turn to the segments and discuss those results. In the C&I group, on a reported basis, including $9.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales, first quarter volume rose 15.3% compared to last year. Organic sales were up 9.5%, double-digit growth in our European hand tool business and a mid-single-digit rise in critical industries led the way. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $50.7 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable currency, represents a rise of $19.2 million compared to the $31.5 million registered in 2020, which included $4.4 million of restructuring. That all means, on an adjusted basis, an adjusted increase of over 40%. And as adjusted increase of over 40%. And the operating margin was 14.7%. And as reported increase of 420 basis points and 290 as adjusted. 
Now when compared with 2019, the pandemic free measuring stick, sales were up 7.2%, and that included $10 million or a 3.1% organic gain; $8 million of acquisitions and $5.2 million for favorable foreign currency. Once again, C&I demonstrated sequential improvement. If you go back and look at the numbers, they keep getting closer and closer, now they're above pre-pandemic levels despite the ongoing uncertainty. It's one of the things I think we want to remember, the virus isn't gone. We're still bearing it and we didn't have it in 2019 and C&I is above that level. As part of the trend, we remain committed to extending in critical industries. That's the C&I sweet spot. So we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise. 
And enabling that intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products, developed specially to make critical work easier. One example is our CT9010, 3/8 inch drive, 18-volt brushless impact wrench, the newest member of our MonsterLithium family, aimed at tight spaces, sustained power, rugged durability and precise control. The 9010 features 320-pound feet of bulk breakaway torque and 240-pound feet of working torque, all the power of technician needs when they're working in confined quarters. It offers a variable speed trigger in 3 speed selections in forward and reverse. That means greater control, adaptable to any applications and no overtorque-ing important. The 9010 advanced design also reduces motor temperature rise, delivering higher durability and great power to rate ratio. It's fitted -- and it's fitted with 100 lumen headlight that helps technicians work in dark environment, just what's needed for those closed jobs. And 18-volt battery with the 5-amp hours ensures consistent output and extended the run time, which translates to less charging and more efficient workday. And all of this comes -- and this is the best part, I think, all of this comes in an extremely compact size. Only 6 and 3/4 inches in overall length that will fit into the tightest of workspace. The CT9010 is a great tool. It's had strong demand, and it's already one of our $1 million hit products. 
I don't want to leave C&I without mentioning SNA Europe. Double-digit sales growth again, progress by the Bahco Ergo Management Tool Systems, expanding product customization to the needs of the task, driving progress across -- against the twin headwinds of a difficult proven environment. Europe is not so easy these days and the uncertainty of Brexit, no small feat. Well, that's C&I, continuing sequential improvement and positioned for more. 
Now on to the Tools Group. Sales of $478.3 million, up $102.4 million, including $6.7 million of favorable currency and a $95.7 million or 25% organic gain, double-digit growth, both in the U.S. and the international operations. The operating margin was 20.7%, yes, 20.7%, up 780 basis points. Compared with pre-virus 2019, Tools Group sales grew $68.1 million, 16.6%, including $5.2 million favorable currency translation and $62.9 million or a 15.1% organic gain. And this year's 20.7% operating margin was up 430 basis points compared with pre-pandemic 2019. The Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands and further enabling its franchisees. And the results show it.
We do believe our runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise network represents a continuing opportunity. And there's evidence that we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel in our franchisee metrics, the financial and physical indicators that we monitor closely. Again, this quarter, they remain clearly favorable. And based on those metrics, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger. And they say so. And our direct interactions at events like this past January's kickoff meeting held this year at a distance. It was a great affair. Well attended, strong orders, visible commitment to our brand, watch parties all over the country. I zoomed into several of myself, and they were brimming with enthusiasm and optimism. Our franchisees entrepreneurs and professionals all are pumped, confident and reaching higher. The Tools Group quarter that's a strong advantage for us. 
The Tools Group quarter was also marked with Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, offering new products. Sometimes, just an improvement on an established line, but clearly making work easier, solving problems, delivering productivity gains. All of these are born out of observing the changing work in shops on an everyday basis. We're in those shops every day. We watch the work. We author the products. One such add is our KERN681, 7-drawer, single bank EPIQ Series Roll Cab, configured entirely with extra wide 62-inch drawers, greater flexibility and capacity and a standard footprint, making the most of limited shop space. Our franchisees are already calling it uninterrupted storage. It's the first large capacity roll cab with a full complement of extra wide drawers in the industry. It's made out of Algona, Iowa plant. I saw some of them being made there just last month. The local team is proud of them. It comes with 2 swivel and 2 rigid casters located right on the corners of the box. It doesn't seem like much of a change, but that's a clever innovation that provides mobility in tight spaces, while also greatly enhancing box stability. That's a very important feature for a high-capacity unit, the KERN681 EPIQ strength and styling, 8,000 pounds of load capacity and more than 45,000 cubic inches of storage space. The franchisees are saying it's been a clear hit and they're right. 
We spent some time over several quarters, working to expand franchisee selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training and RCI and Van operations, so it's paid off. Selling capacity is up. And you can see it clearly in the 3 straight gangbusters quarters for our Tools Group. I don't need to say any more about them. 
Now let's speak about RS&I. First quarter organic sales rose 7.6% with varying gains across the board. Undercar equipment coming back, delivering double-digit rise, diagnostics and information products, independent repair shops, growing at mid-single digits. And the business focused on OEM dealerships advancing low single digits. Operating earnings of $81.4 million, including $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.1 million from 2020, which included $3.1 million of restructuring costs. Compared with 2019, sales grew $19.7 million or 6%, including a $10 million or 3.1% organic gain, $7.3 million from acquisitions and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency. We clearly see the potential and our runways for growth in the RS&I Group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. 
RS&I's organic growth in the quarter was broad-based, but the double-digit rise in undercar equipment was especially welcome turn and was led by innovative products like our newly-introduced Tru-Point ADAS calibration system. Advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS, are active and passive aids to keep vehicle passengers safe, things like collision avoidance, lane departure warnings, automated -- automatic parking and crosswind stabilization. These new features are great. But what's really music to our ears is that they require periodic calibrations to make sure they're working with precisions, and calibrations can be complicated. Sensors and cameras vary considerably across vehicle makes and models. And if you get a faulty recalibration, it leads to rework and it's not good for safety. So our new John Bean Tru-Point ADAS calibration system is the fix, making sure the vehicle is physically aligned correctly, guiding calibration of the sensors and documenting that the procedure was performed appropriately. It does -- and it does so for the multitude of mix and model seen regularly in OEM and aftermarket shops. 
The new Tru-Point is easy to use. It requires minimal training. It compensates for the floor irregularities that are so common in garages and bedevils alignment and calibration. It's quick and efficient and it's OEM compliant. It's a powerful product right in the crosshairs of automated vehicle technology that's so prominent today. Progress in diagnostics and information with independent repair shop owners and managers was also clearly evident in our Diagnostics business and our RS&I activity. And in this quarter, the launch of the new TRITON-D10 had helped author that positive. The new TRITON is ultrafast, a 2-second boot up, and it has a best-in-class 10-inch touchscreen. It's geared to the more capable technician, offering a one-touch full diagnostic cold scan scope capabilities for performance display and guided testing of suspect components that you may want to replace, but you want to make sure they're the problem. It's loaded with our Fast-Track Intelligence Diagnostics rooted in our proprietary database of over 200 billion vehicle events, a Snap-on-only feature that enables quick and accurate diagnosis of even the most difficult and unusual repairs, ensuring an efficient and effective solution for those very, very time-consuming problems. Just what the capable and senior technician needs. 
Now as I've said, we've spent -- as said before, we spent considerable effort working to help franchisees sell the complex tools of today efficiently. And it's paying off with TRITON. Each of our franchisees received a demonstration unit, facilitating the hands-on training guided by the video presentations that were a prominent part of our network's February sales meetings. Following that initial instruction, the demo unit could then be put immediately in the hands of a technician to physically showcase the great benefits of our powerful new tool and it worked. The launch has been a success. Our franchisees are comfortable selling new and complex tool, and many are now calling the TRITON-D10 the best diagnostic unit ever. 
Finally, RS&I got a nice boost in the quarter, as often is the case by the new -- by new technologies and OEM dealerships, helped by some significant essential tools and equipment programs supporting the new electric vehicle launches. We're quite positive about RS&I's future with repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves. It plays to our strength. So that's the highlights of the quarter, continued in strong progress. Our third straight period exceeding pre-pandemic levels; C&I, sequential improvement, sequential advancement; RS&I is solid; the Tools Group, strong and pumped; organic sales rising 16.3%; opco operating margin, 19.6%; EPS, $3.50 a big rise and most important, most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than when we entered. It was an encouraging quarter.

The first quarter of 2021 exhibited robust financial performance, particularly as compared to last year when we experienced the initial shock of the virus. The quarter's results also compared favorably with the first quarter of 2019, which being a pre-pandemic time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1.0246 billion in the quarter increased 20.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 16.3% organic sales gain, $11.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $19.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 11.2% from $921.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, including an 8.1% organic gain, $15.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $11.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. 
Consolidated gross margin of 50.1% and compared to 49.5% last year, which included 60 basis points from restructuring costs. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes will benefit from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.5% improved 270 basis points from 33.2% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs. The improvements primarily reflect the impact of higher sales and cost containment actions, partially offset by higher stock-based costs and 30 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Operating earnings before financial services of $200.9 million compared to $138.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 44.6% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.6% improved 330 basis points from 16.3% last year, which included 90 basis points for restructuring costs. 
Financial services revenues of $88.6 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $85.9 million last year, while operating earnings of $65.3 million increased $8.4 million from 2020 levels, principally due to the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Last year's provisions included a $2.6 million charge for higher reserves, resulting from the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Consolidated operating earnings of $266.2 million increased 36% from $195.8 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 23.9% compared to 20.9% in 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring costs. Excluding the restructuring costs, operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 220 basis points from last year. 
Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 23.5% compared to 24.2% last year, which included a 10 basis point increase related to the prior year quarter's restructuring charges. Finally, net earnings of $192.6 million or $3.50 per diluted share increased $55.4 million or $1.01 per share from 2020 levels, representing a 40.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Additionally, net earnings increased $14.7 million or $0.34 per share from 2019 levels, representing a 10.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Net earnings in 2020 included restructuring charges of $6 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share, and net earnings in 2019 included a benefit of $8.7 million after tax or $0.15 per diluted share from a legal settlement. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share of $3.50 in 2021 increased 34.6% from 2020 and 16.3% from 2019 levels. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $345.7 million increased 15.3% from $299.9 million last year, reflecting a 9.5% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $9.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes double-digit increases in the segment's European-based and Tools business and Asia Pacific operations as well as a mid-single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries. Improvements in year-over-year sales growth were widely seen across Europe as well as in most emerging markets. Additionally, within critical Industries, strong sales gains were achieved in aviation, heavy-duty and technical education, while year-over-year declines in the natural resources sector improved from those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020, but continue to lag pre-pandemic sales levels. 
As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 7.2% from 2019 levels, representing a 3.1% organic sales gain, $8 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 38.7% improved 190 basis points from 36.8% in the first quarter of 2020, which included 150 basis points from restructuring charges. Aside from the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring costs, contributions from higher sales volumes were partially offset by 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved 230 basis points as compared to last year, primarily as a result of the higher volumes and savings from cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.7 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $31.5 million last year. The operating margin of 14.7% compared to 10.5% a year ago. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Sales of Snap-on Tools Group of $478.3 million increased 27.2% from $375.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 25% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects double-digit gains in both our U.S. and international operations. Net sales in the period increased 16.6% from $410.2 million in the first quarter of 2019, reflecting a 15.1% organic sales gain and $5.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 45.9% in the quarter improved 320 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.2% improved from 29.8% last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $98.9 million compared to $48.6 million last year, the operating margin of 20.7% compared to 12.9% a year ago, an increase of 780 basis points. 
Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $347.6 million compared to $314.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 7.6% organic sales gain, $4 million of acquisition-related sales and $4.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a double-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment, a mid-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and a low single-digit gain in activity with OEM dealerships. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased 6%, reflecting a 3.1% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. 
Gross margin of 46% declined from 47.9% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a reminder, undercar equipment as well as facilitation program-related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment's average. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.6% improved 70 basis points from 23.3% last year, which included 80 basis points of restructuring cost. Excluding the effects of restructuring benefits from the higher sales volumes were more than offset by 80 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $81.4 million compared to $77.3 million last year. The operating margin of 23.4% compared to 24.6% a year ago. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $88.6 million compared to $85.9 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $65.3 million compared to $56.9 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $23.3 million decreased to $5.7 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses resulting from $2.4 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge-offs and the absence of the previously mentioned first quarter 2020 $2.6 million charge. 
As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1.4% in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the first quarter, the average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% in 2021 compared to 17.7% in 2020. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.4% and 9.0%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2021 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the first quarter, approximately $11 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $261.8 million in the first quarter increased $6.2 million or 2.4% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 1.7% increase in originations of finance receivables while originations of contract receivables were up 5.7%. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio decreased $25.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in net collections. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for the United States extended credit is down 10 basis points from the first quarter last year and down 20 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe this reflects the typical seasonal delinquency pattern that customarily results in a decline in the first quarter, followed by increases later in the year, usually peaking in the fourth quarter where we compete with the technicians holiday-related discretionary spending. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.9 million represented 2.55% of outstandings at quarter end, down 7 basis points sequentially and down 44 basis points as compared to the same period last year. 
Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $319.3 million in the quarter increased $105.9 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $32.1 million decrease in inventory. Net cash used by investing activities of $207.2 million included $200 million for the acquisition of Dealer-FX and the capital expenditures of $19.3 million, partially offset by net collections of finance receivables of $12.1 million. 
Free cash flow during the quarter of $312.1 million was 158% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $131 million included cash dividends of $66.7 million and the repurchase of 722,000 shares of common stock from $151.9 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plan of $93 million. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $268.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations. 
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $10.1 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year-end. Inventory has decreased $16.4 million from 2020 year-end and on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2020. Our quarter-end cash position of $904.6 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 12.4% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate that absent of any changes to U.S. tax legislation, our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Another encouraging period, resilient markets through the shock and on the way to psychological recovery. The third straight quarter of upward trajectory, clear year-over-year achievement and the third straight quarter of results exceeding the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. RS&I sales continuing upward with OI margins of 23.4%, attenuated but still strong. C&I, ongoing sequential growth across the world and OI margins 14.7%, up nicely even from 2019. And then the Tools Group. Sales up organically, 25% versus 2020, up in all product lines and in all geographies, volume up 15.1% versus 2019 and an OI margin of 20.7%. Finally, financial services in the midst of the greatest stress test, profits up, delinquencies down, rock solid. And it all came together with Snap-on sales rising organically 16.3% versus 2020 and 8.1% versus '19. OI margin, 19.6%, up significantly despite the virus, the unfavorable currency and the acquisition impacts. And the EPS, $3.50, a substantial rise versus both 2020 and 2019. 
We do believe that Snap-on is abundant opportunity as the COVID recedes, and the world shifts away from the cities and away from share transportation and as new vehicle technologies make the car park more complex. And we further believe that we are stronger today than when we entered the storm our advantages of product, brand and people are even greater, and we're in a favorable position to wield those strengths, realize the opportunities and continue our positive trajectory throughout 2021 and beyond.

We introduced the -- certainly, the first thing is when we had that rise, we introduced the Rock 'N Roll Cabs and the TechKnow, whic",420,"Yes. I think there's a couple of things. I think one is, this isn't a tool storage, and it was a much more focused growth. We introduced the -- certainly, the first thing is when we had that rise, we introduced the Rock 'N Roll Cabs and the TechKnow, which really focused on more or less a particular product line, this is a broader thing, much more rooted in kind of agnostic process from a product point of view of expanding the capabilities of the tools of the franchisees. we harness social media better. We're training them better to get the elevator pitch down and we RCI their vans. We worked on this for quarters before, maybe even in 2019, and we worked really hard in the COVID because we had time to focus on it, and that's really paying off. It's showing that these franchisees can hit this 20%. 
The other thing is, I think, boy, I think we got some good products, particularly around hand tools. We package the hand tool. So we're selling not only individual tools, but also kits, kits aimed at a particular problem and they're becoming pretty profitable. We didn't -- popular. We didn't talk about them on the call. I mean things like putting together a set of sockets that are for particular applications in phone, they're wildly popular. And then the other products we have in terms of tool storage and diagnostics, they're really boffo. And that's driving that broad appeal. 
And then the final thing, I think you could think, look, there's a lot of this is condition. You could -- people might say this is a recovery, but the sales off the van all last year exceeded the sales to the van. So you wouldn't think there'd be recovery in that not so much recovery in that situation. It's going off the van at the same level, the whole year was up. And same things happening this quarter, sales off the van are the same as we're selling to them. So you look at this. You might say it's a stimulus and a stimulus could be helping us this way. We don't know. When you talk to technicians and people in a factory, stimulus seems to be, well, it's going into bank accounts or paying off debt. 
And the other thing about it is, by the way, we think it's product and process based because the international business, U.K., Australia and Canada are up and there ain't no stimulus there."

So they tend to have a look at the what I would call the more persnickety problems that arise all the time associated with vehicles that no one ever anticipated. The Dealer-FX is the repair shop management software, so you get to see what's happening in aggregate kind of like a data basis to look at this kind of thing and say, ""Okay, well, they're having a lot of problems here. They're having a lot of problems there,"" you get to understand the difficulties associated with that. So it's not so much an observational thing as is a computational thing. Those are the kinds of things that help. So it just adds to our position. 
And then we also have a nonpareil position in the repair shops afterwards, after vehicles age and they end up in independent repair shops, which is what you're referring to. We're in more shops for more hours in any days, and that's what drives our product line. So when new technologies show in, whether you're talking about automated vehicles or electric vehicles, they're going to roll through this, we're going to see them be at Dealer-FX probably first. Then we're going to see them be the franchisees that call on dealerships to understand the nuances of some smaller and more difficult problems that are harder to predict via just maybe the bigger problems, the 20,000-foot problems that the software might see. And then as they roll into the aftermarket, we have probably almost proprietary visibility on that. That's what generates our proprietary databases that I talked about, 200 billion repair records."

Now -- so that's what we're doing. So we'll continue to look at that in terms of, okay, what do we learn from that, how can we invest in other places just to follow that change. 
But make no mistake about it. The revelations occur in each aging of the vehicle. So things change as you roll out. When the vehicle rolls in, people think this is what's needed. And then couple of years go by. And we see that these are what's needed. And some of it isn't even -- this is what I was trying to say before is some of it isn't the fact that you have to repair, let's say, a particular item or you have to recalibrate the sensors. It might be revealed to us in the difficulty of doing those products -- those processes. Which everybody -- first, you understand how you got to do it and then you realize, wait a minute, on these particular vehicles, you need special tools just to do them because they're configured in an odd way. This is -- and we learned that as it went through. And so basically, we see ourselves this electric vehicle, the EV, the new technologies, as just the version of what's happened before, only maybe hopefully at a faster pace, which gives us more to sell. And so our activities will be to try to anticipate those changes more quickly, invest in them and then enjoy."

But that turned, I think, based on the change in vehicle complexity now driven by the autonomy, these autonomous features, and therefore, undercar equipment was important.

And so we think we're the price leader and we can price for visible inflation, so you have that in the play, too. So we might see some going forward where we think it's under control. I mean this is -- I think I said in another forum that this is kind of what they pay us for to manage this stuff."

And then -- but I would say the big factor, Curtis, is that the schools are starting to anticipate the return of the students. So they're starting to facilitate. So the education business is up principally because you're selling to the schools. And so we have a two-pronged view there. We sell to the students and the schools and we see a lot of students starting to warm up. 
And I think -- I also think in this day and age, just starting to see, if I were sitting in a community college and I'd see the Biden administration rolling in there, and I don't think it's a political statement to reveal that he has a particular bent, given his wife's orientation and things he said to community college technical training. And so I think that might be a positive view and created an area of optimism in the school. So I think that changed the dynamic some. 
It was -- we're pretty pleased to see it. And in fact, again the critical industry businesses got back above the pre-COVID levels. I think that -- I don't want people to miss that. We're above pre-COVID levels. And by the way, we're bearing the COVID at the same time. So I think that -- and that's where C&I was. They've been going each quarter. They've been getting a little closer to 2019. This time they flipped above it. We view that as an incredibly positive event."

So you can get windshield surveys on them and you can get -- different ones will have different views. I can probably get 100 different opinions when I go out. But generally, we don't see that, Dave.

And along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, once again, they were encouraging. And our markets, robust and promising and our continued progress and strength amidst the pandemic, the pandemic isn't over, but we believe we're stronger right now than when it all started. 
Of course, we'll also speak about what it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. We believe that our second quarter, again, demonstrates Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming a variety of ongoing headwinds, accommodating to the lingering virus environment. meeting the challenges of the day across the business world and advancing along our runways for growth and for improvement. 
Our reported sales in the quarter were [ $1.814 billion ], and they were up versus last year $357.1 million or 49.3%, including $20.6 million of favorable foreign currency exchange and $19.6 million in acquisition-related sales. The organic sales were up 4.5%, with significant gains in every group, our fourth straight quarter being above pre-pandemic levels, a V-shaped trajectory that defines resilience and flexible capability. The Opco operating income of $217.1 million was up $126 million from last year, which included $4 million of restructuring charges. Opco operating margin was 20.1%, up from the 2020 level of 12.6% or 13.1% as adjusted for restructuring, representing a 700 basis point as adjusted improvement. 
The Financial Services operating income of $68.9 million increased 19.6%, higher originations lower losses, delinquencies below pre-pandemic levels, our finance company passing the greatest stress tests of our time with flying colors.
And that result combined with Opco for a consolidated operating margin of 24.5%, up 560 basis points as adjusted. Quarterly EPS was $3.76, up 103.2% from last year. And excluding the 2020 restructuring charges, EPS grew 96.9%, versus the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, the EPS grew 16.8%, clearly creating an ongoing positive trend. 
I've said it before, but it bears repeating, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we enter this great withering, and we believe our second quarter is emphatic evidence of that fact. Compared with 2019, our sales in the past quarter grew $130.1 million or 13.7%, that reflects $23 million of acquisition-related sales, $17.2 million of favorable foreign currency and $89.9 million -- and an $89.9 million or 9.3% organic gain. 
The 2021 Opco operating margin of 20.1% was up 10 basis points from 2019, but that gain was achieved against 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while absorbing the lingering effects of the virus, it's not gone. So those are the numbers. 
From a macro market perspective, it's clear that our automotive repair sector remains favorable. The technicians across the map are still at their posts, repairing cars and trucks, keeping the world running. And they are busy. And as expected after the COVID, it appears that people are leaning more toward personal transportation and are holding on to their vehicles longer every year. Auto repair is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it from our franchisees and you can see it in our numbers. 
As we look forward, we see greater opportunities as vehicle techs encountered even more complex repairs, new technologies, alternative powertrains, greater proliferation of driver assistance electronics, all music to our ears. And then there's the repair supers and managers, RS&I territory, a little more mixed, particularly in Europe, but return to growth in repair garages and dealerships, they're starting to invest, undercar equipment and OEM programs are coming back, and RS&I is taking advantage of that trend with new equipment offerings and advanced database solutions continually improving our software products and our diagnostic releases. Products like Midcon repair information software and shop management software and electronic parts catalogs and our dealer FX changement technology and our heavy-duty and our intelligence diagnostic units, big databases and getting more powerful. 
And easier to use, helping the shop fix it right the first time efficiently. Repair shop is changing, rising in complexity and arthonizes the products to match. Finally, let's talk about critical industries, where the step on rolls out of the garage, solving past the consequence. This is where the C&I group operates, our most international operations where the customers have endured the longest impact of the virus and have been slower to accommodated recovering it, what I'd call buried rates, segments like oil and gas and aviation so [indiscernible] like Southeast Asia and India still down. But despite the variation, we did see growth in critical industries. 
Improvements in education, the stones are coming back. and in power generation and heavy-duty fleet, all combining to offset that continuing turbulence. So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as healthy and representing clear opportunity. And coupled with auto repair, we believe our markets are robust now and there's considerable opportunity ahead. And we opportunity ahead for us as we move along our runways for growth and improvement. And I can't leave this section about robust progress and abundant possibilities speaking on the engine of our advanced, Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, developing new products and solutions, borne out of insights and observations gathered right in the workplaces. 
And RCI, guiding the expansion of franchisee selling capacity with better processes, more effective training and a new focus on social media, it will all help drive our progress overcoming the accommodating the virus and enabling us to take full advantage of the opportunities and chart a continuing and positive trend forward, that's the overview. 
Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I group, Sales in the quarter were up 33.8% or $88.6 million versus 2020, including a $71.3 million or 26.3% organic uplift with double-digit progress across all of the divisions. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $55.5 million, including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency represents a rise of $32.6 million compared to 2020, which included a [ $2 million ] of restructuring. That all means an as adjusted increase of over 122.9%, and the operating margin was 15.8%. 
And an as-reported increase of 710 basis points, a rise of 630 basis points as adjusted and an uplift of 120 basis points from the pre-pandemic level in 2019 despite 90 basis points of unfavorable currency. When compared with pre-pandemic 2019 sales were up 4.6%, including a 0.4% organic gain, about flat. Now continuing bright spot. For C&I. SNA Europe did deliver yet another quarter of growth, expanding beyond pre-pandemic levels against the wind with the spot Burgetool management system, leading the way, tailoring products specific to customer needs. 
Europe is a varied market environment, but SNA Europe is defining economic gravity. Again, and that positive was joined by contributions from recovering areas and critical industry like heavy-duty power generation. And as I said before, education who's come to the party just now. and from Asia Pacific geographies like China and Japan, and those gains were balanced by declines in attenuated sectors like the military, aerospace and natural resources, all still weak. 
We do remain confident in and committed to extending in critical industries, and we're committed with great new products. Speaking of product in the last quarter, it helped solve challenging tasks across aviation and other critical industries. We launched a new Snap-on 14.4-volt microlithium cordless with angle mini drill with a 6,000 RPM making it ideal for drilling a variety of materials, plastics to aluminum fiberglass. The unit has a compact 90-degree head, which provides easier access to combined spaces and reduce work in fatigue is a big factor. In addition, it also offers a higher quality check that achieves precise drilling with minimum runout, ensuring tight tolerances are met with considerable reliability. 
To top it all off, our drill also utilizes a double ball bearing supported spindle shaft. And viral level gears. Now that's a mouthful. But it all means that the new power tool has a clear superiority and durability. The cordless right-angle mini is a great innovation with an array of advantages and a text are noticing. So that's C&I, a promising quarter, moving down its runways for growth with strong profitability. C&I margins, 15.8%. 
Now on to the Tools cover. Sales of $484.1 million, up $160.8 million, including $154 million or 46.7% organic gain. Double-digit growth both in the U.S. and the international operations and the operating margin was 21.4%, up 930 basis points. Compared with pre-virus 2019, sales grew $78.3 million, including $70.7 million or 17.1% organic gain. In this quarter, it's 21.4% operating margin, it was up 380 basis points compared with the previrus numbers, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed. Another power another, I was going to say, powerful, I guess I could say that, but another positive quarter with double-digit expansion this across all geographies and all products. 
We do believe our van network remains quite strong. Just a few weeks ago, I spent time with a dozen franchisees on our -- the dozen franchisees on our U.S. National Franchisee Advisory Council at our Algona, Iowa tool storage plan. and they were pumped and prosperous, excited by their current positions, positive about the other vans and the regions that represent and very optimistic about the prospects for even more. Beyond the windshield surveys, we see other indications of continuing strength like the business health metrics, they remain quite favorable. Qualitative and quantitative indicators, both very positive. 
And that positivity was not just internal, it was reinforced by the external view. Snap-on was recognized again this year among the top 50 in the franchise industry by Entrepreneur Magazine. And once again, we scored highest in the Tools distribution category, place we've held for for quite some time. And now this type of recognition is kind of positivity, reflects the fundamental and contemporary strength of our franchisees and of our overall van business and would have not have been achieved without a continuous stream of unique new products. 
Hand tools were up in the quarter. And in part of that torque is rising in importance as more mechanical provisions precision becomes necessary to support vehicle automation. And we're riding that wave with great new products like our new ATEC, Micro Torque rich with a quick release head. The quarter-inch drive quick release has a positive locking mechanism to retain the socket solidly and securely in place. And at the same time, it offers a push button for easy tool disengagement. It holds and it injects both important under the hood. And it's a time saver. It's quite a time saver in close clearance applications like valve cover removals and spark plug replacements that happen every day in the garage. 
The tool also offers a visual, audible and migration alerts to confirm that the proper torque has been applied. -- and it has a wide torque range, 12 to 240-pound inches, and the new Micra also includes a 15-degree flex head ratchet for better access to fasteners, a 72 to quarter inch drive, enabling efficient operations in tight areas and a plus or minus 2% accuracy. 
Our Microtech takes precision fastening to the next level. Tool storage was also strong in the quarter, and part of that success was our KTL-1023-A3 roll a wide 72-inch triple bank tool storage box. It offers 3 extra wide drawers for longer and larger tools, giving the technician more organizational options. Our patented lock and roll latch mechanism, which prevents draws from drifting open and our isoridecasters providing a smooth ride, smooth rolling and excellent weight capacity plus plus. It adds our LED-lighted power Top, which spans the full width of the cabinet for better illumination and great eye appeal, and includes 10 offset AC outlets and 4 USB ports for charging a large array of the text electronics. The KTL-1023-A3, storage efficiency in a box that captures sharp attention in any shop sales of the unit? Well, it's a sellout. 
Our new products are, in fact, making a difference in the Tools Group. You can't miss it in the numbers. They also -- and the group also registered its fourth straight quarter above prepandemic levels. The Tools Group unmistakably is moving onward and upward. 
Now on to the RS&I group. Sales were up 62.7% or $153.6 million versus last year including $135.7 million or 54.1% organic uplift with double-digit growth weighted toward our undercar equipment and our OEM project business -- project businesses. But with our diagnostics and information product business is still delivering strong double-digit increases in addition to the weighting toward undercar equipment and OEM projects. 
From an earnings perspective, RS&I operating income of $86.7 million represents a rise of $36.1 million or 71.3% compared to 2020, which included $1.4 million restructuring. And the operating margin was 21.8%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year, 60 basis points as adjusted, but against a 180 basis point impact of unfavorable currency and acquisition effects. When compared with 2019, sales were up 14.2% as reported and organic growth was $29.7 million or 8.4%, with double-digit advances in undercar equipment, OEM projects, diagnostics and information in North America, all of that being attenuated by a general weakness in Europe. 
For profitability, the OI margin was 21.8%, an the OI margin of 21.8% was down 360 basis points with a 150-point impact from unfavorable currency and acquisition effects, and with a further drag from the higher sales of undercar equipment and OEM projects both at the lower end of RS&I margins. 
Having said that, RS&I has great opportunities, and we're fortifying its way forward with more new products. We just introduced our new to use mobile work centers. giving the technicians the ability to use the full capabilities of our top-of-the-line diagnostics information systems, including our exclusive Fast Track intelligent diagnostics from anywhere in the Service pay. It is a compact footprint for great mobility, reaching all over the shop. 
It also incorporates a lockable to draw tool storage cabinet and a large 27-inch touchscreen display. The News Workstation offers significant improvements in convenience and security and in visibility, combined with the power of our most sophisticated databases. It's just the ticket for those shops that want to solve the most difficult repair challenges and want to visibly display their advanced capability for all the customers to see as they come in to shop. 
And the new workstation is making a difference, attracting attention and it's setting new volume levels for this category. So to wrap up RS&I, improving position with repair shop owners and managers, strong growth across all the divisions, recovering areas of undercar equipment and OEM projects and expanding product lines to lead the way for us. 
Well, those are the highlights of the quarter. Tools Group, strong progress everywhere, unmistakable strength. C&I, recording a positive performance with significant profitability against variations across industry and geographies and RS&I expanding volume in independent repair shops and OEM dealerships gains in the U.S. overcoming weakness in Europe. Overall, sales increasing for the corporation up nicely, both versus last year at 42.5% up and compared with pre pandemic levels at 9.3% up, continuing our V-shaped recovery. 
Opco operating margin, a strong 21% up again in the face of 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and acquisition effect. EPS $3.76 in the quarter, for the -- up for the fourth quarter in a row, up versus last year, up versus last quarter, up versus pre-pandemic levels. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

The second quarter of 2021 exhibited solid financial performance, particularly as compared to last year's heavily pandemic impact in the second quarter. Results also compared favorably with the second quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. 
Net sales of $1.814 billion in the quarter increased 49.3% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 42.5% organic sales gain, $19.6 million of acquisition-related sales and $20.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Sequentially, organic sales improved by 4.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. 
Additionally, net sales in the period increased 13.7% from $951.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, including a 9.3% organic gain, $23.0 million of acquisition-related sales and $17.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 310 basis points from 47.1% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs. 
The gross margin contribution from the higher sales volumes and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.1% improved 440 basis points from 34.5% last year, which included 20 basis points from restructuring costs. The improvement primarily reflects the benefits of higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher stock-based costs, excuse me, and 70 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. 
Operating earnings before financial services of $217.1 million compared to $91.1 million in 2020, reflecting 138.3% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.1% improved 750 basis points from 12.6% last year, which included 50 basis points for restructuring cost. 
Financial services revenue of $86.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $84.6 million last year. While operating earnings of $68.9 million increased $11.3 million from 2020 levels, primarily as a result of higher revenue and lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $286 million increased 92.3% from $148.7 million last year. 
As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.5% compared to 18.4% in 2020, which included 50 basis points from restructuring costs. Excluding the restructuring costs, operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 560 basis points from last year. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.3% compared to 24.1% last year, which included a 20 basis point increase related to the prior year quarter's restructuring charges. 
Net earnings of $208 million or $3.76 per diluted share increased $106.8 million or $1.91 per share from last year's levels, representing a 13.2% increase in diluted earnings per share. As compared to 2020, excluding the restructuring charges of $3.3 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share diluted earnings per share increased 96.9%. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, net earnings increased $27.6 million or $0.54 per share, representing a 16.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $350.5 million increased 33.8% from $261.9 million last year, reflecting a 26.3% organic sales gain, $7.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain reflects higher activity in all of the segment's operations and includes mid-teen increases in sales to customers in critical industries. Within Critical Industries, robust sales gains were achieved in general industry, heavy-duty and technical education but were partially offset by year-over-year declines in sales to the military, which had remained strong in the pandemic impacted period last year. 
As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 4.6% from 2019 levels, reflecting $1.4 million of organic sales gain, $7.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. As compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up high single digits. With respect to critical industry sales activity in that period, our military international aerospace and Natural Resources segments were below 2019 levels. All other critical industry segments are at or above the second quarter of 2019. Gross margin of 39.5% improved 510 basis points from 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring charges. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring costs were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.7% improved 200 basis points compared to last year, primarily as a result of the improved volumes. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.5 million, including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $22.9 million last year. The operating margin of 15.8% compared to 8.7% a year ago. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $484.1 million increased 49.7% from $323.3 million in 2020, reflecting a 46.7% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a gain of approximately 40% in our U.S. business and a gain of approximately 80% in our international operations with strong growth across all product lines. 
Net sales in the period increased 19.3% from $405.8 million in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting a 17.1% organic sales gain and $7.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, sales in the U.S. operation were up 18.8% in that period, while franchisee sales off the van versus 2019 were up 21%. Gross margin of 46.8% in the quarter improved 510 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes, benefits from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.4% improved from 29.8% last year primarily due to the higher sales volumes. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $103.5 million compared to $38.4 million last year. The operating margin of 21.4% compared to 11.9% a year ago, an improvement of 950 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $398.6 million compared to $245 million a year ago, reflecting a 54.1% organic sales gain, $11.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. 
The organic increase reflects a rise of approximately 80% in sales of undercar equipment as well as a gain of approximately 50% in sales to OEM dealerships and an increase of approximately 30% in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. 
As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $49.7 million from $348.9 million, reflecting an 8.4% organic sales gain, $15.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $4.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 44.7% declined from 47.4% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects partially offset by 70 basis points of benefits from acquisition. 
As a reminder, undercar equipment as well as facilitation program related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment average. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% improved 380 basis points from 26.7% last year, which included 50 basis points of restructuring costs. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from lower costs related to restructuring were partially offset by 190 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. 
Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $86.7 million compared to $50.6 million last year. The operating margin of 21.8% compared to 20.7% a year ago. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $86.9 million compared to $84.6 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $68.9 million compared to $57.6 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $18 million decreased $9 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, resulting from $2.8 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge-offs as well as favorable loan portfolio trends, which support lower expected reserve requirements. 
As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.8% and 1.3% on in the second quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the second quarter, the average yield on finance receivables of 17.5% in 2021 compared to 17.6% in 2020. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 8.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. 
As of the end of the current quarter, approximately $8 million of these business operation support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $285.8 million in the second quarter increased $30 million or 11.7% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 17.9% on increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were down 11.5%. Last year's contract receivable originations included the aforementioned offering of business operation support loans to qualifying franchisees during the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $13.2 million in the second quarter, primarily due to the higher originations. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.2% for the United States extended credit is up 20 basis points from the rate of 1% in the second quarter of 2020. 
As we commented during our second quarter 2020 earnings call, we estimated in the quarter, the 60-day plus delinquency rate was favorably affected by 20 to 30 basis points as a result of forbearance and deferred payment programs in place during that period last year. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $41.6 million, representing 2.4% of outstandings at quarter end, is down 15 basis points sequentially and down 53 basis points compared to the same period last year. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $238.2 million in the quarter decreased $15.4 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings more than offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including [ $78.4 million ] of higher income tax payments. The increase in cash paid for income taxes reflects both higher levels of taxable profitability as well as the IRS no longer allowing companies to defer estimated tax payments as compared to the IRS accommodation offered during the second quarter of 2020. 
Net cash used by investing activities of the $29.7 million included net additions of finance receivables of $18.7 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $147.9 million included cash dividends of $66.7 million and the repurchase of 566,900 shares of common stock for $137.4 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plans of $61.8 million. 
As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $251.6 million of common stock under existing authorizations. 
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $4.7 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 56 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $14.4 million from 2020 year-end, but on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2020. 
Our quarter end cash position of $965.9 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 10.8% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. At quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there are no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

Well, at the beginning, I said I would speak on what this all means. I'm going to try. First, it means that Snap-on and markets are resilient. The virus, probably the greatest threat to our society and business. And in many decades, it was a great shock. Miles driven down big dealerships, many furloughed no travelers aviation, no travelers, oil and gas and free full and education, virtually little need for equipment. Nobody is in the classrooms. And yet, we weathered the shock without trauma. 
The credit company stepped in with just the right bridging at just the right places for customers and franchisees and our direct selling vans kept rolling quickly accommodating to the environment. Snap-on kept investing in our products, our brands and our people, and we accommodated and recovered to post 4 straight quarters of above pre-pandemic results. Tracing a V-shaped recovery and emerging from the height of the storm stronger than we entered, resilience against the greatest business threat in memory, but it's more than resilience. More than bounce back. It also demonstrates great flexibility. 
As the world passed through the shock through accommodation to psychological recovery, change was the order of the day and fueled by our fortified advantages and product brand and people we accommodated. The pandemic limited face-to-face interaction. We expanded virtual contact and came away with some long-term social media tools that will enable our franchisees for some time. When technicians focused on shorter payback items, we gave the hand tools and power tools in torque when repair leaned away from maintenance to complex repairs in the shock, we provided ADAS calibration, tools and intelligent diagnostics and help franchisees expand their selling capacity to manage those more complicated offerings efficiently. 
When some critical industries weakened, we developed offerings for those that maintained. When the virus attenuated the distributors in Europe, we focused on customization and more direct interactions, all of that achievement in the time of change demonstrates Snap-on's flexibility and confirms we can prosper mid-future change going forward, as we've always done by observing work and solving whatever the new problems are. 
Snap-on second quarter. Tools Group, up in all geographies and in all product lines, sales up 17.1% compared with 2019 and OI margins of 21.4%. C&I gains offsetting the challenges of the lingering COVID, rising profitability to 13.8%, up 120 basis points from the pre-pandemic level, even with a 90 basis point impact from unfavorable currency. 
RS&I, sales up 8.5% versus 2019. undercar equipment and OEM projects recovering in an OI of 21.8%, down from the pre-pandemic but still strong, and Snap-on overall, sales up 9.3% organically versus 2019, an OI margin of 20.1% and an EPS of $3.76, up meaningfully versus every comparison. It was an encouraging period again, demonstrating resilience and flexibility, encouraging for the now and we're confident encouraging for the prospects of growth and improvement for the future on through 2021 and and well beyond.

I do think the technicians are kind of have good cash because the business has been going well for quite a long period of time. And they are interested in continually investing in tools. So you see that as a factor. I mean that's certainly a factor in the business.

But what I'm really referring to here without -- I didn't want to get into it in remarks because there's a lot to say, and I don't -- really what this is, is we use social media before. But in the pandemic we realized the more effective way to use them was the pre-brief customers. In other words, to contact them, first, we started out by saying, okay, we want to stay in touch with our customers via social media or any electronic means that do it at a distance. But then we realized, boy, it's a powerful tool for making for sales efficiency when you're actually in front of them. 
Because what you can do is contact them on the social media, you have a relationship with. You can pre brief them about how great what the elements of a particular new product is like the power tool I talked about or the tech ranch I talked about. And you can also pre-brief them on any promotions we might have. And so then when you're actually spending the time in front of the technician, you can spend your time closing the deal. 
This is this kind of shrinks the time. And so it takes some of the presell out of the face time and makes it more efficient. That's what we're talking about here. We learned how to do that very well in the pandemic. And that's going to serve us well. And it's part of the ID. Remember, I always said that the pacing element for sales to the Tools Group has been the franchisees' time, well, they're hitting new limits up 17% and versus versus prepandemic levels, and it's because we've expanded their capacity."

And so I think they've kind of changed their level -- they're starting to recover. And so you're starting to see people -- we saw it in our tool storage numbers, one of the reasons why we took the franchisees, the franchise council to Algona, our Tool Storage plant is everybody's screaming for more tool storage. 
Now 1 of the effects was that when we entered the COVID, they sold down they used the used boxes that they had taken in trade, and so they had a lot of that rolling out. But still, but still, they're looking for boxes now. So I think things have turned. The question is, are the franchisees so flushed with cash that they want to finance some of those boxes. For some of them, sometimes they sell them a locker, which is not quite as expensive as a box and they can afford to finance those kinds of things. 
But I do think when I talk to franchisees, they're telling me that we've kind of turned the corner. They turn the corner is probably 2 -- maybe 2 binary award for it. We were coming back, though. Things are pretty optimistic in the shops."

It might be in the U.S. I don't think -- I actually don't think -- David, I don't think stimulus as much of a factor, maybe some because we have pretty good growth in international operations, where you don't see as clear a pumping of the money into the economy. So when we look at it across the world, it doesn't seem as though that specific characteristic of America is a factor. I don't know maybe, but I tend to think it's more a combination of the franchisees feeling more flush. 
You kind of got an interesting interaction. You have people who at first were leaning towards shorter payback items. And maybe that expands to away from hand to past hand tools up into lockers or spiffier tops for the tool storage boxes, which are more fundable by the franchisees over time. franchisees like to build their shorter-term credit, so they like that. And it is true that the technicians do have more cash. I mean, they've been working all through the pandemic -- And so that's kind of built up on a relative case. It could be eligible for other credit. We have no way of knowing that. I don't hear anybody mention it, though. Now I talked to a lot of franchisees, and they may not necessarily mention, but we haven't heard that particular thing come up in any environment. 
So I don't know."

It's an interesting dynamic. I guess we'll watch and see where it goes. You talked about the strength in storage, which I guess was surprising to hear and certainly strikes me is counterintuitive, given it's hard to think of another product you sell that would be more carbon steel intensive. And given cold-rolled steel now hitting $2,000 a ton this week, there's been an awful lot of inflation, which I'm assuming you pass through. So is there just no elasticity there in storage? I guess storage sales kind of flat and what we're seeing the growth on is 1 of those new product introductions?"

I talked about this this extra wide, the 72-inch master series in the call with the light at top. Those things are statement makers and garages. And I think that having refrained from some of this for a period of time, technicians are getting more anxious to buy them and they have the money and they're getting a little more confidence so they go out and look at them. That's really -- I think that's the situation. I wouldn't say there's no elasticity. But I think when you I mean, is there elasticity with new cars? I mean the thing is people are buying new cars and reuse cars and so on. 
I mean, so I think when people want something in this category, which is I've often said, I think you and I have had conversations that a tool storage box like a car. So people tend to want them. They'll pay a little bit more. It's not no elasticity, but people will will go up and pay for them. That's my analysis. It's really the psychology and the need, a combination of need and psychology. And our biggest cycle the product we have, which is the biggest psychological factor in people buying it is tool storage. Now all I can tell you is our tool storage plant is sold out, sold out, I mean."

So that's certainly true for us. And so we keep -- we've always said, keep pounding that and we can sell more. We're not bound by the market. we're bound by our ability to sell.

And along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, once again, they were encouraging. And our markets, robust and promising and our continued progress and strength amidst the pandemic, the pandemic isn't over, but we believe we're stronger right now than when it all started. 
Of course, we'll also speak about what it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. We believe that our second quarter, again, demonstrates Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming a variety of ongoing headwinds, accommodating to the lingering virus environment, meeting the challenges of the day across the business world and advancing along our runways for growth and for improvement. 
Our reported sales in the quarter were $1.0814 billion, and they were up versus last year's $357.1 million or 49.3%, including $20.6 million of favorable foreign currency exchange and $19.6 million in acquisition-related sales. The organic sales were up 42.5%, with significant gains in every group, our fourth straight quarter being above pre-pandemic levels, a V-shaped trajectory that defines resilience and flexible capability. The Opco operating income of $217.1 million was up $126 million from last year, which included $4 million of restructuring charges. Opco operating margin was 20.1%, up from the 2020 level of 12.6% or 13.1% as adjusted for restructuring, representing a 700 basis point as adjusted improvement. 
The Financial Services operating income of $68.9 million increased 19.6%, higher originations, lower losses, delinquencies below pre-pandemic levels, our finance company passing the greatest stress tests of our time with flying colors.
And that result combined with Opco for a consolidated operating margin of 24.5%, up 560 basis points as adjusted. Quarterly EPS was $3.76, up 103.2% from last year. And excluding the 2020 restructuring charges, EPS grew 96.9%, versus the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, the EPS grew 16.8%, clearly tracing an ongoing positive trend. 
I've said it before, but it appears to be repeating, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we enter this great withering, and we believe our second quarter is emphatic evidence of that fact. Compared with 2019, our sales in the past quarter grew $130.1 million or 13.7%, that reflects $23 million of acquisition-related sales, $17.2 million of favorable foreign currency and $89.9 million or -- and an $89.9 million or 9.3% organic gain. 
The 2021 Opco operating margin of 20.1% was up 10 basis points from 2019, but that gain was achieved against 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while absorbing the lingering effects of the virus, it's not gone. So those are the numbers. 
From a macro market perspective, it's clear that our automotive repair sector remains favorable. The technicians across the map are still at their posts, repairing cars and trucks, keeping the world running. And they are busy. And as expected after the COVID, it appears that people are leaning more toward personal transportation and are holding on to their vehicles longer every year. Auto repair is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it from our franchisees and you can see it in our numbers. 
As we look forward, we see greater opportunities as vehicle techs encountered even more complex repairs, new technologies, alternative powertrains, greater proliferation of driver assistance electronics, flow music to our ears. And then there's the repair supplies as advantages, RS&I territory, a little more mixed, particularly in Europe, but return to growth in repair garages and dealerships, they're starting to invest, undercar equipment and OEM programs are coming back, and RS&I is taking advantage of that trend with new equipment offerings and advanced database solutions continually improving our software products and our diagnostic releases. Products like Mitchell 1 repair information software and shop management software and electronic parts catalogs and our Dealer-FX shop management technology and our heavy-duty and our intelligence diagnostic units, big databases and getting more powerful and easier to use, helping the shop fix it right the first time efficiently. Repair shop is changing, rising in complexity and RS&I is the products to match. Finally, let's talk about critical industries, where the Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving test the consequence. This is where the C&I group operates, our most international operations where the customers have endured the longest impact of the virus and have been slower to accommodated recovering it, what I'd call buried rates, segments like oil and gas and aviation so geographies like Southeast Asia and India still down. But despite the variation, we did see growth in critical industries. 
Improvements in education, the students are coming back. and in power generation and heavy-duty fleet, all combining to offset that continuing turbulence. So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as healthy and representing clear opportunity. And coupled with auto repair, we believe our markets are robust now and there's considerable opportunity ahead. And we add opportunity ahead for us as we move along our runways for growth and improvement. And I can't leave this section about robust progress and abundant possibilities, well, speaking on the engine of our advanced, Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, developing new products and solutions, borne out of insights and observations gathered right in the workplaces. 
And RCI, guiding the expansion of franchisee selling capacity with better processes, more effective training and a new focus on social media, it will all help drive our progress overcoming 
[Audio Gap]  
accommodating the virus and enabling us to take full advantage of the opportunities and chart a continuing and positive trend forward, that's the overview. 
Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I group, sales in the quarter were up 33.8% or $88.6 million versus 2020, including a $71.3 million or 26.3% organic uplift with double-digit progress across all of the divisions. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $55.5 million, including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency represents a rise of $32.6 million compared to 2020, which included a $2 million of restructuring. That all means an as adjusted increase of over 122.9%, and the operating margin was 15.8%. 
And as-reported increase of 710 basis points, a rise of 630 basis points as adjusted and an uplift of 120 basis points from the pre-pandemic level in 2019 despite 90 basis points of unfavorable currency. When compared with pre-pandemic 2019 sales were up 4.6%, including a 0.4% organic gain, about flat. Now continuing bright spot for C&I. SNA Europe did deliver yet another quarter of growth, expanding beyond pre-pandemic levels against the wind with the Bahco Ergo Tool Management System leading the way, tailoring products specific to customer needs. 
Europe is a varied market environment, but SNA Europe is defying economic gravity again, and that positive was joined by contributions from recovering areas and critical industry like heavy-duty power generation. And as I said before, education who's come to the party just now. and from Asia Pacific geographies like China and Japan, and those gains were balanced by declines in attenuated sectors like the military, aerospace and natural resources, all still weak. 
We do remain confident in and committed to extending in critical industries, and we're committed with great new products. Speaking of product in the last quarter, it helped solve challenging tasks across aviation and other critical industries. We launched a new Snap-on 14.4-volt microlithium cordless right angle mini drill with a 6,000 RPM making it ideal for drilling a variety of materials, plastics to aluminum to fiberglass. The unit has a compact 90-degree head, which provides easier access to combined spaces and reduces work of fatigue, it's a big factor. In addition, it also offers a higher quality check that achieves precise drilling with minimum runout, ensuring tight tolerances are met with considerable reliability. 
To top it all off, our drill also utilizes a double ball bearing supported spindle shaft and spiral bevel gears. Now that's a mouthful. But it all means that the new power tool has a clear superiority and durability. The cordless right-angle mini is a great innovation with an array of advantages and techs are noticing. So that's C&I, a promising quarter, moving down its runways for growth with strong profitability. C&I, OI margins, 15.8%. 
Now on to the Tools Group. Sales of $484.1 million, up $160.8 million, including $154 million or 46.7% organic gain. Double-digit growth both in the U.S. and the international operations and the operating margin was 21.4%, up 930 basis points. Compared with pre-virus 2019, sales grew $78.3 million, including $70.7 million or 17.1% organic gain. In this quarter, it's 21.4% operating margin, it was up 380 basis points compared with the pre-virus numbers, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed. Another power -- another -- I was going to say, powerful, I guess I could say that, but another positive quarter with double-digit expansions across all geographies and all products. 
We do believe our van network remains quite strong. Just a few weeks ago, I spent time with a dozen franchisees on our -- the dozen franchisees on our U.S. National Franchisee Advisory Council at our Algona, Iowa tool storage plant. and they were pumped and prosperous, excited by their current positions, positive about the other vans and the regions that represent and very optimistic about the prospects for even more. Beyond the windshield surveys, we see other indications of continuing strength like the business health metrics, they remain quite favorable. Qualitative and quantitative indicators, both very positive. 
And that positivity was not just internal, it was reinforced by the external view. Snap-on was recognized again this year among the top 50 in the franchise industry by Entrepreneur Magazine. And once again, we scored highest in the Tools distribution category, place we've held for quite some time. And now this type of recognition is kind of positivity, reflects the fundamental and contemporary strength of our franchisees and of our overall van business and would have not have been achieved without a continuous stream of unique new products. 
Hand tools were up in the quarter. And in part of that torque is rising in importance as more mechanical provisions -- precision becomes necessary to support vehicle automation. And we're riding that wave with great new products like our new ATEC, Micro Torque Wrench with a quick release head. The quarter-inch drive quick release has a positive locking mechanism to retain the socket solidly and securely in place. And at the same time, it offers a push button for easy tool disengagement. It holds and it ejects both important under the hood. And it's a time saver. It's quite a time saver in close clearance applications like valve cover removals and spark plug replacements that happen every day in the garage. 
The tool also offers visual, audible and vibrational alerts to confirm that the proper torque has been applied, and it has a wide torque range, 12 to 240-pound inches, and the new micro also includes a 15-degree flex head ratchet for better access to fasteners, a 72-tooth quarter inch drive ratchet, enabling efficient operations in tight areas and a plus or minus 2% accuracy. 
Our micro tech takes precision fastening to the next level. Tool storage was also strong in the quarter, and part of that success was our KTL-1023-A3 roll cab, a wide 72-inch triple bank tool storage box. It offers 3 extra wide drawers for longer and larger tools, giving the technician more organizational options. Our patented lock and roll latch mechanism, which prevents drawers from drifting open and our ISO ride casters providing a smooth ride, smooth rolling and excellent weight capacity plus. It adds our LED-lighted power top, which spans the full width of the cabinet for better illumination and great eye appeal, and includes 10 offset AC outlets and 4 USB ports for charging a large array in the techs electronics. The KTL-1023-A3, storage efficiency in a box that captures sharp attention in any shop, sales of the unit? Well, it's a sellout. 
Our new products are, in fact, making a difference in the Tools Group. You can't miss it in the numbers. They also and the group also registered its fourth straight quarter above pre-pandemic levels. The Tools Group unmistakably is moving onward and upward. 
Now on to the RS&I group. Sales were up 62.7% or $153.6 million versus last year including $135.7 million or 54.1% organic uplift with double-digit growth weighted toward our undercar equipment and our OEM project business -- project businesses. But with our diagnostics and information product business is still delivering strong double-digit increases in addition to the weighting toward undercar equipment and OEM projects. 
From an earnings perspective, RS&I operating income of $86.7 million represents a rise of $36.1 million or 71.3% compared to 2020, which included $1.4 million of restructuring. And the operating margin was 21.8%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year, 60 basis points as adjusted, but against a 180 basis point impact of unfavorable currency and acquisition effects. When compared with 2019, sales were up 14.2% as reported and organic growth was $29.7 million or 8.4%, with double-digit advances in undercar equipment, OEM projects, diagnostics and information in North America, all of that being attenuated by a general weakness in Europe. 
For profitability, the OI margin was 21.8% -- the OI margin of 21.8% was down 360 basis points with a 150-point impact from unfavorable currency and acquisition effects, and with a further drag from the higher sales of undercar equipment and OEM projects both at the lower end of RS&I margins. 
Having said that, RS&I has great opportunities, and we're fortifying its way forward with more new products. We just introduced our new ZEUS mobile work centers, giving the technicians the ability to use the full capabilities of our top-of-the-line diagnostics information systems, including our exclusive Fast Track intelligent diagnostics from anywhere in the service pay. It is a compact footprint for great mobility, reaching all over the shop. 
It also incorporates a lockable tool drawer, tool storage cabinet and a large 27-inch touchscreen display. The new ZEUS Workstation offers significant improvements in convenience and security and in visibility, combined with the power of our most sophisticated databases. It's just the ticket for those shops that want to solve the most difficult repair challenges and want to visibly display their advanced capability for all the customers to see as they come in to shop. 
And the new workstation is making a difference, attracting attention and it's setting new volume levels for this category. So to wrap up RS&I, improving position with repair shop owners and managers, strong growth across all the divisions, recovering areas of undercar equipment and OEM projects and expanding product lines to lead the way for us. 
Well, those are the highlights of the quarter. Tools Group, strong progress everywhere, unmistakable strength. C&I, recording a positive performance with significant profitability against variations across industry and geographies and RS&I expanding volume in independent repair shops and OEM dealerships, gains in the U.S. overcoming weakness in Europe. Overall, sales increasing for the corporation up nicely, both versus last year at 42.5% up and compared with pre-pandemic levels at 9.3% up, continuing our V-shaped recovery. 
Opco operating margin, a strong [ 21% ] up again in the face of 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and acquisition effect. EPS $3.76 in the quarter, for the -- up for the fourth quarter in a row, up versus last year, up versus last quarter, up versus pre-pandemic levels. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

The second quarter of 2021 exhibited solid financial performance, particularly as compared to last year's heavily pandemic impact in the second quarter. Results also compared favorably with the second quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. 
Net sales of $1.0814 billion in the quarter increased 49.3% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 42.5% organic sales gain, $19.6 million of acquisition-related sales and $20.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Sequentially, organic sales improved by 4.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. 
Additionally, net sales in the period increased 13.7% from $951.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, including a 9.3% organic gain, $23.0 million of acquisition-related sales and $17.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 310 basis points from 47.1% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs. 
The gross margin contribution from the higher sales volumes and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.1% improved 440 basis points from 34.5% last year, which included 20 basis points from restructuring costs. The improvement primarily reflects the benefits of higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher stock-based costs and 70 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. 
Operating earnings before financial services of $217.1 million compared to $91.1 million in 2020, reflecting 138.3% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.1% improved 750 basis points from 12.6% last year, which included 50 basis points for restructuring cost. 
Financial services revenue of $86.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $84.6 million last year. While operating earnings of $68.9 million increased $11.3 million from 2020 levels, primarily as a result of higher revenue and lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $286 million increased 92.3% from $148.7 million last year. 
As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.5% compared to 18.4% in 2020, which included 50 basis points from restructuring costs. Excluding the restructuring costs, operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 560 basis points from last year. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.3% compared to 24.1% last year, which included a 20 basis point increase related to the prior year quarter's restructuring charges. 
Net earnings of $208 million or $3.76 per diluted share increased $106.8 million or $1.91 per share from last year's levels, representing a 103.2% increase in diluted earnings per share. As compared to 2020, excluding the restructuring charges of $3.3 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share diluted earnings per share increased 96.9%. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, net earnings increased $27.6 million or $0.54 per share, representing a 16.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $350.5 million increased 33.8% from $261.9 million last year, reflecting a 26.3% organic sales gain, $7.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain reflects higher activity in all of the segment's operations and includes mid-teen increases in sales to customers in critical industries. Within Critical Industries, robust sales gains were achieved in general industry, heavy-duty and technical education but were partially offset by year-over-year declines in sales to the military, which had remained strong in the pandemic-impacted period last year. 
As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 4.6% from 2019 levels, reflecting $1.4 million of organic sales gain, $7.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. As compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up high single digits. With respect to critical industry sales activity in that period, our military, international aerospace and Natural Resources segments were below 2019 levels. All other critical industry segments are at or above the second quarter of 2019. Gross margin of 39.5% improved 510 basis points from 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring charges. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring costs were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.7% improved 200 basis points compared to last year, primarily as a result of the improved volumes. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.5 million, including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $22.9 million last year. The operating margin of 15.8% compared to 8.7% a year ago. 
Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $484.1 million increased 49.7% from $323.3 million in 2020, reflecting a 46.7% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a gain of approximately 40% in our U.S. business and a gain of approximately 80% in our international operations with strong growth across all product lines. 
Net sales in the period increased 19.3% from $405.8 million in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting a 17.1% organic sales gain and $7.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, sales in the U.S. operation were up 18.8% in that period, while franchisee sales off the van versus 2019 were up 21%. Gross margin of 46.8% in the quarter improved 510 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes, benefits from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.4% improved from 29.8% last year primarily due to the higher sales volumes. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $103.5 million compared to $38.4 million last year. The operating margin of 21.4% compared to 11.9% a year ago, an improvement of 950 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $398.6 million compared to $245 million a year ago, reflecting a 54.1% organic sales gain, $11.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. 
The organic increase reflects a rise of approximately 80% in sales of undercar equipment as well as a gain of approximately 50% in sales to OEM dealerships and an increase of approximately 30% in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. 
As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $49.7 million from $348.9 million, reflecting an 8.4% organic sales gain, $15.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $4.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 44.7% declined from 47.4% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects partially offset by 70 basis points of benefits from acquisition. 
As a reminder, undercar equipment as well as facilitation program related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment average. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% improved 380 basis points from 26.7% last year, which included 50 basis points of restructuring costs. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from lower costs related to restructuring were partially offset by 190 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. 
Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $86.7 million compared to $50.6 million last year. The operating margin of 21.8% compared to 20.7% a year ago. 
Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $86.9 million compared to $84.6 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $68.9 million compared to $57.6 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $18 million decreased $9 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, resulting from $2.8 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge-offs as well as favorable loan portfolio trends, which support lower expected reserve requirements. 
As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.8% and 1.3% in the second quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the second quarter, the average yield on finance receivables of 17.5% in 2021 compared to 17.6% in 2020. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 8.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. 
As of the end of the current quarter, approximately $8 million of these business operation support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $285.8 million in the second quarter increased $30 million or 11.7% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 17.9% increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were down 11.5%. Last year's contract receivable originations included the aforementioned offering of business operation support loans to qualifying franchisees during the second quarter of 2020. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $13.2 million in the second quarter, primarily due to the higher originations. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.2% for the United States extended credit is up 20 basis points from the rate of 1% in the second quarter of 2020. 
As we commented during our second quarter 2020 earnings call, we estimated in the quarter, the 60-day plus delinquency rate was favorably affected by 20 to 30 basis points as a result of forbearance and deferred payment programs in place during that period last year. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $41.6 million, representing 2.4% of outstandings at quarter end, is down 15 basis points sequentially and down 53 basis points compared to the same period last year. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $238.2 million in the quarter decreased $15.4 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings more than offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including $98.4 million of higher income tax payments. The increase in cash paid for income taxes reflects both higher levels of taxable profitability as well as the IRS no longer allowing companies to defer estimated tax payments as compared to the IRS accommodation offered during the second quarter of 2020. 
Net cash used by investing activities in the $29.7 million included net additions of finance receivables of $18.7 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $147.9 million included cash dividends of $66.7 million and the repurchase of 566,900 shares of common stock for $137.4 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plans of $61.8 million. 
As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $251.6 million of common stock under existing authorizations. 
Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $4.7 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 56 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $14.4 million from 2020 year-end, but on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2020. 
Our quarter end cash position of $965.9 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 10.8% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. At quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there are no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

I'm going to try. First, it means that Snap-on and its markets are resilient. The virus is probably the greatest threat to our society and business, and in many decades, it was a great shock. Miles driven down big dealerships, many furloughed no travelers -- aviation, no travelers, oil and gas and free fall and education, virtually little need for equipment. Nobody is in the classrooms. And yet, we weathered the shock without trauma. 
The credit company stepped in with just the right bridging at just the right places for customers and franchisees and our direct selling vans kept rolling quickly accommodating to the environment. Snap-on kept investing in our products, our brands and our people, and we accommodated and recovered to post 4 straight quarters of above pre-pandemic results. Tracing a V-shaped recovery and emerging from the height of the storm stronger than we entered, resilience against the greatest business threat in memory, but it's more than resilience. More than bounce back. It also demonstrates great flexibility. 
As the world passed through the shock through accommodation to psychological recovery, change was the order of the day Snap-on adjusted, fueled by our fortified advantages and product brand and people we accommodated. The pandemic limited face-to-face interaction. We expanded virtual contact and came away with some long-term social media tools that will enable our franchisees for some time. When technicians focused on shorter payback items, we gave them hand tools and power tools in torque. When repair leaned away from maintenance to complex repairs in the shock, we provided ADAS calibration, tools and intelligent diagnostics and help franchisees expand their selling capacity to manage those more complicated offerings efficiently. 
When some critical industries weakened, we developed offerings for those that maintained. When the virus attenuated the distributors in Europe, we focused on customization and more direct interactions, all of that achievement in the time of change demonstrates Snap-on's flexibility and confirms we can prosper mid-future change going forward, as we've always done by observing work and solving whatever the new problems are. 
Snap-on second quarter. Tools Group, up in all geographies and in all product lines, sales up 17.1% compared with 2019 and OI margins of 21.4%. C&I gains offsetting the challenges of the lingering COVID, rising profitability to 15.8%, up 120 basis points from the pre-pandemic level, even with a 90 basis point impact from unfavorable currency. 
RS&I, sales up 8.5% versus 2019. undercar equipment and OEM projects recovering in an OI of 21.8%, down from the pre-pandemic but still strong, and Snap-on overall, sales up 9.3% organically versus 2019, an OI margin of 20.1% and an EPS of $3.76, up meaningfully versus every comparison. It was an encouraging period again, demonstrating resilience and flexibility, encouraging for the now and we're confident encouraging for the prospects of growth and improvement for the future on through 2021 and well beyond. 
Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Your support is the fundamental element in driving our continuing positive trend for your role in helping our society and our company to navigate the pandemic, you have my admiration.

I do think the technicians are kind of -- have good cash because the business has been going well for quite a long period of time. And they are interested in continually investing in tools. So you see that as a factor. I mean that's certainly a factor in the business. And one of the things we see is that you'll notice that RA is very strong versus EC in this quarter.

But what I'm really referring to here without -- I didn't want to get into it with any remarks because there's a lot to say, and I don't want to. It really what this is, is we used social media before. But in the pandemic we realized the more effective way to use them was to pre-brief customers. In other words, to contact them, first, we started out by saying, okay, we want to stay in touch with our customers via social media or any electronic means that could -- that do it at a distance. But then we realized, boy, it's a powerful tool for making for sales efficiency when you're actually in front of them. 
Because what you can do is contact them on the social media, you have a relationship with them. You can pre-brief them about how a great new -- what the elements of a particular new product is like the 14.4 volt power tool I talked about or the Techwrench I talked about. And you can also pre-brief them on any promotions we might have. And so then when you're actually spending the time in front of the technician, you can spend your time closing the deal. 
This is -- this kind of shrinks the time. And so it takes some of the presell out of the face time and makes it more efficient. That's what we're talking about here. We learned how to do that very well in the pandemic. And that's going to serve us well. And it's part of the ID. Remember, I always said that the pacing element for sales to the Tools Group has been the franchisees' time, well, they're hitting new limits up 17% versus pre-pandemic levels, and it's because we've expanded their capacity."

And so I think they've kind of changed their level, they're starting to recover. And so you're starting to see people -- we saw it in our tool storage numbers, one of the reasons why we took the franchisees, the franchise council to Algona, our Tool Storage plant is everybody's screaming for more tool storage. 
Now one of the effects was that when we entered the COVID, they sold down. They used boxes that they had taken in trade, and so they had a lot of that rolling out. But still, they're looking for boxes now. So I think things have turned. The question is, are the franchisees so flushed with cash that they want to finance some of those boxes. For some of them, sometimes they sell them a locker, which is not quite as expensive as a box and they can afford to finance those kinds of things. 
But I do think when I talk to franchisees, they're telling me that we've kind of turned the corner. They turn the corners probably to -- maybe to binary award for it. We were coming back, though. Things are pretty optimistic in the shops."

You kind of got an interesting interaction. You have people who at first were leaning towards shorter payback items. And maybe that expands to away from hand to past hand tools up into lockers or spiffier tops for the tool storage boxes, which are more fundable by the franchisees over time. franchisees like to build their shorter-term credit, so they like that. And it is true that the technicians do have more cash. I mean they've been working all through the pandemic. And so that's kind of built up on a relative case. It could be eligible for other credit.

The cost of freight are up tremendously. -- yet through pricing and RCI, we shove them aside, and got the 20.

I think you'll see some of them when you see in the Q, but I do think it's a combination of those working very well. 21.4%, I think, might be the highest we've ever seen in the tools group.

As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our third quarter and along the way of I'll give you my perspective on our results, they are encouraging. On our market, they are positive and more than resilient, and I'll speak about our progress. It's been considerable, each period demonstrating increasing strength even when in the midst of silencing headwind. And we'll also speak about what it all means for our future. 
It's incredibly promising. And then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. Our reported sales in the quarter were [ $1.377 ] billion. They were up 10.2%, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency and $19.5 million of acquisition-related sales. 
Organic sales growth was up 7%, with 7%, gains in every group. It was our fifth straight quarter of above pre-pandemic performance and Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, all combined to drive that progress and progress it was. Opco operating income of $201.3 million was up [ $15.6 ] million from last year. The OI margin was 19.4%, down 30 basis points, impacted negatively by acquisitions, but still very strong at a strong level. 
For financial services, operating income of $70.6 million increased 7.6% and the delinquencies were down even below the 2019 pre-pandemic levels, a continued testimony to our unique business model and its ability to navigate the most threatening of environments. First quarter EPS was $2.57, up $0.29 or 8.8% from last year. And as I said before, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering and our third quarter results testifies to just that. 
Compared with 2019, before we ever heard of the virus, our sales -- our sales grew $135.9 million or 15.1%, which includes $21 million from acquisition-related sales, [ $13.6 ] million of favorable foreign currency and $101.3 million -- and a $101.3 million or 11.1% organic gain. And that 2021 Opco operating margin of 19.4% was up 80 basis points from the pre-pandemic levels, even while absorbing the impact from acquisitions and while meeting what we can call a considerable disruption of these days. 
Now let's talk about the markets. Water repair remains quite resilient. The technicians are prospering. They know they weather the depths of the COVID shock, learn to accommodate the virus environment and are well along the psychological recovery. Techs are resilient. They've been at their post for the last 18 months undoing it, and they won't be shots again, and they are optimistic about the future of their profession about the outlook of individual transportation and about the greater need for their skills as the vehicle park changes with new technology. 
Vehicle repair is strong -- is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it in the franchisees voice and you can see it written clearly across our numbers every quarter. Also on auto repair, there are our shop owners and managers different from the tech. That's where our repairs information group, RS&I's trade. Demand for new and used cars is high despite limited supply in dealership prepared maintenance and warranty is rebounding, and dealers are starting to invest again. And we've been able to make -- we've been able to take advantage with groundbreaking products like our award-winning Tru-Point Advanced Driver Assistance calibration system. Our new diagnostic, our new diagnostic TRITON-D10, intelligent diagnostic and our claimed Mitchell 1 ProDemand repair seating guide, all representing new technologies and data deployed to make work easier in the shop. 
Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-on is poised to capitalize. Now let's talk about critical industries where Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tasks of consequence. 
These are commercial industrial or C&I operates. The virus had a much longer impact on these customers. They were slower to accommodate, but they are recovering. And in the quarter, our results showed that trend, gains in North America, Europe and in Asia, all over the globe. So overall, I describe our C&I markets as improving. And coupled with the strength of the auto repair sectors, our markets are beyond resilient, and we're ready and well positioned to make progress along those run rate to recover. 
At the same time -- at the same time, it's clear that we have ongoing potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on value creation processes. They never been more important, helping to counter the turbulence of the day, especially important with customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology, driving new products. And just this quarter, Snap-on was prominently represented with 9 Professional Tool & Equipment News, we call it P10 People's Choice Awards where the actual users, the technicians make the selection. 
We're also recognized with 2 P10 innovation awards, and we're honored with 2 motor magazine Top Tool awards. An essential driver of Snap-on growth is innovative product that makes work easier and the awards, hard [ won ], but our testimony that great Snap-on products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task, becoming more essential to technicians and driving our forward progress. 
That's the environment, pretty positive. Now we'll move to the operating groups. In C&I, volume in the quarter rose 13.9% or $42 million versus 2020 on significant growth across all divisions, reflecting -- reflected a $32.9 million or 10.6% organic uplift and $7.5 million from our AutoCrib acquisition. And double-digit growth in our European hand tool businesses and a high single-digit rise in critical industries led the way. C&I operating income of $52.6 million was up $10.5 million or 24.4%, and the operating margin was 15.3%. 
That's an increase of 130 basis points versus last year. I'd say that's an intention getting rise against the wind. Now compared to the pre-pandemic 2019 results, sales were up 4.8%, including a 0.9% organic gain. And that OI margin of 15.3% was up 90 basis points against the 70-point impact of acquisitions and unfavorable currency. Once again, SNA Europe delivered double-digit growth beyond pre -- double-digit growth beyond pre-virus levels against the complex and varied marketing environment propelled by the customization power of their backlog to management system. And our Industrial division roles in critical industries, recording nice gains in general industry, heavy-duty education and U.S. aviation, a number of positive sectors overcoming weakness and continuing weakness in the military and natural resources. 
P&I is rising, and we're enthusiastic about the possibilities. We'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities and enabling that intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products. 
In the third quarter, did see some great new offerings. Like our [ 14.4-volt ] 3-inch drive brushless reaction, the CTR at 61. It's already popular. And it's no wonder. It's a powerful combination of strength and speed, high torque, 60-foot [indiscernible], the bus loose, very suborn bolts and rapid operations, 275 RPM for getting those fashions off in quick time. made our -- made in our Murphy, North Carolina plant, and it features a full frame brushless motor for longer run time and durability. 
It includes a safety switch that shuts in an [indiscernible] safety switch that shuts down -- shuts down the tool after 2 minutes of continuous use that's eliminating the chance of overheating. It also has a super bright aluminum front-facing light that stays illuminated after the trigger is released, allowing easy and immediate inspection of the work. This ratchet also features a built-in break that stops the tool from throwing or fasteners, which is -- it seems like not much, but it's an important safety feature for technicians. 
And it also offers a great cushion group that makes for more comfortable tool control even during extended use. The [ CDR861 ], power, speed and comfort, It's in a very compact package. It's a mighty mic for accomplishing critical tasks and the professionals love it. Well, that's C&I, continuing upward, exceeding pre-pandemic volumes, strong profitability and positions for more. 
Now on to the Tools Group. Sale of $471.4 million, up $21.8 million, including $4.9 million of favorable currency and a $16.9 million or 3.7% organic gain. Growth in the U.S. -- both in the U.S. and the international operations. And the operating margin was 20.8%, one of our highest effort and up 140 basis points from last year. Compared with the pre-virus 2019 level, the organic gain was $80.4 million or 20.6%. And the 20.8% operating margin was up 700 basis points compared with the pre-pandemic level, 700 basis points in the midst of operating turbulence. Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands and further enabling its franchisees, giving them more selling capacity, it's all working. 
Five strong quarters of above pre-pandemic performance says it's so. Now the third quarter is when we hold our -- most of you know this, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, our SFC. This year, we're back again in person at the Gaylord in Orlando, Florida. Over 9,000 attendees, a record. We have training seminars in sales growth and intelligent diagnostics. They're well attended and well received. And we had several football fields of products. 
So our franchisees could get up close and personal with our latest innovations. For the franchisees, the SFC is an opportunity for learning, for touching and ordering new products and for recharging their Snap-on batteries and believe me, they are charged. For the company, the SFC is an opportunity to gauge the franchisees' outlook on the business. One quantitative way is orders. Well, they were up, strong double digits over last year's virtual live from the Forge event, and from the 2019 SFC live in Washington, D.C. 
And when I say up, I mean all of our product categories showed substantial gains over both of those events. And so that's the quantitative look at it qualitatively, I spoke with many of our franchisees. And I can attest that they were beaming, showing a lot of confidence in our business and declaring considerable optimism on their future days and decades ahead with Snap-on. We do believe our franchisees are continuing to grow stronger each quarter, and we continue to invest in our future. 
And if you were with us in Orlando, you would have seen it unmistakably, and we are investing, building franchisees' ability to use the direct interface with technicians, enabling them to better communicate their unique capability and the unique capability and growing technology of Snap-on product lines. We have great confidence in the power of our products and there are real reasons for the confidence. 
You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that, there's a continuous stream of terrific new offerings. During the SFC, the Tools Group unveiled its new [ KHP415], portable 40-inch substation power card. It's targeted at entry-level technicians. The ones working on a narrow scope of repairs. It's built in our Albona, Iowa factory, and the new part enables young mechanics to invest a step on storage at a value price, while at the same time getting some very attractive professional features, a lockable comp compartment, fourfold distort and adjustable power tool rack that holds up the 10 tools and a power strip with 5 outlets and 2 USB ports for battery and device charging. 
New cart, It was well received. And it's quickly reaching what we call hit-product status. Over $1 million of sales, it's raising upward on a steep trajectory. Beyond products, we spent time working to expand franchisee selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training and RCI and the van operations, and it's working. Selling capacity is up, and you can see it clearly in the 5 straight gangbuster quarters for our van network. 
The Tools Group is on a very positive trend, ascending and leaving pre-pandemic levels way behind. Now on to RS&I. Sales were up 14.8% or $46.9 million, including a $31.7 million or 9.9% organic uplift. Growth was weighted toward undercar equipment. But our diagnostics and information businesses also chipped in with double-digit increases versus 2020. RCI operating earnings were $83.3 million, representing a rise of $3.2 million. 
Comparing with 2019, sales grew $41.7 million or 12.9%, including $24.2 million or 7.4% organic grain, nice growth. The RS&I OI margin was down versus the last 2 years, attenuated by business mix, acquisitions and currency, but it was still a strong 22.9%. So we clearly see the potential of our runway with RS&I, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. Third quarter annual growth was broad-based, but a strong double-digit rise in undercar equipment was an especially welcome turn. That's a nice turnaround, and it was led by innovative products like our 15K [indiscernible] post alignment lift. 
It's really taking a hold in the repair shops as they've resumed investing. This new 15K provides professional grade alignment lifting for a variety of vehicle sizes. With open front columns, best-in-class ultra-wide 26-inch runways and integrated 100-inch show long-wear plates. It's suited to accommodate vehicles from compact passenger cars, compact passenger cars to big pickup trucks. And it's low easy on approach angle makes it great, even for low-profile sports cars that are often a challenge for other lifts. 
Made in our Louisville, Kentucky plant on an Assembly line is made or Louisville that took a plan on assembly line, I'm very familiar with. I participated in an RCI event for that process. Our new 15K has helped drive the recovery for undercar equipment, and it's driven the rise in RS&I volumes. We're quite positive about RSI's possibilities to repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves, it's got a great future. 
So that's the highlights of our quarter. Continued strong progress. Our fifth straight period of exceeding pre-pandemic levels, C&I on track with strong sales and increasing profitability. RS&I, undercar coming back, the Tools Group, strong, pumped and moving vertically the credit company solid in a storm and profitable. The overall corporation, organic sales rising 7%. Opco operating margin, 19.4% and EPS of $3.57 a considerable rise and most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than we entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

The third quarter of 2021 exhibited another period of solid financial performance. The results also compared favorably with the third quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period, in some cases may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. 
Net sales of [ $1.0377 ] billion in the quarter increased 10.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain, $19.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 15.1% from $901.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, including an 11.1% organic gain, $21.0 million of acquisition-related sales and $13.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. 
Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 30 basis points from 49.9% last year. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes, 60 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives more than offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.8% increased 60 basis points from 30.2% last year, primarily due to 60 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Benefits from the higher sales volumes were offset by increased brand building, travel and other costs, including the restoration of our annual in-person Snap-on Franchisee Conference. 
Operating earnings before financial services of $201.3 million compared to $185.7 million in 2020 and $167.7 million in 2019, reflecting an 8.4% and a 20% improvement, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.4% compared to 19.7% last year and 18.6% in 2019. Financial services revenue of $87.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $85.8 million last year, while operating earnings of $70.6 million increased $5 million from 2020 levels, reflecting the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses. 
Consolidated operating earnings of $271.9 million increased 8.2% from $251.3 million last year and 18.9% from $228.7 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.2% compared to 24.5% in 2020 and 23.2% in 2019. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 23.7% compared to 23.4% last year. Net earnings of $196.2 million or $3.57 per diluted share increased $16.5 million or $0.29 per share from last year's levels, representing an 8.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
As compared to the third quarter of 2019, net earnings increased to $31.6 million or $0.61 per share, representing a 20.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. 
Starting with the C&I group on Slide 11. Sales of $351.4 million increased 13.9% from $308.4 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain, $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain reflects higher activity in all of the segment's operations and includes high single-digit increases in sales to customers in critical industries. 
Within the critical industries, year-over-year sales gains were achieved in general industry, heavy-duty and technical education but were partially offset by declines in sales to the military and international aviation, both of which had particularly robust sales in the prior year period. 
As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 4.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a $3 million organic sales gain, $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. As compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up mid-teens. With respect to critical industry sales activity in that period, our lower sales to the military international aerospace and Natural Resources segments offset gains in our sales to technical education, heavy-duty and general industry customers. 
Gross margin of 38.2% improved 90 basis points from 37.3% in the third quarter of 2020. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives were partially offset by higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% improved 40 basis points as compared to last year, primarily due to the improved volumes, which were partially offset by higher travel and other costs. 
Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $53.6 million compared to $43.1 million last year. The operating margin of 15.3% compared to 14% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales of Snap-on Tools Group of $471.4 million increased 4.8% from $449.8 million in 2020, reflecting a 3.7% organic sales gain and $4.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit gain in our international operations. 
Net sales in the period increased 22.4% from $385.2 million in the third quarter of 2019, reflecting a 20.6% organic sales gain and $5.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 45.8% in the quarter improved 30 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and 130 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects, which offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25% improved from 26.1% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales. 
Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $98.2 million compared to $87.1 million last year. The operating margin of 20.8% compared to 19.4% a year ago, an improvement of 140 basis points. 
Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $364.4 million compared to $317.5 million a year ago, reflecting a 9.9% organic sales gain, $12 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. 
The organic increase reflects double-digit increases in sales of undercar equipment and in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. While activity focused on OEM dealerships was essentially flat. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $41.7 million from $322.7 million, reflecting a 7.4% organic sales gain, [ $13.5 ] million of acquisition-related sales and $4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 46.8% declined from 47.3% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses, increased material and other costs and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
These declines were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives and 60 basis points of benefits from acquisitions. As a reminder, undercar equipment, which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically has a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment's average. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.9% increased 180 basis points from 22.1% last year, primarily due to 170 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. 
Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $83.3 million compared to $80.1 million last year. The operating margin of 22.9% compared to 25.2% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $87.3 million compared to $85.8 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $70.6 million compared to $65.6 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $16.7 million decreased $3.5 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. 
As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were [ 0.8% ] and [ 0.9% ] in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the third quarters of both 2021 and 2020, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.8%. The respective average yield on contract receivables were 8.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Total loan originations of $269.3 million in the third quarter increased $16.5 million or 6.5% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and a 9.5% increase in originations of contract receivables. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $7.5 million in the third quarter. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.5% in the third quarter of 2020 and 1.7% in the third quarter of 2019. 
On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points, reflecting the typical seasonal increase of 20 to 30 basis points we experienced between the second and third quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $42.7 million represented 2.48% of outstandings at quarter end, down 22 basis points as compared to the same period last year. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $186.4 million in the quarter reflects 92.5% of net earnings. While this represents a decrease of $37.6 million from 2020 levels, this cash conversion rate compares favorably with 77.5% of net earnings in both the third quarters of 2019 and 2018. The decrease from the third quarter of 2020, primarily reflects the higher net earnings being more than offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $61.9 million increase in working capital. This change in working capital is largely driven by the more typical seasonal inventory build in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the reduction of inventory experienced in the period last year. 
Inventory additions also reflect some increases in buffer stocks and higher levels of in-transit inventories associated with the supply chain dynamics being seen in the macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $29.7 million included net additions of finance receivables of $7.6 million and $16.2 million of capital expenditures. 
Net cash used by financing activities of $385.8 million included $250 million in senior note repayments, cash dividends of $66.3 million and the repurchase of 300,000 shares of common stock for $66.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional [ $197 ] million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $12.5 million from 2020 year-end. 
Days sales outstanding of 56 days compared to 64 days of 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $43.1 million from 2020 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2020. Our quarter end cash position of $735.5 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 10.3% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. 
In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for the balance of 2021. We now forecast that capital expenditures will approximate $90 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

The Snap-on third quarter can be summarized in one word, momentum. Our markets are showing extraordinary possibilities, almost across the board with order repair the most advanced going beyond resilience. We sold the COVID-19 playing out with our customers in 3 phases, shock, interruption in the face of virus uncertainty. A combination of gradual learning to pursue essential work while staying safe and psychological recovery, our confidence in the future and return to normal buying. 
But now, we're seeing a fourth phase, exhilaration of certainty that we're -- that we're moving sharply to higher levels, ignited by the conviction that we have met and manage the virus and they want -- and that we won't get shocked again. It's a bright outlook. 
And Snap-on with continuing investment in product and brand and people is well positioned to serve that trend. Of course, the COVID is still lingering, and its side effects, inflation and supply disruption around the loose, but Snap-on is strongly arrayed to engage those challenges. A direct selling model and strong brand position enables agile pricing. 
Our vertical integration and shorter supply chains make us less vulnerable to sourcing viscosities. Our broad product line, more than 80,000 SKUs supports flex -- flexible marketing to guide around shortages, and our RCI culture drives cost offsets. We found opportunities on our runway for growth and improvement even amidst these challenging times, and you can see it in the numbers, encouraging. C&I sales up from -- both from last year and 2019, OI margin, 15.3% strong and rising 130 basis points and 90 basis points versus 2020 and 2019, respectively. RS&I, up organically, 9.9% versus last year and 7.4% beyond the pre-pandemic levels. 
OI margins of 22.9%. And the Tools Group, organic volume rising 3.7% versus last year's record level and up 20.6% versus the day before the virus. OI margin, it was 20.8%, up 140 basis points from last year and up 700 basis points from 2019. It all led to our corporation being organically up 7% compared with last year and a strong 11.1% versus pre-pandemic numbers. Overall, OI margin was 19.4%, solid in the face of turbulence in our credit company, navigating then certainly without disruptions. 
Profit is up, delinquencies down. And EPS, $3.57, rising emphatically versus all comparisons. We have emerged from the virus stronger than when we entered, and the numbers confirm it. We've now recorded 5, 5 straight quarters of above pre-pandemic performances, and we believe that with our markets reaching beyond resilience to exhiliration, with the capabilities of our model to overcome the challenges of the environment, and with a considerable advantage nurtured by our continuing investment in product, brand and and people will continue to rise, maintaining our upward trajectory through the end of this year and well beyond. 
Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I always know you're listening. This is a period of great momentum for Snap-on. You are the fuel that is ignited and fan that drive forward and upward. For your success in creating this encouraging performance, you have my congratulations.

I mean, every day, there's something new, but I think we're -- what I was trying to say was, Lucas, we do take steps and our model enables those stacks to be particularly efficacious. 
The vertical integration means that we don't buy that much. Most of the stuff is in our house. If you think about a hand tool, raw steel comes in the back of the factory. And basically, we add very little when it comes out to you're worried about steel. We buy the steel in the U.S., short of supply chain. We buy some of our chips in the U.S. and closer place. That's not bad. -- circuit boards, those kinds of things, so we have those things as well as one of the advantages we have, Luke, and we do this, we're very aggressive in spot buying. 
So we go out and spot buy because we don't buy large quantities of any one thing. If you're an auto manufacturer, I used to be in Ford. You're buying something for the new Mustang or for the Ford Focus or whatever it is, you're buying a lot of stuff and it's hard to -- once that supply chain gets disrupted because the Shanghai port closes because of a couple of cases, you kind of have trouble to move and get any alternative. Well, if you're only buying a little bit, you go out, you find them in the intercity of the system, and we have our guys actively doing that. 
That's why we're not seeing so much in terms of shortage. It may be still a little cost increase, but then we're agile pricing. So we don't have such a big problem in that regard. I'm not saying we're not actively working because, boy, our people are putting a lot of energy into it, but if you look at the numbers, pretty well managed."

I think that's a broad statement that applies to many industries, I think you hear that out of the big banks. I mean customers are better servicing their debt than they were before. I think they have more discretionary power and spending. And so far, they've been applying it to their indebtedness. 
And I think we see the same trends. It's our job to capture that incremental savings that they might be seeing if they're not borrowing as much as before in capturing business with tool sales. And I think you see that. So the Snap-on tool sales being up more than originations, I think, as I applaud the Tools Group by being able to entice customers to buy more stuff because they have more money. 
From what you read from the Bureau Labor statistics, technician wages is doing pretty darn good. So they seem to be strong. They seem to have more flexibility in what they choose to buy, and they seem to like to buy our products. So again, they're in a better position, I think, than they were a year or so ago. And of course, every quarter brings potential new changes. But right now, it's been running very favorable. And as a result of that, our going forward provision rates are lower than they might have been a year or 2 years ago. It's going back pre-pandemic, simply because of the debt servicing trends."

And this is starting to dawn,I don't know, dawn on is the wrong word, but starting to be reinforced in their mind about that. And then I think they're feeling, what I would say is a general optimism that comes out of having felt like they've engaged and managed the COVID. 
Garages have been working for the whole time. So while the news, when you can see the news and everybody is appropriately worrying about Delta and all these things, people are -- it's not that they're not keeping themselves safe, but they're saying, ""Hey, we can deal with this. We're not getting shocked again. Whatever happens, we're not going to be interrupted. We're going to keep going. Our upward trajectory is happening. In a crazy way, I suppose some of this is sort of -- you can see the sort of prosperity that came out in the 20s after the flu the last time. 
I can feel that in the garages. I feel it in a lot of different places. But you're certainly feeling the grading you feel were franchisees, and that's translating back to them. And then finally, I think our franchisees in particular, are recognizing that our products are more effective than ever. They have great faith in those products. And they're feeling I was with the national franchisees. So national -- NFC, National Franchisee Advisory Council, 12 guys from all over the country. And they're feeling the -- the things they're doing in terms of social media in terms of RCI and the van in terms of the better training are given more selling time. 
So you'll get on a van like I was just on a van in California. So Cowan this guy says, ""Yes, I now find out if I follow the program, I can reach more technicians. He is talking about reaching more technicians than it could before. Those are the things that are making the difference."

I -- what I -- what we view is, I think, for sure, is that the customers themselves have unused credit or untapped credit capacity. So that will come up. 
We haven't really seen -- there was a rotation at the beginning of the virus period toward RA. But this quarter, I'd say it's kind of stayed solid.

July was like a wasteland. And so then things would come roaring back when you got the SFC, people would be keeping their powder dry pretty much.

I think this quarter, of course, is above. So each quarter, it's kind of an upwards versus its prior numbers.

But generally, as you grow, we have working capital, then we look at acquisitions, we believe we have runways for growth, particularly in repressowners and managers and the garages or in maybe in C&I in some places. And we've done some of that at DealerX is an example. 
We have a dividend that we've paid a dividend every quarter since 1939. We've never reduced it. So we take a look at our dividend with the intent of perpetuity and whether we should increase it or not, and we look at that carefully. And then we are agile about share purchases. So you have kind of a 4-way look at that, and they're all -- they're all a draw on what we might do with cash depending on the situation."

As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our third quarter and along the way of I'll give you my perspective on our results, they are encouraging. On our market, they are positive and more than resilient, and I'll speak about our progress. It's been considerable, each period demonstrating increasing strength even when in the midst of silencing headwind. And we'll also speak about what it all means for our future. 
It's incredibly promising. And then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. Our reported sales in the quarter were [ $1,037.7 ] million. They were up 10.2%, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency and $19.5 million of acquisition-related sales. 
Organic sales growth was up 7%, with 7%, gains in every group. It was our fifth straight quarter of above pre-pandemic performance and Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, all combined to drive that progress and progress it was. opco operating income of $201.3 million was up [ $15.6 ] million from last year. The OI margin was 19.4%, down 30 basis points, impacted negatively by acquisitions, but still very strong at a strong level. 
For financial services, operating income of $70.6 million increased 7.6% and the delinquencies were down even below the 2019 pre-pandemic levels, a continued testimony to our unique business model and its ability to navigate the most threatening of environments. First quarter EPS was $3.57, up $0.29 or 8.8% from last year. And as I said before, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering and our third quarter results testifies to just that. 
Compared with 2019, before we ever heard of the virus, our sales -- our sales grew $135.9 million or 15.1%, which includes $21 million from acquisition-related sales, [ $13.6 ] million of favorable foreign currency and $101.3 million -- and a $101.3 million or 11.1% organic gain. And that 2021 opco operating margin of 19.4% was up 80 basis points from the pre-pandemic levels, even while absorbing the impact from acquisitions and while meeting what we can call a considerable disruption of these days. 
Now let's talk about the markets. Water repair remains quite resilient. The technicians are prospering. They know they weather the depths of the COVID shock, learn to accommodate the virus environment and are well along the psychological recovery. Techs are resilient. They've been at their post for the last 18 months undoing it, and they won't be shots again, and they are optimistic about the future of their profession about the outlook of individual transportation and about the greater need for their skills as the vehicle park changes with new technology. 
Vehicle repair is strong -- is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it in the franchisees voice and you can see it written clearly across our numbers every quarter. Also on auto repair, there are our shop owners and managers different from the tech. That's where our repairs information group, RS&I's trade. Demand for new and used cars is high despite limited supply in dealership prepared maintenance and warranty is rebounding, and dealers are starting to invest again. And we've been able to make -- we've been able to take advantage with groundbreaking products like our award-winning Tru-Point Advanced Driver Assistance calibration system. Our new diagnostic, our new diagnostic TRITON-D10, intelligent diagnostic and our claimed Mitchell 1 ProDemand repair estimating guide, all representing new technologies and data deployed to make work easier in the shop. 
Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-on is poised to capitalize. Now let's talk about critical industries where Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tasks of consequence. 
These are commercial industrial or C&I operates. The virus had a much longer impact on these customers. They were slower to accommodate, but they are recovering. And in the quarter, our results showed that trend, gains in North America, Europe and in Asia, all over the globe. So overall, I describe our C&I markets as improving. And coupled with the strength of the auto repair sectors, our markets are beyond resilient, and we're ready and well positioned to make progress along those run rate to recover. 
At the same time -- at the same time, it's clear that we have ongoing potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on value creation processes. They never been more important, helping to counter the turbulence of the day, especially important with customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology, driving new products. And just this quarter, Snap-on was prominently represented with 9 Professional Tool & Equipment News, we call it P10 People's Choice Awards where the actual users, the technicians make the selection. 
We're also recognized with 2 P10 innovation awards, and we're honored with 2 motor magazine Top Tool awards. An essential driver of Snap-on growth is innovative product that makes work easier and the awards, [indiscernible], our testimony that great Snap-on products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task, becoming more essential to technicians and driving our forward progress. 
That's the environment, pretty positive. Now we'll move to the operating groups. In C&I, volume in the quarter rose 13.9% or $42 million versus 2020 on significant growth across all divisions, reflecting -- reflected a $32.9 million or 10.6% organic uplift and $7.5 million from our AutoCrib acquisition. And double-digit growth in our European hand tool businesses and a high single-digit rise in critical industries led the way. C&I operating income of $53.6 million was up $10.5 million or 24.4%, and the operating margin was 15.3%. 
That's an increase of 130 basis points versus last year. I'd say that's an intention getting rise against the wind. Now compared to the pre-pandemic 2019 results, sales were up 4.8%, including a 0.9% organic gain. And that OI margin of 15.3% was up 90 basis points against the 70-point impact of acquisitions and unfavorable currency. Once again, SNA Europe delivered double-digit growth beyond pre -- double-digit growth beyond pre-virus levels against the complex and varied marketing environment propelled by the customization power of their [indiscernible] to management system. And our Industrial division roles in critical industries, recording nice gains in general industry, heavy-duty education and U.S. aviation, a number of positive sectors overcoming weakness and continuing weakness in the military and natural resources. 
P&I is rising, and we're enthusiastic about the possibilities. We'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities and enabling that intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products. 
In the third quarter, did see some great new offerings. Like our [ 14.4-volt ] 3h-inch drive brushless reaction, the CTR at 61. It's already popular. And it's no wonder. It's a powerful combination of strength and speed, high torque, 60-foot [indiscernible], the bus loose, very suborn bolts and rapid operations, 275 RPM for getting those fashions off in quick time. made our -- made in our Murphy, North Carolina plant, and it features a full frame brushless motor for longer run time and durability. 
It includes a safety switch that shuts in an [indiscernible] safety switch that shuts down -- shuts down the tool after 2 minutes of continuous use that's eliminating the chance of overheating. It also has a super bright aluminum front-facing light that stays illuminated after the trigger is released, allowing easy and immediate inspection of the work. This ratchet also features a built-in break that stops the tool from throwing or fasteners, which is -- it seems like not much, but it's an important safety feature for technicians. 
And it also offers a great cushion group that makes for more comfortable tool control even during extended use. The [ CGR861 ], power, speed and comfort, It's in a very compact package. It's a mighty mic for accomplishing critical tasks and the professionals love it. Well, that's C&I, continuing upward, exceeding pre-pandemic volumes, strong profitability and positions for more. 
Now on to the Tools Group. Sale of $471.4 million, up $21.8 million, including $4.9 million of favorable currency and a $16.9 million or 3.7% organic gain. Growth in the U.S. -- both in the U.S. and the international operations. And the operating margin was 20.8%, one of our highest effort and up 140 basis points from last year. Compared with the pre-virus 2019 level, the organic gain was $80.4 million or 20.6%. And the 20.8% operating margin was up 700 basis points compared with the pre-pandemic level, 700 basis points in the midst of operating turbulence. Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands and further enabling its franchisees, giving them more selling capacity, it's all working. 
Five strong quarters of above pre-pandemic performance says it's so. Now the third quarter is when we hold our -- most of you know this, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, our SFC. This year, we're back again in person at the Gaylord in Orlando, Florida. Over 9,000 attendees, a record. We have training seminars in sales growth and intelligent diagnostics. They're well attended and well received. And we had several football fields of products. 
So our franchisees could get up close and personal with our latest innovations. For the franchisees, the SFC is an opportunity for learning, for touching and ordering new products and for recharging their Snap-on batteries and believe me, they are charged. For the company, the SFC is an opportunity to gauge the franchisees' outlook on the business. One quantitative way is orders. Well, they were up, strong double digits over last year's virtual live from the Forge event, and from the 2019 SFC live in Washington, D.C. 
And when I say up, I mean all of our product categories showed substantial gains over both of those events. And so that's the quantitative look at it qualitatively, I spoke with many of our franchisees. And I can attest that they were beaming, showing a lot of confidence in our business and declaring considerable optimism on their future days and decades ahead with Snap-on. We do believe our franchisees are continuing to grow stronger each quarter, and we continue to invest in our future. 
And if you were with us in Orlando, you would have seen it unmistakably, and we are investing, building franchisees' ability to use the direct interface with technicians, enabling them to better communicate their unique capability and the unique capability and growing technology of Snap-on product lines. We have great confidence in the power of our products and there are real reasons for the confidence. 
You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that, there's a continuous stream of terrific new offerings. During the SFC, the Tools Group unveiled its new [ KHP415], portable 40-inch substation power card. It's targeted at entry-level technicians. The ones working on a narrow scope of repairs. It's built in our Algona, Iowa factory, and the new part enables young mechanics to invest a step on storage at a value price, while at the same time getting some very attractive professional features, a lockable comp compartment, fourfold distort and adjustable power tool rack that holds up the 10 tools and a power strip with 5 outlets and 2 USB ports for battery and device charging. 
New cart, It was well received. And it's quickly reaching what we call hit-product status. Over $1 million of sales, it's raising upward on a steep trajectory. Beyond products, we spent time working to expand franchisee selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training and RCI and the van operations, and it's working. Selling capacity is up, and you can see it clearly in the 5 straight gangbuster quarters for our van network. 
The Tools Group is on a very positive trend, ascending and leaving pre-pandemic levels way behind. Now on to RS&I. Sales were up 14.8% or $46.9 million, including a $31.7 million or 9.9% organic uplift. Growth was weighted toward undercar equipment. But our diagnostics and information businesses also chipped in with double-digit increases versus 2020. RCI operating earnings were $83.3 million, representing a rise of $3.2 million. 
Comparing with 2019, sales grew $41.7 million or 12.9%, including $24.2 million or 7.4% organic gain, nice growth. The RS&I OI margin was down versus the last 2 years, attenuated by business mix, acquisitions and currency, but it was still a strong 22.9%. So we clearly see the potential of our runway with RS&I, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. Third quarter annual growth was broad-based, but a strong double-digit rise in undercar equipment was an especially welcome turn. That's a nice turnaround, and it was led by innovative products like our 15K [indiscernible] post alignment lift. 
It's really taking a hold in the repair shops as they've resumed investing. This new 15K provides professional grade alignment lifting for a variety of vehicle sizes. With open front columns, best-in-class ultra-wide 26-inch runways and integrated 100-inch show long-wear plates. It's suited to accommodate vehicles from compact passenger cars, compact passenger cars to big pickup trucks. And it's low easy on approach angle makes it great, even for low-profile sports cars that are often a challenge for other lifts. 
Made in our Louisville, Kentucky plant on an Assembly line is made or Louisville that took a plan on assembly line, I'm very familiar with. I participated in an RCI event for that process. Our new 15K has helped drive the recovery for undercar equipment, and it's driven the rise in RS&I volumes. We're quite positive about RSI's possibilities to repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves, it's got a great future. 
So that's the highlights of our quarter. Continued strong progress. Our fifth straight period exceeding pre-pandemic levels, C&I on track with strong sales and increasing profitability. RS&I, undercar coming back, the Tools Group, strong, pumped and moving vertically the credit company solid in a storm and profitable. The overall corporation, organic sales rising 7%. opco operating margin, 19.4% and EPS of $3.57 a considerable rise and most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than we entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"

The third quarter of 2021 exhibited another period of solid financial performance. The results also compared favorably with the third quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period, in some cases may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. 
Net sales of [ $1,037.7 ] million in the quarter increased 10.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain, $19.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 15.1% from $901.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, including an 11.1% organic gain, $21.0 million of acquisition-related sales and $13.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. 
Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 30 basis points from 49.9% last year. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes, 60 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives more than offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.8% increased 60 basis points from 30.2% last year, primarily due to 60 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Benefits from the higher sales volumes were offset by increased brand building, travel and other costs, including the restoration of our annual in-person Snap-on Franchisee Conference. 
Operating earnings before financial services of $201.3 million compared to $185.7 million in 2020 and $167.7 million in 2019, reflecting an 8.4% and a 20% improvement, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.4% compared to 19.7% last year and 18.6% in 2019. Financial services revenue of $87.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $85.8 million last year, while operating earnings of $70.6 million increased $5 million from 2020 levels, reflecting the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses. 
Consolidated operating earnings of $271.9 million increased 8.2% from $251.3 million last year and 18.9% from $228.7 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.2% compared to 24.5% in 2020 and 23.2% in 2019. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 23.7% compared to 23.4% last year. Net earnings of $196.2 million or $3.57 per diluted share increased $16.5 million or $0.29 per share from last year's levels, representing an 8.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
As compared to the third quarter of 2019, net earnings increased to $31.6 million or $0.61 per share, representing a 20.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. 
Starting with the C&I group on Slide 11. Sales of $351.4 million increased 13.9% from $308.4 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain, $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain reflects higher activity in all of the segment's operations and includes high single-digit increases in sales to customers in critical industries. 
Within the critical industries, year-over-year sales gains were achieved in general industry, heavy-duty and technical education but were partially offset by declines in sales to the military and international aviation, both of which had particularly robust sales in the prior year period. 
As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 4.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a $3 million organic sales gain, $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. As compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up mid-teens. With respect to critical industry sales activity in that period, our lower sales to the military international aerospace and Natural Resources segments offset gains in our sales to technical education, heavy-duty and general industry customers. 
Gross margin of 38.2% improved 90 basis points from 37.3% in the third quarter of 2020. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives were partially offset by higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% improved 40 basis points as compared to last year, primarily due to the improved volumes, which were partially offset by higher travel and other costs. 
Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $53.6 million compared to $43.1 million last year. The operating margin of 15.3% compared to 14% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales of Snap-on Tools Group of $471.4 million increased 4.8% from $449.8 million in 2020, reflecting a 3.7% organic sales gain and $4.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit gain in our international operations. 
Net sales in the period increased 22.4% from $385.2 million in the third quarter of 2019, reflecting a 20.6% organic sales gain and $5.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 45.8% in the quarter improved 30 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and 130 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects, which offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25% improved from 26.1% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales. 
Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $98.2 million compared to $87.1 million last year. The operating margin of 20.8% compared to 19.4% a year ago, an improvement of 140 basis points. 
Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $364.4 million compared to $317.5 million a year ago, reflecting a 9.9% organic sales gain, $12 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. 
The organic increase reflects double-digit increases in sales of undercar equipment and in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. While activity focused on OEM dealerships was essentially flat. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $41.7 million from $322.7 million, reflecting a 7.4% organic sales gain, [ $13.5 ] million of acquisition-related sales and $4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 46.8% declined from 47.3% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses, increased material and other costs and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. 
These declines were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives and 60 basis points of benefits from acquisitions. As a reminder, undercar equipment, which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically has a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment's average. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.9% increased 180 basis points from 22.1% last year, primarily due to 170 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. 
Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $83.3 million compared to $80.1 million last year. The operating margin of 22.9% compared to 25.2% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $87.3 million compared to $85.8 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $70.6 million compared to $65.6 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $16.7 million decreased $3.5 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. 
As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were [ 0.8% ] and [ 0.9% ] in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the third quarters of both 2021 and 2020, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.8%. The respective average yield on contract receivables were 8.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Total loan originations of $269.3 million in the third quarter increased $16.5 million or 6.5% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and a 9.5% increase in originations of contract receivables. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $7.5 million in the third quarter. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.5% in the third quarter of 2020 and 1.7% in the third quarter of 2019. 
On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points, reflecting the typical seasonal increase of 20 to 30 basis points we experienced between the second and third quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $42.7 million represented 2.48% of outstanding at quarter end, down 22 basis points as compared to the same period last year. 
Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $186.4 million in the quarter reflects 92.5% of net earnings. While this represents a decrease of $37.6 million from 2020 levels, this cash conversion rate compares favorably with 77.5% of net earnings in both the third quarters of 2019 and 2018. The decrease from the third quarter of 2020, primarily reflects the higher net earnings being more than offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $61.9 million increase in working capital. This change in working capital is largely driven by the more typical seasonal inventory build in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the reduction of inventory experienced in the period last year. 
Inventory additions also reflect some increases in buffer stocks and higher levels of in-transit inventories associated with the supply chain dynamics being seen in the macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $29.7 million included net additions of finance receivables of $7.6 million and $16.2 million of capital expenditures. 
Net cash used by financing activities of $385.8 million included $250 million in senior note repayments, cash dividends of $66.3 million and the repurchase of 300,000 shares of common stock for $66.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional [ $197 ] million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $12.5 million from 2020 year-end. 
Days sales outstanding of 56 days compared to 64 days of 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $43.1 million from 2020 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2020. Our quarter end cash position of $735.5 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 10.3% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. 
In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for the balance of 2021. We now forecast that capital expenditures will approximate $90 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"

The Snap-on third quarter can be summarized in one word, momentum. Our markets are showing extraordinary possibilities, almost across the board with order repair the most advanced going beyond resilience. We sold the COVID-19 playing out with our customers in 3 phases, shock, interruption in the face of virus uncertainty. A combination of gradual learning to pursue essential work while staying safe and psychological recovery, our confidence in the future and return to normal buying. 
But now, we're seeing a fourth phase, exhilaration of certainty that we're -- that we're moving sharply to higher levels, ignited by the conviction that we have met and manage the virus and they want -- and that we won't get shocked again. It's a bright outlook. 
And Snap-on with continuing investment in product and brand and people is well positioned to serve that trend. Of course, the COVID is still lingering, and its side effects, inflation and supply disruption around the loose, but Snap-on is strongly arrayed to engage those challenges. A direct selling model and strong brand position enables agile pricing. 
Our vertical integration and shorter supply chains make us less vulnerable to sourcing viscosities. Our broad product line, more than 80,000 SKUs supports flex -- flexible marketing to guide around shortages, and our RCI culture drives cost offsets. We found opportunities on our runway for growth and improvement even amidst these challenging times, and you can see it in the numbers, encouraging. C&I sales up from -- both from last year and 2019, OI margin, 15.3% strong and rising 130 basis points and 90 basis points versus 2020 and 2019, respectively. RS&I, up organically, 9.9% versus last year and 7.4% beyond the pre-pandemic levels. 
OI margins of 22.9%. And the Tools Group, organic volume rising 3.7% versus last year's record level and up 20.6% versus the day before the virus. OI margin, it was 20.8%, up 140 basis points from last year and up 700 basis points from 2019. It all led to our corporation being organically up 7% compared with last year and a strong 11.1% versus pre-pandemic numbers. Overall, OI margin was 19.4%, solid in the face of turbulence in our credit company, navigating then certainly without disruptions. 
Profit is up, delinquencies down. And EPS, $3.57, rising emphatically versus all comparisons. We have emerged from the virus stronger than when we entered, and the numbers confirm it. We've now recorded 5, 5 straight quarters of above pre-pandemic performances, and we believe that with our markets reaching beyond resilience to exhiliration, with the capabilities of our model to overcome the challenges of the environment, and with a considerable advantage nurtured by our continuing investment in product, brand and people will continue to rise, maintaining our upward trajectory through the end of this year and well beyond. 
Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I always know you're listening. This is a period of great momentum for Snap-on.

I mean, every day, there's something new, but I think we're -- what I was trying to say was, Lucas, we do take steps and our model enables those stacks to be particularly efficacious. 
The vertical integration means that we don't buy that much. Most of the stuff is in our house. If you think about a hand tool, raw steel comes in the back of the factory. And basically, we add very little when it comes out to you're worried about steel. We buy the steel in the U.S., short of supply chain. We buy some of our chips in the U.S. and closer place. That's not bad. -- circuit boards, those kinds of things, so we have those things as well as one of the advantages we have, Luke, and we do this, we're very aggressive in spot buying. 
So we go out and spot buy because we don't buy large quantities of any one thing. If you're an auto manufacturer, I used to be in Ford. You're buying something for the new Mustang or for the Ford Focus or whatever it is, you're buying a lot of stuff and it's hard to -- once that supply chain gets disrupted because the Shanghai port closes because of a couple of cases, you kind of have trouble to move and get any alternative. Well, if you're only buying a little bit, you go out, you find them in the intercity of the system, and we have our guys actively doing that. 
That's why we're not seeing so much in terms of shortage. It may be still a little cost increase, but then we're agile pricing. So we don't have such a big problem in that regard. I'm not saying we're not actively working because, boy, our people are putting a lot of energy into it, but if you look at the numbers, pretty well managed."

I think that's a broad statement that applies to many industries, I think you hear that out of the big banks. I mean customers are better servicing their debt than they were before. I think they have more discretionary power and spending. And so far, they've been applying it to their indebtedness. 
And I think we see the same trends. It's our job to capture that incremental savings that they might be seeing if they're not borrowing as much as before in capturing business with tool sales. And I think you see that. So the Snap-on tool sales being up more than originations, I think, as I applaud the Tools Group by being able to entice customers to buy more stuff because they have more money. 
From what you read from the Bureau Labor statistics, technician wages is doing pretty darn good. So they seem to be strong. They seem to have more flexibility in what they choose to buy, and they seem to like to buy our products. So again, they're in a better position, I think, than they were a year or so ago. And of course, every quarter brings potential new changes. But right now, it's been running very favorable. And as a result of that, our going forward provision rates are lower than they might have been a year or 2 years ago. It's going back pre-pandemic, simply because of the debt servicing trends."

In a crazy way, I suppose some of this is sort of -- you can see the sort of prosperity that came out in the 20s after the flu the last time. 
I can feel that in the garages. I feel it in a lot of different places. But you're certainly feeling the grading you feel were franchisees, and that's translating back to them. And then finally, I think our franchisees in particular, are recognizing that our products are more effective than ever. They have great faith in those products. And they're feeling I was with the national franchisees. So national -- NFAC, National Franchisee Advisory Council, 12 guys from all over the country. And they're feeling the -- the things they're doing in terms of social media in terms of RCI and the van in terms of the better training are given more selling time. 
So you'll get on a van like I was just on a van in California. So [indiscernible] this guy says, ""Yes, I now find out if I follow the program, I can reach more technicians. He is talking about reaching more technicians than it could before. Those are the things that are making the difference."

I -- what I -- what we view is, I think, for sure, is that the customers themselves have unused credit or untapped credit capacity. So that will come up. 
We haven't really seen -- there was a rotation at the beginning of the virus period toward RA. But this quarter, I'd say it's kind of stayed solid.

July was like a wasteland. And so then things would come roaring back when you got the SFC, people would be keeping their powder dry pretty much.

You know what I mean, this is a working capital-intense company. So when we grow, we tend to -- the COVID kind of changed -- not changed, but obscured that dynamic somewhat. But generally, as you grow, we have working capital, then we look at acquisitions, we believe we have runways for growth, particularly in [indiscernible]  managers and the garages or in maybe in C&I in some places.
